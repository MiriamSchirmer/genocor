P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is now in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  We are very sorry for this delay, which was totally involuntary.  We will begin with housekeeping matters. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, you were to give us some information regarding the witness who was here yesterday. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honour.  The witness is here with us this morning.  He's in the waiting room.  I haven't been able to speak with him directly.  The guidelines that WVSS uses prevent me from speaking with the witness.  They did not want me to be in the same room with the witness.  But I managed to get some information from Jacqueline Crawford, who works with WVSS.  I think we can proceed.  

When the witness takes the witness box, I would like to explain to him, however, that I'm only going to ask one or two questions and then we can go directly into cross-examination. 

I did notice that the witness was holding his head earlier this morning -- he was in the courtroom briefly -- and he did look rather perplexed and uncomfortable, so it may pose a problem later on.  But I think we should proceed and just see how things develop. 

In any case, Witness RO will be available this afternoon, so I would expect that we can do the morning session with  and then see Witness RO in the afternoon.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, for that information. 

Counsel O'Shea, with regard to Witness RO? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, Madam.  Just to set out a little bit of background, we've made several trips to Rwanda to make investigations into the Butare university hospital, which is the area which RO, I think, is going to be dealing with.  We have experienced some obstructions in our investigations in that area.  We had a situation in our last visit where, for the first time, the administration of the hospital allowed us limited access to the hospital and Defence witnesses in the hospital.  Just to give you a taste of the situation, we saw one witness.  Halfway through the interview with a second witness, that person was ordered to leave the room by the hospital administration.  I'm just giving you a small picture of the kind of difficulties that we've been experiencing in relation to Butare university hospital. 

We have very recently obtained information which is quite significant in relation to this witness.  Mr. Hooper, who will be responsible for the cross-examination of this witness, needs a little time to digest this information and build it into his cross-examination.  Obviously, if RO is being examined in chief, Mr. Hooper must be here.  Our position is that we may be ready for this afternoon, and we will try our best to be ready for this afternoon.  However, yesterday, when Mr. Webster came to his feet at six o'clock, at that point, we were not anticipating at all a situation where RO would be called today, as you will understand.  We, of course, want to facilitate that these proceedings go ahead speedily, but Mr. Webster did not clarify exactly what the difficulties were with this other witness that he is saying he has difficulties with calling.  

In my submission, if the Prosecution has a situation which is beyond their control with regard to the calling of a witness, that is one thing.  If the Prosecution have decided not to call a witness, that is another thing.  And those are two circumstances where it would be appropriate to change the order of the witnesses and, if I may put it this way, take the Defence by surprise.  But we don't know what the situation is -- or, at least, I know what the situation is, but I don't think that it is my position to tell the Court.  But I would invite Mr. Webster to tell the Court exactly what his position is. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster, can you clarify? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. O'Shea, you can always invite me to inform the Court of information, but unless I'm ordered by the Trial Chamber, I don't think it's appropriate for the Office of the Prosecutor to go into any discussion of our internal decision-making. 

So suffice it to say that we are experiencing a few problems with this witness.  We are still evaluating him and we will make a decision at a later time when and if he testifies.  I understand that this may be a bit inconvenient to you or to your co-counsel personally, but it certainly doesn't bring any prejudice to the Defence case.  You were well aware, and the parties and the Court were given a list of the witnesses that would testify during the first session.  The first session was scheduled for the 3rd of November.  You stated that you were ready at that time.  In fact, I believe it was your Defence team, more than any other, that was pushing to start the trial three or four weeks ago, so presumably you are ready when you were insisting that trial had to begin on the 3rd of November.  There is nothing in the Statute or in the Rules of Evidence -- there is nothing in the Statute or the Rules of Evidence and Procedure that requires us or requires the Prosecution, or any party, to establish a list and be governed by a specific order of testimony of witnesses.  You were aware that RO was listed to testify during this first Court session many weeks ago.  Accelerating the schedule by one day can't possibly be an issue of prejudice to -- for the Defence.  It just -- it violates all common sense to suggest that taking the witness one day earlier than you expected is going to cause prejudice to the Defence. 
Furthermore, I believe on Monday I had indicated to the Court that one witness was sick, that we were having problems with a second witness, and that there was another scheduling problem because of the order of witnesses and in light of the Kajelijeli judgement that was going to be read.  So as early as Monday, I had indicated to the Court and to the parties that there might be a problem with scheduling during this week.  So it's unfair so suggest that you were informed that there might be a problem just six o'clock yesterday evening. 

But having said that, I think that that fully addresses the issue. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President?  Madam President, just a brief response, if I may. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution, for those clarifications. 

Yes, Mr. O'Shea? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you.  The Prosecution and the Court, in my submission, can take our professional word for the fact that, in this particular instance, prejudice might be caused as a result of one day.  The reason why this Court has encouraged the Prosecution to indicate the order of the witnesses to begin with is so that the Defence is not unfairly wrong-footed.  In many cases, the Defence would not be prejudiced by a change in the order of the witnesses.  However, it is possible that that can happen.  And there is a basis in the Statute and the Rules and it is simply this:  that the Defence must have sufficient time and facilities to prepare the Defence case.  But we are in Your Honours' hands.  I'm not at this stage asking for an extension of time, because, as Mr. Webster correctly points out, we are concerned that the trial moves ahead as is the Court.  So I'm not making that application at this point in time.  

Mr. Hooper will try his very best to be ready for this afternoon.  If there is a problem, I will let you know.  But what I am saying is that the Court is entitled to know why a witness is not being brought, when the Prosecution has previously indicated that that witness will be brought.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, could I have the assistance of a technician?  Because our video screen is blank.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could someone from the technicians' booth come and assist Counsel Martel? 

We have an announcement to make regarding the calendar.  We've decided to resume hearings on the 19th of January, instead of the 12th of January, the 19th instead of the 12th.  Otherwise, things remain unchanged. 

Just allow us one minute, please.  Before calling the witness, we will render our decision on the objection raised by Mr. Robinson. 

The Defence objected to the admissibility of part of 's testimony.  The witness had referred to certain massacres of Tutsi in Mukingo commune in 1991.  The witness had added that he considered the massacres of 1991 was a prologue to other massacres committed in 1994.  The Defence maintained that the temporal jurisdiction -- the limit to the temporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal being the events of 1994 prevented the Trial Chamber from hearing that part of 's testimony. 

The Trial Chamber notes that the Prosecution does not rely on the evidence concerning 1991 with regard to the charges against the Accused.  The Prosecution pointed out that it was relying on that information to establish that there was a conspiracy to exterminate the Tutsi that had begun before 1994, conspiracy of all the Accused.  It has been an established that in the -- the precedent has been established that a Trial Chamber can adduce evidence of events that occurred before 1994 in order to demonstrate conspiracy, or any other crime for which the Trial Chamber is competent, when such violations began before 1994 but continued throughout 1994, or whose purpose was fulfilled in 1994.  We refer to a decision of Trial Chamber III in Nsengiyumva on the 13th of April 2000 and a decision of Trial Chamber I in Bagosora et al on the 18th of September 2003, a decision with regard to the admissibility of the deposition -- proposed deposition of Witness DBY.  

Therefore, we intend to hear Witness  with regard to incidents that occurred before 1994, in respect of what he was saying yesterday.  That is our decision.  

Please bring in  for the continuation of his examination-in-chief. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, before ending on this matter, may I bring an application at this time relating to your decision? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 

At this time, pursuant to Rule 73(B), I would request leave from the Trial Chamber to grant certification to appeal the decision that you just rendered.  I would note that in the Bagosora case that you referred to, the Prosecutor was allowed to appeal the decision on the very issue that you have now decided, and that in that Bagosora case, Trial Chamber I ruled contrary to the ruling that you've just made.  They required that there be a particular showing by the Prosecution how the pieces of evidence related to the existence of a conspiracy before 1994.  I don't wish to re-argue the motion at this point, but I think that it shows that this is a substantial issue that is likely to materially affect the outcome of the case and, indeed, the duration of the trial, and that a determination by the Appeals Chamber prior to the conclusion of the trial would be something that would further this case, which is the criteria under Rule 73(B). 

So my application is a request for certification to appeal your decision.  Perhaps we can join this appeal with that now pending in the Bagosora matter, but in any event, I believe it's worthy of certification.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I was getting up to continue with the direct examination on -- should I -- is the Court -- is the Trial Chamber deliberating, or should I proceed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No.  I thought you wanted to respond to the Defence application.  If such is not the case, you can sit again, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My understanding is that he's going to make a written application.  Is that so?  I think the application for certification for appeal has to be made in writing, and if that's the case, we will respond in writing, but for the record, we oppose the certification, but I had not planned on making a substantive response at this time.  I will simply await his written motion.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I was -- I thought I understood also that he was requesting that we do not continue with the examination-in-chief.  No?  Okay.  Sorry, no, no.  I misunderstood, then, Counsel Robinson's application.  

Yes, Counsel Robinson?  You wish to clarify? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  I think you did understand correctly my application.  I object to continuing and your hearing evidence of events in 1991, pending the decision by the Appeals Chamber, if I'm allowed to appeal to the Appeals Chamber. 

And secondly, I note that you've instructed that there be no written motion during the trial, and so I'm making all of these applications orally in conformance with your instructions.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, in that case I will respond, Your Honour.  It is certainly not in the interests of judicial economy to stop the direct examination of this witness at this point.  Even if this is an issue that Mr. Robinson wishes to address to the Appeals Chamber, we can proceed with the testimony from this witness, and if the Appeals Chamber rules in his favour, that portion of the witness's testimony can be stricken from the record.  So it certainly is in the interest of all the parties and this Trial Chamber to move forward with Witness's testimony, including those portions of his testimony that will address incidents in 1991 and 1993. 

As for his application for certification to appeal, the Prosecutor opposes that application.  I think -- or I would submit that this Trial Chamber has already cited the appropriate authority which would allow this Court to hear evidence in regard -- in relation to incidents that took place in 1991 and 1993.  It is not the same situation that is being addressed in the Bagosora trial, and I would submit that it's in the interests of this Trial Chamber to proceed with this witness's -- Witness 's testimony.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

The Chamber decides that we should proceed with examination-in-chief of Witness , and finds that it will subsequently determine the probative value of the statement of this witness, and it is of the opinion that the application for a suspension of the testimony of this witness should be denied.  And so we are proceeding with examination-in-chief of the witness. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed to examination of the witness.  

We shall rule subsequently on the motion for certification. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
WITNESS GBV,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning. 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we -- you testified at great length yesterday, and I only have one or two additional questions to ask you.  And previously you had indicated you were a bit tired and you would prefer to put off your cross-examination for tomorrow, but I'm going to ask you to bear with us, to answer my one or two questions, and to allow the Trial Chamber to proceed with cross-examination. 

If at any point you are too uncomfortable or too tired or too sick to proceed, you will let us know, but I think it's in the interests of all parties, and yourself, if we could do our best to push ahead.  So I would ask to you bear with us.  Let us know if you are too uncomfortable, but let's try and move forward this morning. 
A.	I told you yesterday afternoon that I would have liked to conclude examination-in-chief, and that with regard to cross-examination, I would like to answer the Defence counsel's questions on another day.  I think you are trying to constrain me to proceed to testify.  My position has not changed.  I am requesting that the Chamber should allow me to rest before continuing with my testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, believe me, we are very conscious and sensitive to your problem, and do you think -- we understand that you are not very well since you came here, but the procedure requires that, immediately after examination-in-chief, there should be cross-examination, and that is why we are proceeding in this manner.  We intend to observe short breaks to enable you to rest, if you're feeling too tired.  We could also request that those who are examining you should speak slowly in order that you may properly understand what is being put to you and to respond to those questions normally.  We are doing all our best to make sure the proceedings are hitch-free, and that is why we are supporting the Prosecutor's proposal that you continue to testify and that things should proceed as usual, notably that you will be cross-examined by the Defence as soon as the Prosecutor ends his examination-in-chief. 

We thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
When I left Rwanda, my objective was to come and testify.  I am not trying to evade the questions that are being put to me.  I'm testifying on events I witnessed, and I've even made a solemn declaration to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Previously, during the Kajelijeli trial, I was in very good health, but that was a long time ago.  The testimony lasted for -- has lasted for a very long time.  I understand what you are requesting me to do, Madam President, but health is more important than everything else.  What I'm saying is that I am not feeling well.  If I accept to continue to testify, it will be to comply with your order, but it will not be because I want to or that I wish to. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness, for the efforts you are making.  If you need to be assisted by a doctor, please do not hesitate to make that known to us. 

Prosecutor, please proceed. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I thank you. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday when we concluded that portion of our examination -- of the direct examination, you left off with a statement that in 1991 there were attacks against the Tutsi in Mukingo.  Do you recall when those attacks took place, when in 1991? 
A.	Those attacks took place in late January 1991.
Q.	And how long did those attacks go on?  How long did the attacks themselves last? 
A.	Those attacks lasted throughout the entire month of February.
Q.	Can you tell us what happened during the course of those attacks? 
A.	To the best of my recollection, following the taking of Ruhengeri by the Inkotanyi, people started killing the Bagogwe.
Q.	And when you say "the taking of Ruhengeri by the Inkotanyi," are you referring to the RPF? 
A.	Yes.  I am referring, indeed, to the RPF. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I wish to make an additional objection to this testimony on the grounds that this contains new matter not previously disclosed to the Defence.  I'm looking at the statement of this witness, and there is reference to 1991 but only as to some specific acts that relate to Mr. Kajelijeli and some particular individuals.  Now we are hearing stories about attack -- widespread attacks over a two-month period.  These are not -- these are new matters which have not been disclosed to us, and I object on that basis. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Robinson.  

Prosecutor, do you want to respond to the objection of Counsel Robinson? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  The attacks against the Bagogwe in 1991 may not have been mentioned in the witness's statement, but it was clear from the witness's statement that he was living in Ruhengeri and in Mukingo commune during the early 1990s.  A witness statement is usually a very directed document.  It only captures a portion of what a witness knows about a specific target of investigation or a specific series of crimes that are under investigation.  We are not in a position to go back to every witness and document every conceivable piece of information that may come out during their testimony in order to establish the context, the historical and social and political context, for the crimes that are charged to the Accused in this trial. 

We concede that the attacks against the Bagogwe are not mentioned in this witness statement, but it should be clear to anyone that has any familiarity with this case that anyone living in Mukingo during the 1990s would have to have lived through those events in 1991 and 1993.

So it's inconceivable that the Defence would be surprised by such information at this stage. 

The crimes that took place, or the attacks in 1991, are not directly attributable to the Accused.  They do not figure in the charges of the indictment.  We are not holding him responsible for crimes that took place in 1991.  We don't have the competence.  This Tribunal doesn't have the competence to judge his responsibility for crimes that took place in 1991.  However, going into that area does place the issue of conspiracy in context; and in addition to the issue of conspiracy, there is also the issue of foreseeability in relation to the joint criminal enterprise.  So there is a legal basis for us to pursue this matter, and it certainly is not prejudicial to the Defence, because anyone with any familiarity with this case would know that any witness that lived in Ruhengeri in 1990 and 1991 would be able to comment on the events that took place there at that time.  That's my submission. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May I respond, Madam President, briefly? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very briefly, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think, Your Honour, that our procedures are flawed here, because in every other case which I'm familiar with, when the Prosecutor talks to a witness in advance, such as the Prosecution has done with this witness, and the witness adds new elements to what he is -- is in his statement, the Prosecution discloses in advance of the witness's testimony what it has newly learned.  That's part of the fair-trial guarantee for an Accused.  And those are known as will-say statements, and that's been the subject of a ruling in the Bagosora case, as I mentioned to you earlier and cited that to you in the ruling of 18th November. 

And I'm informed that yesterday in Government II, Trial Chamber II ruled that no new matters can be heard without advance notice to the Defence, and they excluded testimony yesterday on the basis of the new matters that had not been disclosed to the Defence.  So this is a new matter.  Mr. Webster had an obligation to disclose it.  I don't think he fulfilled that obligation, and I am surprised. 

I'm surprised on two counts.  First, I'm surprised that we would even be speaking of 1991, when I think the jurisprudence is clear that it's not admissible; and I believe Mr. Webster's remarks have undermined your ruling on that point today by saying it's not part of the conspiracy, that Mr. Nzirorera is not being held responsible.  My understanding of your ruling a few minutes ago was that the reason it's being admitted is because it's evidence of the conspiracy for which he's on trial, a conspiracy that you believe extended back to 1991. 

So for all of those reasons, I ask that the question be -- that the objection be sustained and the witness not be allowed to testify on this subject matter. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may just clarify a point, I certainly did not say that the events in 1991 were not part of a conspiracy.  My statement was that Mr. Nzirorera is not being held responsible for the crimes committed in 1991.  There is a distinction there that I don't think you appreciated in your last remarks. 

And then, as for new information, speaking hypothetically, if the witness was talking about what Mr. Nzirorera himself did in 1991, then that conceivably would be new information.  We are not talking about the acts and omissions of your client in 1990; that's not the substance of this witness's testimony.  He's talking about events, and he's not talking -- social and historical events.  He's not talking about the acts and omissions of your client in 1991.  Perhaps that arguably would be new information.  But certainly talking about what he lived through, the social context in Ruhengeri in 1991, is not new information, as I understand it, for the purposes of disclosure.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, we are allowing you to proceed with this line of questioning, since it is the historical context, but we request that you should not dwell on those events, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday you testified that there were attacks in 1993 against the Bagogwe in Mukingo, and I believe you characterised those attacks as acts of reprisal.  Would you say the same for the attacks that took place in 1991? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection.  Leading question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel for the Prosecution, reformulate your question. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when the attacks took place in 1991, were those attacks before or after what you described as the capture of Ruhengeri by the Inkotanyi?
A.	The attack took place after Ruhengeri was captured.
Q.	And how long was Ruhengeri held by the Inkotanyi or by the RPF? 
A.	The Inkotanyi besieged the town for a period of two or three days, no more.
Q.	And the attacks that you were describing against the Bagogwe, how long did those continue afterwards? 
A.	The attacks lasted one month.
Q.	Is there anything that you saw or heard or observed that would lead you to conclude that the attacks against the Bagogwe were somehow related to the attack of the Inkotanyi?
A.	When the Inkotanyi attacked Rwanda on the 1st of October 1993, no killings were committed, only houses were torched.  So at that time there were no killings.
Q.	Are you saying October 1993 or October 1990? 
A.	No.  I'm referring to the 1st of October 1990, at the beginning of the attacks launched by the RPF. 
Q.	And your testimony -- correct me if I'm wrong -- is that after that attack, there were homes that were burned.  Is that what you were saying earlier? 
A.	Yes.  Houses were burnt during that month of October.
Q.	The houses that were burned during that month of October, and this is 1990, was it anyone's house or were -- was anyone in particular targeted, from what you could observe? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  We have no evidence of any foundation as to --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson?  What is your objection? 
MR. ROBINSON:
My objection is lack of foundation.  We have no idea how this witness knows of these attacks and whether he observed it or heard it from others or second- or third-hand. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe I asked in my question from what he could observe, and I assume in his answer he will tell us that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, based on your observations in October of 1990, were the attacks in which houses were burned directed at any group of people or any ethnic group, or was there any basis on which you can say the attacks were directed against specific persons? 
A.	Tutsis were targeted.
Q.	And when attacks took place in 1991, based on your observations, would you conclude that those attacks were also in reprisal for an attack by the RPF? 
A.	Yes.  I would say that those attacks were related to the attack launched by the RPF. 
Q.	Were the persons that were attacked in 1991 -- and I believe you identified them as the Bagogwe -- did they attack anyone?
A.	Are you referring to the attacks that the Bagogwe could have launched against the Hutu?  I have not quite understood your question, Counsel for the Prosecution.
Q.	My question is:  You described a series of attacks against the Bagogwe; and what I'd like you to clarify for the Court is whether the Bagogwe were armed at the time.  Were they attacking as well?  I'm trying to distinguish -- or I'll leave the question at that.  I'm trying to understand what exactly was going on.  You can tell us. 
A.	The Bagogwe did not defend themselves against the attacks by the Hutus.  They were attacked and initially their houses were burnt down, and from 1991 they started killing them.  But they, the Bagogwe, did not attack.
Q.	And directing your attention to 1993, to the attacks against the Bagogwe that you had mentioned previously, in the context of those attacks in 1993, were the Bagogwe armed, and did they try to attack anyone at that time?
A.	No.  The Bagogwe did not launch any attack.
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday you mentioned the Abatabazi government in your testimony.  It was the portion of your testimony where you were talking about having seen Joseph Nzirorera in Gisenyi in June of 1994.  And when I was asking you a series of questions about Mr. Nzirorera in Gisenyi and the presence of the interim government in Gisenyi, you made reference to the Abatabazi government.  Can you explain what you mean by the Abatabazi government? 
A.	No.  I cannot explain to you.  Since the setting up of that government, I did not get to know their political programme, because I was in hiding.  All I know is that that government was a government of killers. 
Q.	And what makes you say that, Mr. Witness?  Could you explain yourself a bit more? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection.  Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
We are again well beyond anything contained in the witness's statement and in any prior disclosure that we have had.  His opinions of the interim government has never been disclosed to us, nor are they relevant or based on any foundation.  He's not an expert. 

So we object on those three grounds:  lack of foundation, lack of disclosure, and lack of qualification of this witness.
MR. WEBSTER:
This question has nothing to do with the expert -- whether the witness is an expert or not.  I'm asking him to explain his response. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Witness, you can answer that question. 
THE WITNESS:
It was a government of killers, because since it was set up in April 1994, that government only killed people.  So I would say that it was a government of killers. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, directing your attention to the word itself, "Abatabazi," can you tell us what that word means, or what it means to you? 
A.	To my mind, "Abatabazi" in Kinyarwanda -- when you want to save somebody, you are called a saviour.  After the killing of Habyarimana, that government was set up, and it was known as the Abatabazi government, and that government was instituted to revenge the death of Habyarimana.
Q.	Mr. Witness, based on your experience of events in April of 1994, did you think that that government was trying to save you? 
A.	To save whom, Counsel for the Prosecution? 
Q.	You, personally. 
A.	No.  In view of the fact that I am Tutsi, that government did not try to save me.  That government instead targeted me and wanted to kill me, because I was considered as the enemy.  It instead wanted to assist the Hutu.
Q.	Mr. Witness, over the weekend, you met with members of the Office of the Prosecutor, and when those persons left your presence at the safe house, do you recall what their parting words to you were? 
A.	Yes.  I recall what their parting words were. 
Q.	Would you tell the Court, please? 
A.	The person asked me to tell the truth in this courtroom and to testify with regard to events that I witnessed.
Q.	Has your testimony yesterday and today been truthful, Mr. Witness, to the best of your ability?  
A.	Yes.  All I have done has been to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

Your Honour, that would conclude my direct examination, but I would at this time like to move two items into evidence.  These were the drawings that the witness made yesterday.  If we could identify them for the record as Prosecution 12A and B, and if we use the photocopy of the Mukingo-Nkuli sketch as A, that would be Prosecution 12A; and if we took the witness's own drawing which he made on a blank piece of paper as 12B, then we could use one number for both of those exhibits, which are essentially the witness's own inscriptions. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I haven't actually had an opportunity to see those exhibits since the witness marked on them.  May I just briefly take a look at them, and I will be able to advise you if I have any objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I note that on the sketch, during the testimony of the witness, he identified certain buildings -- Isimbi building, Byangabo bar -- and the sketch itself simply has boxes.  There are no markings to indicate which place is which.  So I don't think the sketch at this point is particularly helpful because we don't know which place he marked when he put the little box on the sketch.  And maybe you could look at the sketch and you can see what I'm referring to.  Normally, when we have identification, there is some label attached to it, the letter A, B, C.  So I don't think there -- unless the Prosecutor wishes to clarify that, I don't think these exhibits have any probative value at this point to the testimony. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, what's been marked as 12B, which is the witness's original drawing, can be placed in front of him, he can label all of his indications, and then it can be entered into evidence at that time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe Counsel Robinson's question was that there were -- there were no numbers or letters or any identification of the points marked by the witness on the sketch. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  I understand.  I'm asking for the sketch to be placed in front of the witness, and then he will make those indications so it's clarified on the exhibit itself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  The exhibit will be given to the witness so that he can make those indications on the sketch. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have a pen? 
A.	Yes, I have a pen.
Q.	All right.  You identified at least four different locations for us.  One was the house of Mr. Nzirorera's mother.  If you could put a number 1 next to that?  And to the best of your ability, write that, but do put a number 1 next to the house of Nzirorera's mother.  Tell us when you've completed. 
A.	It is done. 
Q.	Would you put a number 2 next to the Byangabo bar? 
A.	That is done. 
Q.	Would you put a number 3 next to ISAE? 
A.	That is done as well.
	(Pages 1 to 15 by Mark Porter)
































	1030H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Would you put a number 4 next to Isimbi house?
A.	That is done.
Q.	Are there any other indications on your drawing that you think are relevant to your testimony?
A.	There is also the Byangabo trading centre.  There is also the Byangabo residence and the Busogo parish church -- Nzirorera's residence.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is the interpreter correcting that.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you put a number 5 and circle the entire area, that is the Byangabo business centre, for number 5?
A.	That is done.
Q.	Would you indicate the Busogo parish church with the number 6, please?
A.	That is done.
Q.	And for your last entry, would you put a number 7 for what you have identified as Nzirorera's own residence in Mukingo commune, the place where he would go to rest?
A.	That is done.
MR. WEBSTER:
May I see the exhibit, please?  Could you place it on the overhead?  Or, actually, could we show it to the Court and the Defence attorneys first?  And at this time I actually withdraw my request to put it on the monitor, since all of the parties have seen it, and I would conclude my direct examination at this time.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, with those clarifications, I don't have any objections to Exhibit P. 12A and P. 12B.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  The Trial Chamber admits the documents containing sketches of Mukingo, Nkuli, and the sketch by the witness himself.  So the first sketch will be P. 12A, and the second, 
P. 12B, have been tendered and admitted as Prosecution exhibits.
	 (Exhibit No. P. 12A admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 12B admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution has finished examination-in-chief of the witness.  Is the Defence ready for cross-examination? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, I just have very -

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel O'Shea, you may speak.
MR. O'SHEA:
I just have a very few questions.  I don't anticipate this to take more than ten minutes, subject to the answers of the witness.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Witness, during the course of your examination-in-chief, at one stage you spoke about the MRND colours.  Do you remember that?
A.	I remember.
Q.	Would it be fair to say that in 1994, you personally could easily recognise the MRND colours if they were worn by a person?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would it also be fair to say that the colours of the MRND were well known in 1994?
A.	Are you speaking of the colours of its flag or other colours? 
Q.	During the course of your examination-in-chief, when you were describing how the Interahamwe were dressed, you indicated as one of the indicia for recognising them, the fact that they wore MRND colours.  Do you remember that?
A.	Yes, I've told you I remember.
Q.	Yes.  So that is what I am referring to.  I am referring to when the MRND colours are worn by a person, as opposed to on a flag.  Would you like me to put the question again? 
A.	I have understood your question.  I said that I remember that type of clothing.
Q.	So would it be fair to say that the colours of the MRND, as worn by persons, were well known in 1994?
A.	I don't know whether there were other people who wore clothing sewn out of kitenge cloth, but whenever it was necessary, the Interahamwe wore this kitenge cloth, clothing.  But it must have been manufactured somewhere.  And the same kitenge cloth might well have been sold in other countries.
Q.	All right.  I won't take this matter further.  Is it right -- I'm now moving on to another subject, Witness.  Is it right that it is your position that in the meetings which you attended, Joseph Nzirorera had encouraged people to only support the MRND or the CDR?
A.	That's not my personal opinion.  It is the reality of what was happening at the time.
Q.	Thank you.  Is it also your position that in your area of the country, the area of the country in which you lived, the killings that took place were controlled by the MRND and the Interahamwe?
A.	Absolutely.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, I have no further questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Counsel Robinson, you have the floor.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, you claim to be a Hutu, but you are really a Tutsi, correct?
A.	When did I say that? 
Q.	During 1975 through 1994, you claimed to be a Hutu but you were really a Tutsi, correct?
A.	Yes.  It was a way for me to conceal my identity, but I was, and I am, Tutsi.
Q.	And so you are used to lying, correct?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just ask your questions but don't draw conclusions.  We've already told you that.  Please avoid calling witnesses liars in this Trial Chamber. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, during the 20 years, approximately 20 years, between 1994 -- excuse me, between 1975 and 1994, if someone asked you your ethnicity in the streets of Mukingo, you would tell them you were a Hutu, correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  And as I said, it was to protect my identity, but don't call me a liar.  You know yourself the reason why I acted thus.
Q.	Well, when you told somebody that you were a Hutu, you were not telling them the truth, correct?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, move on, Counsel.  You're going to make us waste time again with such questions.  Please move forward; ask relevant, pertinent questions. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	As part of your effort to represent that you were a Hutu, you obtained a false identification card, correct?
A.	Correct.
Q.	And you used that card to deceive people, correct?
A.	To whom are you referring, Counsel?  Trying to deceive who? 
Q.	To whomever you showed the card during 1975 to 1994.  When you showed that card showing you were Hutu, you were trying to deceive that person, correct?
A.	The ethnic problem arose after the start of the war, and even in 1963 and 1973, but outside those times of war, to be -- for "Hutu" to be appear on my identity card was no problem at all, and it wasn't, in any case, a deceitful manoeuvre on my part. 
Q.	What was the reason that you obtained an identity card with the word "Hutu" on it instead of "Tutsi"?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered that question, Counsel.  Please go on to another question. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, did you attend a meeting at Ruhengeri stadium on 15 November 1992 of the MRND, where President Habyarimana spoke?
A.	No, I did not attend that meeting.
Q.	And so were you put in prison in 1992?
A.	I have never been jailed in my life.
Q.	Was it not your testimony that if a person did not attend an MRND meeting, they would be put in prison?
A.	That is in respect of people who could be arrested for not having participated in one meeting or another, but I was never arrested in such a situation.
Q.	And with respect to the meeting that you testified about where you heard Mr. Nzirorera speak in 1993, did all of the people in the 40 cellules that you were responsible for attend that meeting?
A.	I was never in charge of 40 cellules.
Q.	Excuse me, that's my mistake.  Did all of the people in the 40 households within your cellule attend that meeting?
A.	Those who could go, went.  But there were old people, and Ruhengeri town, being far from our place of residence, only people that were healthy and physically able to attended the meeting. 
Q.	And did all of the people who were physically able to attend from each of those 40 households, attend that meeting?
A.	It's difficult to administer people.  Some participated; others didn't.  And you couldn't arrest everyone.  You can't arrest the whole population of a country.  You know, in Africa, people are not in a hurry to participate in meetings, rallies, or to follow the instructions of their leaders.  I don't know what happens in your part of the world, but that's the way things are here.
Q.	And so how many of those people who were able to attend the meeting in Ruhengeri, but who did not attend, from the households under your jurisdiction, were actually arrested?
A.	I don't remember.  That was a long time ago.
Q.	Were any of the people in those households arrested for not having attended that meeting?
A.	I know that one person was arrested and beaten by Kajelijeli.
Q.	Was that person within the 40 households of your part of the cellule?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And can you give us the name of that person?
A.	Faustin Ntabwiko.  That is spelt N-T-A-B-W-I-K-O, Faustin Ntabwiko.  N-T-A-B-W-I-K-O, Faustin. 
Q.	Witness GBV, isn't it true that that individual, Faustin Ntabwiko, was in fact arrested for the murder of a Tutsi man named Sabin from the secteur Gataraga?
A.	That is not true.
Q.	Can you provide the names of the persons who attended this meeting in Ruhengeri at which Mr. Nzirorera spoke with you?  And if you believe that that would compromise your identity, we can have you write it down on a piece of paper. 
A.	I am not in a position to recall those people because the event occurred some time ago.
Q.	Can you give us the name of any person, besides Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Kajelijeli, who attended this meeting in which you claim Mr. Nzirorera spoke?
A.	I don't know if you followed my testimony, but I did say, in testifying, that many people attended that meeting, but that I remember -- I recall Nzirorera and the préfet at the time.
Q.	Can you give us the name of any other -- well, this was a meeting at a stadium with many, many people, correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And can you give us the names of any other people who could verify that, in fact, this meeting took place?
A.	What type of person are you referring to, ordinary folk, members of the population, or the préfet who had organised the meeting?  I think you can ask Nzirorera or that préfet.
Q.	Why don't you give us the names of any members of the population who attended that meeting with you or that you observed at that meeting?
A.	I told you, that happened a long time ago, and I don't remember all the people who were there.  Moreover, I wasn't about to write everyone's name down on a piece of paper.  And even if I had written their names down on a piece of paper, I wouldn't have kept that piece of paper from 1993 until today.
Q.	Witness GBV, I put it to you that I have spoken with every living member of the MRND préfectural committee in Ruhengeri and have been advised that there were no meetings after --
MR. WEBSTER:
Objecting to the form of the question, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
Counsel is testifying through his question.  He should pose --
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I'm putting my case to the witness.  It's not evidence, and I will bring the evidence when I have the opportunity.  But I have a right and, indeed, a duty to confront the witness with contradictory evidence to his testimony. 

MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Robinson is stating that he spoke to a number of people and those persons told him -- provided him with certain information, and this is the information that he is putting to the witness.  He is, in fact, testifying.  That is not a proper question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please reformulate your question. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GBV, isn't it a fact that there were no MRND meetings in Ruhengeri préfecture after the attack of February 1993 by the RPF, as a result of the security situation that existed in the préfecture after that date?
A.	These were not security meetings.  They were political party meetings.  Any meeting held in those days were political party meetings or rallies.
Q.	Witness GBV, there were no -- I'm putting to you that there were no MRND political meetings after February 1993 in Ruhengeri préfecture.  Isn't that correct?
A.	If you have a contrary opinion on that point, it's your -- it is your right, but I know that that meeting took place.  I don't know if you were present yourself and didn't attend the meeting, but I did attend and I know the truth as to what occurred.  You have the right to have your own personal opinion on that issue.
Q.	Well, can you give us the name of anyone who can verify that such a meeting took place?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection, Your Honour.  We've gone over this at least four or five times already.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the question had been put in a slightly different way, but it is the same question. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us, when the RPF attacked Ruhengeri in February 1993, approximately how many people were killed in Ruhengeri?
A.	Those who I remember were my neighbours at the time.
Q.	Would it be true that many people in Ruhengeri were killed when the RPF attacked the town in 1993?
A.	During the war between the Inkotanyi and the Rwandan army, I can't tell you how many victims there were, but after the attack, every time, the authorities would organise massacres of Bagogwe.  As to how many victims of the attack on the town, I can't give you a figure because I didn't go into town. 
Q.	Do you acknowledge that from your knowledge of the situation, that many people were killed by the RPF during the attack on Ruhengeri town?
A.	I told you that I didn't go to town.  I didn't go into Ruhengeri, at no time.
Q.	Isn't it true that a Mr. Phillip Gakwerene, G-A-K-W-E-R-E-N-E, was killed by the RPF, as well as his family, from your secteur during the RPF attack?
A.	I confirm the death of Phillip Gakwerene.  He was buried in his home secteur, in fact.  Even if he was killed in Ruhengeri, I cannot confirm whether he was killed by the RPF or the government army of the time.  Because if there is a war here in Arusha, no one can tell you that the bullet that hits me, the Witness , was fired by the rebels or the government soldiers.
Q.	So you will not acknowledge, then, that it was the RPF that killed this man?
MR. WEBSTER:
I object to that question.  The witness has given his answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for Prosecution.  That is correct, the witness has already answered the question.  We'd better go to the next question, but I think we can have the break now for 15 minutes, and you can continue cross-examination later, Counsel Robinson. 

The hearing stands adjourned. 
	(Court recessed from 1105H to 1130H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  

	Counsel for the Prosecutor, do you want to say something? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, during the pause, one of the security guards that accompanies the witness came to me and explained that the witness is really not feeling well and had requested to see a doctor, and that arrangements are currently underway to take him to the clinic.  I notice that when the witness was brought into the room, the courtroom, he was holding his head, and he does look a bit out of sorts.  

I previously informed the Court that when I first met the witness on Saturday, even at that time he was expressing discomfort and he had persevered because he wanted to move ahead with his testimony.  I think he did see a doctor over the weekend, but apparently he is still not feeling well.  And I would appreciate if the Court would indulge this witness in allowing him to see a doctor so that we may continue in a more vigorous mode, once the witness has had his health checked and regains his strength.  Your Honours may wish to speak to the witness directly, but I thought it wise to make this representation.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I also wish to inform the Court that I observed this witness during the break, and he did appear to be in -- sweating profusely and with his head in his hands.  He did appear to be feeling out of sorts, and it's in no way our intention to cause him any discomfort or distress.  We do want to have a full and vigorous cross-examination of this witness, but we would also ask that the Court be considerate of the witness's needs as well as, eventually, the needs of the Defence to have an adequate amount of time to cross-examine the witness.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, when you say that cross-examination could resume later, are you thinking that it could be done today? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd rather not make that representation because I have no way of knowing, but what I would suggest is that we proceed with Witness RO this afternoon, and then, depending on the length of that witness's testimony and cross-examination, we can return to Mr.  to continue with his cross-examination.  If we meet until two o'clock tomorrow, I would think that we'd be able to start again with Mr.  about around midday or so.  That's just a reasonable estimate.  I have no way of knowing.  It depends on --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

Yes, Counsel O'Shea. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, I have managed to speak to Mr. Hooper over the break.  I believe that we will be ready to take Witness RO after lunch.  Could I also say that, from our side, Mr. Webster's estimation on the time with regard to examination-in-chief and cross-examination together is, in our view, unrealistic?  We will -- Witness RO is a very significant witness for the Prosecution, and we have quite a lot of information which needs to be put to that witness in cross-examination.  I don't want to speak for Mr. Hooper, because he is the one who is conducting the cross-examination, but it seems to me to be very clear that it cannot be effectively finished in the time that Mr. Webster has indicated.  That's just to give the Court an indication of where we stand at the moment.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have noted your remarks.  We are going to adjourn, bearing in mind the fact that the witness is not in a position to take questions.  I see Counsel Roach standing up.  

Yes, Counsel Roach, do you have anything to add? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  Thank you, please.  Madam President, I wish to indicate that I may have -- depending on my friend Mr. Robinson's examination, I may have a few issues that I should like to raise with this witness.  Now, I know that there are witness support groups and so on that are very concerned that we don't take advantage of the witness, and I would not myself want to be put in a position to incur the wrath of anyone by examining or keeping a man who is ill here.  But I just wanted to put on the record, so that I don't face the same kind of experience as Mr. Skornicki did the other day, just to alert the Court that I do have some questions that I should like to put.  Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have noted those remarks.  We will now adjourn, to resume at 2:30 p.m., in principle, with Witness RO.  And we will be expecting information regarding the witness.  We hope he will feel better and that you will be able to continue the cross-examination that started this morning.  

We wish you a good rest, Witness, and a speedy return to health. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well then.  The Court is adjourned.

	(Court resumed at 1435H) 
MR. MARTEL:
Madam President, with your leave, please, I would like to address the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	The proceedings are called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

Yes, Mr. Martel?
MR. MARTEL: 
	Thank you, Madam President.

My client is very ill.  He does not stand dust, and neither can he stand being in the cells where he is put during the lunch break.  He had a crisis which required the intervention of a physician that was a short while ago.  So he would like to see a physician who would prescribe him some medicine against his major allergies.  He is also - - he would also like to be put somewhere else other than a place which controverts as unhealthy.  As you can see, he had a crisis this afternoon which required the physician to intervene.  He cannot stand being in a place such as the one he was put in this afternoon.

So our request is that the necessary steps be taken to address this problem, Madam President.  

Thank you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The President's microphone, please?  What the President said was not heard.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, the witness is present.  That is the witness for this afternoon?   Is the witness present?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, Witness RO also known as Witness CEA is present. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please could you bring in the witness?

Good afternoon, Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
	Good afternoon, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness of the Prosecution. We will refer to you under the pseudonym CEA.  You will be examined in chief by the Prosecutor and cross-examined by the Defence.  And perhaps the Judges would have questions to put to you.  You will see to it that you do not give information that could reveal your identity.  
Before answering questions, we would ask you to make the solemn declaration and the Registry staff will help you to make the solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness CEA in Kinyarwanda)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness.  We also thank you Registrar.  

Counsel for the Prosecution you have the floor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  The next witness will be taken by my colleague, Holo Makwaia.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ms. Makwaia, you have the floor. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, good afternoon, Your Honours.
WITNESS CEA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness, how old are you?
A.	I am 33 years old.
Q.	What's your ethnic group?
A.	I am a Tutsi.
Q.	Where were you living on the 6 April 1994?
A.	I lived in********************************************************************************.
Q.	On subsequent days after the 6th of April, did you hear of the President's death, President Habyarimana?
A.	Yes.
Q.	When did you hear of it?
A.	I heard of the death the day after the president's death, from my husband.
Q.	What did you do after hearing this news, Witness CEA?
A.	I didn't do anything.  I waited like others.
Q.	Where did you wait?
A.	I waited at home.
Q.	For how long did you remain at home?
A.	After the announcement of the news, the situation deteriorated.  So we spent very little time at home.
Q.	How did the situation deteriorate?
A.	The relations between the Hutu and the Tutsi deteriorated.
Q.	Can you describe for us how did they deteriorate, the relationships between the Hutus and Tutsis, and in which sense?
A.	Yes, my husband went to work in the morning, and on the way to work, he met roadblocks erected by the Nyumba Kumi and the officials of the secteur.  The people said that no one had to pass because there was insecurity in the country.  

Suddenly, our Hutu neighbours did not look us favourably when we told them, "Good morning," when greeted them, they would not answer, and we started asking ourselves what was going to happen after the death of President Habyarimana.
Q.	At home or did you go somewhere else?
A.	We stayed at home for some time, but because night patrols were instituted, the grounds of patrols were extended to prevent the enemy from penetrating into the country.  And we had to leave our homes. 
Q.	Who was doing patrols?  Can you tell us? 
A.	The night patrols were done by the Hutu and Tutsi, but relations between the two groups were not good.  I would say it was hypocrisy.
Q.	Now, can you give an approximate time, how many days after the death of the president were these patrols done by the Hutus and Tutsis?
A.	From the day, from the next day, road blocks were erected to prevent people from  passing and three days later on, night patrols were put in place.
Q.	You had stated earlier then that you then left home, where did you go to after leaving your home?
A.	Two weeks subsequently, we saw refugees arrive from Gikongoro.  The refugees came to look for refuge in a primary school that was in my area.
Q.	What is the name of this primary school, do you know?
A.	It is called Kabuga, rather the place is called Kabuga.  It is a place where there is a primary school.
Q.	Did you find out why refugees were coming from Gikongoro to your area?
A.	It wasn't long before we all went to see them, and we asked them why they had fled, and they explained to us that the Tutsi were victims of massacres in their native places, in their places of birth.
Q.	Did you remain at your home during this period, Witness CEA?
A.	Yes.  During that time, we still stayed home.  Subsequently, it became necessary to go and participate in a meeting that was convened in Akabuga, that is, the place where refugees were.
Q.	How many of went to -- can you please spell this place for us where the meeting was convened?
A.	A-K-A-B-U-G-A, Akabuga.
Q.	Who convened the meeting?
A.	The meeting was convened by the bourgmestre of Ngoma commune called, Joseph Kanyabashi.
Q.	Can you give an estimate of the number of persons who attended this meeting?
A.	There were very many.  The refugees were very many, and in addition to refugees, you also had the other Tutsis who had the same problems as refugees besides some Hutus.
Q.	Can describe this area for the Chamber please, Aka - - Kabakobwa?  What exactly is it?   
A.	It is a place where there are two separate primary schools.  The first school is in the Nkuli secteur.  The other is in the Sahera secteur, but the whole area is called Akabuga. Akabuga de Sahera. It is a kind of plateau.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, could the names be spelt?
MS. MAKWAIA: 
I wonder if the interpreter assists on that one. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I avoid giving proper nouns.  Nkubi secteur, Nkubi secteur is spelt as follows, N-K-U-B-I, Sahera is spelt as follows; S-A-H-E-R-A.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	 And now, when you all convened there, did anybody speak you?
A.	It is the bourgmestre of Ngoma that is Kanyabashi, Joseph, who spoke to us.
Q.	Did he tell you why you were sent there?
A.	In his statement, he started by saying that he had been contacted because refugees had come into the commune, the commune that he headed.  That it was explained to him that the refugees had come in great numbers because of hunger.  He explained that, we were going to experience, less and less security because the refugees were going to eat all that we had.
Q.	For how long did you remain at this place?
A.	After the bourgmestre's, speech, he, the bourgmestre decided that he would not like to see hunger afflict his commune because of people who came from other communes and that consequently, as his, superiors, and in accordance to his superiors' wishes, the refugees had to go to Kabakobwa in the Nkuli secteur in the Ngoma commune.  This is also a plateau which is at the top of a hill.  He decided that he was going to bring them food and that the people who had to --  he was also going to bring people to protect them.  

He added that anyone who thinks that he is in the same situation as the refugees had to follow the refugees.
Q.	-- or to Kabakobwa and can we please have the spelling for that?
A.	Kabakobwa is spelt as K-A-B-A-K-O-B-W-A.  The witness just added that she went along with the refugees or followed the refugees to Kabakobwa.
Q.	Can you give us an estimate number of the amount of people who went with you to Kabakobwa?
A.	We were very many.  Except that after our arrival, other people joined us.  All the neighbouring communes, communes sharing a border with Ngoma commune experienced problems and all the Tutsis who came from those communes came to that place because it was announced that there was food there, and that there would also be guards to ensure security.  I would say that they were about 30,000 people at that place.
Q.	And can you describe for the Court what exactly Kabakobwa is?  
A.	Thank you.  Kabakobwa is a hill, a very large hill which had a plateau without trees.  Subsequently, trees were planted on the hill.  But before that it was uninhabited.  It was between the Gishamvu, commune, Nyaruhengeri, Muhira communes and Ngoma commune.  These   communes shared a border with the Ngoma commune in Butare prefecture.  It was a very large hill.
Q.	Now, you have told the Court you were told to go there because you would get food and you would find guards to guard you.  Did you get food?
A.	No.  They did not bring us any food. On the contrary, they sent us killers.
Q.	Now, for how long had you been at Kabakobwa when the killers were sent?
A.	I think a number of days had elapsed.  I do not remember the exact number of days, but it must have been between two and four days.  In any case, the number of days did not exceed four and it is at that time that assailants arrived.
Q.	When the assailants arrived, what did they do?
A.	If I could come back a little. As soon as we arrived at that place, time and again, we would see groups of persons encircling us with traditional weapons like clubs, spears and used hoes.  But the assailants did not attack us.  Later on a vehicle of the Ngoma commune accompanied by its bourgmestre, Kanyabashi, Joseph, loaded with the communal policemen, and other vehicles in which you had Colonel Muvunyi and many gendarmes all these people came from Butare.  We thought that they were indeed bringing to us food.  What Kanyabashi said was that, "When you want to burn grass, you first gather the grass, you put it together".
Q.	What did they bring you if they didn't bring you food, Madam Witness?
A.	They arrived with weapons to kill us.  That is all they brought.
Q.	Were any persons killed?
A.	Yes, yes, a very large number of people was killed.
Q.	Did you go to Kabakobwa alone or were you accompanied by other relatives and friends?
A.	There were members of my family, neighbours and many other persons.  There were children, old people, old women, students, Fathers, religious Sisters, priests, there were all kinds of people in large numbers.  Among the persons there were my younger sisters, the husbands of my sisters, and all these persons were killed.  My young brother was wounded, but did not die, and I was also there.  He and I are the only people who survived the massacre.  There were a few other persons who survived, but they dispersed, but such survivors are not many.  
Q.	Now, after the massacre at Kabakobwa, did you remain there that day or what happened to you?
A.	I did not remain there.  Rather I went towards the university hospital of Butare. 
Q.	Why did you go to the university hospital of Butare?
A.	I believed that since you are wounded you should go towards the doctors.  I was hoping to be welcomed there and even hidden there.
Q.	Were you accompanied by other people at the Butare University Hospital?  Without giving any names, who were these people?
A.	Yes, there were other people. They were both men and women.
Q.	Did you go there with your wounded brother?
A.	I did.
Q.	So when you got Butare University Hospital, what did you do?
A.	I went to see a doctor.  And there, I saw many other refugees and many wounded people.
Q.	Which doctor did you see?
A.	The doctor called Gatera, he worked as a surgeon.
Q.	What did Dr. Gatera do when you went to see him?
A.	He didn't do anything for me.  He asked for my identity card.  I was not able to produce that card and he said that he had no time to care for Inyenzi.  He took a hatchet that he had and he hit my brother who was already wounded.  He hit him with a hatchet and my bother immediately fell to the ground.
Q.	You said he didn't have time for Inyenzi, what is Inyenzi?
A.	The term Inyenzi was understood to mean, those persons who attacked Rwanda and Tutsis who were being hunted down at the time.  They - - those Tutsis were considered as the accomplices of the Inyenzi.
Q.	Now, after your brother was struck by Dr. Gatera, where did you go?
A.	I went towards the other refugees.  They were makeshift shelters.  My brother didn't die immediately.  And after being with him, I went to see the other refugees.
Q.	Where exactly at the Butare University Hospital were these other refugees located?
A.	Those refugees were in the garden between the surgery department and the paediatrics department of the hospital, there is a garden between them.  That is where the refuges were at.
Q.	Can you give an estimate number, can you give can you approximate - - an estimate, the number of the refugees who were gathered at the ward and even as you indicated it?
A.	I wasn't able to count them but those refugees had come from many different places. Some of them had been brought by the Red Cross, but I can't tell you they were more than a thousand people.  Refugees kept came coming every single day.
Q.	So who fed you?
A.	Nobody ate, no refugees, no one of the refugees could find food to eat.
Q.	And what did you use for now,  I am going to rephrase my question.  So for how long did you remain at the Butare University Hospital?
A.	I remained there for one week, about a week.  It was towards the end of May and early April of that year.
Q.	So where you did spend the nights?
A.	I didn't sleep as such.  We remained awake because the assailants were around.  It was impossible to sleep.  So I slept or tried to rest under those shelters which were made of tops.
Q.	As you were at the Butare university hospital, did you see any authorities come at the hospital?
A.	After two days, I saw Dr. Gatera arrive with Andre Rwamakuba there at the place where we were taking shelter.
Q.	Who was or is Andre Rwamakuba?
A.	At that time, I did not know who he was, but Gatera introduced him to the refugees, and he said he was happy to welcome him as someone whom he worked with, someone with whom he had a good relationship.  And he introduced him to the refugees explaining that all of those refugees in the shelter were all Tutsis.
Q.	Now, where did this presentation of Rwamakuba by Dr. Gatare take place?
A.	It was in the courtyard where the refugees were and the wounded people were.
Q.	When Rwamakuba was presented to you, did he say anything?
A.	He said that the Inyenzis had killed the head of the state and that those refugees were the accomplices, he explained that the university hospital couldn't welcome that filth and that filth had to be removed at any cost.
Q.	Was the filth removed?
A.	Yes, it was.
Q.	How was this done?
A.	After the introduction and the explanation that all the refugees were Tutsis, Rwamakuba came back the next day.  He asked everyone for their identity cards so as to be able to distinguish the Hutus from the Tutsis. When someone was in the position that he didn't have an identity card, that person was immediately considered as a Tutsi.  Those who were identified as Tutsis were put into vehicles and they were brought somewhere else to be killed.
Q.	Can you tell the Court what type of vehicle were people put into?
A.	The vehicle most often used was a red pickup truck.
Q.	Now when the red pickup truck was being loaded, where was Rwamakuba?
A.	Rwamakuba supervised those who were loading the people into the vehicle and he was with 
Dr. Gatera.
Q.	Can you also tell us which area at the Butare university hospital the loading was taking place?
A.	The vehicle was driven up to the place where the refugees were next to the emergency room, right at the place where all the refugees were.  It was right there were all he refugees where being loaded.  
Q.	You have told the Court a few minutes ago, that these people were killed.  Where were they killed?
A.	Some refugees were cut with axes next to the hospital and corpses were being brought out.  Others were brought to Nyange in the Nyaruhengeri, N-Y-A-N-G-E, Nyaruhengeri, 
N-Y-A-R-U-H-E-N-G-E-R-I, commune.
Q.	How did you know about the killings that took place at Nyange?
A.	Doctor Gatera and Rwamakuba were giving instructions to the drivers to drop off those people in Nyaruhengeri commune because the other mass graves near the city were already full.
Q.	Did you hear this yourself?
A.	Yes, I heard it with my own ears.
Q.	Now, was that just one loading or were there many loadings of people?
A.	There were several because there were many refugees and more and more kept arriving each day.
Q.	Now, after this day, did you see Rwamakuba again?
A.	I did.
Q.	Where did you see him?
A.	I saw him when he was coming out of the operating room.  He was holding a piece of paper.  There were lists on that piece of paper, but I wasn't able to see the names of the list.  Apparently, it was a list of students, medical students and doctors who were being looked for who had been in hiding.  He asked all of the nurses to go through the hospital and try to flush them out and look for them.
Q.	Were students flushed out on this day?
A.	No.  On that day I didn't see their arrest.
Q.	When did you see it?
A.	When they were arrested?
Q.	You said on that day, you didn't see any arrests.  So I am asking you when did you see it?
A.	The following day, I don't remember which day it was, I saw doctors Rwamakuba and Gatera.  They had come from the maternity ward.  They had just brought two students out and he had, they had brought them from the basement.
Q.	And where were you when saw this, Witness CEA?
A.	I was next to the surgery department below the hospital.  It was just next to the ladies room.  I was just outside.
Q.	So what if anything, did Rwamakuba and Dr. Gatare do?
A.	They had axes.  One of them grabbed the student and hit him with the axe.  The other did the same thing.  The student fell to the ground.  

Also they were leading the employees of the hospital.  They brought the corpses of those students to throw them next to the maternity ward and I remained there.  In fact, in that location, there was a ditch where bodies were being thrown into.
Q.	Where exactly did Rwamakuba and Gatare kill these students at the Butare university hospital?
A.	They brought them out of the basement of the maternity ward and brought them before, right in front of the maternity ward door.  There was a corridor before the maternity ward and surgery ward, and that is where they killed them in the corridor.  They immediately asked hospital employees to wash the blood up.  There was lots of blood. 
Q.	Can you give an estimate of time that it took them to bring those students out, kill them and then ask the workers to wash the blood away?
A.	They weren't taking their time, they weren't doing something good. They must have spent half an hour doing that.
Q.	Now, what was going through your mind when you saw that killing taking place?
A.	I didn't think of anything really. I had to understand that I was going to die.  I was awaiting my own death.  I was in complete despair.
Q.	Did you see Rwamakuba again after this day?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	Where did you see him?
A.	I saw him again when he came out of the surgery ward on the second floor when he was talking to the hospital employees, ordering them to take the wounded and to bring the wounded to the soldiers who were manning a roadblock to kill them since those soldiers who were wounded who were guarding that roadblock were not on the war front.  This would boost the morale to kill these people.
Q.	Where were these soldiers found?
A.	Those soldiers were manning a roadblocks just in front of the ESO..  They were in wheelchairs.
Q.	If one were walk from Butare university hospital to the ESO, how long would that take, Witness?
A.	It's not a great distance.  On foot, at a normal speed, you could walk it in five minutes, but a car, it wouldn't take a car even one minute.
Q.	Now, when Rwamakuba said people should be sent to the injured soldiers in order to boost their morale, was this order implemented?
A.	Yes, the order was carried out. We were loaded up and brought to that place.
Q.	You said, you were loaded out, were you also one of the persons taken there, Witness?
A.	No.  Excuse me.  I wasn't loaded up.  I was lucky to be not in the group of people who were loaded and brought to that place.
Q.	So what happened to he people who were taken to the soldiers at the ESO?
A.	After they were brought to the soldiers, they came back and they said that those people had been killed.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours the translation I got was, after they brought them to the soldiers they came back now.  Now, I don't know if there is an error.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It seems to me that I heard those who brought them came back, but not the people themselves who were brought back.  That's what I heard in French was those who brought the refugees returned and said that the people, the refugees had been killed.
MS. MAKWAIA:
It's the English one I am referring to.
 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, Witness, while the people were being loaded to be taken to ESO, where was Rwamakuba?
A.	Rwamakuba was supervising the loading of the people.  He was between the shelters of the tents.
Q.	And can you tell us what does ESO stand for, it's an acronym, I believe?
A.	Thank you.  ESO is military camp in Butare town.  ESO is located just near to the university hospital.
Q.	Now, did you remain at the Butare university hospital after the event? 
A.	I was fortunate to leave the hospital after that, and I went back to the place where I lived.
(Pages 25 to 34 by Petrus Chijarira)






























	1530H
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness, were you married in 1994? 
A.	Yes, I was married and I had two children. 
Q.	Where is your husband today? 
A.	My husband was killed in 1994.
Q.	Which month, do you recall? 
A.	He was killed in the month of June. 
Q.	Do you know how he died? 
A.	Yes, I know.
Q.	How did he die? 
A.	The leaders of the secteurs at that time, including Conseiller Habyarimana, Pascal, had taken him hostage.  He was building his houses in the town ***********************************************************.  **************When the time came to kill him, since he had completed building the houses, Pascal handed him over to the killers who killed him.  And Pascal asked me to accompany my husband to see where his body was going to be thrown. 
Q.	Where was it thrown? 
A.	They threw it in a pit where other Tutsi bodies were thrown.  Moreover, the pit was full.  I would say he was the last person to be thrown into that pit.  They did not kill him; they threw him alive into that pit and they asked me to ask him for news. 
Q.	Madam Witness, if you were to see Rwamakuba today, would you be in a position to identify him? 
A.	This happened a long time ago.  I heard people talk about him following the serious massacres that took place at the hospital; perhaps I may not be able to recognise him.  I did not know him well before.
MS. MAKWAIA:
At this stage, Your Honours, I would like to show the witness Prosecution Exhibit P. 2.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution, apparently there is no objection to that.  

Is there any objection to the Prosecutor tendering -- rather, Exhibit P. 2, showing P. 2, rather?  Is there any objection to the Prosecution Exhibit P. 5 shown to the witness? 

Yes, Prosecution Exhibit P. 5, is that the exhibit? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I was correct Your Honours, it was P. 2.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have a copy for the interpreters?  Do you have a copy of this exhibit, that is P. 2?

MS. MAKWAIA:
Shortly, Your Honours, I think they can follow it from the screen.  We don't have a copy right now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
I am afraid my screen doesn't show the exhibit.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness, you have before you two photographs.  Starting with the first one, do you recognise what it is? 
A.	Yes, I can recognise the first photo.
Q.	Can you please tell Their Honours what it is?
A.	The first photo is that of the house which houses the management of the hospital, it is just at the entrance of the hospital, the administrative block of the hospital. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, may the record reflect the witness has identified Photograph No.1 in P. 2. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objection?  Perhaps it may be necessary for you to specify that this is K0275276, for the record; is that correct?   
MS. MAKWAIA:
It is correct. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now, moving to the second photograph on this page, Witness, do you recognise what this photograph is? 
A.	I think I have identified this photograph as -- rather, I recognise this photograph as well.  It is a photo of the garden where the refugees were, and below, you have the paediatrics block or department.  In the middle you have tents where the refugees were given shelter. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
For the record, Your Honours, the witness has identified and described photograph K0275277. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The record should reflect that the witness has also identified the second photograph. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Could you please turn to the next page?  Could you look at the screen before you?
A.	I also recognise this photo, we are still near the paediatric department, very close to the garden where the refugees were.
MS. MAKWAIA:
For the record, Your Honours, the witness has also identified Photograph K0275278 and described it. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the record so reflect that the witness has identified the photograph.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	And what is the current photograph that we are seeing, Witness PEA? 
A.	It seems to me that this photograph is that of the surgery or operation room.  When you go below, you get to the paediatrics department.  This is also one of the buildings of the hospital.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, the witness has also identified Photograph K0275279 and described it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the record so reflect. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Can you look at the screen please, Witness.  Do you recognise that?  What does this photograph depict? 
A.	On this photograph, you have the garden which is above the surgery department close to the physiotherapy department, where people with muscle problems are treated.  Here again people with fractures are also treated.  You also have the paediatrics department above this house. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
For the record, Your Honours, the witness has identified Photograph K0275281.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the record so reflect that the witness has identified Photograph K0275281. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Do you recognise what this photograph represents?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter -- the Kinyarwanda interpreter apologises, he had not put on his microphone.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We cannot hear the President, please.  There must be --

The Kinyarwanda interpreter says he can repeat the witness's answer.  The witness has said that, to her, the photograph represents the maternity, and opposite the maternity there is -- there are pillars for a water tank.
MS. MAKWAIA:
May the record reflect, Your Honours, the witness has identified Photograph K0275282.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	And what does this photograph represent? 
A.	This photograph is -- or shows the rear facade of the maternity.  It is a one-storey building.  In this building you have the maternity. 
Q.	Witness, are you in a position to tell the Court where you saw André Rwamakuba when he came out with the students, using this photograph? 
A.	I thank you.  They came out from the maternity door near the water tank pillars, very close to the water tank pillars.  Therefore, it is below the maternity block where you have the basement, the students came out of there.  Therefore, it was the basement.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, for the record, the witness has identified Photograph K0275283.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	And, I am going to show you one final photograph, Madam Witness. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
In fact, Your Honours, I don't have any further questions for the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we thank you, Ms. Makwaia.
MS. DIAGNE:
Madam President, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Diagne.
MS. DIAGNE:
With your -- if you would allow me please.  I would like to draw your attention to something which seems to me strange.  The Prosecutor is carrying out an identification mission so to speak.  She wants the witness to identify certain things.  I think it would have been more useful for the Defence and for the Court, for the legends not to be reflected on the photographs, because if we are given a photograph and we are told that it is the maternity; annex to the maternity, you have a kitchen.  And when the question is put to the witness, the question to know what is on the photograph, I think it suffices for the witness to be able to repeat that there is a maternity on the photograph and a kitchen.  If in addition, we were asked to put on the record that the witness has recognised what was on the photograph, allow me to say that it was not indeed difficult, Your Honour.  

I think the Court should draw the necessary consequences.  To my mind, the witness has not identified anything; all she did was, read what was written on the photographs.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Ms. Makwaia, do you have any observations or any comments to make regarding what Ms. Diagne has just said?  

MS. MAKWAIA:
It hasn't been established, Your Honours, that the witness can first and foremost read English; that is my first observation.  Counsel is at liberty to put any questions to the witness as to her knowledge of the Butare university hospital and we can go from there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Trial Chamber notes that you can, in the course of your cross-examination of this witness, ask questions in this regard. 
MS. DIAGNE:
Madam President, I did not want to ask a question.  I know that at the time of cross-examination, I could ask a question.  I will put the question again.  The Prosecutor says that it is an identification of various sites on the basis of photographs, on the photograph that is a legend.  Do you think that, indeed, this is a way -- a proper way of identifying a place or places?  Is that how you carry out an examination to identify places?  Everything is written on photographs.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mrs. Makwaia, you may respond.
MS. MAKWAIA:
When Prosecution Exhibit P. 2 was entered with inscriptions on it, none of the counsel objected.  When the first photograph was screened, counsel didn't bring an objection to the Chamber.  In fact, Madam President, you asked if there was any objection.  Counsel kept quiet until the last photograph.  I think it would be appropriate if she addresses any of her queries to the witness who is still available before you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We move forward now.  

Counsel for the Defence, do you want to conduct your cross-examination at this point? 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, I am in a position to commence my 
cross-examination, but before I do so, there is a matter that I would like to raise and raise it first, if I may, with the Prosecution.  It may be that my direct inquiry of them will answer the query that I have in my mind at present.  And to that end, and perhaps bearing in mind that this lady has been in the witness box an hour and a half, would it be appropriate for me to ask for a short adjournment of 10 minutes or so, perhaps 15, given the nature of the inquiry and what may result from it, and then I will be in a position to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If I understand you correctly, do you want to ask the witness a question out of the courtroom during the break that you are asking for?  

MR. HOOPER:
I am not going to approach this witness for a moment.  I will address it to Ms. Makwaia or 
Mr. Webster. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed, that is what I said.  Do you want to ask your question in the courtroom or you would like us to take a break?  
MR. HOOPER:
I would like you to take a break so that I can deal with it directly as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We are going to adjourn for about 15 minutes and we will resume after the break for the cross-examination of the witness by Mr. Hooper. 

The proceedings stand adjourned.  
	(Court recessed from 1555H to 1614H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed.

Counsel Hooper, you have the floor.
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, you will notice that  the witness is not in court.  I have asked her to remain outside just for a moment, to conclude the matters that were in my mind, as it were, before the adjournment.  

I was able to speak to the Prosecution.  My first question was this: I received in respect of this witness under her pseudonym RO, ten statements.  And I have asked the Prosecution to confirm that these are all the statements that she has made.  I haven't had announcements to that, but it was by chance now, I think, that Mr. Webster expected his team to have provided him with the answer to that matter.  

So I do not know just at this moment as I have raised it, whether we could have an indication if it's possible at this stage before I question this witness, to confirm that the Defence received all the statements in the possession of the Prosecution made by RO. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, yes. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, Your Honours, it has come to our attention that, indeed, there is another statement recorded by Witness RO or CEA.  According to the information we have, the statement came to the attention of a case manager of the team at about 11 a.m. this morning.  This same statement came to my attention at about 2 p.m. today.  I looked at it very fast, gave it to the case manager to find out whether it has been disclosed or not, because my perception at that time, Your Honours, was that it was simply a statement that was not included into my bundle.  

We are having copies made and they will be served upon counsel very shortly.  This is a statement, Your Honours, that is clarifying another statement that was taken in 1998.  That is the response to that query.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  And what was the date of this new statement, unserved statement, please?
MS. MAKWAIA:
This statement, Your Honours, was recorded on the 22nd of October 2003. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm rather concerned that a statement taken just over a month ago, first of all, it was unknown to the team -- the Prosecution team, which raises considerable concerns about their capacity for disclosure.  

But secondly, and more importantly, I think I need to be provided with it too, swift, and before this witness perhaps returns to the witness box.  I mean -- they haven't told me yet what is in the October statement.  I would be grateful to see it.  

The second matter is this:  Madam President, I don't know if you and your colleagues, the Judges, the sister Judges, I should say, have, in fact, had the opportunity of reading many statements in this case.  

I don't know if I could beg an indication from you, Madam President, as to whether you have been provided with the statements or not.  It would assist me in the course that I propose to take to have an indication as to that.  I am not sure what the practice is.  As you know, I am a relatively new boy here.  But I understand some Judges have statements and read them, I believe.  And other Judges and perhaps from another system, tend to keep them very much at arm's length.  But my 
cross-examination of this witness will involve a fairly -- I regret to say, a wide-ranging but not necessarily wide-ranging review of the accounts that she has given in the past. 

I prepared bundles for the assistants of the Judges which are here in Court so that the statements are to -- immediately to hand and they are numbered 1 to 10 so that they are quite easily accessible.  They are not so accessible as you know, I think, in the way they have been disclosed.  

Can I just provide a sample bundle, if there is anyone here to fetch and carry for me?  Thank you very much, fetch and carry for me.  
For the Prosecution's information, this bundle contains no more - can I just have a look in one moment -- than marked statements 1 to 10, together with two sketch maps that appear in the book "Leave None to Tell the Story" of Butare, which the Prosecution, I know, will be very aware of, and I have included them one because it is a clearer sketch of the town.  I think Mr. Webster probably knows the sketch very well.  

But secondly, also because it shows the commune breakdown and it has the secteurs indicated there, and to some extent, I think the cellule, and that may assist if not today, at least to the future.  So I have got the other two here.  

May I say that if it requires -- I am sorry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, Counsel.  Just a moment.  

Counsel, are you in a position to begin cross-examination, and you can have the eleventh statement?  The eleventh statement is not in our files, neither counsel's. 
MR. HOOPER:
Is there a copy of that eleventh statement in Court that I can quickly look at?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, there is a copy you can look at. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will give you a copy immediately. 

Yes, Counsel Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you for that opportunity.  Yes, I have got -- certainly matters I can put today to this witness.  Thank you.  I am ready to start. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Please bring in the witness, Registry.

1630H
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, may I just -- as the witness is on the way -- just raise a matter before the witness comes in, and that is: I will be asking questions such as where she works and the like, and members of family, and I'm just unacquainted with the procedures as to how I should go about that and not possibly risk an infraction of the Rule as to this witness's security.  I seek your guidance.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, Counsel, if you can put all of that information on a document, a sheet of paper, we can put it before the witness and then she can respond.  Otherwise, you can request a closed session to question this witness so that the witness remains protected.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I see how we get on.  But if I infringe, I know you won't hesitate to let me know and I'll reconsider the position.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I don't know if you can see me from where you are.  Can you see me?
A.	Yes, Counsel, I see you.
Q.	You probably find me dressed in a rather strange way, and I apologise to you for that because may I say right at the beginning that I recognise that you are a woman who has suffered greatly.
MR. HOOPER:
I was trying to see if that's being translated.  I'm working with two mikes at the moment; one was difficult enough.  That has been translated, is it?  Very well. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And during the war, during the genocide, you suffered the loss of parents and family and you suffered grave indignities to yourself.  That's right, is it not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now I recognise that.  I am going to be asking you questions today and we'll go into tomorrow certainly.  And if at any time my questions upset and concern you, then you let us know straight away, all right?  And you can take a break, I'm sure, at any time you wish.  You understand?
A.	Very well.
Q.	I ask questions on behalf of Dr. Rwamakuba, the man you say you saw at the hospital doing these dreadful things.  And I say at the outset that you are wrong when you say that he was there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, could you please put questions to the witness without giving your opinion or commentary. 

MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Well, Madam President, I'm putting my case to the witness and I appreciate it's often put in that way and it doesn't involve an answer, but I'm putting, as we say, cards on the table to begin with, and then we'll work with the evidence this witness has given.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, you were, I think, 24 years of age in April of 1994?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And what was your work then?  Were you a farmer, a cultivatrist?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I'm just --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Makwaia, you have an objection?
MS. MAKWAIA:
He is asking the witness what her function or work was in 1994, I think he could reserve this question for the closed session, if he wishes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you should not put questions to the witness regarding her identify in public session anyway.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I did it against the background of there being about six million cultivatrists in Rwanda in 1994, and it wasn't identifying feature, but if I'm going to stumble along in this way, then I better ask for a closed session because it's going to be difficult to pick my way, I think, through these questions without that.  I regret that because I, like most people, I favour an open session that the public can hear and engage in, and there is many public here, I see today, but I think it would be difficult for me to pick my way through this evidence and not infringe from time to time.  If putting the question cultrivatrist is the infringement, then that must be the case.  I think I will be running into trouble.  So, subject to your discretion, Madam President, it may be that the safest course is therefore to ask for a closed session for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, your response is not something that you normally put to a witness in public session, to a protected witness, but if you can proceed now and avoid asking questions that might reveal the identity of the witness, you can move on.  Perhaps at the end of your cross-examination you can ask for a closed session, at which time you can ask questions regarding the witness's identity.
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, thank you for that.  I'm guided and helped by your intervention.  I think it will have to be a closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any objection to the requested closed session?  
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I can only object to what I perceive as information that would identify the witness.  If counsel wants to go into closed session, he knows better his own questions, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we will move into closed session.  We apologise to the public but we must move into a closed session so as to protect the identity of this witness.  

We move to closed session.
MR. HOOPER:
May I just say that I notice that the 11th statement that I have now got was a statement -- was a statement taken by Mr. Henry Baghel, who was the first witness, and I may have had some questions to put to him had I known that position, but that can be addressed perhaps on another occasion.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, in 1994 --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment, Counsel.  We are still waiting for the public gallery to be cleared.
