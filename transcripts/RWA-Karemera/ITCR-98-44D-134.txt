P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings. 
MS. KOUO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Gustave Kam -- and Judge Gberbao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, 4 July 2006, for the continuation of the trial of the matter of Prosecutor vs Karemera, et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony continues this morning.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth as when you evidence began.  

Mr. Robinson will continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  And good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber, I have a few disclosure issues I would like to raise I'm -- I think about to finish my first round of cross-examination of this witness within the hour, and I will have two disclosure matters that I would like to follow up on.  

The first one is whether there has been any success by the Prosecutor in locating the purported statement of Witness XBM made in September 2005?  

And the second concerns Rule 68.  Last week, Mr. Webster told me that the Prosecution had located some Rule 68 material, but that since it was on the EDS, he didn't feel he was obligated to provide it to me.  Since then, on Friday, the Appeals Chamber made a decision concerning the Prosecutor's disclosure obligation and the EDS system.  And they held that the Prosecutor could not fulfill his      Rule 68 disclosure by virtue of placing material on the EDS system.  And they noted that they found disconcerting Mr. Webster's suggestions about interpretations of Rule 68.  

But as to Witness XBM there is, apparently, Rule 68 material which has not been disclosed to us.  And I am asking now that the Trial Chamber order the Prosecution to disclose that material forthwith.  So, those are the two disclosure issues that I am raising at this time.  I am also asking the Trial Chamber to require the Prosecution to tell us at this time who their next witness will be.  As in our informal consultations, Mr. Webster has been equivocal about who he is going to call next.  And I think it is necessary for us to now have some definitive information about that so we can prepare.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning to the Trial Chamber and to everyone else.  I think maybe I should adopt the practice of having a microphone with me and tape recording all of my conversations with the Defence counsel, because what I recall as the content of my exchanges with Mr. Robinson are very different from what what he seems to have placed on the record, be that as it may.  

Concerning the Rule 68 matter, my recollection of that conversation was a request from Mr. Robinson for a number of -- for us to do a search of a number of names that he communicated to us in that correspondence, which we did conduct.  At that time I advised him that he should also do these searches in the EDS because much of the material is at his disposal.  

We did locate one statement which was not among the things that he requested.  We located it in the course of doing these other searches on his behalf.  That statement was delivered with him, but with the advice that much of the material he is looking for is already in the EDS and at his disposal.  And the materials that we disclosed to him, actually, were available in the EDS, and could have been found using the search criteria that he had provided to us.  So, that is quite a very different conversation than the one I heard reported to the Court just a few minutes ago.  The material that he was seeking was actually given to him.  The searches that he asked us to do on his behalf were conducted on his behalf.  And as far as I know, all of the Rule 68 material in this case for this witness has been disclosed.  

I also have a rather different reading of the Appeals Chamber decision yesterday, but I will leave it to each of us to read that decision and appreciate its contents.  As for the statement that the witness alluded to yesterday during his testimony, enquiries are still ongoing.  I have no further information from Kigali.  I sent several emails yesterday.  That was followed up by investigators that are working on our behalf here in Arusha.  And I know that one particular investigator made a few phone calls to follow up on the matter.  But as of this moment, we have no further information.  But I will continue to do this -- to make enquiries during the course of this morning.  And as soon as I have some information, I will report it informally the Trial Chamber and to the parties. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The last matter, your next witness?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I thought that was also a matter that we had addressed, both with Mr. Robinson as well as the other counsel.  The next witness will be AWB.  Because of the projected length of testimony of ALG, even though we had wanted to take his testimony this session, it is impracticable.  From what I understand, each of the Defence teams want to cross-examination him for one week each, and his direct testimony is expected to last two days, so that it is not possible for us to take his testimony this week, even though he has been to Arusha twice before and this is his third time here to testify in this trial.  So, we will proceed with AWB, and I'm assuming that we will be able to complete AWB by the end of next week.  That is, of course, contingent on when we begin AWB's testimony. 

As of yesterday, I was told that each of the remaining Defence teams expected to be with him for      two days each.  Now, I understand that there may be some revisions of that, but if we don't start AWB by Thursday, I doubt if we will complete that witness this session.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like to inform the Court that a short while ago I told Mr. Lahaie that, contrary to my initial estimates in respect of cross-examining Witness XBM, I am going to significantly reduce the amount of time and, hopefully, will be done by mid-afternoon today. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to answer Mr. Webster when he says that we should read and assess the Appeals Chamber's decision on disclosures by EDS.  I believe that it would be useful to conduct that kind of exercise, but this can only be effectively meaningful for us if we do it in the language which we understand, particularly on technical issues of this nature.  And, therefore, we would require some time to be able to respond to the Prosecutor's request, particularly after translation has been provided.  

So, Mr. President, what we are simply saying is that the decision of the Appeals to reject or dismiss the Prosecutor's appeal is something that we need to understand clearly once our official translation has been made available to us, so that we may be in a good position to fully access that decision.  Thank you. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, for my part, I would like to look at the scheduling that has been proposed by Mr. Webster in respect of the testimony of Witness AWB.  He has provided some indication, and we know that the session is drawing to an end.  And I believe that we should calculate properly to see whether it will be timely to begin that testimony, and whether we will be able to complete it, particularly if ALG will not be testifying this session.  That is why, Mr. President, I would rather we dealt with that properly rather then wait until next week and find out that we are locked in a jam.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are faced with a position where the schedule we expected to be followed has not been.  We are going to be short of one witness from the anticipated programme we anticipated.  And when we think in terms of the overall requirements of the case, we are concerned that things are moving too slowly.  
Now, we have adopted the principle of relying on the professionalism of counsel before us and not to be very intrusive in the conduct of the examination; which we could be if we decided to.
What I would expect is that counsel would organise their -- their work to ensure that it fits in within the time that is available.  I don't know if it is necessary for me to say any more than that at this stage.  If I don't think the Court should necessarily be involved to assist in managing this.  But we are not going to give up a week and a half of trial time, and we would expect that the witness commenced will be completed before the end of the session.  We would not want to have a witness that is incomplete at the end of the session.  And we would expect counsel to organise their work to fit within the time that is available.

Mr. Robinson, I don't think we there is anything else we can say or that we can make at this stage.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I understand, Mr. President that.  I just want to respond to something that Mr. Webster said about Rule 68 material for Witness XBM, just so we are clear it is my understanding that he is telling me that there is no Rule 68 material to disclose to me.  I am going to check on the EDS for that.  And if I find that there is Rule 68 material on EDS that has not been called to our attention by the Prosecution, I am going to make a motion under Rule 46.  

So, I just wanted to be very clear that the Prosecution is representing that they have given us all of the Rule 68 material; they are not relying on the EDS, as the Appeals Chamber has directed them, and as the Trial Chamber previously directed them.  And whatever consequences flow from that will be, at least, noticed that -- that everybody knows what the rules are.  So, also I think with respect to      Witness AWB, I think my own cross-examination of him will be very brief.  I will be the last one to cross-examine.  And I don't plan on much cross-examination, if any.  So I think we can complete that witness during this session, at least, as far as I am concerned, absent any glitches.

So, now I would like to offer two exhibits, which are transcripts that were referred to yesterday, of this witness's testimony in Bagosora case on the **************2003.  The first be pages 80 and 81 in the English transcript as D. NZ170 (sic).  And I will supply the French transcript later in the week.  And also from page 18 of his testimony of the **************in the Bagosora case as D. NZ171 (sic).  I provided copies to the registrar and to the Prosecution.  So may those two documents be admitted?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ171 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. NZ172 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the French translators have requested you to speak a bit more slowly. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I may have misnumbered the exhibits.  I am just checking for one moment.  
Yes, Mr. President, I'm sorry.  The transcript should be D. NZ171 and 172, as I already have a 170.  So, 171 would be **************testimony in Bagosora at pages 80 and 81; and 172 would be the       *************in Bagosora at page 18. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you are still speaking a bit too fast for the translators.  But the correction is noted.  And the documents are admitted under those new numbers. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS XBM
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, (Kinyarwanda spoken).  
A.	Well, thank you. 
Q.	Yesterday you told us about seeing Colonel Bagosora arrive in Gisenyi and address a meeting after a helicopter had apparently delivered him.  I'm wondering if you can tell us when was the next time you saw Colonel Bagosora after that? 
A.	After the helicopter had arrived in the month of May, I do not remember any other occasion at which I saw him, either attending or organising a meeting. 
Q.	Did you see him in connection with the financial contributions that were being solicited at the MRND palace in June 1994? 
A.	Well, now I do remember the time at which 7 million francs were collected as financial contributions.  There was a vast assembly of persons, and he was present at that time. 
Q.	And approximately how long after the meeting involving the helicopter did this second meeting occur? 
A.	It was in the month of June, I believe.  One week thereafter information was being disseminated to the effect that the RPF had captured Kigali, so that must have been around the 20th. 
Q.	And on that occasion where did you see Colonel Bagosora?
A.	I did not see him at any other occasion. 
Q.	But where was the place where you saw him around the 20th of June; where in Gisenyi? 
A.	It was, indeed, at the time when those financial contributions to support the army were collected.  So we need to distinguish between a meeting that is organised or held by an official from an occasion when you see that official going by.  We need to make that distinction. 
Q.	Did you see Bagosora at the MRND palace on that occasion? 
A.	The event took place at the MRND palace and Bagosora was present. 
Q.	Was Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva present?
A.	Yes, he was also present at the assembly. 
Q.	And were any officials of the MRND party present? 
A.	Yes, this event was organised by MRND supporters as well as members of the other parties which had allied with the MRND.  And all those present were involved in collecting those funds, or raising those funds in order to support the army. 
Q.	What authorities from the MRND party were present? 
A.	Those who spoke, or who were in a position of high visibility included the president of the MRND who delivered a speech at that meeting.  And his name was Wellars Banzi.  He is the one who requested that the fundraising should begin as a war effort. 
Q.	Were any of the three Accused in attendance? 
A.	None of the three Accused spoke, and we did not cross-check to determine whether other officials were present.  In fact, at that time it was becoming obvious that the country was going through very difficult times. 
Q.	Do you know an official of the MRND party in Gisenyi at the préfectoral level, namely,                    Michel Bagaragaza?  That is B-A-G-A-R-A-G-A-Z-A. 
A.	I have heard about Michel Bagaragaza, but I never met him and I never saw him with my own eyes. 
Q.	Were there any officials of the CDR party in attendance at this fundraising meeting? 
A.	As I have already said in the days past, and even yesterday, this activity was organised by the MRND, but members of other political parties were also in attendance along side the MRND so that they could raise sufficient funds. 
Q.	So, who were the authorities of the CDR party in attendance? 
A.	I do not remember any officials, apart from Ngeze, who was the most visible official of the CDR at that time. 
Q.	Are you referring to Hassan Ngeze? 
A.	Yes, indeed, it is Ngeze; Ngeze, Hassan, yes.  
Q.	And what was his position in the CDR party? 
A.	He was one of the leaders of the CDR.  He was a member of the political bureau of that party.  And further still, he was a very active journalist at the time.  And he often wrote, providing information to Hutus to the effect that they were losing their grip on power.  So he was a distinguished official both within the party and generally speaking? 
Q.	Who was the president of the CDR party at the préfecture level in Gisenyi? 
A.	The préfectoral leader of the CDR, well I do not remember that person's name, because we did not pay attention nor seek to know their names; rather we listened -- or we paid attention to what they said. 
Q.	Can you give us the names of any member of the préfectoral committee of the CDR in Gisenyi? 
A.	I have no names for you, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, you say you were a member of the CDR; you could not name a single member of the préfectoral committee, you can't name the president of the CDR in your commune.  Can you name the president of the CDR in your secteur? 
A.	The chairman of the CDR in our secteur -- well, I think I gave you his name on a piece of paper, unless I am allowed to give his name in open session.  However, I did give the name of that individual on the sheet of paper. 
Q.	Well perhaps you did in connection with the receipt of weapons.  But I'm going to ask you to write down on a separate piece of paper that individual's name so that we have it clear as to who the president of the CDR was in your secteur.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So if the registrar could be kind enough to provide a piece of paper to the witness he can write that person's name.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you write down the name of your secteur also?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that the name of the CDR leader for that secteur be admitted, under seal, as Exhibit D. NZ173. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ173 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, is that individual still alive today? 
A.	Yes, he is, except for the fact that during the time I have spent here I don't know what might have happened to him the interim.  However, when I left Rwanda he was still alive. 
Q.	Were there any members of the MDR party, or leaders of the MDR party present at the meeting where financial contributions were solicited in June of 1994 in Gisenyi? 
A.	As I explained to you at that time, the most important officials who were present were the members of the MRND.  Members of the population also came to support what was happening and support the army, that had run out of ammunition.  So it wasn't a question of political party or belonging to specific party.  Anybody who wanted to help the army in order to free the country intervened.  And at that time people were not bothered about political parties and who belonged to which party. 
Q.	Well, the MDR party was represented in the interim government and had leaders, such as the        prime minister Jean Kambanda, Donet Murego, M-U-R-E-G-O, Jerome Mbonampeka.  Froduald Karamira; did you see any of those people at this meeting? 
A.	As I have explained on a number of occasions now, I knew the leaders of the MDR.  However, I did not see any official from the MDR.  I think I have repeated that on a number of occasions.  I said that those who had organised the meeting were the leaders of the MRND party.  As a result, the inhabitants of Kigali or Ruhengeri could not travel in order to come to meetings or activities organised by the MRND.  
Q.	At the time of this meeting, had the interim government located to Gisenyi as of yet? 
A.	The truth be told, everything to do with the government was rather opaque; even when they were still in the Congo, they would say that they were within Rwanda.  So nothing was clear for the population as to where the government was, or where it was travelling around. 
Q.	Was an individual named Félicien Kabuga present at this meeting?  That is K-A-B-U-G-A. 
A.	I think you should be happy with my response and stop suggesting names to me.  There was a large number of people at the meeting.  And they all had one thing in common.  They all had the same aim.  So I am not in a position to confirm whether he was there or not, or, in fact, to deny that he was there.  I don't know whether he was there or not. 
Q.	And did you contribute financially during this meeting? 
A.	Yes, I did contribute a sum of money, as did each and every member of the population, according to their means.  If you had a sum of money in your pocket, you were to hand it over; and that is what I did. 
Q.	How much was your contribution? 
A.	I gave a modest sum on that occasion, 3,000 Rwandan francs. 
Q.	And why did you contribute? 
A.	It was a way to support the army. 
Q.	Now, when did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda on the*****, in the month of July 1994. 
Q.	And when did you return to Rwanda? 
A.	Two days later, that is to say on the*****. 
Q.	Now, the last thing I want to ask you about is to -- is your contacts with the ICTR and its representatives.  We have discussed already that you made a statement on the 26th and the           27th of February 2003.  Now, can you tell us when was the next time you were contacted by the ICTR after that? 
A.	After that occasion, somebody came to meet with me at the commune office in Mutura.  I think that was on the************, and it was a lady who came to meet me, I'm not entirely sure.  The lady was accompanied by other people.  She showed my statement to me, that is the statement of the            26th of January 2003, and I noted that she had underlined an excerpt where the name of Mr. Ngirumpatse was mentioned.  In fact, what she wanted was for me to confirm what I had said as to the content of that statement; and I did so. 
Q.	And then you testified here in Arusha in the trial of Bagosora and Nsengiyumva on the ************* ***************2003.  And when was the next contact you had with the ICTR after that? 
A.	I was told that it was on the 6th of September 2005 that I had my next contact.  I think that you might like to speed up proceedings somewhat, because I don't think there is any point in coming back on this question.  I have explained it at length. 
Q.	Okay, we are almost finished with the proceedings as far as you and I are concerned.  After the          6th of September 2005, did you have any other contacts with the ICTR before you arrived in Arusha in June to testify at this trial? 
A.	I don't quite understand what you mean.  I made no other statements apart from the ones that I have already mentioned.  I did not give any further statement that I might have given, say, to an investigator or a Prosecutor. 
Q.	Did you have any contact with any investigators who asked to you confirm your earlier statements? 
A.	Yes, I did.  An investigator came to see me, if my memory is correct, that was on the                         *********************2005. 
Q.	Do you remember the name of that investigator? 
A.	I think that it is, in fact, the Prosecutor, Mr. Lahaie, who is here in the Trial Chamber. 
Q.	And on the ****************2005, where did you meet him? 
A.	I went to meet him in Gisenyi.  But beforehand, he had sent a message to me to the effect that I was to meet him at Gisenyi; so I left my home in order to go and meet him. 
Q.	And during that occasion did you review any statements that you had previously made? 
A.	He asked me questions on the statements that I had made in the year 2003, and I responded to the best of my recollection.  I think that we met for between three to four hours, but I don't think I provided any new information as to the content of the previous statement. 
Q.	And did you discuss with him the fact that you had made a statement in September 2005, or anything about the contents of that statement? 
A.	Yes, he wanted to ask me questions as to whether I had anything to add to my previous statement.  I told him that I had met with investigators, and then we parted company. 
Q.	Did you know that Mr. Lahaie was -- was meeting with you in connection with the trial of Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	The person who came said that I was to meet with him, and that was the investigator by the name of Bagera (phonetic).  That investigator told me that I was to meet with a Prosecutor from Arusha before providing my statement.  In the statement given in the year 2003, there were certain elements that were of interests to the Prosecutor.  And I think that those are the elements that we have covered during my testimony here in Arusha. 
Q.	And did you tell Mr. Lahaie at any time on the ******************2005 that you had heard Mr. Nzirorera speak on the radio, RTLM? 
A.	He wanted to ask me questions on the subject of my previous statements, asking whether I had anything further to add.  In response, I said that when I met with investigators on the 26th and the         27th of February 2003, I noted that the investigators were specifically interested in the military trial.  And, apparently, they did not require any further explanation on the subject of other people.

So, he asked me whether I had anything to add to my statement.  And I said that I had already done so with other investigators and that if he wished to do so, he could refer to my statement.  When he then asked me which investigators I was referring to, I said that it was the investigators that I had met with.  And then he left.  
Q.	And did the subject of Mr. Nzirorera's interview on RTLM come up in your discussion with Mr. Lahaie on the********************? 
A.	We didn't talk about it.  I don't think we talked about that. 
Q.	Now, when you arrived in Arusha in June 2006, between the *******************2005 and the time you arrived in Arusha, did you have any other contact with investigators or prosecutors from the ICTR? 
A.	No, I didn't. 
Q.	And can you tell me when it was that you first met with either Mr. Lahaie or Mr. Webster here in Arusha? 
A.	I think I met him at the same occasion when you sought to meet with me; in this building, in fact.  And that is when I saw the two prosecutors that you have just mentioned. 
Q.	And after the meeting in which I was present, did you have an occasion to discuss your testimony with either Mr. Lahaie or Mr. Webster before you came to court? 
A.	No, apart from the fact that we raised a number of issues relevant to my testimony in the                  Trial Chamber, I think it was Mr. Lahaie who asked me questions on that subject. 
Q.	And before Mr. Lahaie asked you questions in the Trial Chamber, had you spoken with him here in Arusha? 
A.	Yes, I met with him, but we didn't talk for very long.  He just came to make sure that I had arrived, as it was he who had asked for me to provide testimony, and that is why I met with him. 
Q.	And did the subject of your statement of September 2005 come up at all in any discussions you have had with any members of the prosecution or investigators since you have arrived in Arusha? 
A.	Do you not have the written statement yourself?  I told you that I did not discuss the contents of that statement with anybody. 
Q.	Well, the problem is, Witness XBM, we don't have that written statement from September 2005.  In fact, we never heard of its existence before.  So, I'm trying to find out from you where -- with whom you may have discussed the fact that you made such a statement.  So, is it your testimony that you did not discuss with anyone from the Prosecution or investigators anything to do with that statement since you have arrived in Arusha? 
A.	I think we are backstepping once again.  Yesterday we addressed this issue lengthly.  And I told you that on the 6th of September, Investigators Hamo and Mengalle interviewed me in Gisenyi, and the interview was on the subject of the former leaders of the MRND party.  We talked about an RTLM interview that had been broadcast.  But nobody ever asked me any further questions on that subject.  So, when you have access to that statement, of course, then you can ask me questions on it. 
Q.	Okay, I appreciate that.  Can you tell us approximately how long you spoke with those two investigators on the 6th of September?
A.	I think we spent more than three hours together. 
Q.	And can you recall, approximately, how many pages the statement was that you signed on that occasion? 
A.	I think it was a statement of six pages in length, if my memory is correct. 
Q.	And do you have a copy of that statement? 
A.	I didn't require a copy.  Those who wanted my statement had obtained it.  As far as I was concerned, I did not require a copy. 
Q.	And do you have a copy of any video or audio tapes of any of the meetings that you attended in Rwanda that you have testified about in this trial? 
A.	I did have audio cassettes of the meetings that I had taken part in, but that was before 1994.  When I was placed in custody those cassettes were still available.  However, once I was released from prison, the cassettes were in bad condition as the house had gone up in flames.  With reference to the meetings that were held in Gisenyi, I did not have the means of obtaining such cassettes.  However, I do know that during the trial of Wellars Banzi, who was chairman of the MRND in Gisenyi, I think that the Tribunal asked him questions on that subject, and he tried to put that danger to one side.  However, during the trial, the Prosecutor used a video cassette, after which -- after that evidence had been produced, the chairman of the MRND was convicted to the death penalty.  So I think that if you were to ask the Tribunal in Gisenyi, that video cassette could be found, because I know that it does exist.

When the cassette was shown to me, we were prisoners at the time; we were in custody.  And I know that that cassette does, in fact, exist.  
Q.	And who showed you that cassette? 
A.	The judges showed me the cassette, but they had got it from the public prosecutor's office.  It was that office who had transmitted the cassette to the Bench in the tribunal. 
Q.	And did you testify at the trial of Banzi Wellars? 
A.	Banzi Wellars was not my neighbour.  He lived in Rubavu.  And there was a distance of 40 or              50 kilometres that separated us.  So, some people were testifying against him, but they were from you are Rubavu.  I did not testify against Wellars Banzi personally. 
Q.	And of which meeting were the cassettes that you were shown by the judges; was it the MRND meeting in October or November 1993? 
A.	There were no dates given as to when the meeting had been held.  He was accused of having incited people to kill others, and that is what the cassette was used for.  As I said, I cannot remember the date that the meeting was held and that the cassette actually covered. 
Q.	You told us of attending an MRND meeting in October or November of 1993 at which Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Karemera spoke.  Was that the meeting that was depicted on the cassette? 
A.	Not only one meeting was covered.  Sections of a meeting on different occasions were shown according to the meetings that had been organised in the town of Gisenyi.  So, they were concentrating, specifically, on elements that were damning for the Accused.  They showed, for example, where the Accused were sitting.  And that was why those cassettes -- or that specific cassette was used. 
Q.	And did you recognise the meeting that you had attended as being part of the cassette that you were watching when the judges showed it to you? 
A.	I think you might want to have a look at the cassette; otherwise, I might make the proceedings rather lengthy by providing you with explanations of what was contained on the cassette.  I think it is a waste of time since we do not have the cassette at our disposal.  I think you should seek it out. 
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, as a matter of fact I have sought out that cassette.  And my investigator was told that the prosecutor office in Gisenyi had lost the cassette, and it was no longer available, which is why I was interested in asking you what was depicted on the cassette.  So, can you just answer my question, whether or not when you watched the cassette you recognised any portions of the meeting that you had attended in October -- or November 1993? 
A.	As I have always testified before this Trial Chamber or before the tribunal at that time, I am telling the truth.  You heard yourself that the cassette did, indeed, exist.  Maybe you were refused access to it because you were a member of the Defence team.  But if somebody could go and ask for it again, then maybe it will be confirmed that it was lost.  But maybe you were refused access to it because people did not trust you. 
Q.	Actually, Witness XBM, we are thinking very much along the same lines.  And I'm trying to get enough information so that perhaps the Judges can make an official request for this cassette.  So, it would be helpful for us to know the answer to my question, which is whether or not you observed on the cassette, when you watched it, any portions of the meeting that you attended in October or November 1993 at Umuganda stadium? 
A.	Whatever the case may be, I am not going to explain the contents of that cassette at length.  I don't think I can satisfy your curiosity on that subject.  I think you need to look at it yourself; unless Banzi is no longer alive, but at the time when the cassette was shown to him he started shaking because it was a very convincing piece of evidence.  Now, testimony provided by people was not convincing, and that was why the cassette was used.  I know that the cassette exists.  

There has been no war in Rwanda in the interim for people to be able to say that that cassette was lost.  The cassette exists.  And I think that you should look for it because it will be -- it will speak mountains in comparison to me. 
Q.	Okay, I appreciate that, and I agree with you.  Every time we found a cassette in this case of what actually transpired at a meeting, then it has proven to be very valuable.  But I need to know from you whether or not when you viewed the cassette, it contained elements from the meeting that you had attended at Umuganda stadium in October or November 1993? 
A.	I told you that it was not -- not only one meeting was covered; a number of meetings were covered.  And people were incited to violence during those meetings; they were told to look for the Tutsi.  Tutsi were referred to as an enemy, and they used inflammatory language.  There was no message as such.  All of the meetings, especially in the year 1993 and 1994, were of the same ilk. 
Q.	Witness XBM, you still have not answered my question, that when you viewed the cassette it appeared to you that, at least part of the cassette, contained elements from the meeting that you attended in October or November 1993 at Umuganda stadium? 
A.	I did not notice anything in particular with reference to that meeting, but as I said, I did not address the meeting.  So people did not recognise me as such.  I think you should seek that cassette out and use it for your purposes.  I saw photographs.  I saw images on the cassette.  But I am not in a position to answer your question thirteen years later, because I cannot tell you what such-and-such a person was wearing.  I saw people.  I saw images.  And I heard speeches.  I think you should refer to the cassette yourself, and assess its value. 
Q.	Thank you, very much, Witness XBM.  I have come to the end of this portion of my cross-examination.  It may be that if we receive additional statements or materials, I will be questioning you again.  But I would like to thank you for answering all of my questions.

Mr. President, I have a request of Mr. Lahaie that I would like to make in the absence of this witness, whether it be at the time of the break, or at this time, I leave it to your discretion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You need to do it on the record?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, are you ready to commence?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President, I am. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will use the ten minutes for the commencement of your cross-examination.  And we will deal with Mr. Robinson's matter immediately after the break.  You may start.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Witness XBM.  My name is Chantel Hounkpatin, counsel for Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  We will spend some time together, addressing questions that I will be putting to you as I seek some clarifications from you.  Let me say up front that my cross-examination will not be as lengthy as that of my learned colleague who cross-examined you before me; particularly if you would be kind enough to provide direct answers to my questions.

Did you understand me, Witness?  
A.	Thank you.  Good morning, Madam.  I am ready to answer your questions and to provide you with the information available to me.  Now, whether my answers will be lengthy or brief will depend on the questions that will be put to me and on the line of questioning adopted by the person who will be putting the questions to me.  

I am ready.  Please proceed. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, the first series of questions that I will be putting to the witness will require proceeding in closed session.  This will be brief, Mr. President, given the nature of the questions and answered that I expect from the witness.  So, we need to proceed cautiously and protect his identity in that regard. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will go into closed session now.

(Pages 1 to 14 by Donna M. Lewis)




























(Court resumed at 1110H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to open session.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, returning to the statement of this witness, which he claims to have given to the Prosecution in September of 2005, during his testimony in the last session before the break he indicated that he had made Mr. Lahaie aware of the statement on the ********************2005.  And we're very concerned as to why the statement has not been disclosed to us.  And I would ask Mr. Lahaie whether or not this witness in fact made him aware that he had given a statement, particularly about these three Accused, and what steps Mr. Lahaie took to disclose that statement, and whether there's any prospect that that statement will be disclosed to us before this witness leaves Arusha.  Thank you.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Mr. President, let me explain what happened:  On the********************, I met Witness XBM in Gisenyi at Kivu Sun Hotel.  I met him for about two hours, 30 minutes.  At the very onset of our discussion, he mentioned that he had made a statement on the 6th of September 2005 to investigators of the ICTR.  Even before that meeting, we had searched for all available material relating to Witness XBM and we did not locate any such statement.  So I did not question the witness further on the purported statement for the simple reason that, when preparing witness, I did not go beyond the scope of the statement he had made.  And the witness did confirm that.  However, I took down the statement he had made to me, and we went on to conduct another search for the purported statement, and still were not able to locate it.  We have been searching for that statement, and we still haven't found it.  Now, whether that statement exists or whether it has disappeared is something that we cannot assert today.  So we have done what we can do, but we have not been able to locate that statement.  That is the explanation I can provide to my learned friend.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, since the witness had given the name of two investigators to whom he made the statement, I wonder if the Prosecution can inform us whether or not those investigators have been contacted since November of 2005 and whether they have such a statement in existence.  
MR. LAHAIE:
During our interview, no names of any investigators were mentioned, so we worked with the normal investigators and working through the names of the witness and the dates.  We were not able to locate any statement.  We have been in touch with the investigators by e-mail and we still haven't had any indication that the statement is available.  But were the statement to surface at any time, it will be promptly disclosed to our learned colleagues.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe I can add another comment or two, Your Honours, because I was looking into this matter during the break.  Since yesterday we have been making renewed efforts to try to trace the statement because we have more information about it now having had -- heard the witness's testimony than we did when Mr. Gilles Lahaie saw him in 2005.  The witness of his own volition mentioned the names of two investigators, that was not the case before.  Both investigators -- the names that he mentioned appear to me to be names of investigators that work for our team, Charles Mengalle, who is the team coordinator in Kigali, and Hamo -- a person he describes as Hamo is identified on one of his previous statements as Oumarou Hamo, so I assume it's the same person.  In his two statements that were disclosed, Mengalle is not mentioned, so it suggests to me that this witness actually did meet with Mengalle because there's no documentation that indicates that name independent of the witness's own recollection yesterday.  Apparently today is a holiday in Kigali, but in spite of that we've been in telephone contact with Charles Mengalle.  I have asked that he go into the office and do a renewed search.  This is something that we've already done before, but we are trying to cover all of the bases.  It is not in our ZY-find.  So it seems to me that the witness is talking about something that he recollects that there is some basis to suggest that his information is reliable to the extent that he's identified an investigator that's not documented in any of his other paperwork for his interviews with our office, but we don't have any trace of a signed witness statement.  We'll continue our search and as we -- if we find anything else or as new information develops, I'll inform the Court.  Quite frankly, it's not very likely that anything is going to materialise other than this witness's own testimony about this particular conversation with investigators and his recollection of his statement.  We simply have not located it.  

Mr. Robinson also explored in his cross-examination of the matter of a videotape in -- associated with the trial of Banzi Wellars in Rwanda.  We've made our own independent efforts to locate that videotape as well.  The last information that I have, and this is -- was confirmed as recently as 15 minutes ago, is that the videotape simply cannot be found in Rwanda.  We don't have access to it.  We've asked Rwandese authorities to make it available to us.  It was supposed to be in Gisenyi.  When we sent investigators to Gisenyi to find it, they were informed that it was sent to Kigali.  We have made requests for the videotape in Kigali.  Those requests have not been fruitful.  So, as well as Mr. Robinson, we share his concern to have the best evidence of what was actually said during this MRND meeting in October or November of 1993.  Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to find this videotape.  And I am given to understand that in the Bagosora trial similar efforts were made to locate this video because this witness also mentioned it in that context.  So with regard to the two matters that Mr. Robinson has been exploring, the latter part -- in the latter part of his cross-examination, we've made repeated efforts to follow-up on these things but, unfortunately, as of this time, those efforts are not fruitful.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, with respect to this statement, I, also like Mr. Webster, (inaudible) that such a statement is taken.  And the witness is very specific as to who he spoke to and how many.  And I would ask that the witness not return to Rwanda until the Prosecution has made an exhaustive search and given us an explanation for why that -- you know, some definitive word that the statement doesn't exist.  For example, the two people he named certainly can recall whether they took a written statement from the witness.  And if they did, they -- it should be located and faxed.  And if they didn't, then they can inform us of that.  But I don't think it would be prudent to send the witness back given that he gave a six-page statement about the three Accused.  I am sure that it would not be fair to not have cross-examination on such a statement were it to be produced.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your request is too broad, Mr. Robinson.  I think that it would be a matter of prudence for the Prosecutor to at least allow some time to elapse.  But I would like to make an order as broadly as the way you have framed it.  But, Mr. Lahaie, I presume that you would take a prudent course in this matter.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Well, my colleague's request, as you have just said, is quite wide in scope.  And I would suggest to you that were you to rule on that, the witness should not be sent back to Rwanda before the end of the session because, as my colleague asked, he should remain here until we have news of the statement.  Of course, we cannot promise you that we will have any news of that statement before the end of the session.  And I would not like us to keep the witness here until the next session that will only commence in October or even in November.  I think that would be abusing his family situation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we need to make an order for you to do that?  The -- what you've suggested seems very reasonable to me.  Would the -- you undertake an investigation?  
MR. LAHAIE:
I don't think we need to make an order on that issue.  I think that we can communicate with the WVSS and ask them to keep the witness at the disposal of the Chamber until Friday, the 14th of July.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be acceptable, I think, to the Court, Mr. Robinson.  

Mr. Registrar, could you bring back in the witness, please.  

For the benefit of the public, many of the witnesses have been the beneficiary of orders protecting their identity, including the witness who's about to give evidence now, and he's going to embark upon a sensitive area of testimony, the answers to which may reveal his identity.  We are going to go into closed session for a short time while those questions are asked.  As far as I understand, this session is not likely to be longer than 20 minutes but, for the next 20 minutes, the trial will be in closed session to which the public is excluded.  

We go back into closed session now for those reasons.

BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, could you please remind me of the date when multiparty politics was introduced in Rwanda?
A.	I think this will be an approximation.  I think that on the 1st of July 1991 the various political parties were authorised -- were allowed to operate throughout the country.  
Q.	You told the Trial Chamber that in 1991, at the time of multiparty politics, you chose to become a member of the MDR party.  How and why did you choose that party?
A.	I chose that party because of my business.  I was in the habit of working with people native of Butare and Kigali and also from Gitarama.  And when we were waiting for***************************************** *************, we would lead discussions on the subject of multiparty politics.  And over time I decided to join the MDR party, that my interlocutors or the other people I discussed with were also a member of.  
Q.	What were the aims and objectives of the MDR party that convinced you in particular?  Could you give us a brief idea?
A.	The truth be told, the MDR was not a new party as such on the Rwandan political scene.  Before 1973, this party was already in existence when President Habyarimana overthrew President Kayibanda, so that meant that the MDR party was well -- was in existence well before that, and that was why the party had become independent -- the country had become independent.  So I think it was a good idea to become a member of that party because we had to take into account the fact that that party had enabled the country to become independent.  
Q.	Was it because the party enabled the country to become independent that you were convinced that that was the party to join?
A.	That is one of the most salient points, but I would also say that the people I talked to convinced me that I should join that party by underlining the fact or underlining the strong points of that party and saying also that it wasn't a normal situation for a country to be governed by one sole party, notably the MRND, and that that was why the situation should change. 
Q.	What exactly did you suffer under the MRND regime?
A.	I'm talking for myself here.  I think other people will talk about their own experience.  But what I did not appreciate under the MRND regime was the educational situation.  Those people who managed to go to secondary school were a scarcity amongst the ordinary population.  You had to have contacts or be a member of a close or distant family with a person of authority in order to have access to secondary school education.  In brief, at the time, it was not really competence that was a criteria for admission to secondary school.  You had to have contacts or links with such-and-such, an authority, in order to gain access to secondary education.  And that was one of the things amongst many that I did not appreciate.  
Q.	And the MDR supporters who talked to you, did they provide you with any guarantee that education would, from then on, be open to all, for example?
A.	Yes.  They did provide me with a guarantee on that subject, but it was not only a guarantee because it came true under multiparty politics because I remember that the minister of education, primary and secondary school, that ministry was handed over to the MDR party. 
Q.	So that ministry was handed over to the MDR party from what date to what date?
A.	Around the months of April, May 1992.  I know that when the new government was set up, comprising all the political parties, I believe that the MDR was granted three ministries, notably the ministry for primary and secondary education.  As a result, there were four posts that were handed over to the MDR party under the new government. 
Q.	And did you know that there was any immediate change?
A.	Yes, I did, Madam, because if we consider this:  The example of a school that had, say, 50 students in the final year, we noted that when the MDR took over that ministry a larger number of students were admitted to secondary education, 20 or 30 more, whereas previously there had been three, four or six students per school, so that was indeed an improvement, a marked improvement. 
Q.	You said that in your commune you were*******************************.  Could you describe to me the process that led to you becoming******************************?  Were you elected, or were you nominated? 
A.	As I explained to you, I continued having discussions with my clientele whilst I was*********************.  And those clients came from Gitarama and Kigali préfectures.  And when I realised precisely what the aims and objectives of the MDR party were, I asked them what exactly I needed to do in order to become a member, specifically within my secteur.  I asked them where I could obtain a membership card within the secteur, an MDR membership card, that is.  

They then asked me to approach the person who was the leader of the MDR party in Gisenyi préfecture.  There were 10 people -- 10 of us when we went -- when we went to meet that person.  And on that occasion, he handed over membership cards to us.  And that person************************** ***********************************************.  And that is how I came to be**********************************.  
Q.	Witness, I'm going to ask you to perform an exercise that you're now used to.  You say that there were 10 of you who went to see the leader of the MDR party with a view to becoming members.  I would like you to tell me or give me the names of those 10 people, please.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
No.  Registry - or, the registrar, please, with your leave, Mr. President, could you please give the witness a sheet of paper with a view to writing down the names of those people who were also candidates and who had gone to see the leader of the MDR party.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	And I would also ask you to provide on that sheet of paper the name of the person, i.e. the leader of the MDR party whom you went to see.
A.	I have finished.  
Q.	Witness, whilst we are waiting to see the list that you've just drafted, you said that you had joined the MDR party, but at what date, during which month?
A.	I do not remember the month, but it was in the year 1991.  And it is very likely that I did not give the name of the leader of the MDR party in Gisenyi at the time, but I can tell you that it was Aloys Nzabonimba, who is the elder brother of Lizinde, Lizinde Théoneste.  
Q.	Could you please spell the name that you just gave, that is, the name of Aloys Nzabonimba.
A.	Very well.  N-Z-A-B-O-N-I-M-B-A.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like to give a number to the exhibit that has just been drafted.  I have now forgotten the last figure -- or, K figure that I provided.  I think it is D. NG -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We can't hear counsel because she's walking away from her microphone.  D. NG21, I believe I heard. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, can you assist?  
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour.  The next number is D. NG21. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG21 admitted, under seal) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, Witness, let us come back to your joining the party.  You say that you don't remember the month, whether it was July, August, or September, or October, or November of the year 1991, but you tell us that as ************you brought 400 people to be members of the party.  Now, how did you go about doing that?  And how long did it take you to enroll so many people into the fold of the party?
A.	Thank you, for that question.  It was a very easy task for me to enroll so many people to the party.  Now, I think that that is what caused me quite a number of problems, in fact.  From that moment on, those people who were *****************************quickly joined the party.  And they thought that in one way or another they would benefit from that political membership in view of the fact that we had created quite close relations within the context of********************.  
Q.	And as*************************************, did you issue membership cards which allowed you to count 400 people?
A.	That's right.  As I explained to Counsel Robinson, it was in that context that I gave the figure of 400 members that I had enrolled in the party.  *******************, in fact, who issued the membership cards.  
Q.	According to you, those 400 people, did they join the party by conviction or because of personal interest?
A.	We had not yet organised public meetings.  And whatever the case may be, they felt that they would benefit from that membership, that political membership in one way or another because the MRND had chosen to privilege some people.  And there was another part of the population that had been put to one side by the MRND party.  They thought, therefore, that they would benefit -- that they would benefit under the MDR party.  
Q.	During this membership campaign, did you assemble the new members?  How exactly did you go about it? 
A.	In Rwanda we go to bars on a regular basis.  And when talking about party politics, there was the subject of multiparty politics.  And whenever people would cross paths in the street, they would talk about it.  It wasn't difficult, but as I explained, we had not at that time yet organised public meetings because had we done so we would probably had obtained or enrolled many members, but at the time people would talk about it in everyday conversation.  And that was how we obtained new members.  
Q.	I find it somewhat difficult to grasp.  The meetings that took place in bars -- well, for a party that has a membership of 400 individuals, I find that rather difficult to understand.  Even if no official meeting was convened, exactly how did the different members recognise each other?
A.	I would follow the activities closely.  It wasn't easy to obtain authorisation to convene a meeting.  And we couldn't hold a meeting in public saying that the party was, in fact, a competitor of the MRND party because, of course, it was the bastion of the MRND 100 per cent, so we could not convene a public meeting.  But people would circulate information, and they would obtain membership cards, but in rather covert circumstances because they could not do it very openly.  It was an MRND bastion after all.  
Q.	Yet the MDR did hold some rallies, didn't it?  Did you attend any of these MDR meetings or rallies?
A.	One of the meetings organised by the MDR, held in Gisenyi -- and that was in 1992, early in the year.  Most of those who attended that rally were persecuted by MRND supporters.  Only those who were able to access the stadium effectively took part in the stadium, but any other persons were disbursed and were not able to enter the stadium.  MDR rallies were properly organised only in 1993 and 1994.  At that time, the MDR was part of government.  But in my capacity as an ordinary Rwandan citizen, living in an area where the MRND was fully active, it was difficult to hold a rally or a meeting of an opposition party in Gisenyi.  
Q.	Did you attend the 1992 meeting, the rally you referred to which held in early 1992?  Did you attend that meeting, personally?
A.	I have just told you that it was not possible given the circumstances that obtained at the time.  And I might mention an example or two:  

In November 1991, the MDR wanted to hold a meeting at the market square at Mahoku, some 15 kilometres outside of Gisenyi town.  On that occasion, the population was opposed to that meeting and MDR supporters were stoned and the meeting could not hold.  In the 1992 meeting, some MDR members were able to access the stadium, but those who came from areas beyond Gisenyi, were not able to enter the stadium because MRND members had driven them away.  I was one of those who was not able to access the stadium.  
Q.	It has been your testimony that you were a victim of what was referred to as the Kubohoza.  When was that?  On what date were you a victim of that?
A.	It was on the 1st of February 1992.  
Q.	Was it before or after the MDR meeting which you could not attend?
A.	After the meeting.  
Q.	How did this happen, this activity which compelled you to join the CDR?  What actually happened, Witness?
A.	This gives me a good opportunity to explain what happened.  This action was undertaken in the presence of some 200 persons who had joined the MDR party.  One could have easily lost one's life, but thank God it did not happen.  MRND and CDR officials went to the military position in the neighbourhood and explained to the soldiers that there were accomplices of the Inkotanyi who were propagating Inkotanyi propaganda, and that the Inkotanyi were about to attack through -- or, thanks to that individual.  

I was subsequently found at my place of business and, of course, at that time I was*******************.  So what I was saying is that MRND and CDR supporters went to the military position and said that there was someone who was collaborating with the Inkotanyi and propagating Inkotanyi propaganda openly.  They provided the Inkotanyi with the various coordinates to facilitate an attack by the Inkotanyi.  So one day, people came and found me at my place of business where I was**************************** *****************************.  They had commandeered a lorry which was parked at Kiyira cya Myuga.  I was mistreated and beaten up along with others who had received membership cards.  
Q.	Witness, you said that this incident occurred in the presence of some 200 persons, that is, 200 members on the 1st of February 1992.  Why were 200 MDR members gathered on that day, on that specific day?  Why were they assembled?
A.	This action did not occur in my native secteur.  The 200 people I was referring to were not MDR members; they were just ordinary inhabitants.  You may even want to investigate further and you will find that this incident occurred in the presence of several persons, some five to six kilometres away from my home.  
Q.	I am just checking your previous testimony.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If counsel would speak into the microphone, Mr. President, it would facilitate the interpreters.  Thank you. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Your testimony was that you give me a good opportunity to explain what happened during this activity which -- or, this incident which occurred in the presence of some 200 persons who had gathered to join the MDR party.  That was your testimony, wasn't it, Witness?  And you referred to the MDR, isn't that correct?  And that is why I was surprised that this incident occurred before the MDR members.  And it was your previous testimony that these MDR members had not had an opportunity to meet.  Can you explain that?
A.	Well, I think I do recall what I said.  Maybe it was not well understood.  As far as I am concerned, I do remember what I said.  Your question was the following:  "How did the Kubohoza incident occur?"  And it is in answer to that question that I said that you had provided me an opportunity to explain the incident which occurred in the presence of 200 persons, and that among those 200 persons were people who were members of -- or, who held membership cards.  I did not say that all those 200 persons were members of the MDR.  So what I am -- said was that among those 200 persons, some of them were holders of MDR membership cards.  
Q.	What was the reaction of the MDR official whom you had contacted in order to become a member of that party when he found out that you had been a victim of that incident?
A.	Whatever the case may be, we did not have an opportunity to provide information on the manner in which we were beaten up.  What I recall is that some effort was made to provide us some treatment; but I know that I was told that the préfectural leader had been informed of the incident and that he had accordingly reported to the national leadership of the party.  So following that incident, there were radio announcements at the national level which mentioned incidents of persecution of opposition party members by the MRND and CDR members.  That is the answer I can provide in terms of the reaction. 
Q.	Are you saying that there was a radio announcement relating to that incident which you were a victim of?  Do you recall the date of that announcement?
A.	No, I do not remember the date of the announcement.  I do not remember the date.  And I would like to be properly understood; I do remember, however, the period at which the incident occurred.  And I know that these acts that were perpetrated here and there across the country in 1992 were condemned by officers.  And I do not know the specific date.  But all of this happened in 1992.  And I think it was two weeks after the incident that announcements were carried over radio.  
Q.	Witness XBM, I put it to you that Kubohoza, which you have described to us as being an MRND practice, was rather a practice that was widespread within the MDR; what is your answer to that?
A.	What I can say is that, when you refer to it as being an MDR practice -- all I can say is that with the advent of multiparty politics and with the registration of various parties, Kubohoza -- Kubohoza became a recurring practice which created disorder within the communities, and compelled members to switch from one party to another.  And it all depended on the strength of any given party in any specific region.  

So, initially, there were the youth wings that were set up.  And it was in 1992 that the Interahamwe were set up, but the Interahamwe did not behave in the same manner as other political parties.  They didn't act lightly, and people were at risk of losing their lives in the course of any such activities or incidents.  And this was contrary to the conduct of other political parties.  
Q.	Witness, your explanation does not tally with what was referred to as the Kubohoza.  They were not the Interahamwe, whereas you talked of the CDR.  Furthermore, you never mentioned, throughout your statement, that you had been attacked by the Interahamwe who had compelled you to join the CDR.  The explanations you are providing today, therefore, do not tally.  And I want to say -- I put it to you again that the Kubohoza, as a practice, was not only carried out by the MRND.  What do you say to that?
A.	Let me explain, Counsel.  The CDR was a party that was borne not out of its own initiatives or specific objectives; it was simply an offshoot of the MRND.  So there was no distinction, practically speaking, between the CDR and the MRND.  These parties were complimentary, whether it be at the grassroots level or at the national level.  

I do acknowledge that the Kubohoza was also carried out by the MDR in other préfectures, however I did not see that happening in Gisenyi.  The first MRND chairman was called Gréogoire Kayibanda from Gitarama.  And we heard mention of Kubohoza in Gitarama where several militants having rejected the MRND, and the same happened in Nduga préfecture in the -- to the south of Rwanda.  But as to -- as to the north of Rwanda goes, it is the MRND which was the dominant party.  And that is why people who wanted to join other parties could only do so secretly while waiting for the proper time when they would be strong enough.  And when members of the MRND realised that someone had changed their position, of course, they reacted.  And that is the explanation that I can provide to your question.  
Q.	When you were being cross-examined, you also testified that having been obliged, or compelled to join the CDR, you, however, continued to be an MDR member, supporter.  How did you work that out, Witness, during that time?  What were the activities that you undertook for the MDR at that time?  Could you please describe them?
A.	If you had understood me properly, I believe that you would have noticed that I already provided an answer to that question.  Yes, I was, indeed, compelled to join the CDR.  But I had the MDR in - or, should I say on my heart.  It is true that I no longer issued membership cards, but my heart was still with the MDR.  I continued to have discussions with several people.  And we would talk about the MDR in secret, not publicly because I did not want to attract any unnecessary problems.  
Q.	What became of your 400 members?
A.	They too continued to be members of the MRND, but not openly.  Every now and then we met in some hidden location and talked about the party.  But we could not engage in any open demonstrations or events because the other parties were not entitled to do so.  
Q.	So, as a matter of fact, it is not only your heart that was with the MRN -- with the MDR given that you were able to meet with members of your party?
A.	Yes, we met and we talked secretly about our party.  We could not express ourselves openly or publicly as the MRND would do, singing its slogans here and there.  
Q.	Now, Witness, let us be a little more specific.  You joined the MDR, and so far I don't know at what date you joined the MDR, but you say it was in the second half of 1991.  And then you were compelled to join the CDR in February '92.  Fair and good.  Let us say that six months have already gone by.  And let us attempt to put a specific date to what you were able to do; that is, the date on which you joined the MDR so that we may be able to establish how long you were committed to the party, and then determine how you continued to belong and participate in MDR activities, whereas you had been compelled to join the CDR.  

Witness, can you please clarify these issues for me?  Give me the dates of those meetings which you were able to hold in secret with MDR members - or, supporters after you had been compelled to join the CDR.
A.	Let me start from the end:  We met in secret.  And when I say "secret" I hope that you will not seek to obtain evidence from me, because I have already said that these were secret meetings.  

Now, as far as leaving the party to join another, I believe that I have already explained this matter to Robinson, particularly in respect of the use of the various membership cards.  If one left Gitarama to go to Gisenyi, knowing that the MRND was predominant in Gisenyi, they would use their MRND card.  And if you were travelling the other way round, that is from Gisenyi to Gitarama, and you knew that it was the MDR party that was predominant, then one would use the MDR party card.  That is what all Rwandans did at the time.  But that did not mean that people did not belong to their political party by conviction.  I had provided that explanation.  I hope, Madam, that you understood me.  
Q.	Now, Witness, I'm concerned about the secret meetings which you had with MDR militants or members after you had been compelled to join the CDR.  I would like to know the dates at which those meetings took place?
A.	If I understand you then, you would seem to be saying that we actually held meetings.  No.  What happened was that our paths crossed, people would meet maybe at nine o'clock in the morning, at eleven o'clock, and they would talk about party activities.  So there was really no need of assembling people in a meeting to talk party politics.  Yet we were able to meet here and there and talk about what the national leaders were discussing in terms of strategies for implanting the party -- the MDR to work as a party.  

Our national leaders were more intelligent than we were, and when we met one-on-one, we may have been able to discuss, saying, for example, that we had heard a programme over radio and had found out what was being discussed by our leaders. So we knew that the time for change was coming and that we would be able to engage in our political activities without difficulty.  
Q.	Now, Witness, one last question before the break, I notice that it is time -- it is almost time -- it is, indeed, time for the break, so -- but let me put it to you that members of the CDR compelled you to join them because they hoped that you were going to help them recruit members.  What activities did you undertake within the CDR in that connection?
A.	CDR members, I believe, were monitoring the situation closely.  I shared a beer or two with some of them in various drinking places.  And while we shared a drink we listened to each other to find out the side to which people belonged.  I had people who had agreed with my line of conduct and who were ready to defend me if ever I came under some threat.  So as you can see, I was under threat.  My situation was not very good, so what I did was to stop and continue to conduct campaigns - or, rather, abstain from campaigning for the MDR which was said to be the party of the Inyenzi, the party of the Inkotanyi.  So what I did was to stop the membership drive.  And it was very easy to convince those who had been won over to the MDR to go back or to remain within the MRND.  I hope that I've answered your question.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is time for lunch now.  We will take our lunch break now. 
(Court recessed at 1234H)
(Pages 23 to 31 by Roxane Meena)























(Court resumed at 1418H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may continue.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I could address the Court for a moment.  We have some additional information about the statement in question.  As it turns out, we have located the statement.  We have it as an electronic text, unsigned, which was disclosed to the three Defence teams around five minutes ago.  

As it turns out, the investigator, Charles Mengalle, who the witness had mentioned in his testimony yesterday, explains that he actually sent the statement by pouch to Arusha sometime in September of 2005.  It was addressed to me as the STA.  I don't recall ever receiving it, and I've gone back through my correspondence file and through my electronic inbox in the Lotus Notes which tracks things that come to me from Kigali, and I don't find any trace of it.  But we do actually have the statement now, and I've made it available to the Defence.  

We apologise for that, it's an oversight, but we had looked for this statement in the past in our ZyFIND evidence database.  It was never there, because it usually gets into ZyFIND after it passes through my hands here in Arusha.  And that didn't happen or I have no recollection of it; I can't really say what the situation was.  But it would have come during the week this case opened, and I have no recollection of receiving this information.  

But it's here, and the Defence have a copy, and as soon as we can put it into our evidence database we will generate a copy with ERN numbers on it and we will make a formal disclosure.  But the substance of the statement is currently with them.  So I'm sorry, but that's an unfortunate oversight.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I haven't looked at the statement yet, but it's in French, and it will take us some time to -- for me to have it translated into English, and then we will have to decide, based on the contents, what should be the ramifications of how the statement would be used.  So I could maybe let you know tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sure.  

Ms. Diagne, do I need to recognise you?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  It is on the same subject, to confirm that indeed a few minutes ago we have -- we did receive the statement.  It is also in French.  From time to time I see mention of my client's name.  Naturally I have not had time to go through the document.  I just wanted to make you aware of this so that you could bear it in mind.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, the circumstances of this disclosure are quite obvious, and we will -- if you need to make any applications, we will hear them when you are ready to do so.  

In the meantime, the Prosecutor will retain the witness in Arusha until the end of the trial session, or until we are able to determine what steps, if any, need to be taken with regard to the statement.  But I think in the meantime his cross-examination can continue, and we will deal with any remedial issues, if necessary, in due course.  

Mr. Witness, I see you have been listening to what has been going on.  The position is that the statement you made in 2005 has been recovered now, and it may be that, depending on the contents of that statement, that you may need to be asked some questions about it.  But because the document has only come to the hands of the lawyers within the last few minutes, they don't know as yet whether they need to ask you any further questions.  And so we will address that question in due course.  In the meantime, your cross-examination will continue on the information which is before the Trial Chamber.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Regarding the statement, whether -- which I made on the 6th of September 2005, indeed I made the statement, and I am prepared to answer any questions relating to it. 

But, Mr. President, I have a problem that I would like to put to you.  As you can see, I did not come here as an employee.  I have already told you about my concerns about my family.  I arrived here on the 15th of June; today is the 4th of July.  I told you I am***********, and that I must provide for my family.  Therefore -- now I see you are going to keep me away from my family for a long time, and I will suffer as a result.  Therefore, I would like to ask for your assistance.  

I was questioned by the Prosecutor, cross-examined, so I would like to ask you to give me some time to go and see what has become of my family, and if you need me, you will again organise my return to Arusha.  If there is no telephone -- here there is no telephone that I can use to call my family, so that I am in the dark about their situation.  

That is what I wanted to submit to you, Mr. President.
  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, your position is very clearly understood.  Maybe what I should have indicated is that it is likely that by tomorrow morning we will be in a position to finally address your position on this matter.  There is no guarantee that there will be need to ask you further questions.  But we will have an opportunity to determine that tomorrow morning, and it may very well be that there is little, if any, additional inconvenience to which you will be put.  But we have taken into account what you have said, and whatever decision we take will include consideration of your position.  

Now, I think we should continue with your cross-examination at this time.  

Ms. Hounkpatin.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness XBM, late in the morning, a while ago, you told us that you had been forced to join the CDR on the 1st of February 1992.  Can you confirm this to me?  
A.	Yes, I can. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I put it to you that the CDR was only set up on the 23rd of March 1992; statutes of the party were filed on that same date.  The party president, Martin Bucyana, made a speech on the 23rd of March 1992, and the first rally gathering supporters and partisans -- party members was held on the 23rd of March 1992.  Can you explain to me -- or, rather, can you account for the fact that on the 1st of February 1992 you were given a CDR party membership card?  
A.	You say the CDR party did not exist at that time.  Perhaps when you cite the 23rd of March 1992, you mean the date at which the party was accredited.  But as far as I'm concerned, the CDR party existed already before its official launching.  The party was conducting a campaign, had an office, and was working hand in hand with the MRND.  It was therefore a party already in existence prior to its accreditation.  In 1992, I am well aware that it was in that year that the CDR was created, but I am not in a position to give the exact date of its accreditation.  

The CDR was a party that only accepted full-blooded Hutus.  But it was pointed out they did not hate the Tutsis as such, that the problem they had with the Tutsis was as a result of the latter's arrogance.  The message was channelled in the songs of the party.  So, I wonder how you can claim that the CDR did not exist prior to the 23rd of March 1992, whereas it was collaborating with the MRND even before that date.  I do not understand why you came -- how you can claim that the party could have been created on a particular date and organise a rally on that very day.  The party already existed. 
Q.	The contradiction, Witness, or discrepancy, results from your statement, almost two months before the party came into existence, that you had been the victim of violence, violent acts by members of that party.  On the 23rd of March 1992, the date you claim you were targeted, that party did not exist.  
A.	To answer your question, I think if you go on basing yourself on the documents available to you, we will not understand each other.  I would rather you went to Rwanda to enquire about the circumstances of the party's creation.  I think that the information that will be provided to you will help you to understand me.  However, I am saying the CDR existed, and I continue to insist that the CDR existed prior to the date you mentioned.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, now let us come to the events of the 6th of April 1994.  Can you tell me where you were on the 6th of April 1994?  At your home, or outside your home?  
A.	When you say I was outside, do you mean that I was abroad, or outside my home?  
Q.	Quite simply, possibly outside your home, or house.  
A.	I was at my house.  
Q.	When exactly were you told of the attack on President Habyarimana?  
A.	I thought I answered that question when Mr. Robinson asked me a question about the morning after.  So you know that people can wake up very early in the morning; it depends on what activities they have.  So, I woke up very early in the morning and I was told that President Habyarimana had been killed.  The person who gave me that information was in a hurry.  I was not able to ask him further questions about it.  Then I listened to RFI, and I heard the news.  Thereafter communiqués were put out on Radio Rwanda to the effect that the president of the Republic had died.  Those are the circumstances under which I learned the news. 
Q.	So following the news you heard from someone -- was it a neighbour, someone who lived in the same house with you? 
A.	No, it was not a neighbour.  It is a person I came across on the way, but we were not together when he gave me the news.  I heard him speaking to someone else; I was still in my house.  
Q.	I do not quite understand.  You were in your house, that person was giving a third person the news, but he was not in your house, and yet you heard him?  Is that what I am to understand?  
A.	Yes, that is what happened, as a matter of fact.  
Q.	Where was that person?  
A.	I have told you repeatedly my house is close to the road, about four metres away.  So, when people talk, passersby, it is easy to hear what they say, unless you order me not to listen to what passersby are saying.  But the fact is when someone speaks, somebody walking along the road, it is possible to hear what they are saying.  
Q.	Can you tell me what time, approximately, you overheard that conversation on the road?  
A.	It was about 5:30.  
Q.	You said a policeman came to your house to summon you to a meeting.  At what time did the policeman arrive?  
A.	Once again, I think we're going back in time.  That policeman's name is Kabalisa, and he arrived at my house at about 8 a.m. 
Q.	Did he hand over written convocation, or a summons, or was it verbal?  
A.	The invitation was verbal.  There was no document.  If a summons was to be sent to me, I don't think that policeman would have brought it to me.  Someone else would have been approached to bring me the summons, or invitation.  
Q.	Why not the policeman?  
A.	I think that this cannot be a problem.  It is a notion that it would not have been the policeman to bring the message to me if the summons had been in writing.  
Q.	And why is it this policeman whose name you have remembered, Kabalisa? 
A.	You clearly understand, madam, I did not select him.  I cannot tell you why he was selected to fetch me.  I just know he came to give me a message, and he gave it to me.  So, only those who sent him can tell you why they selected him.  
Q.	Did the policeman transmit the same message to other persons in the commune?  
A.	Whatever the case, I know the commune had enough policemen, and on that occasion I did not ask him whether he had given the same message to other people.  All I did was comply with the orders issued and respond to the invitation that was given to me.  
Q.	Could you please tell the Trial Chamber what the exact terms used -- were used by the policeman in order to invite you to that meeting?  
A.	Once again, I think that this is going to slow down proceedings once again, and now you seem to be doing it on purpose.  I think that I have explained this point sufficiently; it took me an entire week to do so.  I remember now, I have already explained to you what that policeman said to me.  He quite simply told me that a meeting was organised at the communal office, and that I was invited to attend.  He told me that it was a message that had been given to him by somebody else, and that he was to transmit it to me.  
Q.	Witness, I can see that we have to revisit the manner in which you received that invitation, and the way in which somebody had transmitted that invitation to somebody else to transmit to you.  But it was an official meeting, and that is why I am asking you to tell us precisely through what chain of messengers that invitation came to come into your possession.  Because you're giving a partial response every time.  Why don't you give a full response in one go. 
A.	If I give you piecemeal responses, I think it's just an impression you're under.  But I have always tried to give you a complete answer.  I told you that the policeman came to me, told me that he had been given a message to the effect that a meeting was going to be held.  He told me that I was invited to that meeting, and I went with him.  We then went to the place where the meeting was going to be held.  I see that you are asking me questions that I am not in a position to answer.  Those are the type of questions that you need to put to that policeman, specifically, or to the person who'd sent him.  

I think that you're just trying to keep me here for as long as possible because you seem to have a lot of time to play with, but I am wasting time here.  I think I have already explained this point, and I can see that you are inviting me to provide you with the explanation that that policeman or the person who sent him could provide you with.  So, Madam Counsel, I think that you are causing me a headache here.  
Q.	Witness, just simply answer my questions, and then you will not be under the impression that I am causing you a headache, or brainstorming you (sic), and we will move forward.  I have nearly finished with my cross-examination, and it is in fact your time-consuming responses that are wasting our time.  

Now, the policeman who came to fetch you, did he ask you to follow him immediately, or did he give you a time to come to the meeting under your own steam?  
A.	When he came, he told me that I was to go with him.  I would like to specify that my -- the area in which I live is located very close to the frontier.  So he could not carry on down the road; he had, in fact, to turn around and go back the way he had come.  And that's how I came to follow him, because he could not go down the road.  Maybe you were under the impression that it was a summons, and that I was placed -- or, I was arrested in some manner.  No, it was merely an invitation to a meeting to which I was to attend.  
Q.	So, you followed the policeman who came to your home.  Did you go in the same vehicle as him?  
A.	No, he was not in a vehicle.  We left on foot.  
Q.	So, you both left at the same time from your home, did you?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, if I have been concentrating on this specific point, it is because three days ago you answered by saying that you had left your home after the policeman, and not at the same time as him.  So, what are we to retain from your testimony?  That you left at the same time as him, or at a later stage?  
A.	I have just specified that the policeman could not carry on and go anywhere else, because my secteur and the area in which I was living was very close to the border.  He had not brought an arrest warrant with him; it was merely an invitation.  So, are you asking me whether we got to the communal office at the same time?  Well, I think there are two ways with which to accompany somebody.  You can leave a place at the same time, accompany that person, and when, for example, he stops to talk to somebody, you can carry on.  But that's not the process that I followed.  I had been invited to a meeting; we left my home at the same time, but I also followed him.  
Q.	So, Witness, you received this invitation as what, as a civilian, as a member of the MDR, or as **********************?
A.	Once again I think you are trying to create problems for me by asking me such a question.  I think I explained yesterday, or the day before, even, I told you that there were 13 secteurs in our commune.  When I got to the communal office, I found 65 (sic) people.  So, that means that we were 66 (sic) people there.  There were political party leaders, as well as other people in which we had trust and who could give ideas.  So, that was the kind of person who had been invited to that meeting.  I think I've explained everything to you.  I think I've given you the specific reasons behind my being invited to that meeting.  People just wanted to keep me informed of the situation prevailing at that time, and what people intended to do. 
Q.	So you, you say that 66 or 70 people were present.  Were they only men, or was there a mixture of men and women at that meeting? 
A.	I said that there were 66 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
76 -- correction from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
THE WITNESS: 
As far as the leaders of political parties is concerned, well, there were no women at the head of political parties within my commune.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	So, it was a meeting involving political party leaders.  And all those people present at the meeting were notably men who had a function within a political party.  
A.	I told you that there were leaders of political parties present, but there were also other people with whom -- whom we trusted, and who could provide ideas and who could also assign duties and functions for the future.  
Q.	Who were those people, and what kind of posts, or positions, did people want to appoint them to?  
A.	I was one of them because I had been forced to leave the MDR party, and every time I was compelled to go and take part in their rallies and political meetings, and -- they thought I would remain active in sensitisation activities, as I had already been in the MDR.  So, I think I was one of the people to whom they wanted to award a position, or post.  
Q.	On the 7th of April, you were invited to a meeting at which you might have been appointed to a position whereby you could sensitise the population; is that correct? 
A.	I've already explained to you -- if not to you, but to your colleague, but I think you were present and must have followed all that I said.  I told you that even before that date I had taken part in another CDR, or other CDR meetings.  After the meeting there was a reception, but I had not yet been told the reasons behind the invitations that I was receiving every time there was a meeting.  But I was under the impression that I was being prepared for something.  
Q.	But what was the purpose of the meeting of the 7th of April?  
A.	We were to be kept informed -- or, we were to be informed of the fact that the president of the Republic had died, and that he had been killed by the Tutsis, and that the political parties need to pull together in order to seek out the enemy, that is to say, the Tutsis, and kill them.  
Q.	Witness, during your examination-in-chief you told the Trial Chamber that a message was put across during the meeting.  Who was the message from, and what was the precise content of that message?  
A.	The message had been sent by Barayagwiza and was transmitted to us.  I had already started to talk to you about the content of the message, but I can see that you did not want to comprehend.  You want to put the same question to me 100 times over.  Maybe you have enough time in (sic) your hands.  
Q.	What exactly was the content of the message, Witness?  What you said earlier was not with reference to the message.  What you said was that people were going to talk to you.  I would like you now to tell us what the content of the message was.  
A.	But I had already started talking to you about it.  I see that you are now putting words in my mouth.  I see that you are trying to throw me off kilter, but you were not with me at the time.  So, the message was read out to us, as I was saying, and the political parties had to pull together in order to set up roadblocks.  And we were told that the president of the Republic had been killed by the Tutsis, and that all the Tutsis were considered to be the enemy, wherever they may be, in Kigali or elsewhere in the country, whether it be a baby or an old-aged pensioner.  So, we were told that all the Tutsis should be killed, they should be exterminated.  I see that you are trying to contradict me, but you were not there at the time.  
Q.	Did the message contain the term, explicitly -- that is, that the president was killed by the Tutsis?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what was the reaction of the recipients of the message? 
A.	People already knew it by the time they left their homes.  They knew that the president had been killed.  That is, the morning after on the 7th, between 7 and 8, almost everyone knew that the president was dead; some were afraid, did not know what to do.  But people -- you are asking how people took the message.  It depends on the individual.  Each person had his own interpretation so that I cannot tell you how everyone took the message. 
Q.	During the meeting, were there no exchanges between participants in attendance regarding the message, the way forward, in reaction -- in particular the mountain of roadblocks? 
A.	The participants exchanged ordinary opinions, and since most of the participants hailed from different secteurs -- there were, for example, people who were coming from other secteur.  So that there was in -- there was a problem in terms of how people would exchange, given that people would operate in their own secteurs, would be operating separately; therefore, it was not easy to exchange ideas as to the manner in which they would operate.  
Q.	Can you tell me if you were the only one who came from your secteur, or whether there were a number of you? 
A.	As I have told you, I left alone.  I did not go with anyone else.  I do not know if anyone else in the commune was invited like me.  
Q.	Of the 76 persons present, did you not recognise anyone from your secteur? 
A.	Of the 76 I think there was one person from my secteur, but I did not ask him how he had come to be at the meeting.  
Q.	Did you not speak to him at all? 
A.	I was answering the summons.  I had not gone to give the message. 
Q.	Did you not discuss implementation of the message? 
A.	I would like to tell you that we immediately went to Mudende.  Please do not ask me any more questions about this matter, because I have discussed it in detail.  
I would like to ask you, Madam Counsel, to ask me questions relating to things you did not understand.  I have family problems.  Therefore, I would like to ask you to do all in your power to ensure you ask me questions you have not understood.  If you ask me to narrate everything I said from 6 a.m. to evening, that would not be possible.  I have problems at home.  I am making -- or, suffering losses in my family so that I do not have much time to spend here.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I do not like to ask for your assistance; I am five minutes from the end of my cross-examination, and I would like you to ask the witness to help us in getting to the end of those five minutes without hindrances.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What was the specific question you would like the witness to answer now?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I wanted him to explain to me, to tell me if he did not have a discussion with anyone following the message he received with anyone from the group of 76 at the meeting.  And my second question, Mr. President, the person from his secteur with whom he was at the meeting, what was the nature of their exchanges?  These are the questions I would like him to deal with.  
THE WITNESS: 
Since we are going through the President, or, rather, since you are going through the President to ask me the question, then I will agree to answer it.  

Regarding the person from my secteur, I can tell you that immediately after the meeting, immediately after the message was read out to us, since the driver said they would go and give the message to other communes, we heard that there were problems at the university.  I went with the people I was with to the university.  We went through our representative -- or, we took different routes, but we all met up at the university.  Some went immediately to the university, whereas others spent some time away before getting there.  I went to the university, but I did not stay the night; since it was almost dark, I went home.  And so we were not able to discuss the manner in which we would implement the message we had received.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	What time did you get to the university and what time did you leave the university? 
A.	I arrived at the university on the 7th of April between 3:30 and 4 p.m.  And on the 8th of April, I left the university at 11.  So, I spent the night at******************************, and I think that I never mentioned discussing the matter with anyone. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will have to backtrack.  You left the university on the 7th of April or the 8th of April?  
A.	We went to the university -- rather, to the commune on the 7th at midday, a few minutes after midday.  The message was read to us; there was a discussion.  When the driver left to give a message to other communes, a messenger arrived and told us there was trouble at the university, that the students were avenging the president's death and targeting their colleagues.  The message arrived just as we were about to discuss the manner in which we would implement the message.  So, on the 7th of April I went to the university. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
"Mr. President," says the Kinyarwanda booth, "we have not understood the end of the witness' answer."  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 7th of April, therefore, you were about to discuss ways and means of implementing the message, and just as you were about to do that, another message came, and you left.  Have I understood you correctly? 
A.	Yes, the message was read to us, the driver told us he would give the message elsewhere, and as we were preparing to debate the message, we then learned the news.  It is not a messenger who came specifically for that, it's just that someone was passing by and told us that the Tutsi students at the university were attacking the Tutsi students -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the Kinyarwanda booth. 
THE WITNESS: 
-- because the president was dead.  It appears the Tutsi students were happy that the president of the Hutus had died, so we had to go and take stock of the situation.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	All those in attendance at the meeting, did they go to the university at that point?  
A.	As I was saying, when we heard about the event, we all went to the university to see what was happening.  When I got to the university, I spent the night nearby because my house was very far from the university.  
Q.	No instruction was given for you to head to the university?  
A.	No, we just heard about it and went.  However, it is on the 9th that we received instructions to go to the university.  You want us to revisit issues, and yet I think I had already said this.  
Q.	Witness, with respect to the second part of the message given to you on the 7th of April at the roadblocks -- or, regarding the roadblocks, how was the message implemented?  Did you set up roadblocks in the area?  
A.	Yes.  At every kilometre mark there was a roadblock.  In other secteur, perhaps spaced out in kilometre per kilometre, there were also roadblocks.  The situation could have changed.  
Q.	Were the roadblocks set up on the 7th of April following receipt of the message? 
A.	I told you I spent the night in Mudende on the 7th.  I did not see any roadblocks where the students were, but when I went home on the 8th, at that point I noticed roadblocks.  Can you see that we are wasting time?  We would have -- or, rather, we could have concluded all this.  I wonder if we're moving forward or backwards. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the roadblocks you referred to were set up after the 7th of April 1994.  Did they not exist before that date? 
A.	There were roadblocks, but they were not manned in a serious manner.  However, on the 7th, or by the 7th, it was noticed that those manning the roadblocks were very fierce, were much more severe in the way they managed the roadblock. 
Q.	Were you not personally at the roadblocks conducting checks? 
A.	No, I never worked at the roadblocks, though I did pass by the roadblocks.  And I would see how people suspected of being Tutsis were checked, and how Tutsis were treated when they arrived at roadblocks.  
Q.	Witness, you had no problems crossing the roadblocks, did you? 
A.	I had no problems. 
Q.	Do you know the people who were at the roadblocks? 
A.	I was dispatching them to the roadblocks.  Maybe I can give you the name of the person who would dispatch them to the roadblocks, but as far as I'm concerned, I did not come here to give you names of persons manning roadblocks.  I think you are wasting precious time.  I don't understand why you're asking me names of members of the public who worked at the roadblocks.  Ask anyone and you will be told that throughout the country there were roadblocks. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I think I have gone through all the questions I wanted to put to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  

Ms. Diagne, do you have any idea how long your cross-examination will take?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I am sorry to have to tell you that I was not intending to cross-examine the witness, simply because all questions that related to me were covered by my colleagues, Robinson and Hounkpatin.  Therefore, I do not think it is necessary to go over all that the witness has said.  I will refrain from making certain comments on this witness' demeanour, and I therefore choose not to cross-examine him.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Ms. Diagne.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I just wanted to tell you of our wish to reserve our right to comment on disclosures that we received early at the start of the session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's understood, and I will hear you on that tomorrow morning.  I won't expect you to comment on that tomorrow afternoon.
  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Therefore, Mr. President, there is no point in telling you about my reservation as expressed early this afternoon following disclosure of the information by the Prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's also understood.  

Mr. Lahaie, I think that it would be appropriate for you to conduct your re-examination now.  If it is necessary to have further cross-examination, then we will address that if application is made.  It's now 3:30, and -- 

Do you have a view on this?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour, if I may.  Actually, I would like to request that we adjourn the proceedings for the day and that we pick up tomorrow morning, actually.  This new disclosure -- this new disclosure has taken us all by surprise.  Clearly we weren't expecting this.  I would -- I think it would be much more appropriate to give the Defence an opportunity to read through it and to cross-examine further if they need to.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Am I hearing you properly, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Am I hearing you properly?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think so.  We would like to have clean and orderly proceedings, Your Honour.  We think it would be in the interests of justice to complete the cross-examination before we go into the redirect.  We don't expect to be very lengthy in our redirect.  Our concern is that we finish the testimony of AWB before next Friday, and I think we can do that if we start his testimony on Thursday morning.  So we would have more than enough time tomorrow, I think, depending on the length of any consequential cross-examination from Mr. Lahaie, to finish his redirect, and I'm assuming that the cross-examination on this additional information will not be too lengthy.  

It's not only the issue of this -- you know, this disclosure of this -- of this afternoon that presents a problem for us.  All along we had been preparing ALG to go next, and we had worked with him in the anticipation of taking his testimony and dispensing with AWB for this session, and we've had to reverse the order of their testimony, because we clearly cannot finish ALG in the time that remains.  So, we would appreciate the opportunity this afternoon for Mr. Lahaie to speak with our next witness, who is now AWB, and we would maximise our efficiency by having Mr. Lahaie meet with that witness this afternoon and taking the remainder of our examination of XBM tomorrow morning.  I'm quite confident, on the Prosecution side, we will be able to complete our work within the time constraints.  And I would hope that the Defence would be able to make the same assurance.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just as a matter of interest, I understand that the preparation of your witness is not completed, so I'm asking for just a general estimate.  Do you anticipate that the examination-in-chief will exceed a day-and-a-half?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would prefer that Mr. Lahaie respond to that question himself, since he will be taking the witness.  But I've already discussed the matter with him, and by our timetable, if we start on Thursday morning, we will have completed our direct examination by Friday at midday.  But I would prefer to pass the floor to him and have him make that specific undertaking to the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I didn't need an undertaking at this stage, I wanted an estimate, a reasonable estimate at this stage.  So that basically if we did take the adjournment now, that you will still have a reasonable chance of completing the examination-in-chief by Friday?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That is our projection, and I would -- on that note, it would -- I would ask the Court to enquire of the Defence, if we kept within that parameter, if the entire cross-examination could be handled next week, from Monday to Friday.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's what I was thinking of.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yep.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who is taking the lead in the cross-examination of the witness, AWB?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
It is my team, Mr. President, for AWB. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Have you got -- again, at this stage, a general estimate, what do you anticipate is the likely duration of the cross-examination?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, we gave indications in May and there has been no change.  Of course, it will depend on the duration of examination-in-chief.  It could be more or less than the original indication.  Therefore, I will stand by the indications I gave in May.  I think, from memory, it was two days for this witness, three at the most.  So, for the Ngirumpatse team, that was the time provided.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, my impression -- my impression is that the examination of this witness is going to be completed before the end of next week.  What do we do with the rest of the time?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, there are motions -- I'm sure we can depend on Mr. Robinson to have motions for us to resolve -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why is everybody laughing?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If he doesn't have any motions, the Prosecution will find some motion that is worthy of the Court's attention.  But in terms of taking testimony, I don't think it's prudent to think beyond AWB.  We always have our investigator on hand, and there are a number of exhibits that we can put in evidence through him and begin the process of admitting things with some -- a bit of legal argument.  So I'm sure we'll find a productive way of using the time.  But the Court's time will not be lost next week, I'm quite sure.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, what seems clear is that whatever happens, your testimony's going to finish tomorrow.  So, we are proposing to give the -- all counsel an opportunity to review your statement of 2005 this afternoon.  So, if it is necessary to put any questions to you concerning it, it will be addressed tomorrow morning.  So, whatever happens, it is most likely that your testimony will be concluded tomorrow.  So that will take care, I think, of the concern which you expressed a little while ago.  

Okay, we are going to take the adjournment now.  Just in case there was any conspiracy to cause this to effect, I will just say thank you, and we will take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1535H)
