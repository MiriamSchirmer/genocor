I agree.

May I, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:

7

Yes, please.

BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

9

Q.

Sir, you testified that on the day after the

10

events that you described at Byangabo, the

11

killings that occurred there, that is on the

12

8th of April, that the Interahamwe organised

13

a celebration or a feast at Kajelijeli's bar

14

and they sang a song Tuzu Semba Sembe.

15

sure I'm not doing justice to this song, to

16

the name. But, can you tell this Chamber why

17

you never mentioned anything about this in

18

the statement that you made to

19

representatives of the ICTR when you gave

20

your statement in June of last year?

21

A.

Thank you, Mr. President.

I say so because there are too

Sir, again, on the 8th, when you testified

7

here in this, before this Tribunal, you told

8

this Tribunal, concerning an incident at a

9

roadblock where you say a woman, a Tutsi

10

woman, was taken out of a car and this woman

11

was killed.

Kanoti deeply.

MR. PRESIDENT:

4

Yes.

5

BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

6

Q.

Now, sir, do you know if Kanoti had more

7
8

than one wife?
A.

Thank you, Mr. President.

9

Since yesterday

I've made statements here and notes were

10

taken and I said that Kanoti was a driver

11

and he was engaged in transportation between

12

Kigali and Mombassa.

13

was wedded to Kanoti somewhere else, not in

14

our area, and so when the Interahamwes of

15

Kajelijeli killed her they were saying that

16

they had just caught the woman whom Kanoti

17

wanted to hide, that they had caught a woman

18

whom the son of Konyeri wanted to hide.

19

to ask me whether Kanoti had several wives,

20

really, I wouldn't know what to say or

21

answer, because that woman never lived in

22

our area.

23

The woman in question

So,

MR. PRESIDENT:

24

The question was whether you know, Witness

Sir, just to clarify your testimony, do you

in fact, Kanoti's wife.

6

That question should be put to

I

MR. PRESIDENT:

7

Yes, tell Witness GDQ that questions that

8

are being asked, and the ones allowed to be

9

asked are valid questions and they go to

10

assist the Trial Chamber to find out the

11

facts in the search for the truth and

12

justice.

13

carefully, answer them briefly, if we may

14

remind him again, and in doing so we also

15

save a lot of time and be able to complete

16

his testimony in the shortest possible time.

17

So, it is important that these questions are

18

answered appropriately.

So you should listen to them very

20

Counsel would like to know when was, if he

21

recalls, when was Kanote's wife and child

killed?

least if it was in the morning, in the

afternoon, or in the evening.

The Trial Chamber thinks that the

Can he tell us then, when this happened?
THE WITNESS:

6

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honour. I

7

believe that it was on the, 8th if my memory

8

serves me right.

9

Counsel mentioned the date of the 8th and

I don't know whether

10

what I am saying, I am saying as a witness

11

that saw what happened in the area that I

lived in.

that date we were burying people that had

bee killed and out of those people that we

were burying other people were added, that

managed to hide hitherto.

concerned about the hour at which the events

started at the time, I was busy burying

I crave your indulgence, Mr. President, Your

Honour.

11

I am saying because I am speaking in

13

Kajelijeli himself was there on the spot, in

14

front of that store, in front of a shop when

15

the Interhamwe were with him and came to

present him with the lady they discovered at

Interahamwe to do to that woman what they

taken and the children were taken out of the

no Tutsis were to be spared; is that your

testimony, that that is what Kajelijeli said

5

at that time?

6

Mr. President, Your Honour, I repeat that

7

Counsel should understand what I am saying

8

clearly.

9

the gender of the child in question.

I never pinpointed, for example,
I

10

didn't say that the child was a boy or a

11

girl.

12

that gave all the orders out in

13

collaboration with his accomplices, and it

14

was him that said that all Tutsi should be

exterminated in the Mukingo commune, which

16

commune was considered by Kajelijeli as his

own personal property.

18

Now regarding Kajelijeli, it was him

specific question and I want him to answer

that question.

So he can answer them

PROFESSOR HINDS:

11

Your Honour, the question that I am putting

12

to the witness is the following:

13

BY MR. HINDS:

14

Q.

Is it the witness's testimony that at the

15

time that he says the woman was taken out of

16

the car with her child or children and

17

killed that Juvénal Kajelijeli said that no

18

Tutsis were to be spared, or words to that

19

affect, whatever his testimony is with

20

respect to what Kajelijeli said, was it at

21

that time?

22

MR. FLEMING:

23

Your Honours, may I make an objection.

24

simple answer to that is, yes that is his

25

testimony and it is contained in the
REGINA LIMULA -OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
38

The

KAJELIJELI

6 DECEMBER 2001

1

transcript of yesterday.

However, is my

2

learned friend trying to test his memory on

3

what he said yesterday, or is he trying to

4

test his memory on what happened on the day?

5

The questions, in my respectful submission,

6

are confusing in themselves because he has

7

already answered and I can see the way in

8

which everybody is at cross-purposes during

9

this process.

The witness is struggling to

10

know whether or not he is actually being

11

asked whether it is his testimony now,

12

whether or not it was his testimony

13

yesterday, whether that is what he saw on

14

the occasion.

15

question, with respect.

16

friend says; was it your testimony yesterday

17

that you said this, well, it is quite

18

obvious that it was because it is in the

19

transcript or not in the transcript, and he

20

is testing his memory of yesterday or is he

21

testing his memory on what actually happened

22

on the day?

So, it is a confusing
If my learned

23
24

Now, cross-examination, is not, with the

25

greatest respect, a test of memory in
REGINA LIMULA -OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
39

KAJELIJELI

6 DECEMBER 2001

1

respect of peripheral matters, rather

2

cross-examination is to verify issues and

3

these aren't helpful questions that my

4

learned friend is asking and, indeed, I can

5

take it further and say they are an entire

6

waste of time of this Court's than of

7

anybody else's because it an entirely

8

improper question in cross-examination,

9

simply to ask whether or not somebody asked

10
11

some questions yesterday.
PROFESSOR HINDS:

12

Your Honour, Mr. Fleming has just entered

13

the room and chooses --

14

MR. PRESIDENT:

15

I think, this matter, we wanted an answer

16

from the witness and we think it is a

17

relevant question and it is an important

18

question, because, from the proceedings, the

19

Trial Chamber has been following so far,

20

when counsel was out, is that whether or not

21

those words were attributed to the accused,

22

and that is extremely important question.

23

That is one.

24

examination-in-chief, these matters were

25

spelt out, no doubt about it.

Two, it is true, in

REGINA LIMULA -OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
40

But I think

KAJELIJELI

6 DECEMBER 2001

1

it is important -- this particular question

2

is important for the witness to answer in

3

that light.

4

to be answered and overrule your objection.

So, we will allow that question

5
6

MR. FLEMING:

7

Your Honour, can I ask then --

Your Honour,

8

can I ask then that the question be

9

clarified?

Is it your evidence now, was it

10

your evidence yesterday or was it your

11

evidence at some other time, so that there

12

is some clarity in the question before the

13

witness.

14

BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

15

Your Honour, if Mr. Fleming wants to ask a

16

question he will ask his question but he

17

will not dictate the form in which the

18

Defence will put a question.

19

objection.

question again?

4

5
6

PROFESSOR HINDS:

7

Q.

Sir, is it your testimony before this

8

Tribunal that at the time that you say that

9

a woman was taken out of her car and her

10

child or children were killed at the

11

roadblock, that Juvénal Kajelijeli was

12

present and said, no Tutsis were to be

13

spared or all Tutsis were to be killed?

14

A.

Mr. President, Your Honour, I should like to

15

plead with the Chamber to tell Counsel that

16

I should continue to testify and to repeat

17

the same words each and every time that I am

18

called upon to testify before jurisdictions

19

concerning genocide.

20
21

Now, regarding my utterances, sir,

22

Kajelijeli, I said, did make such utterances

23

on his own part.

24

confirm it and if Counsel wants more

25

evidence on that, he can come with me and we

He is here and he can

REGINA LIMULA -OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
42

KAJELIJELI

will go to the areas where the crimes were

2

committed.

3

Q.

I thank you, sir.

Sir, if what you are saying today is true,

4

why didn't you say this to the

5

representatives of the ICTR when you gave

6

them your statement in June of last year?

7

A.

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honour.

8

Defence Counsel should understand, should

9

clearly understand, as a matter of fact,

10

that when I was interviewed I did answer the

11

questions put to me.

12

putting forth to me other questions and I am

13

answering those questions depending on the

14

manner those questions are put to me and he

15

is trying to find out all the truth.

Now today Counsel is

16
17

Now, the investigators that interviewed me

18

told me that I may have to go elsewhere, to

19

another location, to explain in greater

20

detail all that I knew, and it was thus that

21

I am here answering Counsel's questions such

22

as they are put to me, and I repeat; what is

23

he trying to do?

Is he trying to bring out

24

the whole truth?

I told him that if he

wants information that is not contained in

4

concerning this.

in answer to the first question you made

reference to seeing Professor Hinds when you

those who were with me, And once I learnt

KAJELIJELI

number of persons who died?
THE WITNESS:

3

Thank you, Mr. President.

The question that

4

has been put to me by the Lady Judge is a

5

very good one and I would like the Court to

6

understand that it is only Kajelijeli who

7

was the bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune,

8

it is only him who is able to know the

9

number of Tutsis and to talk to the Court

10

about it.

Personally, I know that the

11

Tutsis who were killed were very many in

12

Mukingo and even in the neighbouring

13

communes.

14
15

Unless I am asked to provide an estimate or

16

an approximate figure, that is, of the

17

Tutsis who were my neighbours, unless that

18

is the case I wouldn't really be in a

19

position to provide an estimate on

20

approximation on the number of Tutsis who

21

were killed or elsewhere or close to my

22

place.

she is putting to me are quite interesting

April, together with others, I was involved

11

in burying the victims and I have just

testified before the Court that I am not in

a position to provide an approximate figure

14

of the number of dead, and that I am only

15

able to give an estimate of the deceased who

16

were my neighbours.

might even give you their names and their

approximate number.

particular location; now, what do you say

13

about that?

14
15

He was left with nothing.

If our learned

16

friend is going to make an inference, and I

17

use only this one example and there were

18

many others, if he is going to make an

19

inference in respect of the credibility of

20

this witness, in that he didn't recognise

21

that particular place, then he had an

22

obligation to put to the witness what that

23

place was and to have the witness comment on

24

it.

Now, I recognise that this is a rule

2

peculiar to those systems which have

3

followed the British system more closely and

4

I recognise that it is not a rule that is

5

practised in the US and they have, of

6

course, argued vehemently against it because

7

they take a view that it constitutes giving

8

evidence from the bar table, in fact.

9
10

So, we recognise the rule as one relating to

11

a narrow section of the legal community, but

12

it is something which this Court obviously

13

has to determine whether or not it wants the

14

rule applied or doesn't want the rule

15

applied.

17

I say no more on that matter than that, Your

18

Honour, but we will be making submissions at

19

the end of the day if those matters haven't

20

been put to various witnesses.

Do you want to

PROFESSOR HINDS:

4

Yes, Your Honour, I was just going to say,

5

briefly, that the record so far with respect

6

to detained witnesses is very clear.

7

Defence has made our request for disclosures

8

in writing on the record by way of motions

9

and the Court has ruled with respect to

The

10

that.

We have a communique from the

11

Prosecutor General from the Republic of

12

Rwanda dated November 26, 2001, in which he

13

set out, by way of reference, the request

14

for copies for statements for confessions by

15

Rwandan detainee witnesses appearing before

16

your Chamber and the Court is aware of the

17

contents of that letter.

18
19

In substance, we received nothing.

20

witnesses have testified, we believe there

21

may be relevant and probative evidence with

22

respect to their testimony which we are

23

entitled to pursuant to Rule 68 and in the

24

interest of justice the Defence intends,

25

Your Honour, to follow a supplemental motion

Now, we realise there are limits with

5

respect to Article 28 and we understand

6

that this Court is limited with respect to

7

what you can do pursuant to Rule 7 bis and

8

so that may be the limits with respect to

9

what this Chamber may do in this regard.

10
11

But that would not be the end of the problem

12

because we then have a situation where a

13

Defendant stands accused of one of the most

14

horrible crimes that any individual could be

15

accused of, and we have witnesses where the

truthfulness of what they have said before

Now, with respect to an inference that has

9

he didn't say that, but I didn't know

whether they were cited properly.

12

I have been in discussions with Ms. Ojemeni

for determination, but there are, no doubt,

25

very, very important issues that will need

ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

There is

6 DECEMBER 2001

to be addressed as we go along.

2
3

The first one dealing with the question of

4

the statement, the Trial Chamber has, as you

5

both rightly observed, had made a ruling on

6

that and we have to take note that Mr.

7

Fleming has said that they are still and

8

will continue to follow this matter with the

9

authorities in Rwanda.

And reading also the

10

letter of the 26th November that has been

11

referred to, one tends to think it does not

12

close the door in the sense that I think the

13

last paragraph seems to suggest that they

14

could open for consideration in dealing with

15

specific requests, if our reading is

16

correct.

17
18

On the second issue raised by Mr. Fleming

19

there are two -- one touching on the element

20

of alibi which both of you, I think, have

21

touched on.

22

sorted out soon and as the Prosecution

23

rightly pointed out Rule 67, of course,

24

gives a time frame within which issues of

25

importance of it is that it is true that

accused persons to a particular place, they

must be given opportunity to comment on any

possible absence of that particular accused

particular time.

These questions are

10

extremely important, these witnesses must be

11

given opportunity to respond to that.

12

hope this is being done so that we don't

have to go over again at a later stage.

I think it is very valid in that context

that these aspects were sorted out as soon

as possible.

with the principles that have been raised by

flowing, did he explain what he meant by

13

that?

15

being killed and it was thus because people

were being killed he added that even in the

It's permissible under the rules.

about where people should go to get guns and

probative evidence could be admitted, but we

can't move on the basic elements of the

her to, you know, answer my questions.

20

recognize that what she's saying is not in

21

response to what I have asked her and I

22

cannot stop her in the middle of her answer.

I'll come back to that meeting because I

asked a particular question, which she has

25

not answered and is very relevant for

conspiracy purposes and I will establish it.
PROFESSOR HINDS:

3

Your Honour even dealing with conspiracy, we

4

can't deal with hearsay based upon hearsay.

5

MS. OJEMENI:

6
7

It is relevant, Your Honour.
PROFESSOR HINDS:

8
9

Okay, we have an objection.
MR. PRESIDENT:

10
11

Yes.

Can you finish?

MS. OJEMENI:

12

It's very relative and it has probative

13

value and I rely on Rule 89(b).

14

MR. PRESIDENT:

15

We don't know, Counsel, how far you intend

16

to go on this, but to the stage where you

17

are, we do appreciate hearsay under Rule 89

18

is permissible, provided it has probative

19

value, and the probative value can sometimes

20

not be fully established at the beginning of

21

things.

22
23

But there is another factor also that has to

24

be taken into account is also the possible

25

prejudicial effect to an accused in whether

ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
112

KAJELIJELI

1

or not the admissibility of that hearsay at

2

the stage of a submission should be allowed.

3

In the light of the information we have at

4

this stage, we are inclined to sustain the

5

objection of the Defence in this matter, and

6

we do so.

Your Honour, I can still ask questions

9

concerning the meeting, but not -- I mean

10

differently?

on or some other matter, I am sure you can

address the aspect that you would have.

Witness, can you recall names of important

personalities that you saw at the venue or

19

any?

20

A.

Now, so far as the very important

21

personalities that are concerned that I saw

22

at those meetings, I did not see any

23

personality, apart from the bourgmestre of

24

the Kinigi commune, that is before he died.

25

Now after he died, meetings were held in the

KAJELIJELI

6 DECEMBER 2001

1

Mukingo commune because after the death of

2

the bourgmestre of Kinigi, the Kinigi

3

commune had no bourgmestre any more, so that

4

all the meetings were held in the Mukingo

5

commune.

6

those meetings that were preparatory to the

7

massacres.

8

were held, they were already massacres

9

because the killings and massacres had begun

10

I am referring particularly to

And at the time those meetings

in 1991.

11

Q.

Witness, my question --

12

PROFESSOR HINDS:

13

Your Honour, again, the kind of -- the

14

problem we are having is because the witness

15

is not being given sufficient direction in

16

terms of her testimony and the counsel, the

17

Prosecutor, knows where she wants to take

18

the witness, I assume, and should direct the

19

witness and I think leading would be

20

permissible under these circumstances.

21

what we are getting here is a witness

22

without guidance who is simply now giving

23

testimony about massacres that occurred in a

24

certain period of time and she's talking

25

about meetings.

But,

First of all, we started

KELLY ALLEMANG - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

114

KAJELIJELI

6 DECEMBER 2001

1

off with meetings that occurred in 1993.

2

She talked about one meeting where she was

3

thrown out and then she started talking

4

about, at a following meeting where she was

5

not present and she began to talk about

6

that.

7

either one of these meetings, but just asked

8

about meetings and now she is now talking

9

about things in general.

Now, counsel has not taken her to

And so that is

10

where we are running into the problems,

11

Your Honour.

We take note of your observation, Counsel.

information concerning his participation at

PROFESSOR HINDS:

10

Your Honour, what Counsel is doing is trying

11

to elicit naked hearsay about Nzirorera's

12

involvement at meetings.

13

has directed her to ask questions based on

14

what the witness saw, observed, and the

15

witness has clearly said, she's seen the man

that she held an office in the cellule by

22

being a member of the committee and for some

reason she was asked to stop coming -- or,

she, on her own, stopped coming to meetings.

And, as a member of that committee, it is

KAJELIJELI

6 DECEMBER 2001

common knowledge that she's likely to

receive information about meetings that he

3

couldn't attend from her colleagues.

4

she can give the source of the information,

5

even if it's hearsay, it's relevant, because

6

what the line of question I am about, or the

7

issue I want to pursue now, is conspiracy.

Q.

Why do you say so?

A.

I am saying that it was Kajelijeli that is

22

responsible for what happened to me.

23

of all, because the people who came to take

subsequently did say that Kajelijeli told

them to be quick about it and to go back to

aggressors did say that if an investigation

was carried out in Ruhengeri to determine

Thank you.

PROFESSOR HINDS:

15

Your Honour, I am objecting to the whole

16

line of questions and answers that have been

17

given for all of the reasons that I have

18

already put on the record, and I really

19

don't want to trespass upon the Court's

20

patience in going over it.

21

MR. PRESIDENT:

22

We take note of the observation that you

23

have made and we are aware of the answers

24

given by the witness and at an appropriate

25

3

Q.

Witness, can you tell this Court -- I am

4

referring to the -- I want to take you back

5

to the skin that you said was cut off from

6

your sexual part.

7

if it has any adverse effect on your health?

Can you tell this Court

8

A.

Yes, it has affected my health.

9

Q.

Can you explain how it has affected your

10
11

health?
A.

The effect of that gesture on my health was

12

such that I was no longer able to give birth

13

normally.

14

here by C-section, and even the one before

15

this one, an operation of that type was

16

necessary, that procedure was necessary.

MS. OJEMENI:

I had the child that I mentioned

That will be all for this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:

Professor Hinds, do you have an idea how

6

long your cross-examination is likely to be

7

on this witness?

Your Honour, I would endeavour to be as

10

swift as I can.

intend to go into any --

The witness has -- I do not

MR. PRESIDENT:

13

Just have an indication, if you can give us

14

an indication about it, we don't tie you to

15

that.

16

PROFESSOR HINDS:

You've always tied me to any figure I give

18

you, that's exactly what I am tied to.

Have to plan.

I'll explain why after giving

more time than the Prosecutor's case

It took her to 5.30.

Took two breaks.
MR. PRESIDENT:

One break.

12

we do realize about two hours, two hours and

a half.

We're a bit late to start, but

PROFESSOR HINDS:

I think I could do it in a half a day, the

16

half a day that we work from.

MR. PRESIDENT:

18
19

About three hours?
PROFESSOR HINDS:

20

Yes.

would not be convenient for us at all.

Your Honour, let me just say tomorrow

MR. PRESIDENT:

We are saying so, it must be tomorrow

I am facing an emergency problem
I am facing a

Defence, I am putting on the record that the

problem that I am having, that I am trying

14

to deal with, we had planned to deal with

15

that with the client tomorrow to see if we

16

can resolve that, which would not,

17

hopefully, impact on our ability to proceed

next week.

I am dealing with that problem

right now.

The client has also informed me

that he has problems with his health and

But show it to your client and let's

PROFESSOR HINDS:

Your Honour, my client has put another

restriction on me.

He has told me if I

11

from you, I now have some other pressures to

12

complete the cross by twelve o'clock.

13

So, aside

MR. PRESIDENT:

14

That would be nice.

15

we'll adjourn these proceedings until

16

tomorrow to deal with the evidence of this

17

witness in cross-examination.

18

frames have been indicated and I hope the

19

Prosecution will also be thinking about what

20

possible areas, but I know you have to hear

what the cross-examination will be all

about.

Your Honour, I don't know if the witness can

2

leave, I have just one short information to

3

give the Court.

4

MR. PRESIDENT:

5

Okay.

6

tell the witness that she'll be coming here

7

to court at 9.30 and she may not discuss her

8

evidence with anybody.

9

All right, we draw the curtain, but

THE WITNESS:

10

I couldn't talk to anybody about what's

11

happening here because the people with me do

12

not speak my language, Your Honour.

13

MR. PRESIDENT:

14

It's a procedural explanation that we give

15

to witnesses.

16
17
18

Yes, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:

19

Your Honour, I would like to crave the

20

Court's indulgence to alter the order of

21

calling witnesses because we are presently

22

having problems with some of our witnesses.

23

The next witness has medical problems, in

24

fact, she's can't talk, she's in Arusha, but

25

she has a dental problem, but she will

definitely be put on stand after the next --

2

I mean, ACM, which comes after her.

3

GAS, so that's the information I have, just

4

to crave your indulgence, to apply to alter

5

the order of calling witnesses because of

6

the problem we are having.

7

After

PROFESSOR HINDS:

8

I don't have any problem with the

9

application, Your Honour.

I just need to

10

know exactly what is now the order as seen

11

by the Prosecutor's Office.

12

MR. PRESIDENT:

13
14

So can you be specific, learned counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:

15
16

GAS is supposed to be the next.
MR. PRESIDENT:

17
18

GAS.
MS. OJEMENI:

19

But we're not calling her here, we'll call

20

her after ACM.

21

PROFESSOR HINDS:

22

The order that I have, and counsel you may

23

not need, quite frankly, to make any

24

application.

I had GAP, GDQ, GDT, ACM, GAS,

25

GAR and GBW.

That is your letter to me of

November 13th, 2001.
MS. OJEMENI:

Fair enough.
PROFESSOR HINDS:

5

So is there something else we're dealing

6

with?

7

MR. PRESIDENT:

8

You're going to too fast for the

9

translation.

10
11

Could you please repeat what

you just said?
PROFESSOR HINDS:

12

Your Honour, I have had a communiqué from

13

Ms. Ojemeni dated November 13th, 2001.

14

order of witnesses at that time that she

15

proposed was GAP, was number one; GDQ,

16

second; GDT, third; ACM, fourth; GAS, fifth;

17

GAR, sixth, and GBW, seven.

18

understand she is saying is that she's not

19

proposing that order that existed.

20

The

Now, what I

MS. OJEMENI:

21

Can I clarify the issue myself?

I didn't

22

realize that you got that list because I

23

know that I sent it to you by email and at

24

the same time by fax, and I got a letter

25

still requesting for that.

Now that you

131

KAJELIJELI

6 DECEMBER 2001

have it, that's exactly the order we are

2

going to abide by.

3

be better for me to now inform the Court

4

that within this trial period, we would not

5

be in a position to call GAR and GBW, we'll

6

stop at GAS.

7

But, perhaps, it might

MR. PRESIDENT:

8

That is actually obvious from the time

9

frames that remain.

So, in any case, we

10

also have that order.

11

have already done, and then the next Witness

12

GDT, whom is being -- we're dealing with,

13

and the next witness is ACM, and then the

14

next is GAS.

15

MS. OJEMENI:

16
17

GAS.
MR. PRESIDENT:

18
19

We have GAP, GDQ, we

And then GAR.
MS. OJEMENI:

20

GBW.

21

but I said that given the time frame, we

22

will not be able to call GAR and GBW.

23

MR. PRESIDENT:

24
25

So the order still remains the same,
