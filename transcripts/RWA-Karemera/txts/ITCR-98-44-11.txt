MR. PRESIDENT:
This hearing is called to order.
 Let me
note before I begin that I should like to
express my wishes for a happy and good
year, especially to Lennox Hinds and to
the Prosecutor's office.
 Let it be a
fruitful year, a year in which we all
work hard.
 I should like to say I hope
that all the plans we have for this year
be fulfilled.
 I should like to reiterate
that this year be a year for trials, so
that we respect the rights of all the
accused to be tried without any undue
delay and afford the Defence time to
prepare for their defence.
 This is what
I wanted to say.
MR. KIYEYEU:
Now, the Registrar, could you please give
us the cause list for this morning.
Thank you, Mr. President.

I'm most obliged, My Lords.

Thank you.
 Thank you, Registry.
 Should we

should we begin with the motion for an
amendment?
 Mr. Hinds, would you like to
take the floor first?
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
 If it pleases the
Court, I would submit that the Court set its
own time frame and sequencing for hearing
the motions.
 I am prepared to proceed first
if that is the Court's wish, or I would
present my motion second if the Court so
wishes.
 It is up to you how you would like
to proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we are so used to you that I would
like to make an introduction, but for the

Lennox Hinds, representing Juv nal

 And I am assisted by
Mr. Baragahoranye, Juv nal Baragahoranye,

client and as an assistant.
If the Court pleases.
 I am Ken Fleming,
senior trial attorney.
 I appear with
Mr. Webster, Ms. Ojemeni, Ms. Pollard and
Mr. Jayasuria.
 I apologize for what appears
to be an over-representation.
 It's just
that different aspects of today were handled
by different people in our office.
 I
promise we won't be here all the time.
We shall begin with the motion for amending
the indictment.
 Let me make a small
observation first on behalf of the Chamber.
We regret that once again, and this is not
the first time, that we have the impression
that the one that is pursuing and that
should be diligent has a tendency of
delaying procedure.
 It is very important
for to us to come back to this case.

hearing we had the last time the Defence
observed that in reality the Prosecutor had
filed an amended indictment.
 The Prosecutor
then protested and said that it was not the
case; they had simply wanted to bring in
clarifications.
But today we are starting a trial, and at
the 11th hour we are given a motion to amend
an indictment with all the possible
consequences.
 If the Trial Chamber admits
this motion, it is their right; but in the
future we should take time consideration so
that the Chamber respects the rights of the
accused to be tried without delay.
MR. FLEMING:
Now this having been said, I shall now turn
to the Prosecutor to introduce their motion
for amending the indictment.
If the Court pleases.
 I intend to make a
few introductory comments and then
Mr. Webster is going to argue for the
indictment.

Your Honours have ruled in respect of the
matter as to whether it constituted an
amendment previously, and I don't
particularly want to go behind that ruling.
However, I do want to relate some of the
history of the matter so that there is a
clear picture of what we are dealing with.
Your Honours have made or made an order in
July of last year that we separate
Mr. Kajelijeli from the indictment of eight
and we present an indictment with just
himself.
 Our view of that indictment that
we presented was that it was precisely the
same indictment but with greater
particularity.
There had never been a request for
particularity, and I presume that the
argument of counsel was going to be
something like this:
 There was no
particularity in the original indictment;
therefore, you're not entitled to call
evidence in respect of that charge.

Now I presume that's what my learned friend
was leading up to.
 Now we, of course,
wanted to provide particularity, which we
did in August of 2000.
 Now, Mr. Hinds said
in this Court, when he was last here at the
beginning of December, in respect of our
indictment which was filed in August, and
Your Honours, at page 50 of the transcript,
asked him when he first saw it.
 And at line
18, Mr. Hinds says, "I saw it when
Mr. Harvey came back.
 Mr. Harvey came back.
He was here on the 30th.
 Maybe a week later
--" that's the 30th of October -- "maybe a
week later, maybe the first week of November
or something like that, I saw the indictment
and also studied the witnesses, the new
witness statements.
 And at that time I
asked him:
 What was Kajelijeli -- was he
allowed to plead, and he said "no".
 He
said, 'I think the Chamber has forgotten
about it and didn't'.
 And I said, "Look,
I'll deal with that when I get there", in
terms of him pleading to the new indictment.
There are two elements in respect of that.

The first is the indictment.
 The second are
what he terms as the new witness statements.
Of course he had disclosure in respect of
all of the evidence that we intended to
call.
 We had no obligation to give that to
him before that point, although we worked
hard to ensure that he had it as soon as he
possibly could.
 Now he can't rely upon the
latter part of this proposition, the new
witness statements, to say that he had never
seen the indictment.
 He, in fact, had seen
the indictment when we filed the motion.
And that was in July -- I'm sorry, that was
in August.
If there is a necessity to show that he had
seen it, then we refer to two letters which
he sent to this Court.
 The first, on the
6th of September 2000, where he wrote to the
Registrar in these terms,
 "I represent
Defendant Mr. Kajelijeli in the
above-referenced matter.
 I write in respect
of the Prosecutor's motion to correct
amended indictment dated August 29, 2000".

Now of course the original motion to file an
indictment and the motion to correct some of
the charges in that indictment had annexed
to them those indictments.
 So he then goes
on to say -- so he must have had them at
that stage and has obviously looked at them
because he is writing in respect of them --
"I do not object to the Prosecutor's request
for leave to correct the said amended
indictment.
 I would only note that,
according to the order of Trial Chamber II,
dated July 6, 2000, granting the Defence
motion for severance and a separate trial,
the Prosecutor was ordered to file a
separate indictment pertaining only to
Mr. Kajelijeli.
 However, the Prosecutor is
referring to this separate indictment".
May I interpose there.
 The one which was
before the Court from the middle of August
2000 and the one which was the subject of
discussion in December.
"As an amended indictment, therefore, it is
unclear to me whether the ICTR Rule

pertaining to amendment of indictment,
Rule 50, is applicable or whether ICTR
Rule 47, submission of indictment by the
Prosecutor, is applicable.
 Thus, I request
guidance on that issue.
 Nevertheless,
notwithstanding the nomenclature used,
Mr. Kajelijeli hereby reserves and preserves
his rights under ICTR Rules 47, 50, 72 and
73 to challenge the amended or separate
indictment if leave to correct is so
granted".
It was said on the 6th of September 2000
that his rights to challenge were reserved
if leave was granted.
 Of course leave was
granted.
 On the 5th of October, 2000, a
letter was sent to Mr. Webster.
 And I won't
read the whole letter, but the appropriate
paragraph is paragraph 2 in respect of the
indictment:
 "Moreover, it is our
understanding that the Prosecutor's office
has secured additional witness statements in
support of the new indictment which has been
filed against Mr. Kajelijeli.
 To date, the
Court has not ruled on the Prosecutor's

request to modify that indictment and,
therefore, Mr. Kajelijeli has reserved his
right to challenge the indictment.
"Also, Mr. Kajelijeli has not been arraigned
on the indictment and the Prosecutor has not
provided Defence with the new witness
statements which has prevented
Mr. Kajelijeli from conducting his
investigative trip to Kigali.
 It's
extremely important" and so on.
And then another paragraph, "Further to my
letter to the Court of October 5, on which
you were carbon-copied we proposed an
adjourned date for the status conference for
the week of October 30th at which time my
co-counsel, Richard Harvey, would be
available.
 Perhaps if we could obtain the
witness statements prior to that time we
might be able to travel to Kigali during the
month of November, December and have the
trial scheduled for early 2001".
Now, what in fact happened is that

Mr. Hinds, having already reserved the
rights of the Accused in respect of the new
indictment, came to this Court at the
beginning of December and pretended
surprise.
 He made a comment to this Court,
that I've read out before, that he hadn't
seen this indictment until maybe a week
later than the 30th of October.
 In fact, he
has had the indictment in his hands since
the middle of July, has considered it on at
least two occasions, and has ample time to
take the points that he said he was going to
take, or at least had reserved his right to
take those points, in the two letters that
he sent.
Now if one looks at the Rules, one can see
precisely what was going to happen.
 Rule 47
is the submission of the indictment, and, of
course, gives an accused certain rights.
Rule 50 deals with the amendment of an
indictment and the accused, if there are new
charges, "The accused shall have a further
period of 30 days in which to file
preliminary motions pursuant to Rule 72 in

respect of the new charges".
So instead of doing anything at all, my
learned friend sat on his hands and then
came to this Court on the 12th or 13th of
December and feigned surprise at this new
indictment, an indictment that he had had in
his hands for some five months, four months
by then, and five or six months by now.
But in fact what we really understand is his
real motive in respect of taking these
points:
 He doesn't want a trial to start
now.
 Mr. Harvey said it in no uncertain
terms on the 30th of October, "We will not
be ready".
 Mr. Harvey withdrew, or at least
applied to withdraw.
 Mr. Hinds said, "We
will not be ready".
 And as he has said to
the press recently, "Even if you order a
trial to go on, I won't go on, despite the
consequences".
The real reason why this trial is not
proceeding today is not surprise as a result
of particularity.
 It is because he simply

doesn't want the trial to go ahead because
he is not ready.
 He says he has an
international reputation to protect.
 He
also says to you on last occasion he was
here that he has had the case for 22 months.
One's international reputation would demand
that having a case for 22 months the Defence
case would be ready, and it would be simply
refined from the point where they had the
precise statements that the Prosecution was
going to rely upon.
So we are here now as a result of these
unfortunate circumstances.
 Now Your Honours
have made a ruling, and I don't wish to go
behind that.
 However, it leaves us in this
position:
 We have an indictment which we
say more fully particularises the
allegations against him.
 And indeed in some
instances, we accept there was an inadequate
particularisation of some of the charges.
That's why we took the initiative to
particularise them.
Your Honours have said that it might well

give the impression that it was an amended
indictment, and so therefore we should go
back to the old indictment.
 However, we
know that the next limb of our learned
friend's argument is going to be:
 There is
no particularity in respect of, for example,
rape; therefore, you can't bring evidence of
that.
 We will not be placed in that
position, of course subject to what
Your Honours will say about it.
So we seek leave to amend for the purposes
of ensuring that justice is done fully to
the people of Rwanda and that all of the
appropriate facts are before the Court.
 In
a recent letter to this Court,
Mr. Kajelijeli himself has said he doesn't
object to time being given to allow
Mr. Hinds to get his house in order and then
to go and investigate this matter properly.
We also rely upon that declaration.
 And we
say there is no prejudice whatsoever in our
more fully particularising the matter as we
have in the amended indictment.

Your Honours, my having made those
introductory comments, I'll give the floor
to Mr. Webster, who will argue the precise
points in respect of the amendment.
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.
 I'd like to
begin by stating that I have a slightly
different observation with regard to the
last time we gathered here in this
Trial Chamber, that was on the 12th of
December 2000.
 At that time the Prosecutor
was represented by the Prosecutor herself,
Ms. Ojemeni and myself.
 And we came
prepared at 9:30 in the morning to discuss
matters germane to a pretrial conference.
We were here to discuss the logistics of
preparing for trial, the trial date being
anticipated for today, the 22nd of January.
At that time Mr. Hinds appeared and made a
series of objections for the first time
after having received a copy of the separate
indictment that the Prosecutor filed in
compliance with the Trial Chamber's order of
the 6th of July 2000.
 Mr. Hinds made a

series of objections that consumed the
entire day.
 We were in this courtroom from
9:30 that morning until I believe 7:00 that
evening, and we discussed nothing that was
germane to a pretrial conference.
 We
focused exclusively on the Defence objection
to the separate indictment.
The Prosecutor's position at that time was
that we were ready for trial; we wanted to
proceed to the trial; that the Defence
objections were untimely; that they were not
substantive.
 And after much debate back and
forth, this Court ruled in favour of the
Defence and supported its objection and
required the Prosecutor to re-file a
separate indictment based on the original
joint indictment against Mr. Kajelijeli and
seven others.
What I would urge the Court or what I would
like to bring to the attention of the Court
today is that the Prosecutor has made every
effort to push this case ahead for trial.
When we received an adverse ruling on the

12th of December, we reviewed the case-law,
revisited all of the issues that the Court
addressed in its decision and that Defence
raised in its motion, and on the basis of
that filed this present motion to amend.
 So
what we are requesting this Court to do is
to substitute the separate indictment that
was originally filed on the 15th of August
and to consider that separate indictment as
an amendment.
Now that's not a position that we wanted to
be in.
 That's a position that we were
placed in because the Court ruled favourably
on the
 Defence objection.
 The Court ruled
on a Defence objection that took everyone by
surprise.
 We came to address issues of a
pretrial conference and instead were
confronted with a substantive motion.
 We
debated that motion without any regard for
the case-law, without any reference to the
established jurisprudence of this Tribunal,
without any guidance from any established
learning on the law.
 And since the delivery
of that decision or that judgement, the

Prosecutor went back and investigated the
case-law.
And it's on the basis of our investigations
and our review of the jurisprudence that we
generated this motion to amend.
 So it
certainly isn't an attempt on our part to
retard matters or to be dilatory in the
matters that are before this Tribunal.
 It's
our attempt to take our obligation seriously
and take the jurisprudence of this Tribunal
seriously and to conduct a judicial debate
on the basis of precedent, established
learning, and established procedure, which I
would suggest that the Defence has been
wanting in this regard.
Even with respect to this motion, which was
well researched and placed before this
Tribunal during the first week of January,
the response from the Defence appears in the
form of a certification which was served on
us on the 17th of January.
 This
certification is simply a recitation of
Mr. Hinds' opinion and Mr. Hinds'

characterisation of the Prosecutor's motion.
There is no case-law.
 There is no reference
to judicial precedent.
 There is no
reference to policy.
 The only
considerations that are raised in the
Defence response is the opinion unsupported
by any sort of legal argument of the Defence
and mischaracterisations of the Prosecutor's
motions and positions in this case.
As you recall, this Tribunal was on a
judicial recess from the 14th of December to
the 14th of January.
 We filed this motion,
I believe it was on the 3rd of January,
during the period of judicial recess.
 Our
filing a motion, our researching the law and
our attempt to come before this Tribunal
with arguments that are based on precedent
and
 established learning is certainly not
an attempt to delay procedure.
Our position has consistently been that we
were ready for trial; we wanted to proceed
with trial; and the only thing that has
slowed the trial down in this regard has

been the Defence objections and the Court's
ruling in favour of those objections.
With respect to this amendment, I think the
issues that the Court must confront today is
whether an amendment is legally required in
order for the Prosecutor to proceed with the
case that it intends to lead against
Mr. Kajelijeli.
 On the one hand, which is
echoing the argument or the statements by
Mr. Fleming earlier, we have a case that we
intend to present to this Court at trial
against Juv nal Kajelijeli.
 It is the same
case, whether we proceed on the basis of the
joint indictment, whether we proceed on the
basis of the separate indictment, which is
closely aligned to that joint indictment, or
whether we proceed on the separate
indictment that is now presented to this
Court as an amendment.
 It is the same case
regardless.
If Mr. Kajelijeli was sitting in front of us
with seven co-accused, we would still be
presenting the same case.

the basis of the separate indictment that
was filed on the 22nd of December, which
closely or more closely parallels the
original joint indictment, it would be the
same case that we wish to present on the
basis of this separate indictment that we
introduced today as an amendment.
That is to say, Juv nal Kajelijeli was a
direct participant in the events in Mukingo
and Nkuli communes in Rwanda during the
period April 6th of 1994 through July of
1994.
 He was operating on the ground; he
was leading crowds, distributing weapons,
inciting local civilian militia to rape
Tutsi women.
 His activities or the
accusations against him are what he did to
perpetrate the genocide in Rwanda.
The case against the other ministers and the
case that is incorporated in that first
joint indictment is -- anticipates proof of
genocide on a national scale.
 He was
grouped initially with the national
secretary of the MRND, the president of the

MRND, a minister of the interior, a minister
of defence, several high level government
officials.
 And the theory of that case was
that the activities of someone like
Mr. Kajelijeli and Mr. Kajelijeli himself,
the activities of those who actually
perpetrated the killing was linked to the
men at the top who were making policies and
issuing directives and organising the
genocide on a national scale.
That same set of allegations is what we
intend to introduce at a separate trial of
Mr. Kajelijeli.
 When this Court ordered us
to file a separate indictment, it made
little sense, and it seemed more efficacious
to focus specifically on his acts and
activities on the ground since that was the
basis that would frame the evidence that the
Prosecutor would lead a trial.
In terms of articulating or documenting or
submitting to this Court a document, an
accusatory instrument that would accuse Mr.
Kajelijeli individually, it made little

sense to incorporate all of the structure
and the baggage of the joint indictment,
which was really premised on a theory of
joint criminal liability of persons acting
in concert in a joint criminal enterprise.
That is the reason that this office filed a
separate indictment that was much more
concise and much more pointed.
We argued on the 12th of December that there
was no change in the case, that the same 11
counts from the original indictment were
conserved and repeated in the separate
indictment.
 We argued that the greater
factual elaboration was simply providing
particulars that were not included in the
first joint indictment.
 The Court rejected
that argument.
The case-law of this Tribunal provides some
support for the position taken by the
Defence and also some support for the
position taken by the Prosecutor.
 This
Tribunal has not ruled conclusively on that
discrete issue.

believe it was of the 18th of November 1998,
there is some language from Trial Chamber I
which states that, "Supplying additional
factual material in an indictment does not
require an amendment".
That Trial Chamber also suggested that if
there were additional factual allegations
that went beyond the scenarios described in
the original indictment, that it may not be
necessary to file an indictment or to
request leave to file an amended indictment,
but that those allegations could be
incorporated in a pretrial brief.
 And as
long as they were incorporated in a pretrial
brief or addressed in a motion or in filings
to establish contested matters of law or
fact, that it would be permissible to lead
evidence along those lines at trial.
Now that was not a ruling of the Court.
That was the Court opining on issues that
were raised in the context of that
proceeding without giving a definitive
ruling on that discrete issue.
 So it is not

resolved as far as the jurisprudence of this
Tribunal is concerned, or even with respect
to the proceeding in Musema before Trial
Chamber I.
There is additional jurisprudence coming
from the ICTY.
 I believe it is the
Kovacevic case.
 I can provide you with the
citation.
 The case is fully discussed in
the motion papers that were submitted to
this Court on the 4th of January.
But in that case -- actually, it's not the
Kovacevic, it is the Krajisnik case.
 And
there are two decisions, one on the 11th of
May of 2000, and the other on the 20th of
May 1999.
 And in those cases, the Court
discussed the same issue that this Trial
Chamber confronts, which is:
 Is an
amendment necessary when it appears that the
theory of the case is changing.
 In the ICTY
case, that was a case where the allegations
against the accused were that he directly
participated in the events that he was
charged with, and the Prosecutor attempted

to change those set of accusations from one
of direct participation to acting in concert
in a joint criminal enterprise.
And in order to change the theory of the
case from one of direct participation to
vicarious criminal liability of joint actors
in a common criminal enterprise, an
amendment was required.
Our case is the inverse.
 Here we have a
case where the initial set of allegations
were one of a joint criminal enterprise.
Even stating that, and even admitting that,
in order to prove this joint criminal
enterprise, it is the direct activities of
Mr. Kajelijeli that this Prosecutor's office
intended to lead evidence on in order to
incriminate those that were above him.
 So
Mr. Kajelijeli, by the terms of that first
indictment, was always on notice that his
direct participation in the events in
Ruhengeri and in Nkuli and Mukingo communes
were going to be the basis of the
Prosecutor's case against him.

But in respect of this Trial Chamber's
ruling on the 12th of December, we have gone
ahead and filed what the logical consequence
of this Trial Chamber ruling which is to
file that separate indictment as an
amendment.
 That's not what we intended.
Our position is that we shouldn't have to do
that.
 We do that now because we are urged
in that direction by this Trial Chamber.
The bottom line is that we will lead
evidence at trial of Mr. Kajelijeli
distributing weapons, calling people
together, having meetings, raping women,
ordering other people to rape women.
 This
whole series of particular acts that are
alluded to in the separate indictment would
be the basis.
 That is the evidence that we
will lead at trial of Mr. Kajelijeli.
It is for this Court to determine whether
leading that evidence requires an amendment,
requires granting an amendment at this stage
or proceeding on the separate indictment

that was filed on the 22nd of December,
which is more in line with the joint
indictment that was filed back in August of
1998.
If we can proceed to trial on the basis of
the old indictment or an indictment that's
more in line with the joint indictment and
the pretrial brief, so that evidence at
trial will go to the particular acts of
Kajelijeli, then amendment may not be
required.
 What is required at this stage
before the trial begins is some decision and
clear indications from this Court that the
Prosecutor's office can lead evidence that
Mr. Kajelijeli directly participated in the
acts that resulted in the genocide and the
killings of thousands of people in Mukingo
and Nkuli communes in April of 1994.
I would suggest, and the Prosecutor's office
would take the position, that the better
indictment, or the more appropriate
instrument to go forward with that case, is
the separate indictment which was filed back

in August which is re-filed today as an
amendment.
 That indictment is more pointed;
it is clearer; it is a more appropriate
accusatory instrument for the trial of a
single accused.
When we address the issue of prejudice to
the accused, that is a non-argument.
 As I
stated before, both indictments put forth
the same case.
 The Defence is actually at
an advantage going forward with this
separate indictment, because it more
specifically guides the Court and the
parties as to the substance of the evidence
that will be led at trial.
This is an instrument in terms of the
separate indictment that the Defence has had
in its possession since the middle of
August, that was well over six months ago.
If there were objections to it, those
objections should have been submitted in
writing; it should have been placed before
this Court formally as a motion, and the
Prosecutor in this Court should not have

been surprised during the course of a
pretrial conference to address objections to
the substance of the form of the indictment.
I'd also like to bring to this Court's
attention or remind the Court of how we got
before -- how we got to this stage in the
proceedings.
 If you recall, this motion,
this separate trial of Kajelijeli goes
forward because of a Defence motion to
sever.
 That motion to sever was filed
almost a year after the Accused made an
initial appearance on the original joint
indictment.
When this Court granted a separate trial for
Kajelijeli by its decision of the 6th of
July 2000, it included in its decision a
rather lengthy discussion of the timeliness
of that Defence motion.
 The Defence filed a
motion for severance that was well out of
time.
 It was months after the 60-day period
in which it should have filed a motion to
sever pursuant to Rule 72, because it was in
the nature of a preliminary motion.

Rules of Procedure have since been amended
to shorten that period to 30 days.
 But when
the Defence filed that motion he had 60 days
within which to file a motion of that
nature.
 He did not even honour the 60-day
period of time, a window of time in which to
raise those objections.
 His motion was
filed almost a year later.
 And this Court,
on its own initiative, considered that
motion because his application was not even
framed by a request or a demonstration of
good cause of why that motion should be
considered even though it was out of time.
So even in order to get before the Court at
this stage in a separate trial of
Mr. Kajelijeli, there was a delay in the
proceedings that was occasioned by a lack of
initiative on the part of the Defence.
 We
face that same lack of initiative when we
consider on the 12th of December another
motion, raising yet another objection to the
accusatory instrument that would form the
basis of the trial of this accused.

The Defence has had full disclosure of all
the materials that will be used in the trial
of Mr. Kajelijeli since the 30th of October
of the year 2000.
 So in terms of the issue
of fairness and prejudice to the Defence, it
seems hardly a tenable argument to suggest
that the Defence is being disadvantaged or
being taken by surprise or is being treated
unfairly by the Prosecutor's office simply
because we wish to proceed to trial on the
basis of an instrument that complies with
the jurisprudence of this Tribunal.
I'd also like to go back to a slight point
that I neglected earlier, which is that in
terms of the indictment that we submit today
is an amendment.
 There are one or two other
changes that make it different from the
original joint indictment, but those changes
were introduced in compliance with the
developing jurisprudence of this Tribunal.
The original joint indictment was filed in
August of 1998.
 That was prior to the
judgement of this Tribunal in the Akayesu

case; it was prior to the judgement of this
Tribunal in the Musema case.
 We filed our
separate indictment, the first one, in
August of the year 2000.
 We had to take
into consideration the developing
jurisprudence of this Tribunal.
 And on that
basis the lead count in the original joint
indictment, which was conspiracy to commit
genocide, was replaced by genocide as the
lead count; and complicity to genocide was
pleaded alternatively to genocide, and the
count of conspiracy was relegated to the
third count on the indictment.
Now that was in response to the developing
jurisprudence of this Tribunal, which is
what any litigant in the context of a
criminal proceeding would be urged to do,
which is to take into consideration the
developing law, the developing jurisprudence
in making filings before this Tribunal.
That's an aside.

that earlier.

the Defence and delay:
 There is no
prejudice to the Defence.
 The Defence has
had all these materials at its disposal for
well over a year.
 With respect to undue
delay, it is the obligation of the Defence,
the burden is on the Defence to establish
undue delay as a basis to contest this
motion for amendment.
That is the jurisprudence established
previously by this Tribunal on previous
decisions to amend the indictment in the
Butare cases, specifically the case against
Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.
 All of the case-law
has been reiterated, cited, explained and
discussed in the motion papers that were
submitted earlier this year.
 I won't repeat
it here.
 I'll simply state for the record
or during this oral proceeding that the
case-law is established within the context
of this Tribunal, that the issue of undue
delay is the Defence burden.
 It is up to
the Defence to demonstrate that there is
undue delay to establish in making an
argument that this motion should not be

The Defence can hardly meet its burden on
that score when it has repeatedly requested
that this trial be delayed.
 Every time
Mr. Hinds or Mr. Harvey have appeared before
this Tribunal, before this Trial Chamber,
they have stated they are not ready for
trial.
 One was engaged in another matter in
another jurisdiction.
 Mr. Hinds' most
recent correspondence is that his shortage
of staff at his law firm would force him to
delay his focus on this trial.
 At every
turn the Defence has tried to delay the
proceedings, formally by appealing to this
Tribunal and informally, by the very manner
in which they lead their preparation of this
case.
We have in our possession a letter from
Mr. Kajelijeli himself dated the 15th of
January of this year, where he himself
states that he is prepared to delay the
proceedings in this trial in order to
maintain his relationship or the

relationship of his counsel to this Tribunal
and to his case.
So at every turn the Defence has prepared to
delay the proceedings of this trial and has
requested that the trial date of this matter
be postponed and be postponed for as long as
six months.
 So on that score alone, there
can be no serious argument that there is
undue delay that will prejudice the Defence
and will compromise the Defence right to
trial without undue delay as a basis for
contesting this motion for amendment of the
indictment.
Now I am not suggesting to this Court that
that concludes the issue that is before the
Court.
 I'm not suggesting that the only
issue that this Court confronts is one of
undue delay.
 But on that particular issue
there is no argument that the Defence can
argue as a basis to oppose this motion.

discussion, I would simply like to remind

the Court of a passage that was actually
quoted in the motion papers, and it comes
from the decision by the Appeals Chamber in
the matter of the Prosecutor v Kovacevic,
which is an ICTY Appeals Chamber decision.
It's the decision stating reasons for
Appeals Chamber's order of the 29th of May
1998.
 And in that Appeals Chamber decision,
what the Court stated was that the
timeliness of the Prosecutor's request for
leave to amend the indictment must be
measured within the framework of the overall
requirement of fairness of proceedings.
In other words, there was an expanded
discussion in that decision that the Court
should consider all the circumstances that
develops the litigation before the
Trial Chamber in deciding whether a motion
is timely or not and whether there is a
legitimate issue of undue delay.
 And in the
context of this specific litigation where
the Defence at every moment has filed its
motions late, has filed its motions out of
time, where every motion has delayed the

proceedings of this Court, first with the
motion for severance, then with its most
recent motion, objecting to the separate
indictment that had been filed six months
prior to the Defence appearance in a
pretrial conference, then when this Court
considers how this litigation proceeds
before it, this is the case the Prosecutor
intended to try as a joint indictment.
 We
were prepared, for reasons of judicial
economy, to try seven defendants together in
order to expedite matters.
 And instead,
this Court has ruled to separate one of
those litigants and has slowed down that
whole process in terms of pushing that whole
series of cases to conclusion.
So in that context, when the issues germane
to Mr. Kajelijeli are considered globally,
there can be no reasonable argument that
delay should be a basis for delaying this
motion.
 The only issue before this Court on
this motion is whether it is legally
required or advisable for the indictment to
be amended in order to lead proof through

the trial of all of the evidence that the
Prosecutor intends to amass and demonstrate
or place before this Court in regard to
Juv nal Kajelijeli.
It's not necessary to repeat myself at this
stage.
 I've provided both earlier today and
on the 12th of December the reasoning of the
Prosecutor for why the joint indictment and
Kajelijeli's inclusion in that joint
indictment is the same case with respect to
him that we put forward before this Court in
the separate indictment.
But having said that, the Prosecutor and
this Court has the discretion to amend an
indictment in the interest of justice.
 Here
we have the same 11 counts.
 I would suggest
to this Court that the trial would proceed
much more smoothly with fewer distractions
of baseless objections to the form of the
indictment that are definitely rephrased to
upset the proceedings, which is what the
Defence has done at every turn, that in
order to streamline the procedures for

trial, that the Court grant the Prosecutor's
request for leave to amend the indictment.
The Prosecutor has that discretion.
 It's
established in the case-law.
 The Court may
exercise its discretion to allow that.
There is no legal impediment to admit this
separate indictment as an amendment.
 There
is no question of undue delay.
 And on that
basis we ask the Court to rule in favour of
the Prosecutor's motion and grant the
amendment.
 Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Prosecutor.
 Allow me
to point out, since you've repeated it, that
perhaps the Chamber now independence in
sovereignty, it was not only independence
and sovereignty that we pointed out the fact
that that motion was out of time.
 In our
sovereignty we said that there should be a
separate trial for Kajelijeli.
 Please allow
the Chamber to exercise its sovereignty and
independence.
Mr. Hinds, now you have the floor.

MR. HINDS:
May it please the Court.
 I'd like to thank
Your Honours for giving us this opportunity
to respond to the Prosecutor's motion to
amend.
In its argument, the Prosecutor seems to
criticize the Defence because we moved to
challenge a joint indictment against
Mr. Kajelijeli, and we move for a separate
trial and for severance.
 We did so because
from the very inception of this case, our
position has been that Mr. Kajelijeli had
not committed the offences charged and that
he was inappropriately joined with other
defendants against whom there was more
evidence of involvement, if any, in the
offence.
 Now that has been our position
from the very beginning.
The Prosecutor suggests to you today that
they all along had evidence of
Mr. Kajelijeli's involvement in a range of
activities.
 That is what they are telling
you as we stand here today, that back in

August of 1998 they knew that Kajelijeli was
involved in making speeches and inciting
people to genocide and to crimes against
humanity.
If that was so, why, pray tell us, didn't
the Prosecutor in paragraphs 5.4 to 5.11 of
the original indictment mention
Mr. Kajelijeli once being involved in
inciting anyone to commit genocide or
inciting anyone for crimes against humanity?
Mr. Webster has said that was their case all
along.
 He said that what they were thinking
of doing now is just simply providing
supplemental information.
 The question is:
Where is the initial information charging
Mr. Kajelijeli with respect to making
speeches and inciting anyone to commit
genocide?
Mr. Fleming gets up and he makes certain
statements.
 I would ask him to point out to
this learned Tribunal where in the 1998

it, under subtext speeches and incitement,
where Mr. Kajelijeli was in fact mentioned
specifically in inciting anyone.
With respect to distribution of weapons:
They claim that Mr. Kajelijeli -- they had
information that Mr. Kajelijeli was involved
in distributing weapons that was used to
commit genocide, crimes against humanity.
Paragraphs 5.25 to 5.37 in the original
indictment.
And I do not have to remind this Tribunal
that the Prosecutor has the burden in this
particular case.
 They have the burden and
the burden never shifts to the Defence.
They have had all of the time; they have all
of the resources; they have all of the
manpower; they made the decision to indict
Mr. Kajelijeli.
 And the question now is:
Have they proceeded with enough
particularity so as to provide sufficient
notice to Mr. Kajelijeli of the charges
against them?

Back in 1998 there was, in fact, not a
single allegation that Mr. Kajelijeli was
involved in distribution of weapons.
 So it
is not a question of supplementing.
 What we
are dealing now with is new allegations and
charges.
 With respect to propagating and
establishing lists of individuals, targeting
individuals to be killed, they say that they
had evidence all along of that.
 Yet, if you
look at the original indictment, why didn't
they say Kajelijeli was involved in
preparing lists?
Now, according to Mr. Webster, their theory
of the case was that Kajelijeli was the
individual who was involved in all of these
activities and upon his shoulders they were
going to build a case involving others.
That's a strange way of doing it, with no
evidence, no allegations with respect to
him.
 And that is precisely the reason why
we moved to sever.
With respect to the charge of rape:
 It is
true that Mr. Kajelijeli under count 7 of

the original indictment, that count 7 of the
indictment speaks to a crime against
humanity; in particular, rape.
 Not one
single allegation specific to
Mr. Kajelijeli, not one.
 Now suddenly they
say they had planned to do that all along.
The Prosecutor's office with its staff have
the duty to formulate an indictment with
proper specificity to put the defendant on
notice on the principles of due process, so
that he could prepare to defend himself.
The Defence has no burden in this respect.
The burden is on them and not us.
They seem to criticise us because we, in
fact, A, pointed out shortcomings and moved
and said if you want to try this man, try
him separately.
 They criticise the Tribunal
for ruling in our favour.
 They now move to
criticise us because they did not comply
with the order of the Tribunal.
 They have
the burden; they are the ones who in fact
caused this man to be arrested.
 They are
the ones who must proceed with the evidence

against him.
22 JANUARY 2001
With respect to the crime of rape:
 If you
look at the original indictment, and when
you look particularly of crimes that
allegedly took place in Ruhengeri, there are
two paragraphs addressing Mr. Kajelijeli.
Kajelijeli at paragraphs 6.84, 6.85, 6.86.
Now that is the extent.
 That is the extent
that the Prosecutors speak with any
particularity of what they claim
Juv nal Kajelijeli was involved with.
 I
have no problems with them saying they put
us on notice with respect to those
allegations.
Now if you turn now to the so-called
proposed amended indictment and what they
call "concise facts and events in
Ruhengeri", and you look at the nine
paragraphs there, in terms of concise
statements, you have, for the first time,
they find themselves realising that, A, now

must follow the letter of the law, and you

must follow the letter of this Tribunal's

for Mr. Kajelijeli based upon the indictment
that was confirmed by Judge Pillay.
 You
can't add new elements; you can't add new
charges.
 Look at the old indictment and
what is contained in there, that is what you
are bound by".
They now realise that they have no evidence
with respect against Kajelijeli in the old
indictment.
 So, therefore, they are now
talking about for the first time that
Kajelijeli was involved in organizing,
attacking, abducting, raping, massacring
individuals; that he witnessed the raping
and other sexual assaults of Tutsi females,
in 5.5.
 In 5.3, that he commanded,
organized, supervised and participated in
rapes.
Now when we talk about fairness, should the
Defence after close to the amount of time
that the Prosecutor has had with respect to
this case, where they brought an indictment

in August of 1998, and assuming that they
presented to us an indictment in August of
2000, it doesn't matter.
 After two years is
that the first time that they suddenly
realise that they have no evidence on rape
against Mr. Kajelijeli?
 And based upon
Mr. Webster's analysis, they had planned all
along to produce evidence that
Mr. Kajelijeli had organized and supervised
rapes.
How were they going to introduce that at
trial?
 Were they just going to come into
this Tribunal and suddenly present witnesses
without any allegations in the indictment
itself?
 How were they going to proceed?
They created their own dilemma.
 They
created their own problems.
 It is not for
the Defence to help them solve that.
 They
have the staff; they have the resources;
they brought the indictment.
 And now we
find ourselves in a situation where

we deal with the same time frame suggested
by Mr. Fleming, August of 2000 -- after two

years we have Mr. Kajelijeli suddenly faced
for the first time with rape, an allegation
that he in fact organized, supervised rapes;
that he in fact was involved in giving
speeches and inciting.
 None of those were
contained, those allegations, in 1998.
Now, Mr. Webster suggests that there is no
prejudice to Mr. Kajelijeli, that because
the Defence is having problems with its
staff and had required and requested
enlargement of time and adjournment that
there is no prejudice.
 He misses the point.
The point is that when we deal with fairness
the Prosecutor cannot at the last minute
change the rules of the game.
 They cannot
at the last minute change the allegations in
the indictment.
 And say, "Well, you are
better off today than you were yesterday.
Guess what?
 We have told you what the
charges are, Professor Hinds; you ought to
be happy".
That is not the rules.

sufficient particularity with respect to the
allegations so that he can defend himself.
Now if the Prosecutor proceeds with an
inadequate indictment, that is his problem.
He cannot later on attempt to bring in
evidence that is not contained in the
original indictment.
The problem that the Prosecution faces is
that they started off in December saying
that they did not intend to amend.
 They now
realize that unless they amend, there are
certain charges that they have brought
against Mr. Kajelijeli where there is no
evidence to support it.
 That's their
dilemma.
 But they are the individuals who
are the architects of these proceedings.
They have initiated it, and they have the
burden of proceeding forward.
 We as the
Defence are raising issues and we think
properly so, and this Tribunal is exercising
its authority in ruling on the
appropriateness of the motions that are
being made.

At this late date, the Prosecution should
not be allowed to amend this indictment
which will only cause more delays, because
to amend this indictment to introduce these
allegations of rape, and they now say, well,
you've gotten these witness statements and
you've gotten it since October -- yes, we
got these witness statements in October for
the first time, laying out some horrible
allegations with respect to rape.
 We now
have a situation of trying to locate
witnesses.
 If they had that information
back in August of 1998, why did it take them
this long to present it to us?
 Women who,
according to those allegations, were raped
with instruments of sticks, and so on.
To allow the Prosecution to introduce all of
these new elements dealing with distribution
of weapons, dealing with incitement
speeches, dealing with establishment of
lists, dealing with rape, all of these are
new allegations, new charges, because they
are not contained in the original
indictment.

why the amendment should be amended and why
this Court should amend that indictment.

Defence.
If the initial indictment, the joint
indictment against Kajelijeli and seven
others were deficient, that motion should
have been filed within 60 days of the
initial appearance of the Accused back in
April of 1999.
 He had ample opportunity --
the Defence has had ample opportunity to
contest the original indictment for defects
in form to contest the prima facie case of
the eleven counts of that original
indictment.
If that's the motion the Defence wants to
make, that motion should have been made
sometime last year.
 Every time the Defence
has appeared before this Tribunal, it makes
the same motion in other clothing.

continued focus on the original indictment
and its facial insufficiencies.

The discussion before this Court today is:
Does the separate indictment go forward as
an indictment or does the Prosecutor have to
rely on the separate indictment that was
filed on the 22nd of December.
Mr. Hinds' argument is precisely the reason
why this Court should grant this amendment.
We intend to produce evidence of Kajelijeli
distributing arms, inciting people to
massacres, inciting people to rape,
organising meetings.
 All of the things that
are contained in the separate indictment,
that is the evidence that will be presented
before this Court at trial, and that is the
evidence that the Prosecutor should be
allowed to lead.
 We have the discretion.
The rules and the Rules of Evidence and
Procedure gives the Prosecutor, if allowed
by the Trial Chamber, an opportunity to
amend an indictment to include new evidence.
If Mr. Hinds sees all of these allegations
as new, that is precisely the reason why
this amendment should go forward and the

There is no reason the Defence should not be
allowed to trip this Tribunal and
substantial justice should not be allowed to
deftly turn issues around, turn issues on
their head to avoid this Tribunal being --
to avoid the eventuality of evidence of all
of these acts of Mr. Kajelijeli being placed
before this Tribunal to be considered in
relation to the eleven counts of the
indictment.
Every step of the way, from back in August
of 1998, the Defence has been aware that
there are eleven counts in the indictment,
incitement is charged in the indictment,
rape is charged in the indictment.
 All of
those things are in the counts of the
indictment.
 If he had problems -- if the
Defence has problems with those counts on
the basis of the paragraphs in the
indictment, the appropriate motion should
have been made months ago, over a year ago,

and that's the motion that should have been
argued -- or these arguments should have
been presented at that time.
 These are
inappropriate arguments for the motion that
is before the Court at this time.
Even with respect to the specific
allegations that were made, in Mr. Hinds'
certification, the certification of January
17th, when he alleges that the separate
indictment is for the first time raising
issues of Kajelijeli's control of the
communal police and civil servants within
his jurisdiction, his bourgmestre of Mukingo
commune, all of those things are repeated
verbatim in the original indictment.
 If you
look at paragraph 3.4, the same paragraph
that he takes issue with, look at 3.4 in the
original indictment, and you will see the
same allegation that is made in one of the
paragraphs of -- I don't recall the specific
number, but it has to do with Kajelijeli's
authority over civil servants and communal
police and gendarmes.

I am not disputing that the separate
indictment provides greater particularity
which advances matters before this Tribunal,
which advances and facilitates this
litigation.
 If the Court agrees with
Mr. Hinds that these additional facts are
new facts -- which is not what we are
supporting -- but if the Court should choose
to accept the Defence representation that
these are new facts, then that is a reason
why this indictment, the separate
indictment, should be amended.
 We have that
discretion.
 The rules give us that
discretion.
 And the only impediment and the
only objection should be one of undue delay.
That is not a valid objection in the context
of this litigation, given all of the
dilatory tactics that the Defence has
employed and the fact that they, themselves,
are not ready to go to trial and have
requested a delay of the proceedings.
 I
surrender the floor to my colleague.
MR. FLEMING:

exhibited considerable confusion about the
matters of law about which he has been
speaking.
 May I quote one sentence from
him:
 "That the Prosecution realizes that it
has no evidence in the old indictment".
We've known forever that there is no
evidence in the old indictment, because
that's not the purpose of an indictment.
The purposes of the indictment is set out
clearly in the Rules.
 It is not the place
where the evidence resides.
Another confusion:
 What my learned friend
is seeking to do is to in fact review the
president's decision to confirm the
indictment.
 My learned friend, Mr. Webster,
has already touched upon that.
 The
indictment was confirmed, and it was said at
that time there was sufficient evidence to
put the Accused on his trial.
 Now somehow
or another our learned friend says that over
the next 22 months, we are not entitled to
accumulate further evidence.
 We are stuck
with the evidence which was available when

Now the Rules are sensible.
 The Rules say
that the indictment must be confirmed at
that point it is established that there is
sufficient evidence to put the accused on
his trial.
 Judge Pillay decided that a long
time ago, and that includes rape, that
includes incitement, and all of the other
charges that are there.
 So there was enough
evidence; there is enough evidence in the
initial material.
 Our learned friends
didn't challenge that, so they are stuck
with that.
But then the rules go on to protect their
interest.
 Now our learned friend is
confused again because he suggests we have
to produce all of the evidence to him when
the indictment is confirmed.
 No rule says
that.
 His client's interests are protected
by, of course, him, because he goes out upon
the strength of the indictment and starts to

make his own investigations.
 Ah, but of
course he tells this Court that he hasn't
done that yet and he wants more time to do
it.
 So he can't really complain that he
hasn't had all of the material, to which he
is not entitled in any event.
What do the Rules say about disclosing the
evidence which our learned friend continues
to say should have been in the indictment?
The evidence, of course, is disclosed under
Rule 66, "No later than 60 days before the
date set for trial copies of the statements
of all witnesses whom the Prosecutor intends
to call to testify at the trial must be
disclosed".
 Sixty days.
Now let us look objectively at this.
 Our
learned friend has had an indictment for two
years that he didn't challenge in respect of
the adequacy of the evidence.
 He challenged
it in other ways; took appeals.
 And of
course they were dismissed because time
limits were not met.
 Then he asked us what
evidence was available.

answer the substance of the appeal -- and we
didn't because the time limits were not met
and it was dismissed on that ground -- we
would have referred him to the five public
documents that have been in existence from
periods of time from 1995 through until 1997
which clearly states that his client is
suspected of war crimes.
Now those are still available and that could
be one of the issues he wants to raise if he
wants to see those.
 We can show him any
time he wishes.
 He's never asked us.
Second, the evidence itself, that is, the
witness statements, are to be disclosed no
later than 60 days.
 Now the particularity
that we provided in the indictment was given
six months ago.
 Our learned friend stands
here today and pretends that all of this has
happened today or in December.
 Even if it
happened in December, he's had six or seven
weeks to prepare a case.
 But he hasn't,
because he puts his own personal financial
circumstances before that of his client, and

we come to that in the next application that
he makes to be relieved of his
responsibilities as counsel.
So he's had the indictment with all the
particularities since August.
 He's had
every word that we intend to call at trial
from all of our witnesses since the 30th of
October.
 October to November to December:
He's had those for 10 weeks.
 And he's
feigning surprise.
 He's entitled to have
them, in fact, 60 days before the date set
for trial.
 He had them well within that
time.
He had the temerity to say to this Court on
the last occasion that there has not been a
single other accused in this court or any
other court in this Tribunal who has had to
meet the time limits that he's had to.
 We
say of course "balderdash", because the
rules say that he has to get the statements
within 60 days, must have the statements
within 60 days.
 And if he thinks that there
is some injustice in that, then the Rule

goes on to say that he can come to this
Court and upon good cause shown, a Trial
Chamber may order the copies of statements
within a particular time.
 He does none of
that.
So there has been evidence, always has been
evidence -- Judge Pillay found that two
years ago -- sufficient to put this man on
his trial.
 We have no obligation to give
evidence until 60 days before trial.
 Now
that's a very sensible rule, and I'll
explain in our submission why.

MR. FLEMING:
1050H.
(Continuing)
We could have gone to Mr. Kajelijeli with a
truckload of material and said, here you
are, there it all is, you sift through it,
you sort it out; but we don't.
 Because my
view of this rule, and I would submit that
it should be the Court's view as well, is
that by the time you are ready for trial and
by the time you can announce that you are
ready for trial, you have refined the case
to specifically those witnesses that you
intend to call at trial.
Now that's the purpose of the rule so that
in Mr. Hinds' mind the case, when he is
given full disclosure, is fully
particularised then, that's when he gets the
witness statements, not back, as he says, in
some confusion when the indictment is
confirmed, or not back, as he says, with
some further confusion, within the
indictment itself.
 That's just not the law.
The law is he has the indictment, it is
confirmed by a judge of this Tribunal saying

that there is sufficient evidence to put him
on his trial, the matter is refined and
refined, we took the initiative to
particularise.
 The allegations, they are
not new allegations, they are a
particularity in respect of those
allegations.
 We give him the forty-one
statements that we intend to use.
 Now we
can say, still, that we hope we can refine
that down further so that we don't have
forty-one statements, but these are the ones
which will prove our case.
So he's had our case fully particularised
from August last year.
 He's had all of our
witness statements since the 30th of
October, and he is here crying foul as
though these things happened today.
 And
with the greatest of respect, there is no
substance to what our learned friend just
said; they are entirely outside of the
jurisprudence of this Tribunal, and our
learned friend is simply playing for time
and he's made no bones about that either.

Please, Mr. Hinds, just let him finish.

His partner took another brief when he knew
that this matter was coming on for trial,
something of course which is an outrageous
proposition in any reasonably developed

seeking for leave to amend and supporting

 May I explain?

view that we were particularising.
Now, Your Honours dealt with that in your
decision on the 12th of December and you
said it wasn't particularising; it could
appear to somebody that they were in fact
new charges.
 So what we do is to bring
precisely that same indictment.
 It is the
same in every particular, every word, and we
say if you say it is in fact amending
charges, then we will have to take the step
of seeking an amendment of the old
indictment, that is, the original
indictment.
So, it is that indictment that we seek to
now put forward as an amended indictment
because Your Honours basically told us it
was an amended indictment.
 I mean, you
didn't tell us to seek an amendment of it,
but you did tell us that it was in fact an
amended indictment.
 So we now seek to have
that amended indictment against the Accused.

Okay.

-- obvious to this Tribunal that in both Mr.
Webster's and Mr. Fleming's statements to
the Court, they have not responded in any
way and shared with this Tribunal not a
single allegation that was contained in 1998
with respect to rape involving Mr.
Kajelijeli, nor any allegations with respect
to incitement, distribution of weapons or
lists.
 They've ignored it because it does
not exist.
 Just one other comment.
Mr. Webster says that the Defence could have
proceeded with a motion to dismiss the
indictment if we found that it was
insufficient.
 That is obviously true.
 We
chose not to do so because we knew that at
the end of the Prosecutor's case they would
not be able to overcome a motion to dismiss
at that point.
So we knew that there was insufficient facts
and allegations to support the charges and
that is why we did not move to dismiss.

respect to when you look facially at the
indictment, the indictment should set forth
at least allegations that in fact pointed to
the defendant's actions to support the
charges.
 They in fact attempted to do so
with respect to other allegations and with
respect to other individuals.
 The
indictment is absent, absent any
allegations, any allegations setting forth
any charges with respect to rape with
respect to Mr. Kajelijeli.
They are saying they are under no duty to
provide that.
 Minimally, minimally, they
must provide some specificity with respect
to an allegation of rape, not just simply
that the man is charged with rape without
any facts.
 We are not talking about
evidence that is presented on a basis of
witness statements, but there has to be some
allegations with respect to what Mr.

it was confirmed until the actual hearing

provided to him that is, the witness
statements.
 The Rule actually says that if
you are going to challenge the indictment in
any particular way that constitutes a
preliminary motion, then you must do so
within a certain number
 of days.
Now, you see, he says that he was going to
leave this challenge until, apparently, the
end of our case.
 The Rules simply don't
allow it, that's our proposition, you simply
can't do that.
 He might be able to say
there is insufficient evidence in the case,
not to -- I'm sorry, there is insufficient
evidence to convict his client, but he can't
go back to the indictment.
 If there is a
problem with the indictment then that must
be sorted out within a certain number of
days of the indictment being confirmed.
So what our learned friend said is a total
misconception of the law in respect of this.
I'm sorry I took the time Your Honours, but
that's all we wish to say.

Defence would move to dismiss the specific
counts for failure to provide sufficient

change the contents of the pretrial brief.
Now, there will be many elements that are

would change.
 We thought it wiser at the
end of the day to wait until we knew
whether or not we are entitled to now amend,
or whether or not we had to go back to the
order of the 12th and comply with what Your
Honours directed there.
 The only reason we
haven't complied with what Your Honours
directed there was in respect -- that was
because of this possible amendment.
 We can
tell Your Honours that we could, with some
haste, provide you with a pre-trial brief on
either matter by the end of this week.
However, to ensure that there is no
difficulty whatsoever, we could have a
pre-trial brief done either in this matter
as it presently stands, or on the amendment,
by the 5th of February, that's Monday the
5th of February, and we seek to extend the
time to there.

that we can, depending on what Your Honours

MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a motion to correct an indictment
dated 22nd December.
 Do you want to

said motion?

We will say simply Your Honour, again that
would depend upon what you do with this
present motion because if you allow the
amendment that would become irrelevant, if
you don't allow the amendment it would
become relevant and it's not of great
substance.

necessary, but it will depend upon what Your
Honours determine in respect of the first
motion.

Mr. Hinds, any observations on this item?
As Mr. Fleming pointed out, Your Honour, and
my reading of the motion to --
Microphone.
-- correct seems to be more -- dealing with
some typographical issues and nothing of
substance, I mean, if I'm correct, because I
read Exhibits B and C, and tried to make
heads and tails of it but I -- my sense of
it is that they wanted to insert one page
and they wanted to make some corrections
with some paragraphs, but I didn't see any
substance.
 If I'm misreading this I hope
the Prosecutor alerts me to this.
We can assure our learned friend that there
is nothing of substance.
 It is truly just
trying to sort out some typographical
issues.
 Thank you.
So this is duly noted that this will depend
on our ruling on your initial motion, but we

PRESIDENT:
HINDS:
all agree that there are no matters of
substance being introduced in this latter
motion.
Exactly.
That's fine.
 Thank you.
 So we will
conclude with the motion by Mr. Hinds, which
makes mention of the difficulties he is
encountering in ensuring representation of
his client in connection with difficulties
he is also encountering within his own
chambers and his cooperation with Mr. Harvey
who is taken up with some other brief in
Northern Ireland.
 Can I give the floor to
Mr. Hinds?
May it please the Court.
 I took an unusual
decision to file a motion to withdraw, not
because that was my intent, nor the intent
of my client.
 But I felt in fairness to
this Tribunal and in fairness to Mr.
Kajelijeli, given the chain circumstances
that I found myself in, I could not, in all
fairness to the Tribunal and to my client,

proceed under what I understood to be the
time schedule that this Tribunal was
prepared to adhere to.
 And I recognise my
duties to the Tribunal and my duties to my
client, and I wanted to make sure that
notwithstanding the decision taken by the
Tribunal, I would not jeopardise his
interest.
 And so therefore, I, while making
an application to withdraw, I continued to
do work on his case, including travelling to
Rwanda last week, taking 10 days being away
from my office, coming here, going back to
New York for four days, and then travelling
back here getting here on Saturday night.
This was done to make sure that Mr.
Kajelijeli's interest was not compromised in
any way and also to demonstrate to this
Tribunal that I took my responsibilities
very seriously.
While I was in Kigali, I received notices
and correspondence from this Tribunal
including some scheduling orders.
 In other
words, I was not in New York when the time
frames were set to respond to the

Prosecution's motion for leave to amend.
 I
was in Ruhengeri visiting various locations
there.
 And so therefore, I was faced with a
situation where there were time constraints
being given for me to respond to the brief
while I was in Rwanda with no support staff,
no co-counsel.
 I had to get back to New
York and within less than 24 hours, respond.
But I did so.
This Tribunal is aware that I have a law
firm headquartered in New York City, over
7600 miles from this place.
 I decided to
take this case at great personal sacrifice
because I wanted to do it.
There are lawyers who have agreed to serve
here for various reasons.
 I did so with an
understanding that I could assemble a team
that would allow me the time to be away from
my office for a trial for three to four
months, and I operated up until December of
this year.
Every time this Tribunal scheduled a

proceeding I was here or I had co-counsel
here.
 There hadn't been a single proceeding
that went forward even when we -- there were
joint defendants, that went forward where I
was absent and unexcused.
And so, when I was here in December, even
though my co-counsel had decided to take
another assignment, I felt that I could
still make arrangements, and I made those
representations to the Court.
 But on going
back to New York, I was faced with two other
lawyers who are in my firm who have decided
to take employment elsewhere.
 One of those
lawyers left last week.
 Another lawyer will
be leaving in a couple of weeks.
My office represents the Government of South
Africa in the United States.
 We handle all
bilateral matters between the Government of
South Africa and the United States
Government; trade issues, and so on.
 In
addition to hundreds of other cases that we
deal with, I felt a duty to my client, and I
shared that with him, and a responsibility

to this Court.
 But I knew that with the
very structure of the Defence team
collapsing, I could not continue in this
representation unless I was given additional
time in order to organise myself and so,
therefore, I took the extraordinary step of
putting before this Court an application
setting forth the reasons.
 It was not an
easy decision for me to make.
My duty to this Tribunal and my client does
not include filing bankruptcy.
 Those -- all
of us who are at the bar have practised law
and we understand the problems that lawyers
face from time to time.
 This situation is
extraordinary.
 I have never had this
particular situation in the 27 years that I
have been practising, but I must confess I
have never tried a case requiring me to be
away from my office for months, seven
thousand miles away.
If this matter was within the United States
I would have no problem, I'd be able to
organise myself and most judges in the

United States would understand that.
 You
can make those arrangements.
 But being away
for this amount of time I just couldn't do
it.
 And so, therefore, the application that
I am making is an application to withdraw if
the Court intends to proceed with this trial
today.
 I just simply am not going to be in
a position to do so and to remain here for
three months.
 I would not be able to give
my client undivided attention for the very
reasons that I've set forth in the public
record, and I'm not going to belabour the
points which have been set forth in my
certification.
 I'm willing to entertain any
questions that the Tribunal may have.
MR. PRESIDENT:

Hinds, I followed your submissions and the
effort that you have recently made in

own difficulties that you had been -- you

There is the issue of co-counsel, Mr.
Harvey.
 A decision -- I will have to take a

to 10 days with respect to what to do about
Mr. Harvey.
 I've not been able to
communicate with him.
 I know that this --
the Registrar's office have written to him
through New York.
 He has been e-mailed in
Northern Ireland.
 He has not responded, and
by the time I left New York I have not heard
from him in terms of what he intends to do.

the next 10 days concerning co-counsel and
whether or not it would be Mr. Harvey and
whether or not he could meet the
requirements and the rigours that are
required with respect to moving this case
forward.
 That's one decision that has to be

The other decision that I have to take I
have to hire two new lawyers with respect to
handling the docket of cases that we have in
my office and reorganise along those lines
and then, of course, continuing to prepare
here.
I do not believe that I could be ready to
proceed with this matter; that is, to start
a trial where I would be here for an
extended period of time earlier than June
30th.
 I could be here to deal with motions,
I could be here to deal with opening
statements, I could be here to deal with
cross-examining; for example, an expert
witness or something of that nature in two
months or something like that.

Mr. Hinds, have I got you correctly?
 You
would be prepared to enter into a
compromise?
MR. HINDS:
Yes, the compromise is what I have just
proposed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In other words, if I get you correctly, you
would be ready within the next month or two
to begin the trial; that is, to hear the
opening remarks of the Prosecutor and the
presentation of expert witnesses or others,
perhaps to counter -- cross-examine them.
But so far as factual witnesses are
concerned you would be ready to work on them
later on.
 This is what I got you to say.

witnesses, if there is one expert witness to

be presented at that time, I would be in a
position to cross-examine an expert witness
if we are talking about some time in March.
That's what I'm saying, yes.
Prosecutor, what is your reaction?
If there was anything we say, we say in this
context:
 First, we acknowledge the right of
an accused to have an effective Defence.
Second, we would concede that to have
somebody new coming and start all over again
would probably be a lengthier process than
our learned friend remaining in the case.
So we would have to concede that it would be
better to have our learned friend to remain
in the case.
 And third, we also acknowledge
the fact that we've brought the motion that
we have first this morning.
 So anything we
say is within those context, and given the
circumstances it seems that we too would be
able to effect a compromise to get the trial
going.

say about experts:
 As the matter is pleaded
and as it is set up presently, there is a
6(3) allegation thereof; the effect command
responsibility.
 We are seriously
considering that because of the sufficiency
of the evidence of Mr. Kajelijeli's personal
involvement, that we won't proceed with
that, but rather we will proceed under 6(1).
If we make that decision, and we will do so
within the next couple of days, there
probably won't be a great need for an expert
that's why I went through that background,
because the expert would give principally
evidence in respect of the structures of
society and the structures of local
government, and so on.
The second thing we would say is this, that
if there is time, and my learned friend Ms.
Ojemeni foreshadowed this on the 12th of
December, we would consider it to be
appropriate to bring a motion for judicial
notice of certain things.
 Now, before we
did that, of course, we would communicate
further with our learned friend about

matters such as, for example, whether we had
to prove genocide; perhaps another reason
why we might call an expert.
 If our learned
friend was opposed to any admission of
genocide we would immediately bring a motion
for Your Honours to take judicial notice of
some of those matters.
 So we can usefully
use the time to save time at trial.
Now, having said all of that, and we are
prepared to obviously compromise in respect
of all of these things, there are some
matters which we must comment upon in our
learned friend's motion.
 I will not repeat
the matters that I have already commented
upon about Mr. Harvey taking another brief,
we have great concerns about that.
 We, of
course, have great sympathy for our learned
friend because we who practice law know the
difficulties that can arise without
involvement or complicity, and we
acknowledge our learned friend's position.
However, we must make some comments about
withdrawal of counsel and that is, and we

simply say the jurisprudence is that you can
only withdraw in exceptional circumstances.
It would be our argument that there are no
exceptional circumstances shown.
 Personal
comfort or personal pecuniary position
should not come before the obligation to the
client or to this Tribunal.
 We don't want
to belabour those propositions anymore.
There are propositions in respect of
language, that Mr. Harvey was a very fluent
French speaker and was obviously the person
who was translating and interpreting.
 We go
back to the beginning of this matter when
our learned friend Mr. Hinds was actually
appointed.
 Your Honours will recall that
this is being litigated but the simple
circumstances were these:
 Mr. Kajelijeli
insisted upon having Mr. Hinds.
 The
question of language was specifically raised
by the Registrar and this is well before Mr.
Harvey became involved as co-counsel, and
that issue was set to one side.
 Mr.
Kajelijeli himself said it wasn't an issue.
So we submit that it can't be made an issue

now in respect of the argument being run.
The fact that it is a long way from home and
therefore stretches resources in
communications and everything else, we would
submit this is inadequate argument because
the brief is taken upon that basis.
 So we
would submit that there is no special
situation shown which would permit a
withdrawal.
Now having said all of that, we come back to
the point where we would agree that the best
way forward is for our learned friend, Mr.
Hinds, to stay in the case and try to find
ways that we can expedite the matter from
there.
 And we have at least one or two, one
being that we will review the indictment and
finally make a decision on 6(3), and second,
negotiating with our learned friend in
respect of matters that we might not have to
prove; if not, then we will bring a motion
for judicial notice within a very short
period of time.
 And Your Honours, we are
prepared to meet any reasonable timetable in

respect of the matter.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, the Chamber was thinking
that in spite of his motion, Professor Hinds
has described practical problems that he has
and that we've understood that he was
prepared to come back to revise his motion
rather, if we could together, come up with a
compromise solution that would enable us to
start a trial, cross-examining witnesses, et
cetera, even if it means that later on he is
able to cross-examine the factual witnesses
of the Prosecution.
We were thinking about those compromise
which appears to us to be constructive.
 I
believe that if we leave it at that, we can
find a solution so that -- this is the
reason why I should like to propose that we
deliberate.
 It is not impossible, with the
agreement of my colleagues, that if we see a
possible date in March that we call the
Judges, the Prosecutor and the Defence in a
public hearing in my office so that we find
a constructive compromise.

Now, I think it is out of question now to
talk about the law, and as far as the author
of the motion is ready to relinquish it if
we find a solution that allows him to defend
his client and to face other practical
difficulties that confront him.
 I think
that that is a good direction, a
constructive direction as compared to
engaging in a debate.
 So that Mr.

come back to it later to see what decision
we are going to take on your motion and the
time factor because there are other
obligations under Rule 50.
