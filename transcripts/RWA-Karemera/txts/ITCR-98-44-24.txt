MR. FLEMING:

Thank you, Your Honours.

Your Honours might

20

well be aware that there are some

21

difficulties with proceeding today.

22

difficulties arise as a result of two

23

things.

24

and second, there are ongoing difficulties

25

with the investigations into the alibi and

witnesses.

2
3

If I may deal with the first issue first.

4

Your Honours may or may not be aware that,

5

IBUKA, one of the organisations which

6

represents the victims and witnesses in this

7

Court, has put an embargo upon witnesses

8

travelling here.

9

that we wanted to call in this session are

10

As a result, two witnesses

not going to be here.

11
12

Your Honours, it becomes an unsatisfactory

13

situation, given that this Court doesn't

14

have the coercive powers that a domestic

15

court would have.

16

are some things that can be done but those

17

proceedings are so convoluted and difficult,

18

there could be of no assistance in an

19

emergency such as we have here.

We are aware that there

20
21

Some steps have been taken and the

22

Registrar, I understand, has written

23

recently to the Minister of Justice,

24

outlining the difficulties and requesting

25

that some action be taken to ensure that the

8 APRIL 2002
witnesses come.

2
3

So, the problems result from not having the

4

coercive powers and then having a

5

misconception of what is actually happening

6

in this Court, a misconception which is so

7

ingrained is going to be very difficult to

8

remove.

9
10

The second reason why there are no witnesses

11

here, is that, it was hoped that we could

12

have alibi witnesses dealt with in these

13

sittings.

14

call in response to alibi material, we would

15

be able to do it, and we are not able to do

16

that.

Any evidence that we wanted to

19

little in history.

20

that during cross-examination of one of our

21

very early witnesses, when material wasn't

22

being put to that witness as one would do in

23

the common law system, I raised the issue

24

directly as to whether or not there was

25

going to be alibi evidence and the answer

Your Honours will recall

SITHEMBISO MOYO - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

KAJELIJELI

8 APRIL 2002

1

was "Yes" and no alibi statement had been

2

given to us or notice of alibi had been

3

given to us, because Defence counsel were

4

relying upon the exception in the Rule,

5

namely; that even if they don't give us the

6

material, they won't be excluded from

7

relying upon it.

8

ruling by this Honourable Court, for them to

9

provide us with the notice of alibi.

Now, that gave rise to a

That

10

was done, but no details were given to us of

11

who those witnesses were.

12

material suggesting who they were, there was

13

no order in place in respect of the witness

14

protection of those witnesses.

15

that didn't occur until well into January of

16

this year.

When there was

So, all of

19

called any evidence in rebuttal during our

20

case as the rules anticipate.

21

able to do that because we haven't spoken to

22

all of the alibi witnesses, we have spoken

23

to some, but not all.

We were not

hampered by events that are entirely out of

2

the control, even if this Court -- and that

3

is the eruption of the volcano in Ngoma, and

4

we have been precluded from pursuing some of

5

the witnesses because of the chaos that

6

pursued there.

7

presently, there are further difficulties

8

going into the areas of Ruhengeri and

9

Gisenyi for the same reason.

10

And, in addition to that,

So, all of our

best endeavours have come to naught.

11
12

We notified this Honourable Court on the

13

19th of March, it's here that we wouldn't

require all of the time that had been set

15

aside because we then only had two

Your Honours, two things remain to be said.

23

First, we will review the situation in the

24

next 24 or 48 hours, to see whether or not

25

we can do without these two witnesses, and
SITHEMBISO MOYO - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

KAJELIJELI

8 APRIL 2002

1

we will come back to this Court and either

2

inform the Court that we need those two

3

witnesses or that we close our case.

4

Second, we won't be able to call the alibi

5

witnesses in the course of this case.

6

I mean by the alibi witnesses -- I don't

7

mean my learned friend's witnesses, but,

8

rather, those witnesses who would rebut the

9

alibi.

What

We will asking at the appropriate

10

time because of the circumstances, that we

11

call any evidence in rebuttal at the close

12

of the accused's case.

13
14

Your Honours, we can't take the matter any

15

further than that, but, my learned leader

16

wants to address the Court on some matters

17

as well.

18

MR. PRESIDENT:

19

Thank you, Mr. Fleming.

20
21
22

Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. DEL PONTE:

23

Thank you, Mr. President.

It is simply to

24

add on to the points made by my colleague.

25

The two witnesses who are not appearing
SITHEMBISO MOYO - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

KAJELIJELI

8 APRIL 2002

1

today, were contacted on the 5th of April,

2

that is last time, to try to persuade them

3

to come.

4

they did not come because they heard over

5

the radio that the association of survivors

6

had indicated that they should not appear.

7

In other words, they are absolutely ready to

8

appear but they are waiting for it to be

9

said over the radio that witnesses can

And they said unequivocally, that

10

appear before this Court.

Just to tell you

11

that all had been done on our part, to

12

ensure that these witnesses appear.

13
14

On the letter of the registry, a response

15

had been addressed to the registry and I

16

have a copy of a letter from the Rwandan

17

Minister of Justice dated 5th April and it

18

reached the Tribunal on the 6th of April,

19

and it is stated by the Minister of Justice

20

that, well, his services are absolutely

21

ready to assist our institution -- your

22

institution to resolve the delicate problem

23

that slows down the course of justice and I

24

am quoting: "It would be proper, says the

25

Minister of Justice, for us to reflect
SITHEMBISO MOYO - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
8

KAJELIJELI

8 APRIL 2002

1

together as to concrete ways and means to

2

expedite the course of justice".

3
4

In other words, therefore, the Minister of

5

Justice, Mr. President, is asking that we

6

re-establish dialogue, taking into account

7

the positions adopted by each of the parties

8

and the concerns that I have expressed, by

9

those parties.

10

That is what I have to say

with respect to that problem.

11
12

As far as I am concerned, I also would like

13

to say that the appearance of witnesses is

14

crucial here.

15

but there would be other trials that are

16

going on and that would be facing the same

17

problem.

We are talking about it today

18
19

And so, it is important that we monitor

20

closely and deploy our efforts to ensure

21

that these victims and witnesses appear.

22

Obviously, we know that it is incumbent on

23

the Tribunal to protect the witnesses,

24

particularly under Article 21 of the

25

Statute.

There is also a moral obligation on our

part; we are all here to work along those

lines.

registry would need our services, our

5

contribution, we would be prepared to

6

discuss with that association.

And, it is my view that if the

7
8

Mr. President, that is not the point I

9

wanted to make with respect to the need for

10

witnesses.

11

within 24/48 hours to provide an answer.

12

Maybe we might come to a situation where we

13

might close our case, better we still feel

14

that we should maintain our request for

15

cooperation.

Mr. Fleming.

Of course, we were not aware until this

The problem with the alibi witnesses, I

think that Mr. Fleming is correct, as he

17

traced the history and certainly what was

18

put on the record by us with respect to

19

that.

20
21

The trial began in July and on July 9th, we

22

attended about four days after this trial

23

began, pursuant to the order of this Court,

24

we filed a notice of alibi.

we set out the parameters as is established

Quite frankly, looking at Rule 85 and

particularly Rule 85(a) it was our -- we

certainly didn't see that the Prosecutor was

prejudiced in any way with respect to

presenting any rebuttal with respect to our

alibi testimony.

felt and we agreed that we should provide a

understand that Mr. Fleming would be making

the necessary application.

say, from the standpoint of the Defence,

that we would not oppose that.

they have a right to rebuttal testimony,

at this point.

The problem of cooperation between the

Rwandan -- the sovereign state of Rwanda and

15

this Tribunal, pursuant to the cooperation

agreements signed by the United Nations and

I join with Madam Prosecutor in the

application for cooperation.

adequate cooperation.

we think that there should be cooperation in

we have, given the fact that we believe that

I stand here today, joined with the

and we anticipate even more problems for the

There will be different types of

fact that he has to have access to Defence

21

witnesses.

22
23

Now, specifically with respect to access to

24

the files of witnesses, witnesses who are

25

accused before the Rwandan Courts and for
SITHEMBISO MOYO - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
17

KAJELIJELI

8 APRIL 2002

1

whom investigations are going on, I had

2

raised this matter with Prosecutor Gahima

3

and it would appear that indiscriminate

4

access to files is not allowed.

5

we have to live with this because in

6

national systems, ongoing investigations

7

prohibit a third party from having

8

indiscriminate access to files.

This is --

9
10

What can be done, Mr. President, is for the

11

Defence to clearly indicate what it would

12

like to have as documents that would be

13

useful to them, you know -- specific

14

requests like minutes or witness statements

15

or if they are aware of any other

16

documentation, but then they have to be

17

specific and I could personally insist with

18

the Prosecutor Gahima a sort of rogatoire

19

commission, requiring assistance, mandatory

20

assistance from the Prosecutor or the State

21

Prosecutor.

that Defence counsel faces a lot of

understand that because I personally faced a

question to you, sir.

7

solution, for instance, to ask that these

8

witnesses be transferred to Arusha so that

9

the Defence would have free access without

I can

Wouldn't it be some

10

any interference by anyone to create an

11

impediment to such access?

12
13

I am aware, Mr. President, that this is a

14

matter that may be or may not be possible in

technical terms, but, it is aimed at

16

ensuring that the Defence have free access

to these witnesses.

in touch with our contact, the Rwandan

authorities and it would therefore not be

necessary for the Defence to embark on a

trip to Rwanda, you know -- so that if they

come here, for instance, they would have

access to these witnesses.

possible suggestion that I have, that is

with respect to alibi and alibi evidence.

request that we made concerning documents,

19

that is the document request, so that she

20

may be able to look at the specificity of

21

the request that we made, because I agree

22

with her, that we should not be talking

23

about wholesale looking through any files.

24

But we specifically requested documents

25

relating to particular witnesses and not

just all documents, we were specific with

respect to confessions that were made,

statements that were made by those witnesses

and those of witnesses who appeared here, to

testify for the Prosecution.

6

believe, that we are entitled to that

7

information and the information was fairly

8

specific.

9

there are any security concerns raised by

10

the Rwandan authorities that they need to

11

redact some information or that some

12

information -- they do not want us to have,

13

but the Court may, in fact, look at it in

camera, we have no problem with that either.

And, we

And, we would even be prepared if

If we can work these things out, but, just

17

simply not to provide the document, forces

18

us at some point in time to move for a

19

motion to strike the testimony of all those

20

witnesses, because, right now, what we have

21

is part of their testimony and not all of

22

it.

So, if we can find some way of sorting out

25

these problems, again, in the spirit of

cooperation, we stand willing and able to

Thank you.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor Hinds.

5
6

We would like to thank the Prosecution and

7

indeed, the Defence for the comments that

8

have been made in the course of this

9

session.

10

We would like to make the

following observations.

11
12

The first one with regard to the case of --

13

to the issue of alibi, the Prosecution and

14

the Defence, Professor Hinds has clearly

15

indicated what possible course of action

16

that could be taken.

17

how things shape up in the course of the

18

remaining part of this trial.

19

most that we can say on that particular

20

issue.

We will wait to see

That is the

21
22

With regard to the issue of the witnesses

23

who are linked up to this particular

24

session, we take note of the observation as

25

put across by the Prosecution and, indeed,

1

the observation made by the Defence on this

2

particular question.

3
4

We would like to observe first, that,

5

indeed, in the course of collective work and

6

collective responsibility to do justice in

7

matters before this Tribunal, and, indeed,

8

for the course of international criminal

9

justice, the cooperation and the assistance

10

of states in whole is of utmost importance

11

and necessary and that, of course, would

12

include the Rwandan state.

13
14

So, we will urge that all that needs to be

15

done, to facilitate and to enhance the

16

cooperation of states in this regard, should

17

be done and all efforts should be undertaken

18

to see that it is done, and, in that regard,

19

we would appreciate any action that is being

20

taken by the registry, as well as in this

21

particular aspect, by the Prosecution on

22

their side, to ensure that these particular

23

witnesses are able to come and testify

24

before the Tribunal.

We will say no more on this matter at this

2

particular stage, and the Trial Chamber is

3

willing and thus grant a requested time by

4

the Prosecution as indicated by Mr. Fleming,

5

to deal with this issue in the next 20 or 48

6

hours.

7

happens.

We will wait to be appraised of what

8
9

If there is further time required, we will

10

see what needs to be done, because it is an

11

extremely important matter, it can't just be

12

left like that.

13
14

Thirdly, the Trial Chamber appreciates

15

tremendously the thought that has been put

16

across by the Prosecution, Madam Prosecutor

17

herself and, indeed, as reacted on by the

18

Defence, Professor Hinds, with regard as to

19

what could be done to deal with some of the

20

issues that have been outstanding and keep

21

cropping up here and there, in the course of

22

the proceedings before this particular

23

Trial Chamber, and, indeed, before the

24

Tribunal as a whole.

So, I hope they will be crystalised.

It

would interest to see how they develop on

3

the ground and see how they can be

4

ventilated before the Trial Chamber.

5
6

We seriously take note of those observations

7

with the appreciation and we hope they will

8

be followed up.

9
10

So, that being the case, the proceedings as

11

far as today end here and we wait to be

12

appraised of the developments with regard to

13

the two witnesses in the course of the time.

14
15

Mr. Fleming, should we come back here on

16

Wednesday, would that be sufficient time?

17

We'd like to see how things are developing

18

on the ground with regard to the witnesses.

19

MR. FLEMING:

20

Your Honours, there might be some

21

difficulties with that.

suggested to me that I was somewhat

optimistic in my time frame.

I know, perhaps -- how much time?

MR. FLEMING:

I realise that we have to bring the issues

to a conclusion.

8
9

Your Honour, we may be able to inform the

10

Court as to whether or not we need these

11

witnesses quickly, and that would bring that

issue to a head.

MR. PRESIDENT:

When do you plan to do that?
MR. FLEMING:

16
17

We can do that within the 24 hours.
MR. PRESIDENT:

possible information.

MR. FLEMING:

Thank you, Your Honours.

There is one

associated issue.

that Professor Hinds has requested that --
