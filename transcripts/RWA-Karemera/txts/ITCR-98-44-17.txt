We could start, the

that relate to how we proceed.

is a motion that has been made by

The other issue that I want to deal with

relates to disclosures which impart on how

we proceed here.

you indicated that you will be familiar with

our motion to the Prosecutor's response and

our response to the Prosecutor's motion.

And I just want to set on the record where

17

we are at this point, and where the Defence

18

is looking for some response from the

19

Prosecutor.

20

Mr. Fleming on some collateral issues

21

related to that day before yesterday, but

22

let me make just make the point.

Yesterday, Your Honour,

I had some discussions with

23
24

We received disclosure statements, that is,

25

witness statements.

And we requested from

the Prosecutor original, original either

2

statements that were made or any tapes that

3

perhaps were made of the interviews in the

4

original language.

5

was interviewed and spoke in Kinyarwanda or

6

spoke in French, or spoke in English, we

7

just wanted to know what the original

8

language was for each of the witnesses, and

9

we wanted a copy of the interviews in the

Whether the individual

10

original language.

We were told by the

11

Prosecutor's Office that, first of all,

12

there were no tape recordings.

13

interviews were done in which the

14

translations were simultaneously taken, in

15

fact, there were no notes.

16

know if there was a stenographer, but what I

17

was told was that there was no translation

18

from -- there was no recordings made in the

19

original language if it was Kinyarwanda, and

20

then there would have been a document or

21

tape of that, which then was translated.

That the

I do not even

22
23

So, the next question that we have was

24

whether or not, the -- if there was this

25

interview done, we wanted to know which of
HARUNA FARAGE - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

KAJELIJELI

4 JULY 2001

1

the documents that we received would be the

2

documents that would be relied upon for

3

purposes of the proceedings.

4

documents had signatures on them, others did

5

not.

6

were signed, were in fact the documents that

7

the Prosecutor considered to be the original

8

documents.

Because some

We were told that the documents that

9
10

Now, we just want to be clear and for it to

11

be put on the record concerning what the

12

Prosecutor's position is with respect to

13

whether or not there are any documents, any

14

tapes, any transcripts in Kinyarwanda.

15

I raised that because this Court knows, you

16

Judge Sekule knows, we dealt with the

17

question of tapes early in this trial.

18

Prosecutor said to this Court there were no

19

tapes.

20

and over, and then we found out later on, in

21

fact there were tapes, and the tapes were

22

some place else.

23

we get the Prosecutor on the record, they

24

said there are no tapes.

fine.

They swore to it.

And

The

I want to make sure that

If it is, that is

HARUNA FARAGE - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

KAJELIJELI

4 JULY 2001

The second issue we have raised.

We have

3

indicated that in going through the witness

4

statements, when you compare the English and

5

the French in some cases on critical issues,

6

the versions are not the same.

7

said, tell us which statements that you

8

would be relying upon are the statements of

9

the witness.

So, we have

Because in looking at some of

10

these witness statements, we were not able

11

to decipher which was the statement of the

12

witness given, there were in some case

13

omissions, and in some cases there were

14

statements made that were not contained in

15

either the English or the French.

16
17

I had some preliminary discussions with the

18

Prosecutor's Office in this regard, but I

19

could not give them some details with

20

respect to that matter, only because our

21

investigator who compiled that information,

22

who is bilingual was in Zimbabwe.

23

give at least one example on a critical

24

witness that we wanted to deal with.

25

is a problem that only impacts as a

But I can

That

KAJELIJELI

4 JULY 2001

1

particular witness will take the stand.

And

2

we perhaps can deal with this issue as we go

3

along on a witness by witness basis.

4

is an issue that is causing us some concern

5

because we need to know what is the

6

statement that we can rely upon from the

7

witness.

But it

8
9

For example, there is a witness by the

10

pseudonym GBW, and in particular, there is

11

an unredacted statement of GBW of June 8 of

12

1999, and specifically, at page 1149, or as

13

stamped in the Prosecutor's page number

14

K01379 -- I don't know whether that's a 4 or

15

70, but it's 1149, which is in handwriting

16

at the top right-hand corner.

17

French, it is 1152 handwriting in the

18

corner.

19

last paragraph in English says, "After the

20

massacre, I hid in the bush around the

21

church where I suffered hunger and grief.

reading because he does not read any

17

with respect to these inconsistencies.

that what I have in English is exactly what

is in the French.

item.

Is it the French, is it the English
Let me proceed.

The next

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
PROFESSOR HINDS:

12

The next item that I have raised relates to

13

Rule 68.

14

because we believe that the Prosecutor is

15

under a duty to provide information that

16

would be either exculpatory or may relate to

17

the credibility of any of their witnesses.

18

Now, they intend to call about four

19

convicts, individuals who are prisoners and

20

from Ruhengeri, individuals who have a sword

21

of Damocles hanging over their necks.

22

Individuals who may be even awaiting

23

sentences based upon whatever they say here.

And it's a peculiar situation

24
25

Our position, and I think it is a reasonable
HARUNA FARAGE - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
11

KAJELIJELI

4 JULY 2001

1

position, is that if there has been any

2

cooperation agreements between these

3

prisoners, the ICTR or the Government of

4

Rwanda in exchange for their testimony, we

5

are entitled to it.

6

I have been told unofficially that -- from

Mr. Fleming, that they were not aware of any

such statements.

9

the request and asking for that information,

We are asking for it.

I just simply repeating

10

if it exists, so that we be on the record.

11

Of course, it is very critical to us,

12

because our position is, it relates to the

13

issue of credibility of these witnesses in

14

the same vein.

15

another branch of our motion.

And we raised this issue in

16
17

We requested copies of any trial testimony,

18

any plea agreements, any statements that

19

were made by these convicts during their

20

trial, because these are individuals who are

21

on trial, and if they mention our client at

all.

expeditious way of us proceeding forward

would be to go through the Prosecutor's

We have

clearly, they don't have it, and

That

pursuant to Rule 68 that we might -- that

might affect the credibility of one of their

John Stewart Mill said in his work on

can be rightly exercised over any member of

"The only purpose for which power

to prevent harm to others.

His own good,

2

either physical or moral is not a sufficient

warrant."

The evidence in this case will disclose that

Juvenal Kajelijeli exercised power in a

7

wanton and undisciplined manner not for the

8

good of anybody, but rather for his own evil

9

purposes.

10
11

William Pitt, the elder in 1770, stated this

proposition: "Unlimited power is up to

corrupt to the minds of those who possessed

it."

15
16

The evidence in this case would show that

17

Juvenal Kajelijeli had unlimited power in

18

the small part of Rwanda, and he ran rampant

19

with that power.

20
21

Lord Acton in 1904 said: "Power tends to

22

corrupt, and absolute power corrupt

absolutely."

Juvenal Kajelijeli, the Accused in this

6

Your Honours, there is no humane system on

the face of the earth who can and will

8

tolerate humanity -- inhumanity as we have

A humane system is one

11

all issues, and reaches a conclusion in

12

which citizens can experience peace and

liberty.

The contrast to humane society is a

Our contention

is that not a single one of these

witnesses ever contacted the Prosecutor's

office prior to this man's arrests.

They, in fact went out with his name on a

list talking to people, trying to figure

out, can we -- how can we hold this man?

And this is a context under which we say

17

that you must evaluate the credibility of

these witnesses, and just ask them, when

19

were you first contacted.

20

when Mr. Kajelijeli was arrested, I mean

the record is so clear, every time I

Sorry.
PROFESSOR HINDS:

Your Honour, I don't know what document

he is showing the witness.

16

fundamentally before he shows the witness

17

any document that the Defence ought be

18

able to look at it so that we know what

19

he is presenting to the witness.

20

I think that

Yes, is the document familiar to the

22

Defence, and maybe you can draw the

attention to it.

1

Your Honour, the document contains purely

2

protected information to identify this

3

witness for the purposes of the Court.

4

He will identify the fact that his name

5

and details were on the document and then

6

I will hand it to the Court and ask that

7

it be sealed after my learned friend has

8

seen it.

9

MR. PRESIDENT:

10
11

Okay, do you follow?.
PROFESSOR HINDS:

12

I know what he is saying but how do I

know what he is handing the witness.

present it to the Court.

makes a decision with respect to this

matter but he has just walked up and

handed the witness the document.

traditional method of tendering a

witness to identify it and then for it to

be shown to the other side before it's

finally delivered to the Court as an

4

exhibit, then my learned friend can make

5

any objections he wishes, to the

document.

witness to identify the document.

10

However, I simply want this

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Yes, Mr. Hinds.

PROFESSOR HINDS:

11

I do not know whether that is an

12

Internationally recognized standard.

13

certainly know that before the highest

14

Tribunals in the United States before any

15

document is handed to a witness the

16

document is shown to the defence and even

17

before the witness sees it, and the

18

reason for that is that if there is any

19

objection the witness is not contaminated

20

by seeing something and so if it is what

21

this particular document purports to be,

22

is in fact true even if the Prosecutor's

23

position is that they do not want the

24

defence to see, certainly the Court

25

should see it first to make sure that it

purports to be what it is, but just

2

simply handing the document to the

3

witness without the Defence knowing what

4

it is, without the Court knowing what it

5

is, and I am raising an objection with

6

respect to that procedure.

7

MR. FLEMING:

Court going to know what it is, unless

in some place as a self-propelled

any objections to, and it will go to Your

One which finds its way in,

any value to you, Your Honours, because

2

you won't know what it is, until he has

3

identified it.

4

MR. PRESIDENT:

5

Because ultimately it is the --

6

ultimately if the document is to be put

7

into evidence it would depend on what the

8

witness has been able to identify but I

9

think it shouldn't be a problem.

If you

can have the document shown and, you

know, and then move forward.

after that of course, subject to what you

have said that this is a -- it has got

for him to put any document --

self-evident by looking at what it is.

5

A.

When I met him for the first time in

6

1974, he was working with the priests.

He was a carpenter in Busongo.

Let me

B-U-S-O-G-O.

9

Q.

From 1974 until 1994.

my commune in which I was residing.

5

changed the commune in 1994 when I had to

seek refugee somewhere.

7

Q.

I

All right, and is your commune near the

8

place where Mr. Kajelijeli lived from

9

1974 until 1994?

10

A.

In actual fact it was the same commune.

11

It's just that these were different

12

sectors.

Thank you.

Do you know Joseph Nzirorera?

14

A.

Did you at any time attend any meetings

23
24

It was an

4

Q.

Who gave that order?

5

A.

The order was issued by the Bourgmestre

6

and then conveyed right up to the

7

conseiller and to members of the cellule.

8

In turn they were the ones who told the

9

population that it was necessary to

10

attend the meetings.
Q.

What particular Bourgmestre are you

12

speaking about when you said that the

order was given by the Bourgmestre?

4 JULY 2001

When you went to meetings of the MRND was
Mr. Kajelijeli present?

A.

He was often present at the meetings.

5

Often he was the one who chaired the

6

meetings until the President of MRND was

7

appointed, and even at that time he was

8

present and he often took the floor

9

during the meetings.

10

Q.

11
12

When you say the President of the MRND
was appointed, to whom are you referring?

A.

As Kajelijeli was Bourgmestre at the time

13

and the legislation in force did not

14

allow for an accumulation of positions.

15

In other words the Bourgmestre and

President of the MRND, it was necessary

Did you ever hear Nzirorera speak of

Kajelijeli at any of these meetings that

5

you attended?

6

A.

7

No, he didn't talk about him because he
himself was present at the meetings.

8

Q.

Do you know what the Interahamwe is?

9

A.

The word Interahamwe means young people

10

strong, vigorous, recruited among the

Can we then go back to the Interahamwe.

The Interahamwe for whom the Bourgmestre

Q.

Yes.

A.

Kajelijeli's bar was not yet well known

It had just been built or

How many Interahamwe were there, do you

Could you hear any discussion between
Kajelijeli and the Interahamwe?

A.

I was at about 50 metres from those persons

them is that he asked them to go and dress

18

up and to start work.

19

Q.

Did anybody say what the work was?

meant killing and, indeed, they started with

7

Q.

Did you recognise any of the vehicles

travelling towards that place that you

10

A.

Among the vehicles, I was able to recognise

11

a vehicle belonging to the commune, the

PROFESSOR HINDS:

2

I know that Mr. Fleming expected me to rise.

3

I don't know whether or not he wanted just

4

to rest a while he raised the issue, but,

5

Your Honour, we would like showing, with

6

respect to the nature of the proofs before

7

this witness testifies with respect to 1991.

8
9

Our objection, of course, with respect to in

10

limine limiting the scope of this testimony

11

is because we know that the rulings of this

12

Chamber and other Chambers with respect to

13

any evidence of any crimes that were

14

committed prior to the jurisdiction of this

Tribunal is inadmissible for purposes of

16

proof in the guilt of the defendant in --

under the jurisdiction -- the temporal

jurisdiction of the Tribunal except on the

19

issue of conspiracy where the Courts have

20

allowed evidence of acts or meetings that

21

occurred before the temporal jurisdiction.

some showing of where he is going, what he

intends to elicit before we proceed.

can see it, of course at the outset, that

the temporal jurisdiction is 1994.

can see it that we can't prove the guilt of

Mr. Kajelijeli by reference to anything --

15

an event that occurred before 1994, except

in narrow circumstances, and I accept what

is preceding in, and so I mean, even based

22

upon his theory where he talks about the

respond to that?

2

between that period.

3

MR. PRESIDENT:

4

It appears, I think, from both sides,

5

that there is no serious dispute with regard

6

to the legal position regarding making

reference to events prior to 1994 for

context or in the manner that has been

outlined.

reasons behind, why they want to go back to

prior to 1991, within the premises of

2

On the question of context which is

4

different, there is an issue as to the

5

probative value of the evidence versus the

prejudicial impact and it is on that

7

particular issue that we are concerned,

because if we are now dealing with questions

9

beyond whom he was meeting with, and who

knew whom and that sort of thing and whether

there were meetings and agreements etcetera.

We are not objecting to that, but where you

say context and now they are talking about

carry out something within the commune, he

formation of the Interahamwe.

financial resources.

He was a

to those young people, monies from Nzirorera

19

for -- during feasts or the purchase of

weapons used by the Interahamwe.
