MR. PRESIDENT:

Court resumes the sitting.

For the record,

Prosecution is represented by Mr. Ken

Fleming, and Defence by Professor Hinds,

just for the record.

know from Professor Hinds when he would be

As agreed yesterday, we are sitting today to

10

in a position to cross-examine the

11

investigator who appeared here yesterday,

12

who was brought here by the Prosecution

13

yesterday.

14

confirm some information that got to us

15

semiofficially; namely, that he would be

16

ready to cross-examine the investigator

17

tomorrow morning.

18

Professor Hinds?

19

I would like Professor Hinds to

Is that correct,

MR. HINDS:

20

Yes, Your Honour.

First of all, I would

21

like to state that Mr. Kajelijeli is not

22

here today and we waive his appearance.

23

fact, I spoke -- I worked with

24

Mr. Kajelijeli up until 5 o'clock last night

25

at the jail on the documents.

And when I

In

KAJELIJELI

14 MARCH 2001

1

realised that we would not be finished and

2

we still had two other exhibits to go

3

through, I informed him that I was going to

4

speak to Dr. Mindua and to see if we could

5

have this session adjourned until Thursday

6

morning so as not to inconvenience the Court

7

to convene, to just simply adjourn.

8

told him that is what I was going to do.

9

assumption is that he informed jail

And I
My

10

officials that that is what was going to

11

happen, and that is why he is not here.

12
13
14

we waive his appearance.

15

we had our session in court I felt that I

16

needed to consult with Mr. Kajelijeli

17

concerning the exhibits which were

18

introduced for identification.

19

Court realises, the exhibits -- primarily

20

maps, locations and that sort of thing that

21

essentially are from three communes in

22
23
24

Ruhengeri.

Now, with respect to our situation:

There's

Could the

MR. HINDS:

6

Yes, as I was saying, Your Honours, the

7

nature of the exhibits are maps which

8

specify locations of particular buildings

9

and so on in three communes in Ruhengeri.

10

And we need Mr. Kajelijeli to go over each

11

of those to deal with the question of

12

accuracy, first of all, and then to see

13

whether or not we raise any objections on

14

that basis.

indices indicating sources of information.

18

you know, are in English and so we had to

19

translate each of the documents for him and

then for him to begin to give me his

21

assessment of it, which has taken a longer

period of time.

And then there have been some

Part of our problem is that the exhibits, as

Mr. Fleming has informed me yesterday at the

the translated French copy is supposed to be

2

faxed to his office even as we speak and,

3

hopefully, if we get that, we will be able

4

to work throughout the day today; but, even

5

without the French copy, we think we would

6

be completed with our work today and be

ready to proceed in the morning.
I am not saying that we will cross-examine,

10

but we will be in a position, if we are

11

going to do that.

12

to cross-examine, I would inform the Court

13

by the end of today in any event.

14

And if we are not going

MR. PRESIDENT:

15

So, if I have understood you, we should

16

resume normally tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.

17

Well, it will depend whether you

18

cross-examine or not; is that correct?

19

MR. HINDS:

20
21

That's correct, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:

Mr. Prosecutor?
MR. FLEMING:

Exhibits, 1 to 4, be sealed, except, of

course, for all -- except -- sealed for all

purposes, except that required by the

Tribunal and by our learned friends?

MR. PRESIDENT:

12

After having deliberated briefly, Chamber

13

directs that Exhibits No. 1 to 4, which were

14

placed under seal for purposes of

15

identification -- or, sorry, which were

16

submitted for identification, be placed

17

under seal for purposes of security in view

of the names mentioned in those documents.
