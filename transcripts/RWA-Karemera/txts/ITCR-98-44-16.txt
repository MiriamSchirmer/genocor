BY MR. HINDS:
Q.

Mr. Lucassen, my name is Lennox Hinds and I

11

represent Mr. Kajelijeli.

12

Tuesday that you were employed by the ICTR

13

for a little over two years, is that

14

correct?

15

A.

You testified on

That's correct, in the sense that my

16

contract as an employee with ICTR is

17

currently, I think, a year and a half, and

18

before that I had a current (sic) with my

19

government from Holland, and I worked for

20

ICTR during eight months.

21

Q.

But your total employment, you testified,

22

exceeds two years; is that correct, with the

23

ICTR?

24

A.

That is correct.

25

Q.

I will be posing several questions to you.
VERNA BUTLER - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - CHAMBER II

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

1

I'd like you to listen very carefully to my

2

questions and just answer those questions

3

and nothing more.

4

A.

I understand that.

5

Q.

Okay.

Do you understand that?

Now, with respect to your employment

6

by the ICTR, you testified that your only

7

knowledge of Mr. Kajelijeli, or about this

8

case, began in January of this year; is that

9

correct?

10

A.

That's correct.

11

Q.

And you were assigned by the Prosecutor's

12

Office; is that correct?

13

A.

That is correct.

14

Q.

And you worked for the Prosecutor; is that

15

correct?

16

A.

That is correct.

17

Q.

And part of your responsibility was to

18

gather evidence to support the indictment

19

against Mr. Kajelijeli; is that correct?

20

A.

My orders were more specific than that.

21

Q.

Were your orders to take some photographs in

22

the area of Ruhengeri?

23

A.

That is correct.

24

Q.

Were your orders to take some photographs to

25

support the indictment of Mr. Kajelijeli?

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

1

A.

I suppose so.

2

Q.

Now, you were informed, were you not, that I

3

was in Ruhengeri the week before you

4

travelled there?

You knew that, didn't you?

5

A.

I heard that.

6

Q.

And you knew that I went to certain

7

locations in Ruhengeri, didn't you?

8

A.

I suppose so, yes.

9

Q.

Well, you were guided in your activities in

10

Ruhengeri by certain individuals who were

11

familiar with that area; isn't that correct?

12

A.

That is correct.

13

Q.

And you were informed that I went to certain

14
15

locations, weren't you?
A.

Um, in fact, I was not.

I heard that you

16

had been there and, having heard that you

17

had been there, I supposed you had been to

18

certain locations.

19

locations you had been and nobody informed

20

me on that.

21

Q.

Okay.

I don't know to which

You had no personal knowledge with

22

respect to events and activities that may

23

have taken place in any of the locations

24

that you photographed; is that correct?

25

A.

Well, of course, during my photographing and

sketching, I don't think --

Q.

Mr. Lucassen, please, so that we could get

3

along here:

I have asked you a specific

4

question.

5

question, please.

6

repeat it?

I'd like you to answer that

7

A.

Yes, please.

8

Q.

Okay.

9

Would you like me to

The question, sir, is:

Did you have

any personal knowledge with respect to any

10

event that took place in any of the

11

locations that you photographed during 1994?

12

A.

13

The question is too extreme to answer it
with no.

14

Q.

Were you in Ruhengeri in 1994?

15

A.

No, I was not.

16

Q.

Did you see any events that took place in

17

Ruhengeri in 1994?

18

A.

No; I did not.

19

Q.

All right.

So, you have no personal

20

knowledge of what occurred there in 1994, do

21

you?

22

A.

In that sense, I have not.

23

Q.

So, you relied upon what people told you

24

took place in those locations that you took

25

photographs of; is that correct?

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

1

A.

What I heard and what I saw, yes.

2

Q.

You didn't see everything that occurred in

3

1994, did you?

4

A.

That is correct.

5

Q.

So, you relied upon what people told you as

6

you took photographs and made your sketches;

7

isn't that correct?

8

A.

9
10

As far as this was not contrary to what I
saw, yes.

Q.

Okay.

Now, turning to -- and could we have

11

the witness presented exhibits, Prosecutor's

12

Exhibits 1 through 4 for identification,

13

please?

14

of you now, sir?

Do you have the exhibits in front

15

A.

Yes, I do.

16

Q.

I would like you to turn to Prosecutor's

17

Exhibit 1, which is the maps.

18

your assignments, sir, with respect to these

19

maps?

20

A.

What were

I was asked to get maps from UN archives of

21

Ruhengeri and certain communes within

22

Ruhengeri.

Q.

Were you asked to get the most accurate

24

maps?

different way:

say were your instructions to get maps, did

3

you endeavour to get the most accurate maps?

4

A.

I suppose these maps are accurate.

5
6

Based upon your -- what you

We have

maps on a larger scale.
Q.

Was there some reason why you decided not to

7

get maps that showed more detail of the

8

area?

9

A.

Yes.

Do you understand the question?
I understand the question.

There is

10

another map of another scale, which is used

11

in one of the sketches, more or less.

12

is not in use because there's just one map.

We found no way to make copies of it.

Mr. Lucassen, please.

I have asked you one

3

question and I'd like you to answer that:

4

Have you ever seen that map; yes or no?

5

A.

I think the one I saw is a different one.

6

Q.

Okay.

Now, that you are looking at

7

Defendant's Exhibit 1, do you know whether

8

or not that map is available from the UNDP?

9

A.

To my knowledge, it is not.

the week before you got there?

BY MR. HINDS:

Q.

8

Now that you have an opportunity to examine
that map, do you have -- withdraw.

9
10

Now that you have had an opportunity to

11

examine the map, can you tell us whether or

12

not you believe this map has more detail

13

than what you have as your map of Ruhengeri

14

in Prosecutor's Exhibit 1?

15

A.

Of course, but it covers a smaller area.

16

Q.

With respect to the area in question -- that

17

is, the three communes in question -- does

18

it have more detail?

19

A.

I think Kinigi commune is not on it, but

20

Mukingo and, wholly, it certainly has more

21

detail, yes.

Q.

Now, turning to your -- that is, the

respect to the accuracy of the secteurs that

5

were mentioned in that particular map?

6

A.

7
8

Regarding the source of these maps, I did
not check their accuracy.

Q.

9

Okay.

So, you do not know whether or not

there are any errors in any of the secteurs;

10

is that correct?

11

A.

That's correct.

12

Q.

So, for example, you do not know, whether or

13

not Mukingo secteur is incorrect, and it

should be Muhingo (phonetic) secteur, do you

15

know?

A.

I don't know.

in particular, the legend that you prepared

did you prepare this legend, or was it your

I saw them constructing, yes.

isn't that true?

I don't remember it more precisely than it

is marked here.

18

which are here behind the church, they were

19

working on it.

20

Q.

In fact, the buildings

It was not very clear to me.

And wasn't that wall abutting or, in fact,

21

being part of the main structure, or you

didn't recall it at that time?

It was told to me that it was Kajelijeli's
residence in Mukingo commune.

Q.

All right.

I have noted that, with respect

5

to other structures, you have indicated that

6

these structures were completely destroyed.

7

Did you have an opportunity to -- did you,

8

personally, take these photographs with

9

respect to Mr. Kajelijeli's residence?

10

A.

Yes.

11

Q.

You were there?

12

A.

Yah, I took them.

Q.

And you saw that the structure was

A.

I saw that it is in this state, yes.

16

Q.

Okay.

But you reached no conclusion with

respect to whether or not it was destroyed?

I didn't add any conclusion to my comments

A.

Q.

No commentary was necessary?

3

A.

That's correct.

4

Q.

You didn't inquire what happened to

5

Mr. Kajelijeli's family?

6

A.

I did not.

7

Q.

You didn't inquire whether or not they were

8

living 11 people in one room in the back,

did you?

10

A.

I didn't inquire.

We met some people and it

11

was, more or less, confirmed that this was,

12

indeed, Kajelijeli's house; but I didn't

13

inquire, no.

14

Q.

Given that the photographs speak for

15

themselves, why did you have commentary with

respect to other residences?

A.

Didn't the

I thought on some other photographs that
they did not speak for themselves.

Q.

All right.

As I look at 21, where you say

21

"These are the remains of the gate of the

22

house of Nzirorera's mother", and there's a

23

single gate standing there, nothing else.

24

Doesn't that speak for itself?

25

A.

I thought it did not.

I thought when

VERNA BUTLER - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

1

somebody was looking at the photograph he

2

would be wondering, "So where's the house?".

3

Q.

There you are.

4

A.

So that's why I added it.

5

Q.

Let's go to 30.

This is Nzirorera's house,

6

under construction.

7

itself?

8

A.

9

Does it speak for

I added the words "under construction"
because it was not clear to me if somebody

10

looking at the photograph would think it is

11

under construction or whether it has been

12

destroyed.

13

Q.

But you have no personal knowledge with

respect to any of these houses being

15

destroyed, do you?

16

A.

I don't pretend to have.

17

Q.

All right then.

And you do not know

18

anything about whether or not these houses

19

were, in fact, even under construction.

20

A.

That's why I write my source.

Sir, I am saying you have no personal

4

what happened at the Munya -- Munyemvano

with these names, but I am struggling with

8

A.

No, I don't.

9

Q.

10

And, similarly, with respect to 56;

isn't that true?

11

A.

That's correct.

12

Q.

Now, on 57, you do not know whether or not

13

there were any -- there was any mass grave

14

at that location, from personal knowledge,

15

do you?

16

A.

No, I don't.

Q.

And at No. 60, where you have "roadblocks

were set up", you don't have any personal

19

knowledge whether any roadblocks were set up

there, do you?

A.

That's correct.

Now, let's turn to No. 23.

A.

I learned that it belonged to

6

Mr. Kajelijeli, not as a residence but as a

7

building.

8

Q.

9

No. 31, which shows what you describe as a
fence or a wall.

That was the location of

10

Mr. Nzirorera's house, according to you; is

that correct?

A.

That's correct.

Q.

And nothing is standing there; is that

correct?

That's correct.

16

Q.

Did your sources say what may have destroyed

BY MR. FLEMING:

8

Q.

9

-

E X A M I N A T I O N

Mr. Lucassen, in the documents that have
been referred to, have you described the

10

sources of information in respect of many of

11

the items that our learned friend has

12

referred to?

13

A.

Yes.

I have.

14

Q.

Have you ever suggested to anybody, either

15

here in this court or in these documents,

16

that you, yourself, have personal knowledge

17

of the events in 1994?

18

A.

No, I didn't.

19

Q.

Would you explain what the role of an

20

investigator is in respect of a crime scene?

21

First, do you ever have personal knowledge

22

of the events before you go to a crime

23

scene?

24
25

A.

That would be a very special coincidence.
Normally, when I go to a crime scene I have
VERNA BUTLER - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - CHAMBER II
23

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

1

not been present during the crime, and it is

2

very clear that in '94 I was not in Rwanda.

3

Q.

4
5

And what was your role when you went to this
particular crime scene?

A.

My role was to make sketches and photographs

6

of the area, I suppose with the purpose so

7

that later statements or declarations can be

8

understood better.

9

Q.

All right.

Now, can we go to some of the

10

particular items that our learned friend has

11

described; for example, the photograph which

12

is Exhibit 31.

13

around it, as you think he described?

It seems to have a wall

14

A.

That's correct.

15

Q.

Now, I think you also described this as

16

being one of the premises which, in your

17

words -- how did you describe it? -- is

18

"completely destroyed".

19

that you used?

Is that the wording

20

A.

That's the wording that I used.

21

Q.

So, when one looks in behind the wall, one

22

can see very little.

23

A.

That's correct.

24

Q.

All right.

25

There was very little.

Can we go then back to 43, 44

and 45; that photograph, that photograph and

Q.

So, you described 31 as completely

destroyed, but you described 45 as a

view -- 43, 44 and 45 as view of

8

Kajelijeli's residence.

9

destroyed?

Was it completely

10

A.

No, it is not completely destroyed.

11

Q.

Were there, in fact, people still living in

13

the house?
A.

There were people around, and what I saw was

14
15

that they were studying there.

Your Honour, we object to the admissibility

First of all, if you look at each, the front

the same thing, 3 and 4.

Your Honours, we who have practised

would normally be made without the jury

22

present because nobody would want to poison

23

their minds or prejudice the way in which

24

they approach a problem.

25

interesting things and one of the good

One of the

VERNA BUTLER - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - CHAMBER II
31

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

1

things about practising in this jurisdiction

2

is that we have a fusion of both common law

3

and civil law principles.

4

are used very much to different procedures

5

to what we are use to in common law, and I

6

may say, in this instance, thankfully so.

7

Because whilst we have jurors who act as

8

jury and jurists who act as the judges in

9

our system, here we are before three

Civil law judges

10

jurists.

There is no jury and, therefore,

11

an appeal based upon one that you would make

12

in respect of a jury is of no relevance here

13

whatsoever.

14
15

So this application that our learned friend

16

has made is made to three jurists.

17

suggests, first, that Your Honours cannot

18

distinguish between who is on trial here and

19

who is the co-conspirator, Kajelijeli,

20

Juvénal, Nzirorera Joseph.

21

am quite sure, can distinguish that it is

22

actually Mr. Kajelijeli on trial here and

23

not Mr. Nzirorera; however, Mr. Nzirorera is

24

inextricably interwoven in this case.

25

3

whatsoever; however, his name is there

4

because he is, in fact, a co-conspirator.

It has no consequence to us

5
6

The second proposition is one relating to

7

evidence, hearsay, double hearsay and so on.

8

I am uncertain that there is any double

9

hearsay in anything that our learned friend

10

has established, and he hasn't brought out

11

fact that there is double hearsay anywhere.

So, at worst, we have hearsay.

20

at the documents and identify the particular

21

items in the documents, and they will be

22

witnesses who, for example, have lived

23

there; who were there during 1994.

24

won't have to worry about whether or not an

25

investigator was there in 1994.

That means that witnesses

ICTR - CHAMBER II
33

So, we

KAJELIJELI

2

The sole purpose of bringing an

3

investigator, such as this, is to ensure

4

that there is some basic material that can

5

form some basis of information for

6

Your Honours to start building upon.

7

basis of information is not necessarily the

8

descriptions that are there but, rather, the

9

items, themselves.

The

10
11

The descriptions are there to identify

12

clearly to this Court exactly where the

13

information came from and what that

14

information was.

15

might have cause to thank me for doing that

16

because I am sure in cross-examination, if

17

any of those witness come, he will be able

18

to cross-examine in respect of, first, the

19

source of information, because that person

20

is identified; and, second, the description

21

that was given.

And my learned friend

22
23

But we turn to the Rules, Section 3, Rules

24

he quoted from the man who became Justice

Jackson, subsequent to the Nuremberg trials.

3

Of course, Your Honours have a duty and

obligation to ensure a fair trial.

5
6

However, my learned friend's submissions are

7

premised, first, on the basis that

8

Your Honours can't fulfil that duty if the

9

sort of evidence goes in, in that you can't

10

identify the different elements -- for

11

example, what is hearsay, what isn't hearsay

12

-- and then give it appropriate probative

13

weight; and, second, that these documents

14

will be under verified for the duration of

15

the trial.

16
17

The simple proposition is that these

18

documents are offered complete with sources

19

of information so that Your Honours can

20

begin to weigh the probative value of them.

21

If, for example, we call X, who has made

commentary included in the document, and X

doesn't say that at all, Your Honours can

rightly say at the end of the day that piece

25

of information has no probative value, and

It is our submission that the evidence is

12

probative; indeed, it will become more

probative value will be very limited, and

However, in summary, let us say these things
GERALDINE O'LOUGHLIN - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - CHAMBER II
40

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

1

again:

First, it is admissible evidence

2

under the Rules; second, Your Honours can

distinguish between fact and law; and,

4

third, the documents are tendered for

5

identification purposes only, in any event,

6

so one ought to wait and see.

Thank you, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:

10
11

Thank you.

Professor Hinds.

MR. HINDS:

12

Thank you, Your Honours.

First of all, I

13

would like to thank Mr. Fleming for

14

acknowledging Justice Robert H. Jackson, who

15

happened to have been an Associate Justice

16

of the United States Supreme Court prior to

17

him going to Nuremberg, and then he returned

18

to his position.

19
20

But besides that piece of history,

21

Mr. Fleming has not addressed the

22

fundamental problem; and, that is, he

23

correctly says that this Court can sift, and

24

that you know how to sift evidence.

25

that isn't the issue.

But

Why put you through

GERALDINE O'LOUGHLIN - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

that process?

he has taken with respect to the exhibits:

Even a co-conspirator

But he says, "Well, we have done it.
That is the approach

"Judges, you can sort it out later on."

11
12

The fact of the matter is, Mr.

Lucassen is

13

a photographer for the purposes of going out

14

and taking photographs, drawing sketches,

15

and so on, in his capacity as an

16

investigator at the Prosecutor's Office.

17

should have prepared the documents with

18

minimum commentary so that we do not have to

19

deal with these issues of whether or not

20

evidence, which would be adduced later on,

21

says -- describes the items in the way that

22

they have been described by him.

23
24

Certainly, later on, we can excise out and

25

scratch out, and so on.

But why do that?

GERALDINE O'LOUGHLIN - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - CHAMBER II
42

He

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

He is making the submissions now.

They

2

should be made with minimum commentary so

3

that at some later time, whatever evidence

4

is adduced, whether that evidence is hearsay

5

or direct knowledge of the sources, then we

6

will be able to deal with that, and,

7

therefore, the description would be based

8

upon whatever admissible evidence we obtain.

And so we make the objections, Your Honour,

11

that we have made before, and we do nothing

that Rule 89 changes our application.

exhibits that have been tendered for

identification so far, and by whom?

3

MR. FLEMING:

4

Thank you, Your Honour.

We would be

5

anticipating calling witnesses at various

6

times who can identify specifically

7

different items.

8

your deliberations that there are different

9

sources of information.

Your Honours might see in

We intend to call

10

those sources of information.

In the main,

11

there might be one or two that aren't

12

called, but I'll come back to that in a

moment.

information will be called and they will

15

identify specifically the respective items.

from somebody else who we might not call --

19

for example, somebody else who wasn't there

identified by the witnesses that we will

22

call, and we'll be seeking to tender the

23

documents themselves at that point in time

24

through those witnesses.

purposes of identification.

JUDGE SEKULE:

3

I understand that, Mr. Fleming, but my

4

question is:

5

formally tender these four documents which

6

have been put insofar as Exhibits P, for

7

identification and, if so, through whom?

At what stage do you intend to

8
9

Of course, the witnesses, I understand

10

they'll come perhaps in the scheme that you

11

describe.

12

Just at what stage do you intend, when

13

everything supposedly has been done -- so at

14

what stage of the procedure do you intend to

15

have these documents formally tendered as

16

exhibits?

17

But my question is very narrow:

MR. FLEMING:

18

Your Honour, they will be tendered -- I'm

19

sorry, they will be identified during the

20

process, and as the full identification of a

21

document occurs, then we will tender it on

22

the basis of the previous identification,

23

specific identification.

24
25

For example, we might call one witness who
GERALDINE O'LOUGHLIN - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
ICTR - CHAMBER II
45

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

1

can say in respect of the sketch that, yes,

2

he identifies that as the area, and we can

3

work through the specific items of it.

4

that is complete, of course, we'll be

5

tendering it at that point.

6

waiting necessarily until the close of the

7

case -- almost to the close of the case to

8

tender all of those documents.

9

they are fully identified, we will tender

10

them.

11

Your Honour --

12

So we won't be

As and when

So, I'm sorry I can't give

JUDGE SEKULE:

13
14

As

Through this witness or how?
MR. FLEMING:

15

No.

We will do it through the witnesses as

16

they are called, Your Honour, because my

17

understanding, for example, of the process

18

is that we might, in fact, have to undo this

19

bundle of photographs and tender five or

20

eight at a time.

21

necessarily destroy the impact of what we

22

are doing now -- tendering a document for

23

the purposes of identification.

24

the photographs will be tendered as and when

25

that they are identified.

But that doesn't

And, so,

1
2

I understand what Your Honour is asking me.

3

It might be different, for example, for the

4

maps.

5

say, "Yes.

6

because I have personal knowledge of that".

7

So, it will be done at different stages as

8

and when the matters are complete and fully

9

identified.

One person may be able to come and
That is the map that I identify

11

So, ultimately, Your Honour, it might be

12

more than one witness who identifies any

13

particular exhibit.

that the exhibit loses its efficacy now as

15

an exhibit.

MR. HINDS:

attempts to explain at what stage these

documents are to be tendered into evidence

all face.

end of the trial.

But there may be

11

something that he has in mind that I don't

12

see at all.

13
14

That goes for 2 and 3, because if you look

15

at these various locations, and you look at

16

the commentary, they speak to acts that were

allegedly committed at different times at

different places.

respect to all of these items, sufficient

for them to be introduced or for an

application to be made for them to be

individual witness.

And he speaks to precisely the problem.

3

They are not going to be using Prosecutor's

examine a witness on it, and that is

The witness would, in fact, identify

10

the photograph, identify the location,

11

et cetera, and, it would appear, that an

12

application would be made after that witness

13

conducts the preliminaries, and we would

14

have one piece after another going in or

being subject to objections.

So, he describes precisely the problem that

he, in fact, has created.

calling a number of witnesses who can and

will identify the different elements of the

documents, each and every one.

applications of the Defence and the

JUDGE SEKULE:

This is the oral unanimous

14

decision of the Trial Chamber on the motion

15

raised by the Defence as well as by the

16

Prosecution.

17
18

After having deliberated on the Defence's

19

request to strike out the name of Joseph

20

Nzirorera on each of the documents tendered

21

as Prosecution Exhibit for Identification

22

Nos 1 to 4, the Trial Chamber notes that

23

Juvénal Kajelijeli and Joseph Nzirorera are

24

not jointly indicted, nor will they be

25

jointly tried, although they are accused of
GERALDINE O'LOUGHLIN - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

55

KAJELIJELI

15 MARCH 2001

allegedly conspiring together along with

2

other accused in committing genocide.

4

In these circumstances the Trial Chamber

5

finds that mentions of Joseph Nzirorera's

6

name on the said documents tendered as

7

Prosecution Exhibits for identification

8

Nos. 1 to 4 do not cause any prejudice to

9

the Accused.

10
11

In any case, the Judges record that they are

12

professional jurists capable of clearly

13

distinguishing between accused and trials,

14

and also to make independent findings.

15
16

Therefore, the Trial Chamber dismisses the

17

Defence's request to strike out the name of

18

Joseph Nzirorera on each of the documents

19

tendered as Prosecution Exhibits for

20

identification Nos 1 to 4.

the Defence objects to the said comments to

Defence, these comments are hearsay and

double hearsay.

6

The Chamber, first, considers that at this

8

stage of the proceedings there is nothing

9

unusual for the Prosecutor to present

10

sketches and photographs resulting from her

11

investigations.

12
13

As to the issue of admissibility of hearsay

14

evidence, the Chamber reminds the Defence

15

that pursuant to 89(C) of the Rules, the

16

Chamber my admit any relevant evidence which

17

it deems to have probative value.

18

Chamber considers, on the basis of the Rules

and of the Tribunal's jurisprudence as

20

established in the Akayesu judgment, that

hearsay evidence is not per se inadmissible

On the Prosecutor's request to have

4

Prosecutor's Exhibits for Identification

5

Nos 1 to 4 admitted as Prosecutor's Exhibits

6

Nos 1 to 4, the Prosecutor requests that

7

these exhibits currently considered as

8

exhibits for identification be admitted as

9

Prosecution Exhibits.

The Chamber finds

10

that granting the Prosecutor's request would

11

contribute to the clarity as well as to the

12

proper administration of these proceedings.

13
14

Therefore, the Chamber deems it in the

15

interests of justice to admit these exhibits

16

as proper Prosecution Exhibits and grants

17

the Prosecutor's request that Prosecution

18

Exhibits Nos 1 to 4 be formally admitted as

19

Prosecution Exhibits in the proceedings.

20
21

Accordingly, Prosecution Exhibits for

22

Identification Nos 1 to 4 become,

23

respectively, Prosecution Exhibits

Nos 1 to 4.

Thank you, Your Honour.

I'd like to thank

the Chamber for its indulgence to the

Defence in light of the peculiar problems

that we are faced, and the Chamber has

9

graciously agreed to honour the request that

10

we made when I was here during the last week

I just want to point out to the Court that I

indicated that I would be available at the

wanted to indicate to the Court that that

that I would like to put on the record, so

that when we reconvene at the end of June we

do not have the same problem.

We had requested original statements of

tapes in the language in which the witnesses

It is important that we receive the original

problem of recalling witnesses and dealing

with that issue.

We don't want to find out after the

that witnesses whom they intend to call have

11
12

I am putting on the record our request, and,

13

again, the reason for me doing this,

14

Your Honour, is that I don't want to come

15

back here in June ready to resume this

matter, ready to cross-examine witnesses,

and then to find out that we don't have the

continue, of course, to look for material

which is relevant to my learned friend and

will provide it, if we come across any.

13

I can make some general comments about the

tapes and records of interviews.

understanding -- this is the result of my

requests for information in respect of this

-- my understanding is that when a person is

tapes are never used.

past that.

interviewed; for example, in Kinyarwanda.

So no document exists, that I have been able

to find yet, in Kinyarwanda in respect of

the interview of any witness.

And that's because an interpreter

The process is completed by a statement

being prepared in type-written form and then

being read back to the witness.

verification, in most cases, of an

interpreter being present, and having read

15

the statement back, it is then that the

statement is signed.

There is a

second interviews is that is done in

not need to see the transcripts at the

benefit to the witnesses in exchange for
