MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings. 
MS. NTILATWA:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Francis Emile Short (sic); and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, 19th May 2006, for continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.

Please, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony continues this morning.  You are on the same oath that you took to tell the truth when your testimony began.  

How are you feeling now?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't think the witness heard you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Issa, could you make a check?  

Can you hear me now, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I hear you well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I mentioned that your testimony will continue this morning and that you remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  And then I asked you, how are you feeling now?  
THE WITNESS:
Quite well, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then we will proceed.  We will -- today we will finish at 12:30.  
Mr. Robinson, you may continue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I should indicate that my co-counsel has now returned to Brussels.  He's not present with us today, and he'll be participating by video link next week.  

Also, I want to again object to having to proceed in the absence of any disclosure from Trial Chamber I of the material that I need.  But I do note that we received the decision of the preliminary motion, so that's no longer pending.  And that was a pleasant surprise.  So, thank you very much.  

And my next thing I would like to do is offer a copy of the page of the transcript from the Bagosora trial that was used to impeach this witness yesterday.  It's -- since it's in closed session, I offer it under seal as Exhibit D. NZ106.  And I have hard copy for the registrar, and I've given one to Mr. Webster. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ106 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have a few questions to ask this witness that I think should be in closed session at the outset of this testimony concerning location A and his -- his relevance to it or position in it.  So could we perhaps go into closed session?  I anticipate it will only be about five minutes, and the only other time I think we would have to go into closed session is at the very end of his testimony for one or two questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We go into closed session now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Remind me of the exhibit number for the last exhibit that was tendered. 
MR. ROBINSON:
D. NZ106.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 5] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, when you gave us a list of people who were at the meeting yesterday -- and we're speaking of this meeting at location A -- we're now in open session, so we're going to refer to this as "location A" -- it did -- that list did not include Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  Was he present at this meeting? 
A.	Counsel, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi was at the camp, but not in the room where the meeting was being held.  That's why I made that distinction. 
Q.	Okay.  And did he join the others in the canteen after the meeting? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And were there any other persons present at the camp who were not at the meeting at that time? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And can you give us their names, please.  
A.	Inter alia, there was a corporal by the name of Rusangiza and others by the name of Baligendere and others -- other soldiers, who were either the bodyguards of some officers -- who were the bodyguards for some of the officers, but I didn't know their names. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Rusangiza is number 72 on the spelling list, and Baligendere is number 6.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And were these two people ********************************************
A.	Well, Counsel, ********************************************. 
Q.	And do you know where either of these people are today? 
A.	Corporal Rusan -- as regards Corporal Rusangiza, I don't know.  But as regards Corporal Baligendere, he -- I think he's in Rwanda.  He returned to Rwanda. 
Q.	And do you know what his commune of origin was? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) can you tell us what it is? 
A.	He's from Byumba urban, Byumba town.  
Q.	Can you tell us -- 
A.	I -- his commune, now, I don't know if he was born there, but that's where he resided in town.  But they said that he -- he was from Cyungo, Cyungo commune, but he'd established himself in Byumba town, in Byumba urban commune. 
Q.	And -- 
A.	And the urban commune's name was Kibali.  So it's possible that since he lived there, he might be registered in Kibali; otherwise, he'd be registered in his home commune, which it was said was Cyungo. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, Cyungo, I believe, is spelled C-Y-U-N-G-O.  Kibali, K-I-B-A-L-I.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And can you tell us, when was the last time you saw Corporal Baligendere again? 
A.	I -- the last time I -- the last time I saw him, Counsel, was in 1998.  
Q.	Now, with -- turning to this meeting again, you have told us that, in the days that followed this meeting, some activity took place in Kavoye (sic) commune; is that correct?  

Kayove, I'm sorry.  
A.	Counsel, the day after the meeting, after Lieutenant Bizumuremyi and Major Kabaya, who were on assignment in that sous-préfecture in Kayove commune, and Mr. Mugesera, Léon, and Habiyambere, Joseph, who was, by the way, a native of that commune, Kayove, Kayove, when they're together and they assembled the bourgmestres and probably their close collaborators in the commune to hold a meeting in the commune.  According to Lieutenant Côme Bizumuremyi, the meeting's agenda was minutes of a meeting that had been held the previous date; that is, they had to discuss those minutes, and they discussed plans that the Tutsis had allegedly prepared to exterminate Hutus.  

After they left, in the following days, the bourgmestres assembled secteur conseillers because there were many secteurs in the commune.  So they convened a meeting of all conseillers of secteurs to inform them of the Tutsis' plan to exterminate Hutus.  The conseillers were leaders of secteurs.  There were secteur leaders and members of the secteurs.  Those persons were convened by those conseillers, and they held a rally involving the members of those secteurs, the populations in those secteurs.  And that is why there were disturbances in which Hutus rose up and started attacking Tutsis in the various secteurs in Kayove commune. 

I do not know whether I have answered your question, Counsel.  
Q.	The events -- the -- the attack in Kayove commune, therefore, took place within a week or less after this meeting, correct? 
A.	After about three days, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness can now be shown number 11 in our list of exhibits.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, what I placed in front of you is a report of an international commission of investigation on human rights violations in Rwanda that came to Rwanda in January 1993 to investigate events in different communes in which there had been attacks on Tutsi.  And you have two pages in front of you.  The first page is a cover page.  The second page, which has K-number 0020209, is a particular page dealing with the events in Kayove commune.  And I'm just going to briefly read some parts of this to you.  

And it indicates that, according to the bourgmestre of the commune Kayove, authorities found four bodies in the Gishwati forest during the months of November and December 1992, claiming that the deaths had been caused by bandits who lived in the forest.  They decided to clear the brush in the forest, and the bourgmestres of several communes adjacent to the forest fixed the date of December 28th, 1992, for this particular Umuganda and advised their workers to arrive at the assigned sites equipped with machetes and large sticks.  

And then it goes on to say on the third paragraph that, on the day of the Umuganda, crowds armed with machetes and sticks descended on the Bagogwe and Tutsis and burned their houses, killed their cattle, pillaged other goods.  And so these events, according to the international commission on investigation on human rights violations in Kayove commune, occurred in late December of 1992.  

My question to you is whether that assists you in determining when it was that the meeting that you've described took place.  
A.	Counsel, I do not think this would enable me to place things in a -- in the context of time.  From what I heard and what I saw when I was in Gisenyi, what happened in Kayove occurred on several occasions.  There was more than one event, so I do not know the event he is referring to here.  It must be another event amongst many others.  

I believe that is the case. 
Q.	Well, Witness ZF, I represent to you that this was the only event reported by the international commission who had -- were going to investigate human rights violations that had occurred in Kayove commune.  But if you're saying that there were other events that occurred, I -- can you tell us approximately when the events that you're speaking of would have occurred? 
A.	Regarding the dates, Counsel, I believe I told you I don't quite remember those dates.  But since you previously gave me examples of President Habyarimana's speeches in Ruhengeri and the speech of Mr. Mugesera in Kabaya sous-préfecture in November 1992, I told you that it was well before then.  And you can see that the situation described by Human Rights Watch dates back to the month of December, which means that the event that I am referring to occurred well before the events you have just referred to here. 

That would be my answer, Counsel. 
Q. Well, Witness ZF, I would put it to you that there were no events in Kayove commune in which people were attacked prior to December 28th, 1992, and, therefore, your testimony concerning these -- the meeting -- the relationship between the meeting and these events is not correct because there never was such a meeting.  Do you have any comment on that?

MR. WEBSTER:
May I have an offer of proof on that latest proposition?  On what basis is Mr. Robinson putting that to the witness?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I'm putting that to the witness on the basis of the contents of this report that I've put in front of the witness, as well as another investigation that was conducted by the Rwandan intelligence service in which they produced a report of all of the events in Gisenyi préfecture in which there had been attacks on Tutsis.  In fact, that report led to the dismissal of the préfet.  And there was no mention of any attacks in Kayove commune prior to December 1992 in either of those reports. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's hardly a basis to make the latest proposition to the witness.  This particular report was authored by Alison Des Forges.  It's going to be an exhibit during her testimony.  Nowhere in that report does it say that there was only one attack in Kayove in December -- on December 28th of 1993.  So that's not a proper way of confronting this witness with those events.  We can put the entire report in evidence, and the Court can examine it for itself.  But, to me, it's -- it's not well advised to tell the witness that there was no events prior to the 28th of December.  There's no basis for making that statement.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, two investigative bodies with a mandate to investigate attacks against Tutsis completed their reports, and their reports don't contain any mention of an attack during the time frame that he claimed.  I think that's enough of a basis to put it to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, at this stage, that is all rather semantic.  The witness does not know of any.  And, in due course, you'll have an opportunity to lead evidence if you can establish facts which contradict his statement.  So there's no point in carrying on this -- this discussion. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness, with respect to these events in Kayove commune, I believe you testified that Major Kabera went to Kayove during this time; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And I want to put to you that Major Kabera has indicated that he never went to Kayove commune in connection with such events, so during this time period.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	I want to turn your attention now to the fourth meeting that you claim took place at location A.  And I believe you testified that Colonel Bagosora participated -- I mean, presiding over this meeting; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, regarding this specific meeting, I did not attend it.  But according to Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, that meeting was chaired by Colonel Bagosora. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  One moment, please.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, directing your attention to testimony that you've given in the Bagosora trial, when Colonel Bagosora was on trial (sic), was it also your testimony at that trial that he had attended or presided at other meetings? 
A.	Counsel, I do not remember whether that question was put to me because I answered questions that were put to me, and I only answered those questions that were put to me. 
Q.	Okay.  We're going to come back to that because there was a question put to you and an answer given, but it was in closed session in that trial, so I'm going to put that aside for now.  

Can you tell us who it was who told you about the fourth meeting?  
A.	As concerns the fourth meeting, I, indeed, said that it was Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, and it was during conversations at the officers' mess that I heard that that meeting was held.  

As for the person who chaired that meeting, it was, indeed, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi. 
Q.	Did you hear about this meeting from Major Kabera, Lieutenant Rwasa, or 
	Lieutenant Munyabarga (sic)? 
A.	Counsel, I stated that I got wind of that at the officers' mess.  And at the time there were officers at the mess, I do not remember all those who were there, but I remember that the person who spoke to me about it -- I said that it was Lieutenant Bizumuremyi who told me about Bagosora.  The conversations were held at the officers' mess.  
Q.	And have you said on a previous occasion that you heard about this meeting from Major Kabera, Lieutenant Rwasa, and Lieutenant Munyabarga (sic).  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think that last name is Munyaburanga, for the record. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, I believe the problem here is one of terminology.  And I will say that, following questions that were put to me, when we are talking of the officers' mess, there are many officers who usually go there.  And when I talk of conversations, the conversations were between many people.  And if someone talks of a particular subject, everyone can talk about it.  

I don't know whether I can give the names of all the persons who mentioned that name, but I can mention the name of the person who was closest to me, that is, a person who was of interest to me.  But, as a matter of fact, whenever there is a conversation, all officers at the mess talk about that subject and discuss it.  If a question was put to me on that subject, I don't remember when that question may have been put to me.  I would answer it, depending on the nature of the question put to me.  

I don't know whether I have answered your question. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, you've answered my question, and I think we'll come back to this in closed session so I can put the question exactly to you as it was put in the earlier proceeding.  But, for now, we'll move on, and we'll do that at a later time.  

So I want to now move on to meetings that you say were held at the MRND palace.  And with respect to this MRND palace, it's true, is it not, that in the multiparty system, after June of 1991, July of 1991, the MRND palace in Gisenyi became the property of the state and was no longer controlled by the MRND party?  Is that correct? 
A.	I know nothing about that, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, isn't it a fact that, when the multiparty system came into -- then all of the buildings of the MRND, as a unique party, became the property of the state, and, in fact, the MRND building in Kigali became the office of the prime minister? 
A.	I cannot confirm that because I know nothing about it, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, you have said that there was a meeting held at the MRND palace, at which Mr. Ngirumpatse attended.  Can you tell us approximately when that meeting was held? 
A.	For the time being, I cannot give you an approximate date, Counsel.  But it was prior to the events of the 6th of April.  I was in Gisenyi for a very long time, and I am not in a position to determine the exact period or the date because I wasn't very interested in those meetings.  I was busy at other services at point A.  That was so because there was a coordinator, who was also an officer, and we exchanged views with one another, such that I could find out what was happening within the MRND.  

But as regards the date, I cannot say what it is at this point in time.  I know he came on more than one occasion.  And whenever he came, to the best of my recollection, he came to convene a meeting of préfets of préfectures, sous-préfets, and bourgmestres, since there were many communes in the préfecture.  He also invited the conseillers of various secteurs in the commune.  

And, from what I could gather from my conversation with Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, the most important point discussed was discipline within the party and the party youth wing, which was the Interahamwe.  They also discussed the assistance that they had to give to the security service in Gisenyi town and to the gendarmerie.  The meeting also dealt with organisation within the MRND and its youth wing.  
Q.	Witness ZF, I put it to you that, in the multiparty system, the president of the MRND could not convene a meeting of the préfet, the sous-préfet, the bourgmestres, and the conseillers.  It's impossible for that to be done in the multiparty system by a member -- by a leader of a political party.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	I do not know what was the situation elsewhere, but in Gisenyi town where I was -- first of all, even though there was multiparty politics, there was only one party in power.  It was not all the parties that governed the country.  The others were associate parties.  The MRND was the party in power.  I do not know what was the situation elsewhere.  

In the case of Gisenyi, I do not know whether there was any bourgmestre who was from another party, but the overwhelming majority of leaders were supporters of the MRND, I mean, the préfets, the bourgmestres, and the authorities of the various administrative entities, including the conseillers.  

Regarding the issue of convening the meeting, I don't know whether it was convened by the préfet of the préfecture at the request of the MRND or whether it was the MRND which requested the préfet to organise a meeting in collaboration with him.  

But what I know is that those people met with Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I don't know whether he was secretary-general or president.  I do not know.  It -- I didn't know at the time.  It was later on that I heard that he was the president or the chairman.  When he met with those people, they discussed the agenda, and in that agenda are the various items I have referred to.  
Q.	And can you tell us the names of any people who were present at this meeting that you know of besides Lieutenant Bizumuremyi? 
A.	I wasn't interested in asking the question as to who attended that meeting.  I was only interested in knowing the agenda and the chairman of the meeting.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us when the Interahamwe was formed in Gisenyi or when you became aware of the existence of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi? 
A.	Counsel, first of all, the Interahamwe was not established in Gisenyi or founded in Gisenyi.  The Interahamwe was an -- a national organisation.  

Regarding the date or the period during which the Interahamwe were established in Gisenyi, I know nothing about that.  But what I know is that there was a movement of fanatics.  Some of those fanatics were members of the MRND.  The others were from other parties.  I don't know whether they were authorised or not.  That situation persisted up to a certain period.  After 1991, people started gathering in public.  You could see people wearing MRND uniforms, while others wore CDR uniforms.  And people could say, "Those are from the MRND and those other people are from the CDR."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness needs some assistance with his headphone.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  

Regarding the establishment of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi, I cannot tell you when it was established because establishing an organisation involves preparation of documents.  I don't know when those documents were prepared.  What I could see was the movement of people and the activities they engaged in, and those activities were carried out by various groups and trends.  That situation existed well before 1991.  And in Gisenyi you could clearly make out those who were from the CDR and those who were from the MRND.  

I don't know whether I've answered your question, Counsel.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness ZF, we've had evidence in the record that the Interahamwe in the préfectures outside of Kigali were not established until after April 1992, and that even the CDR was not founded until 1992.  And I'm trying to use the creation of the Interahamwe as some basis for you to give us an estimate of the time in which the meeting of Mr. Ngirumpatse at the MRND palace took place.  

So, given those dates that I have provided to you, can you tell us at least the year in which Mr. Ngirumpatse came to the MRND palace in Gisenyi and convened all the préfectoral authorities for a meeting about the discipline of the Interahamwe? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, but I have a problem when information from the record is being misstated to the witness as a proposition.  There's nothing in the record that establishes what Mr. Robinson has claimed.  So I'd ask him to be a bit more careful in how he puts his propositions to the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, to the contrary, Mr. President, we had testimony from witness *****************, as well as an exhibit admitted during his testimony from the MRND -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it's -- eventually we are going to have to determine those facts.  You can put your question to the witness in a different way to elicit information that you are obviously seeking. 
MR. ROBINSON:
The information I gave to the witness is in the record, Mr. President, so I think the objection was not well founded.  But, in any event, I'll ask the witness -- 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	If you assume that the Interahamwe was created in the préfectures after April 1992, can you give us an estimate as to when it was that you saw -- or, that you heard that Mr. Ngirumpatse had convened this meeting at the MRND palace?
A.	Please, Counsel, can you repeat your question?  I haven't quite understood it. 
Q.	If you assume that the Interahamwe in Gisenyi were established after April 1992, can you tell us approximately when the meeting with Mr. Ngirumpatse and the préfectoral officials, in which they discussed discipline about the MRND and the Interahamwe, was held? 
A.	Well, Counsel, first of all, I don't agree with that hypothesis, supposition, to give a date for the establishment of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi.  

Anyhow, I personally are (sic) not aware of that.  I don't know about that.  Perhaps you know, but I don't.  I cannot -- I'm not ready to stipulate that period.  But I know that he came more than once, and especially in 1993, if my memory serves me right.  He held meetings with the -- attended by the authorities, whom I have named.  That is all I can give you.  I cannot go into the details of the creation of the Interahamwe or the dates stipulated for those meetings.  I can't remember.  

Lots of time has now passed; much time has now passed.  You should, perhaps, give me time to go and undertake some research, try to find something to remind me.  It's not something I have on the tip of my tongue here before the Court.  I'd rather abstain from giving you dates because they would not be correct.  
Q.	Okay.  Did you ever -- were you ever aware of Colonel Bagosora addressing any meeting of the MRND in Gisenyi? 
A.	You mean which participants, Counsel?  
Q.	No.  I'm asking you whether or not you ever learned that Colonel Bagosora had participated in a meeting of the MRND in Gisenyi.  
A.	I do not recall that, Mr. -- Counsel. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not remember that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, as I understand your testimony concerning your contacts with Colonel Bagosora, was that you were introduced to him at the meeting at location A sometime in 1992, and that he called you one time after that to ask how your work was going.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Was it just that one time that he called you? 
A.	I think so, yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, I want to direct your attention to your statement that you made on the -- in 2004.  And in this statement, which I'm reading from the English version, on page 6, which has K-number K0365035 -- and it's the second full paragraph.  And it reads, "After the meeting the participants went to the canteen for a drink, except Bagosora and Nsengiyumva, who went to visit the room where I was.  Nsengiyumva introduced me to Bagosora and explained my duties to him.  He also asked me to state my needs.  Bagosora merely commended me.  

"Subsequently, he telephoned me from time to time to enquire about the functioning of --" and I'm going to leave out the rest, but it was the place where you were working.  

So did you make that statement to the Office of the Prosecutor in 2004? 
A.	Yes, if I remember well, Counsel. 
Q.	And I put it to you that the same statement was made by you in 1998 in your statement, which was Exhibit D. NZ107, and so I'll ask you, then, if you could tell us why in 1998 and 2004 you testified that Colonel Bagosora telephoned you from time to time and today, in this trial, you have testified that he had called you only one time.  
A.	Counsel, I think one should make a nuance here.  You asked me when -- about when he came into his -- came into my office.  He didn't call me, but invited me to go and have a drink.  So between going and having a drink and calling me on the phone are two different things.  

I, myself, am confused.  I don't understand anything anymore because calling someone over the phone and inviting me to go to the canteen -- it's the only time he came and invited me to the canteen.  But as to calling me over the phone, I don't even remember how many times because I was there for a lengthy period of time.  And he called me several times.  

Maybe I could sit somewhere quietly and try and rake through my memory to tell you how many times he called me over the phone, the differences between inviting and calling.  I wasn't -- and regarding calling me over the phone, he'd call me and we'd talk.  But when he came into my place of work, he invited me for a drink.  That is the distinction -- the nuance one should draw.  

I hope you have understood me, Counsel. 
Q.	So you're saying that -- when you testified on the 15th of May, and again here this morning, that Colonel Bagosora called you only one time, you were meaning that that was the only time he called you out from his office?  Is that correct? 
A.	No, I -- I don't understand very well what you are put -- saying.  To call me out of my office?  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	If -- if you are saying call me out of my office, what -- what do you mean?  Please, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay.  I'm having trouble understanding you.  

So you had testified in direct examination, and again today, that Colonel Bagosora had called you one time.  Now, I've pointed out in your statements where you had said that he had called you from time to time.  So I'm trying to understand what the reason is for that discrepancy.  So, can you explain that?  
A.	Well, Counsel, if you can show me the two versions, maybe we could banish this misunderstanding.  I don't understand.  Perhaps it's just a play on words.  I've tried to explain to you in few words what had been asked me elsewhere and what you are asking me here.  I'm trying to answer your question.  

When he came to my office, he invited -- it is not he and his colleague.  Colonel Bagosora invited me to the canteen. 

Now, as to telephone calls, if someone had asked me whether "Did you once speak with such-and-such," I could answer, "Yes, I received his phone call."  I know whether it's calling me from time to time.  It would depend on the question.  The answer is in answer to a question, so we have to see what the question is to know why I've said this or that because an answer is in reply to the question put.  

That's how I see it, Counsel.  Unfortunately, I have no document here before me to see in what context -- in what -- which version -- I think that's already (sic) I can say.  

Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay.  We're going to move forward from that to some of the organisations that you described during your direct testimony.  And I believe that you testified you became aware of such organisations as the réseau zéro, the dragons, the Abakozi, the death squad, and the friends of the alliance; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay.  And can you explain to us, of those groups, which is the group that had the largest number of members? 
A.	Well, Counsel, as to the exact membership of each group, I can't tell you which was the more -- most numerous because I don't even believe that the only ones I knew were the only ones involved.  They were only the ones known among the circle of officers with whom I moved.  Perhaps there were others, but I can't tell you whether they were more numerous or less numerous except that some names, which I still remembered.  

At a -- one point when the question was put to me, I gave the names I had.  And the names that I couldn't remember, well, it's gone and the others that perhaps weren't given to me by Lieutenant Bizumuremyi or at the various times when I lived there.  I couldn't give you that estimate, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, were all these five groups different groups, or were some of them names for the same groups?  For example, the dragons and the Abakozi:  Was that two different names for the same group, or were (sic) that two different groups? 
A.	Well, Counsel, from what I knew in the specific circle in Gisenyi at the officers' mess, the groups had different names meaning the same thing.  There wasn't only the Dragons and the Abakozi.  The Abakozi is a name that comes from Gukora.  There were terms which say "work," "go to work." 

For the militiamen and the soldiers, it meant going into anti-RPF operations, anti-Ibiyitso, to go and kill.  Instead of telling people to go and kill -- you wouldn't say that.  It's heavy; it's not good.  You'd say, "Go to work."  When a leader tells a small group, "You're now going to go and work," those who said Abakozi, the workers, that's what it means.  You understand that workers, that matches a word you can't pronounce, which is not polite, which is not human.  You don't tell people to go and kill.  So if you say to -- talk about going to work, the work -- that is Abakozi.  Abakozi are the workers, the dragons.  Good workers, people considered to be trustworthy, good workers, good workmen.  It is those people who were lumped together, as we called the dragons.  They might also be called the Abakozi, or they might also be called the friends of the alliance.  That was another name in Kinyarwanda.  The friends of the alliance.  You might say Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi.  "Mugambi" means alliance, something alliance.  What alliance?  Question mark.  

But those Impuzamugambi, friends of the alliance, Interahamwe, friends of the alliance.  These are names that were used in the group.  There I don't know if others knew that, but in everyday terms we used those words.  But in practice there were different groups, and we knew that there were groups of leaders and groups of people who had to execute, implement, fulfill orders.  So the group of the leaders were the ones we called the dragons, the people who would give orders, the people who had authority over the others, the smaller groups.  With what we called the squads were also friends of the alliance, Impuzamugambi, and Interahamwe, the small groups, very small groups, who would receive orders and would have to put them into effect.  

According to him, the lieutenant, who was a coordinator, in the plan he had in (sic) the names were organised in groups of dragons or in squads.  And the réseau, that was, rather, in connection with communications.  

I don't know -- I hope I've answered your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay.  Witness, ZF, your answer was much, much, too long, but we will get back to that when we -- afterwards.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Would you like to take the break now, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take a morning recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1031H)
(Pages 6 to 18 by Ann Burum)




































(Court resumed at 1108H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, with your permission, I should like to raise a motion following on your decision of        18th of May regarding complicity and joint criminal enterprise.  We have seen the English text but, as you know, we are only -- our English is only rudimentary.  We should like to ask you to urge the Registrar to provide a French translation as quickly as possible so that we can discuss it with our client in full knowledge of what is stated there so that we can make appropriate submissions as necessary.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can assure you that -- steps have already been taken to try to get a translation prepared as soon as possible.
MR. SOW: 
I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, as we continue from here on, can you please try to keep your answers brief so that we can move forward more quickly.  Did there come a time in November of 2002 that you prepared a list of persons who you claim were members of the dragons, Abakozi, réseau zéro, and the death squads? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, could you please repeat the question, I didn't fully grasp it. 
Q.	In November of 2002, did you prepare a list of the friends of the alliance dragons, Abakozi, réseau zéro, and the death squad? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if the registrar could come and retrieve the list and its copies, I have made copies for everyone, and then present a copy to the witness.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness ZF, directing your attention to the papers that have been placed before you, is this, in fact, the list of civilians and military members of these organisations as you knew them? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer this exhibit as D. NZ108. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ108 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	And, Witness ZF, I'm just going to call your attention to some of these names and ask then if it was your information that these people were members of those organisations.  First number, 23,
 	Hormisdas Nsengimana, priest; and, then, number 29, Michel Bagaragaza; on the list of militaries, number 21, general of the brigade, Leonidas Rusatira; and on number 28, Major Ngendahimana; and number 33, Major Kabera; and number 41, Lieutenant Bizumuremyi.  

And is it your testimony that all of these people were members of these organisations?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, as they were introduced to me at various times. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, could you repeat the last name, I didn't get that one. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Bizumuremyi. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  So now we will turn aside from that list.  And I want to ask you about the meeting at the  Méridien hotel in which you claimed you learned about it at the end of 1993 in which Mr. Nzirorera had attended, according to you.  Now, from whom did you hear about this meeting? 
A.	It was Lieutenant Bizumuremyi who told me about it, but it was also mentioned at the officers' mess. 
Q.	Was Major Kabera also one of the people who told you about this? 
A.	I mentioned Lieutenant Bizumuremyi and conversations that were held at the officers' mess -- at the officers' mess. 
Q.	I'm going to read from your statement to the Office of the Prosecutor in 2004, and it is on page 7, K0365036.  You talk about the meeting at Hôtel Méridien.  Then you say, "I got this information from Major Kabera and Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, as well as from comments by officers at the Gisenyi camp mess."  And I want to ask if you that was an accurate statement when you made it? 
A.	I think that that statement is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And can we agree that Major Kabera was no longer in Gisenyi as of August 1993? 
A.	Counsel, I can't tell you whether Major Kabera was just passing through or posted there, that I don't know. 
Q.	Can you tell us the names of people who attended the meeting at the Méridien hotel with Mr. Nzirorera at the end of 1993, as far as you know? 
A.	In respect of that question, Counsel, I would say that I only asked the lieutenant, who was with his colleagues at the mess, the people who had taken part in the meeting, and he said that it was the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi, but as to the individual's names I didn't seek to know that.  But if you spoke of Interahamwe or Impuzamugambi it directly involved people such as Barnabé, who must have been there as a leader of the Impuzamugambi, and Munyagishari, Bernard, who was the head of the Interahamwe.  He must have attended, but that is just what I suppose.  I did -- I was not interested and I did not seek to know the individual names.  He said that the Interahamwe had met with him and that is all -- that was the extent of my interest in the matter. 
Q.	And do you know whether Colonel Nsengiyumva attended this meeting? 
A.	I no longer recall, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, you testified that the day after this meeting there was a distribution of firearms to the Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And is that something you witnessed yourself or something you were told by others? 
A.	I was an eyewitness, Counsel. 
Q.	Did you see Mr. Nzirorera that day? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	And who was it that distributed the weapons to the Interahamwe? 
A.	It was Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, Counsel. 
Q.	And was an individual named Omar Serushago among those who received weapons that day? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And that is something you saw with your own eyes; correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And there were Motorola radios also distributed to the Interahamwe that day? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And thereafter, did the Interahamwe communicate amongst themselves and with                          Lieutenant Bizumuremyi by Motorola radio? 
A.	Yes.  From time to time, when I was with him, I could see him sending from his Motorola, and the names he uttered were those of those leaders.  I saw him doing it, which puts me in a position where I can say that it was customary with him. 
Q.	Now, I want to direct your attention to the 6th of April 1994.  You have testified that you were taken to the Gisenyi military camp that evening, and that you spent most of that evening and the next morning sitting in the office of Colonel Nsengiyumva; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, I did not understand when you said part of the night.  It was that night I was with him.  And, perhaps, you should respect the nuance between words in French; stayed with him doesn't mean that we sat from 11 p.m. to -- until the morning.  (Inaudible) we would come in, go out.  But the time I stayed with him was just when I heard what he had said and when I spoke with him.  Don't think that we, every single minute -- and we were there and we didn't do something else.  I don't know if I have answered your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, from the time you arrived at the Gisenyi camp at, let's say, around 10 o'clock p.m. until sometime around 7 the next morning, is it true that you remained at the Gisenyi camp during that entire period? 
A.	Counsel, until 6 in the morning, 6 a.m. 
Q.	And this was a time of great crisis for the Rwandan army, was it not? 
A.	Yes, I do think so, Counsel. 
Q.	And you had, in fact, been summoned to come to the camp from your -- where you had been -- your place of business; correct? 
A.	No.  They came to get me in town where I was.  I was no longer at the camp at location A.  They came to fetch me from the town centre, Gisenyi town centre. 
Q.	And what was the purpose of them coming to fetch you at 10 o'clock at night or 9 o'clock at night?  What was the purpose of that? 
A.	I did not seek to know the why and the wherefores, Counsel.  What I know is that the one who came to get me told me that Colonel Nsengiyumva wanted me to go to meet him.  And when I arrived there, I stayed with him until morning.  The motivation, I don't know, he himself is the only one who knows.  I don't know the motivation.  He is the only one who can tell you. 
Q.	Well, Witness ZF, it makes no sense to me that you would be taken to the Gisenyi camp at this time when the war had just been launched against the Rwandan army, and given the skills that you possessed, given the position that you held, you would sit around for the entire evening at the     Gisenyi camp having coffee with Lieutenant Nsengiyumva instead of taking up your duties at location A.  Can you explain why you did that? 
A.	Counsel, my first answer to that question would be, I could not think in the ops commander's stead.  It was Colonel Nsengiyumva who commanded, it was up to him to reflect and decide.  But the way my work was organised, personally, I didn't think that there was any danger of badly doing -- of badly doing my work because as -- that there would be any difficulties in my work because he himself had organised.  We had *********** and there were people there to do it.  So if that was his line of thought or if he had other motivations, I don't know.  And I was not in a position either even to ask him why.  That is my answer, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness ZF, I put it to you that on the evening of the 6th and 7th, many people who were at the   Gisenyi camp during those events, including officers, soldiers, militia, have been interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor and not a single one of them has ever mentioned seeing you there at that time.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	I have no comment as such.  But it is surprising because that would mean that, at the time, I couldn't even bring the product of my work at that time since they never saw me.  So I don't know, perhaps, you yourself can think what you like.  But what I find abnormal, that I can -- is that I could not have been there at that time, whereas I should --  I went there more than five or six times a day, according to the -- what my work produced, or what was produced at location A. 
Q.	But all of those things were produced in the morning of the 7th of April after 8:45 a.m.  And we are speaking of the evening from the time you got to the camp until the time that even you yourself say that you began this work.  I'm telling you that during that time period you claim to be sitting in the office of Anatole Nsengiyumva listening to his end of the telephone conversations with Colonel Bagosora and being about the Gisenyi camp watching the militia arrive.  And I'm telling you that during that period, for all of the people who have been interviewed who were at that same place, none of them ever mentioned seeing you.  So that is why I am asking you to comment on why is it that nobody saw you during this period that you claim you were at the Gisenyi camp? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, could counsel clarify if any -- if these many people were ever asked if this particular witness was present on the location?
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I can't clarify that because every witness statement does not contain questions, it only contains the statements, so it is impossible to clarify as Mr. Webster well knows.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But in terms of putting this proposition to the witness, one is left with the impression that these witnesses were interviewed about the presence of this witness on the location, so I'm trying -- I am asking you if you could clear up that ambiguity for us because I would believe that the witness or any impartial observer would think that these witnesses were being asked about this witness's presence,  and I don't think that is the case.  So could you clarify that when you put your proposition to the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I can represent that in the statements people have listed those persons whom they saw.  And among those lists, the name of this witness does not appear.  I can't take it any further than that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And the proposition I am putting to you, Witness ZF, is that when people who were present at     Gisenyi camp on the evening of the 6th, up until, let's say, 6 o'clock in the morning of the 7th, were interviewed, and when they gave the names of the other people they saw at this camp, nobody mentioned you.  And I'm wondering if you would like to comment on that?
A.	Counsel, I have no comments on this question.  What I have told you is that that would be abnormal because I was there.  And I know that I was there on several occasions, as usual.  So if someone did not see me, it is perhaps because that person did not meet me because the camp is a camp, it is a big camp.  And in the soldiers' quarters, at the homes of married soldiers, single persons, and someone in the living quarters cannot see someone in the commander's office.  However, I cannot say that they are telling the truth or lying.  However, it is not normal for that to have happened because people worked every day.  ***********************************************************************************
           ***************************************, including the day of the 6th of April. 
Q.	Now, you have testified that during the course of the day of the 7th of April, you made several trips into Gisenyi town with Colonel Nsengiyumva, and you went virtually all over the town during those trips.  And I put it to you that the Prosecution has interviewed several witnesses who claim to have seen Colonel Nsengiyumva at various places in Gisenyi on the 7th of April 1994 and, again, not a single person has indicated that they saw you.  Would you like to comment on that?  
A.	No comment, Counsel. 
Q.	And is it not true that in a previous proceeding, when you were asked about your activities on the 7th, and I'm referring to the testimony in 2001, at page 19, you testified that after you delivered a message at around 10 o'clock in the morning that Colonel Nsengiyumva told you to go back to the place where you were working and told you to stay there permanently.  Did you give that testimony in 2001? 
A.	Counsel, I no longer recall the context in which I gave that answer.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Mr. President, I will have to do this in closed session, so I am going to move on to something else. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	With respect to the activities of Omar Serushago, I want to ask you several questions about what you have observed?
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have, again, enquired of Mr. Webster concerning this and he is not in a position to give me any different information, so I am going to have to go ahead and ask these questions at this time.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	First of all, was Omar Serushago one of the members of the militia who you observed on the night of the 6th and the morning of the 7th at Gisenyi camp? 
A.	I did not see him, Counsel. 
Q.	And you saw him on the 7th of April coming from the home of the Tegeli family; correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And when he was leaving that home, he told Colonel Nsengiyumva that he had just got rid of some Inyenzi; correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And then you went inside that home and you found the corpse of Tegeli, his wife and two children lying in a pool of blood; correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And you also saw Omar Serushago at the commune rouge; correct? 
A.	I do not quite remember the context, Counsel, unless you read out the passage to me. 
Q.	This is an open session testimony that you gave in the Bagosora Case, so I'm going to read it to you.  You were asked if you had gone to the commune rouge, and this is on page -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could you give us the date and page number, please? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
This is on page 59, of testimony given on the 28th of November 2002.  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	At the end of page 58, you were asked, "Did you ever go to the commune rouge with the defendant Nsengiyumva?"  And your answer was, and this is at the top of page 59, "I did, Counsel."
	
	Next question:  "Do you recall when that was?"  And your answer:  "Counsel, I don't remember the date, but if my memory serves me well, it was in 1994 at some time during the month of April."

	Next question:  "Can you please describe to the Court what you saw?"  And your answer was:  "I remember that when we went by the cemetery, we saw a gathering of persons who were in the middle of the cemetery.  At the entrance to the cemetery, there was a small group of people, they were militiamen.  And the people gathered at the middle of the cemetery were not clothed.  There were other people behind them who had clubs and machetes and there were others who had rifles.  We arrived at the cemetery and the chief, who was there at the time, was a certain Omar who was among the chiefs responsible for the surveillance.  He saluted the ops commander.  We stopped for a moment and then we moved on.  On the way back, we went to the operations camp for the Rwandan army."

	Now, does that refresh your memory as to whether or not you saw Omar Serushago at the       commune rouge?
A.	Yes, Counsel, but a little distinction should be made here because there is a place known as   commune rouge which is the cemetery and there is the entrance to commune rouge where there was a gate and militia guarding the entrance.  And the leader, who was at the head of the militias who were at the entrance, was Omar.  So if I had said that Omar was at the commune rouge, it means that he was with those people who were at the commune.  He was at the entrance to commune rouge.  That is why I asked you to read out the transcript to me so that I should make that distinction.  It was not at the commune rouge, but at the entrance to the commune rouge. 
Q.	Was it on the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	So, did you also see Omar at a roadblock at a juncture of the road between the customs and the breweries? 
A.	Counsel, I remember seeing him on several occasions.  But unless you give me the context, I wouldn't know when and where.  It would, perhaps, be good for you to specify the context, that is, the context in which I said that because he was a leader, he passed through roadblocks.  There were times when he would stop and other times when he would be on duty.  There are many circumstances here, and I cannot recall all of the circumstances.  I don't even know the circumstances under which I answered any question put to me in that regard.  If you place me in the specific context, I would be in a position to say yes or no, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, for the 7th of April, we know, at least, that you saw Omar Serushago coming out of the home of the Tegeli family, which had just been murdered.  And we know that you saw him at the commune rouge where the people were being taken to be killed and buried.  And that all occurred on the 7th of April; correct?
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, I put to it you that Omar Serushago has told the Prosecutor, and testified now at two trials, that he never left his home during the period of the 6th of April through the 14th of April, and was spending that time caring for his pregnant wife.  Would you care to comment on that? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no objection to the question itself, but I would like a point of clarification, if I may, because if     Mr. Robinson is going to put that proposition to this witness, he should do so in a way that is consistent or will be consistent when he cross-examines Omar Serushago when he testifies in this case.  It would not be appropriate to that proposition to this witness and to take the position that Omar Serushago was not in commune rouge on the 7th of April and then turn around and make an inverse proposition to Omar Serushago when he testifies.  Perhaps the Court could provide some instruction on that point.  But the propositions that the Defence is putting to the witness has to be consistent.  It is not appropriate, in my submission, for him to take one proposition with one witness and then turn around and use the -- an opposite, the inverse proposition with another Prosecution witness that is being called.  So if we can clarify that point. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's a very good point, Mr. President, because I myself am at a total loss.  I don't believe either of these individuals.  I don't know.  Their testimony is totally, completely opposite each other on this point, and I myself don't know which of them are telling the truth.  All I want to do is establish the contradiction between both of them.  I think I'm allowed to do that without having to take a position as to which is the correct version. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think that is a correct position so we will permit you to ask. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ZF, I'm telling you that Omar Serushago has stated on several occasions that he did not leave his home between the 6th of April and the 14th of April because he was caring for his pregnant wife.  So would you care to comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, I was not aware of Omar's family situation as it was.  But what I know is that at that time and at that specific location I saw him. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, also with respect to Omar Serushago, you were told, were you not, that there is a house in Gisenyi where Damas, Thomas and Omar would take girls to rape them before executing them; correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, were you aware that Omar Serushago had killed the sister of Colonel Nzungize during the events of April 1994?  And the spelling is N-Z-U-N-G-I-Z-E. 
A.	Counsel, I was not aware of that situation. 
Q.	Okay.  So it was not a big scandal within the Gisenyi ops, as far as you knew, that Serushago had killed the sister of Colonel Nzungize and needed protection from other authorities.  You never heard anything like that? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, finally, with respect to Serushago, if we can just go back before April 1994, was there an incident where Omar Serushago had shot a student in the head in Rubavu town centre? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, according to what I heard. 
Q.	And the student was a Hutu; correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And Omar Serushago had to be protected in the Gisenyi camp from the -- from the fury of the population after he did this killing; correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And then he had to go into the rural areas to hide and did not come back until some time later; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  That concludes my questions about Mr. Serushago.  Now, I want to ask you about the times that you claim you saw Mr. Nzirorera in Gisenyi after April 1994.  So, first of all, can you tell us how many times you spoke to Mr. Nzirorera after April of 1994?
A.	Counsel, I do not know whether you are talking of a conversation I had with him, however, I would say that Nzirorera came to the camp, not to speak with me but to see Colonel Nsengiyumva and Bizumuremyi, who were his collaborators and who were there.  And it was with them that he had a conversation.  And, if I remember correctly, I saw him twice at the camp and he passed by on other occasions.  And I was told about those other occasions but, personally, I saw him only twice. 
Q.	And on either of those two occasions, did you speak with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	I personally did not speak with him, but I remember that he greeted me and said two or three words to me, but I never spoke to him as such. 
Q.	Apart from the two times you saw him at the Gisenyi camp after April -- after 6 April 1994, did you ever see him in Gisenyi town? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And did you ever speak to him on any of those occasions when you saw him in town? 
A.	I did not speak to him, but on the two occasions when he saw me during his visit, he recognised me, greeted me and then went his way. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I can have the registrar return to me the 1998 statement, which is Exhibit D. 107.  I would like to use that for a moment and I gave them my only copy. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you think you are going to take on this subject?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
On this subject maybe about 15 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Do you want -- are we supposed to take a recess or something. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not a recess, we wanted to have a -- just a brief intervention for some management issues. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I can continue -- I can do this on Tuesday morning.  It is no -- if you want to do that now, it is no problem, or if you want me to continue.  Stop me at any time.  It is not so important. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will see if you can finish. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
So, if Issa can give me back the English version of Exhibit D. 107.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  I'm going to read to you from your statement in 1998, which is Exhibit D. 107.  I'm going to read from page 5, it is K0222251.  And you were asked about Joseph Nzirorera.  It says:  "During one of his numerous visits to the Gisenyi military camp, when Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva was ops commander, the latter introduced me to the former as" -- and then it states what your occupation was,  I'm going to omit that.  "Nzirorera asked me where I came from and I told him I was a native of Byumba.  Nzirorera spoke with Anatole about Banyanduga, Rwandans from the south.  They offered me a bottle of beer and continued their conversation while I sat down at a table to have a meal and drink my beer.  I knew Nzirorera by sight because he had been minister of public works for a long time.  After I had been introduced to him, we spoke quite often whenever we met at the military camp or in town."  

Witness ZF, did you make that statement to the Prosecutor in 1998? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And would you like to explain the nuance between that statement and the testimony you have given here today? 
A.	Counsel, I think the question you are putting to me today is totally different from the question that was put to me on the other occasion.  You do not know the question that was put to me.  You have only read out the answer.  We talk of conversations and we also talk of speaking to someone.  Now, conversing with someone and just speaking to someone are two different things.  Someone can speak to another and, on that basis, you hold a conversation.  I have told you that I never spoke to him, but he, when he met me, he spoke to me.  I believe this is clear French.  Whenever there is a conversation between two persons, there is always someone who takes the initiative to speak to someone else, that is what we mean when we say he spoke -- when I said he spoke to me.  I never said that he did not speak to me, but I said I did not speak with him.  I have never said that I had a conversation with him.  And whenever he asked for something, I would explain it to him.  That is already a conversation.  When you are asked, "How are you?  How is work?", we would have a conversation or we would talk to one another.  That is what we call a conversation, he put a question to me and we had conversation.

I believe that on that occasion, when I said that whenever we met in town, and I don't remember how often or how many times, because that happened a long time ago -- when he spoke to me, we would have a conversation.  I do not see what the difference or the distinction is here.  This is the only distinction I would make between the two statements or the two testimonies.  It is not that I am giving another testimony here which is different from what I gave in the other case.  It all depends on the questions that were put to me.  I believe this is what I would say by way of an answer, Counsel.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And if I may, Your Honours, just for the clarity of the record, I found the English translation that          Mr. Robinson was reading somewhat dissatisfying.  When you read the last two sentences of that paragraph in French, I think the meaning is slightly different.  And I would like to read those into the record just so that we are clear on what the witness acknowledged as his statement.  So looking at the last two sentences, and it is on page 7 of the French text, which ends in K number 9486, and I'm going to read it the French for the translation booth.  

It says:  "I knew Nzirorera facially because he had been the minister of public works for a long time.  I knew him by sight.  After I had been introduced to him, we would talk together quite often if he met me at the military camp or in town." 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, it is the same -- exactly as the English translation, but maybe there is some nuance that us Anglophones don't understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean west coast Anglophones. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I mean Caribbean Anglophones. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I could offer my own translation but, you know, I think we have gone past the issue because now the witness has heard exactly what is in the witness statement; he can expand upon his answer if he needs to. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	With respect to the first time that you saw Mr. Nzirorera at Gisenyi camp, can you tell us how close to the 6th of April that occasion was? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I can't, for the moment, tell you how long, but what I remember, for the time being, that it was after April. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, that was lively but I don't have any idea where it came from. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think that...(microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness -- the witness may have an explanation. 
THE WITNESS:
Pray forgive me.  I forgot to turn off my telephone.  Do forgive me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We accept your apology. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, were you aware that there was a time that the interim government came to Gisenyi and began operating from Gisenyi? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when that was, maybe like what month? 
A.	I no longer recall.  And, personally, I didn't see him operating as such.  It is only that I learnt at one point that the government was installed in Gisenyi, but I no longer remember when. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I see the Chamber's legal officer is here.  I was wondering is that how they dress at the ICC. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
When they play football. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can't give him legal advice.  

I'm sorry for the interruption. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ZF, can you tell us if the first time you saw Mr. Nzirorera was before or after the interim government had arrived in Gisenyi? 
A.	Well, Counsel, the first time -- listen, I can't speak of the interim government because I don't know when the interim government set up in Gisenyi.  But the first time after -- when he came it was after the       6th of April and the beginning of May, sometime then, approximately.  That is the time frame I would suggest.  As you are insisting on giving the time, that is the time frame I would put forward, I suggest. 
Q.	And the second time that Mr. Nzirorera came to Gisenyi op camp, can you give us an approximate time frame or at least tell us how long after the first visit that was? 
A.	I wouldn't know.  I couldn't make an estimate.  But there was a short lapse, it was a relatively short lapse of time between the two visits, but I can't be more precise than that.  I couldn't give you an exact figure, in other words. 
Q.	Now, focusing on the first visit, can you tell us who was with Mr. Nzirorera when you saw him? 
A.	When he came to the camp for the first time I remember he was accompanied by Félicien Kabuga and Colonel Bagosora who came to the camp also at that time. 
Q.	Did you see them arrive? 
A.	I saw the first to arrive was Nzirorera and Félicien Kabuga, and subsequently Bagosora also arrived. 
Q.	And were you able to see the vehicles in which these people had arrived? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Could you describe those vehicles? 
A.	The vehicle that brought Nzirorera and Kabuga was a civilian vehicle, I no longer recall the make; whereas Colonel Bagosora came in a military jeep, a radio jeep.  It is the sort of vehicle often used by commanders, a radio jeep, a jeep equipped with a radio. 
Q.	And were there any other persons in the vehicle of Mr. Kabuga and Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	And do you know which one of them were driving the vehicle? 
A.	Neither, perhaps the other people you are looking -- seeking are the drivers, they were driven by drivers. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm not quite going to be able to finish this as quickly as I thought, so maybe we can take the break now if you wanted to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  I think it is time.  We need to break now.

Mr. Witness, we are going to take the adjournment in a few minutes, but you are going to be excused now.  We'll return to you -- your testimony on Tuesday the 23rd.  And you can come back to court to continue your evidence at that time.  I remind you repetitiously that during this adjournment you are not to discuss this case or your testimony with anybody.  You may go.
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, our main objective was to ensure that everything was in place for the video conference next week.  As a preliminary to that, could we clarify; we have two days next week for the continuation of ZF's testimony, as we will not be able to do the video link for technical reasons outside of our control and to do really with positions in The Hague.  We will not be able to do the video link on the 23rd and the   25th of May, that is Tuesday and Thursday.  It would be of interest to clarify whether we could have the cross-examination concluded between all Defence teams on those days.  

How far you and what are is the positions of your colleagues?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, Mr. President, I'm actually very far and I think I only would have one hour or less on Tuesday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin and Mr. Sow, what is your position with regard to the -- would you be able to fit into the established timetable?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think we could finish hearing that witness.  I had thought I would take a day, and in light of the issues raised, I think I will be using the full day -- the full day.  But I should like to have one more day in light -- depending on the sort of answers given and depending on the objections that might be raised. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, what is your position?  
MR. SOW:
	Mr. President, as you know, speaking last I would need probably a half of day to finish my cross.  A half day I think would be enough.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Robinson, I forgot to mention information that I believe may already be available to everybody here, that Trial Chamber I has, in fact, decided on the -- on your application.  Have you got access to that decision yet?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I haven't, but I will liaise with your courtroom people after this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay.  Well, that should not extend your -- that should not extend your cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I don't know the decision, but if I have access to the closed session testimony, I would have to obtain that testimony and then I could let you know, but if I don't have -- if they denied the access, then I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, your application was successful. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Well, the next step would be for someone from CMS to disclose the closed session testimonies of these, I believe, seven witnesses.  And then I could read that.  I don't think it is particularly longer, and I don't think it is going to add that much, but these things need to be done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, my conclusion from hearing counsel is that the timetable could be enforced and that we should be able to complete the testimony of ZF during the course of the two available days next week.  

This brings us now to Witness T.  It is extremely important that the schedule for Witness T is observed.  There are -- there are ten days allocated for his testimony; two days for the examination-in-chief, seven days for cross-examination to be shared among the Defence teams, a half day for re-examination, and a half day for contingencies.  

The timetable during the video link, we will start at 9:30 in the morning and end at 6 p.m., with a lunch break from 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m.  Now, I received information that the country from which the video link will be broadcast will have in the chamber a judge who will be there to guarantee the integrity of the proceedings.  I had not been aware that that provision had been provided.  

Now the judge would require that at the commencement of the proceedings all counsel present there, be formally introduced on the record.  There was a note which stressed the importance of that.  So I would be grateful if that information could be communicated.

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I share the Trial Chamber's concern that we stay on schedule.  And to that end, I would like to suggest that we convene at 9 o'clock on Monday.  I know that Mr. Robinson usually has a string of motions anytime we have a witness begin his testimony.  And if we can do that before the video link is actually in place, I think it may expedite matters.  So if there are going to be any pre-testimony motions can we dispense of those before the link is actually live at 9:30?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- I wouldn't want to sit in court if we have nothing to do.  The Chamber will be available for 9 o'clock.  Could we impose upon you a requirement to give notice if you have any motions to make?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I do have some, so we won't be wasting our time.  I would even like to, if you have a few minutes, I would like to raise one issue with you right now about that so we can address a couple of issues.  I don't think we are ready to begin the testimony of Witness T because of disclosure issues that are still pending.  And one of them is pending before the Chamber, in fact.  So, that is one problem that we ought to talk about before 9 o'clock on Monday morning, is the specific motion dealing with the disclosure for Witness T that has never been ruled on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you identify that, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
It is a motion to disclose benefits for Witnesses G and T.  It has been pending for probably a month or so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And what was the other issue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
The other issue that I would like to raise it concerns the closed session.  And I would like to particularly asked Mr. Webster if he is willing -- before I make my motion, because we have been discussing this back and forth by email, and I am wondering if Mr. Webster would be willing to indicate -- I have not intercepted any of his emails this time, but I wondering if he might be willing to indicate whether he would have any problem if we took that testimony from Witness T in open session, to the extent that we could be consistent with protecting his identity. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I understood that with regard to the issue of open and closed session, that your position has modified somewhat.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes and no.  And in order to give an expansive answer, we would have to go to into closed session because it will go into the protective measures that this Court has authorised which -- and I think that one of those provisions was that any discussion of the protective measures be conducted in closed session.  I don't think I would have a lot to say.  We can do that on Monday morning if the Court would prefer not to go back and forth into closed session now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, if you are going to be making any -- or modified concession, it would be useful for the parties to know in advance. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would not offer to make the modification as Mr. Robinson has put it.  I mean, I'm -- if we are talking about something consensual I could clarify the position in closed session, but in terms of reversing our position on the protective order, I'm not willing to do that.  But I think I would really need to do it in closed session to be explicit about what I had in mind.  And I mean, we can do that during the last ten minutes of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we are about to close our session now. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can go into closed session for a few minutes.  I think what we -- you have already persuaded us and I think we have agreed that we will start early on Monday to dispose of the matters that have been raised as far as we can.  And we will go into closed session now to deal with the issue of the protective orders with regard to Witness T.  We will go into closed session now.
