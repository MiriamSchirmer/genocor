MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MS. BEN SALIMO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, 17th April 2008, for the resumption -- for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue.  I will say what I said yesterday morning, that I hope this is your last day of appearance.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  

Mr. Webster will begin. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning to the Trial Chamber and the parties.
WITNESS BTH,
RE-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning to you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I want to pick up with something that we started to discuss yesterday, and that's with regard to a statement that was taken from Number 15 on the list we've been referring to.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Could the registry make sure that the witness has that exhibit in front of him, please?  

And for the parties and the Chamber, I am referring to page 177 in the bundle.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, we began discussing the statement yesterday.  It concerns a number of people, but the information was taken from number 15.  Can we start by agreeing that number 15 and number 11 on that list are brothers? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that number 16 is their father? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Because that's exactly what number 15 says in his statement in the middle of the page.  Now, when you spoke to number 15, right after he spoke to the members of the OTP, did he tell you that he misrepresented everything else?  Because yesterday you told us that he misrepresented his account of a letter that he was supposed to have.  Did he tell you that that anything else he told OTP investigators was not true? 
A.	You know that you cannot say everything when you speak on the telephone, particularly since it is expensive and it is not possible to say everything because you are never sure whether your call is being monitored or not.  But he told me that people had come to see him.  He told me about them, and he said that they had told him to greet me.  

I asked him what they had discussed and he told me that the person had asked him questions on the documents that I had given.  He said he did not comment on the documents, but since he did not have more money to continue the conversation, he stopped there.  But I had even -- already told him that even if he had told the truth about the documents that I had given to him, that would not have been a problem. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that.  Because that's consistent with what was documented in the statement from number 15.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  If that is true, I would like to make a motion that the Trial Chamber investigate whether its orders had been complied with, with respect to non-contact of witnesses during the course of their testimonies, because it's been your standing order that there is not to be any contact with the witness until he's completed his testimony.  In this case, even though I communicated with Mr. Webster once the decision was made to recall this witness, and we agreed that there will be no contact directly or indirectly by either party with this witness, since he was going to be resuming his testimony.  Now, I see that Mr. Webster himself, since he is the author of this interview note, went to see the brother of the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Before Mr. Robinson continues, can we have the witness take off his headphone?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, please remove your headphone.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So the witness has now testified that Mr. Webster sent a message to him through his brother, and said even yesterday that I think, Mr. Webster --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you put back your headphone, please?  Could the witness put back his headphone?  

Mr. Witness, do you understand English?  
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know we don't know where this discussion is going to lead.  If it's going to be examined fully at this stage, but if it is going to be, then I think we ought to ask the witness to leave.  We already have to bear in mind his current residence is in a predominantly English speaking country.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I think that will be fine.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Mr. Witness, I think we will ask you to leave the room for a short while.  
(Witness exited courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I am making now a motion to sanction Mr. Webster pursuant to Rule 46(A) of the rules, for violating your order concerning contacts with the witnesses during the course of their testimonies.  

Now, the evidence has shown that Mr. Webster contacted the brother of the witness, and according to the witness, he just testified that he told the brother that he wanted to send a message to this witness.  

In addition, yesterday, Mr. Webster said that he had gone personally so that -- to Ruhengeri and talked to these witnesses so that this witness would know that he, personally, was sending him a message or was making these enquiries.  And, notably, he took with him, during the interview, the witness's brother, the very individual who the witness had said was the one who encouraged him to give false testimony while he was employed with the prosecutor general office in Rwanda.  

I believe that this conduct violates your order that there be no contact with witnesses, especially after this witness had recanted in February, and that at the end of March, Mr. Webster goes to his family with the guy who arranged for him to give the false testimony and sends a message to the witness.  I think that is very improper and has the ability to show the witness's willingness to come and give the testimony -- the recanting testimony that he indicated he was ready to give when he was interviewed in February.  And because it's a violation of your order that there be no contact with witnesses during their testimony, I think that Rule 46(A) comes into play.  You've already given the Prosecution some warnings under that rule.  So, now, if you find that there's been a violation of your order, they should be sanctioned for it.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, do not reply as yet, please.  

Mr. Webster, we don't think that you should reply orally, so we want to give you time to respond in writing.  Would two days be sufficient?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Two days meaning Monday morning?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, okay.  Would that be sufficient?  
MR. WEBSTER:  
Yes, that's fine.  But since the witness is here, Your Honour, I think the enquiry can be settled with a simple question to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you are still conducting your cross-examination (sic), but we think it's a motion to sanction, in our view, requires a reasonable opportunity to respond.  If you volunteer to respond, it doesn't mean we will accept your response, but we thought that we should indicate the willingness to give you time.  But if you don't want the time, then we will hear you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I do not think the time is necessary.  I think that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you want us to evaluate now on an oral response?  You want to respond orally now?  
MR. WEBSTER:  
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Well, we will withdraw our order giving you leave to respond in writing.  

MR. WEBSTER:
I think the enquiry can be managed by simply asking the witness if anyone from the Prosecution team has been in contact with him, and the Court can make that enquiry itself. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Court is not inclined to enquire.  If you wish to do it, it may give rise to further cross-examination by the other side.  If you wish to proceed in that way, well, we will accept your request.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  I think I will put that question to the witness, and based on his response, I will incorporate that in my -- in a written response that I will file on Monday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  You can't have two types of responses.  There is nothing wrong in providing a written response and also including it in your cross-examination (sic).  But if you have told us that you do not want to make your response in writing and you are going to respond orally, you can't also respond in writing. 
MR. WEBSTER:
What I would like to do is what the Court thinks is the best response, respond in writing on Monday, and then I will also put a question to the witness now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, so ordered. 

Mr. Robinson, we think it's reasonable to respond to your motion (inaudible).  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, that's fine.  It gives me a chance to reply.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
How much time will you need?  Two days?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I am not going to be here, so if you give me five days. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Five days?  Okay.  So ordered.  
(Witness re-entered courtroom) 
MR. WEBSTER:
And if I could use this opportunity to have the assistance of the registry to make copies of a document available to the three parties, since he is on his feet, he can distribute it now.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, since sending your letter that was addressed to the President of the Tribunal through your brother, to the ICTR, since that point, have you and I, Don Webster, have -- had any contact, whatsoever? 
A.	Ever since the date the letter was written, I have not had any direct contact with you, but after you visited number 15 and number 22, they sent the message that you had asked them to send to me.  Thereafter, I was even able to meet with number 22 because he had travelled to the country in which I currently reside to carry out some of his usual activities and he transmitted the message to me that you had asked him to transmit.  

Let me also add, and I believe that you are aware of this, that amongst the members of the defence team of Bicamumpaka, who came to see me, the interpreter who was with them is a member of the team in charge of this case.  This leads me to believe that I did not only meet with the members of the defence team of Mr. Bicamumpaka, but that you included one of your investigators in the team that interviewed me in February. 
Q.	Do you know the name of that person, the person that you are referring to now? 
A.	His name is probably Déo, and he usually sits behind you.  He even came to see me. 
Q.	In other words, he came to see you? 
A.	And even since I have been here for my testimony, I have seen him. 
Q.	You've seen him sitting behind me in the courtroom, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you saw him on the 8th of February 2008 when you were being interviewed by the Bicamumpaka defence team? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Other than those two occasions, have you seen him since your interview on the 
8th of February 2008?  In other words, I am asking you if you've seen him outside the context of that interview and your presence here in the courtroom? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, when you were interviewed on the 8th of February 2008, there were other members of the Prosecution present; isn't that correct? 
A.	Maybe you should -- I should give you the list of the people who were present.  There was a member of the Prosecution team in the Bicamumpaka case.  There was also the person that I just mentioned, but I thought he was an interpreter, and yet when I came here, I saw him on the Prosecution bench.  There was also Bicamumpaka defence counsel, as well as a certain Musonga.  I was told he was a member of WVSS.  Then there was also a camera man who was taking images. 
Q.	Well, that seems to be consistent with what is indicated on the transcripts itself of that interview, but with respect to Mr. Déo  Mbuto, did you not recognise him as having been part of the Karemera team when you were here in June of 2006? 
A.	I did not remember having seen him in 2006, but I was able to recognise him physically.  And he knows me very well.  When he was introduced, I was told he was an interpreter and that is why I thought he was an interpreter.  It was only when I saw him again after beginning my testimony that I realised that he was a member of the OTP, but I had forgotten about him.  
Q.	Okay.  With respect to the messages you received from number 15 and number 22, tell us what message they gave you in respect of Don Webster? 
A.	Number 15 told me that a certain Don Webster had asked him to greet me.  Number 15 added that Don Webster had said that he cannot -- he could not do me any harm because he was a friend.  Number 22 told me the same message.  He also said that you had told him that you could not do me any harm.  He said you had told him to greet me.  He sent me a message and the message was clear. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We move back into the substance of your examination now.  

Did number 15 tell you that he was asked to sign a witness statement when you spoke to him back in March of 2008?  I am talking about a telephone conversation with regard to the visit from 
Don Webster and the OTP.  
A.	I have told you what he told me over the phone.  He probably was not in a position to tell me many things because the phone is expensive.  However, he mentioned the questions put to him and the answers he gave.  He also told me about his reactions after questions were put to him on the documents I had given.  I told him that he should not have been afraid.  I reassured him that he would have no problems, and then he rang off without telling me anything else. 
Q.	So, let me read from the middle of page 177, and this is what is recorded in that interview note.  He identified number 15 by name, says number 15 was willing to speak to OTP representatives, but did not wish to sign a witness statement.  Consequently, this interview note simply documents the contents of what he told us, referring to the team, without any affirmation of its accuracy by number 15 himself, and then it continues with a summary of what was said.  

Then in the first numbered paragraph, number 15 clarifies his relationship to number 16.  He recounts that both number 15 and number 16 had been arrested in 1997 and imprisoned and that both had been released, and, in fact, acquitted, and that neither one of them had either pled guilty to any genocide crime or been convicted of any genocide crime.  He also states that there was never any pressure on us to plead guilty.  

Does that sound consistent with what you remember in relation to number 15 and number 16? 
A.	I know that what he said is correct.  
Q.	He goes on to recount, as it is recorded in the second numbered paragraph that he does not know about any letter that you were supposed to have given him.  That's consistent with what you've just explained to the Court; that he didn't want to mention the letter to members of the OTP, but that he called you and when you told him there was no problem in disclosing that type of information, he 
re-contacted members of the OTP and acknowledged that at some point, he had received a letter from you that he then passed on to someone else.  

And that's reflected in the very last paragraph, on page 178, in the bundle, where number 15 says or relate, by telephone message an hour after leaving the company of the OTP team, "When I got home, I remember that one time, number 22 had brought me a letter that I gave to number 16.  It is possible that this letter had things in it.  Please discuss this with that man.  I am sorry."  And that too, that message, seems consistent with what you've been telling the Court.  Because after number 15 left the precinct of the OTP team, he contacted you by telephone.  Would you agree with the summary that I have just made? 
A.	Some portions are correct.  I have already explained it.  When you cross-examined him the first time, he was afraid he did not want to tell you the whole truth, but I assured the person that he should not be afraid.  I think that this is -- reminded to make rectification, but after meeting that person, I reassured him and told him not to have -- to be afraid.  He will have no problem and that he should acknowledge what was in the letter.  But I did not -- I was not informed that he subsequently contacted you on the telephone. 
Q.	No, that's new information, and it's coming from the record of the contacts between number 15 and the OTP, excuse me, back on the 28th of March 2008.  

Returning to paragraph 2, on page 177, number 15 is talking about you again, Mr. Witness, and he says, referring to you, left Ruhengeri in January or February of 2007.  That's his recollection.  You, of course, have already told this Chamber that you left in August of 2006, but you simply have different recollections of the dates of your departure.  

He goes on to say, he, and he is referring to you, Mr. Witness, fled Ruhengeri because some people in our locality were after him.  The genocide survivors, particularly -- this is a name that we have mentioned many times before, so I will say it on the record again, Samvura, Epimaque, in 
Busogo secteur, and then he gives another name in Nkuli commune, keeps accusing him of genocide crimes.  They manipulate the Gacaca to arrest the prisoners who were released.  Generally, I think Gacaca dispenses a good even-handed justice, but there are isolated cases where there is manipulation by those in charge.  I think Samvura does exercise undue influence in the Gacaca in Busogo.  So, according to number 15, his understanding of the reason that you fled Ruhengeri was because you were facing additional charges in Gacaca, which is what I have suggested to you before.  Are you suggesting that number 15 is wrong on that point? 
A.	I would like to tell you, this is one of the points that I had to clarify before this Trial Chamber.  I think that he, himself, he is an intelligent person.  He knows the information that is being sought by the Tribunal prosecutor.  He can make a distinction between people who are pro-government and people who are not pro- government.  And as someone who lives in Rwanda, he cannot tell you about threats or problems that he could have with the CID officers or officers of the intelligence services, but what he did not tell you is that they were afraid because they saw the case of number 10, who was criss-crossing the region, looking for some documents, and number 15 wanted to avoid giving you some information.  I think that is the main reason why he gave you that answer, and I am telling you that number 15 still has safety problem -- security problems.  I will not be surprised if his problems worsened after my present testimony.  Please, remember that you did not give him any assurances regarding his security prior to his giving you this statement.  Number 15 is living in Rwanda.  He knows what is going on in Rwanda and he knows how he should conduct himself in certain situations.  He did not know how you are going to use the information that you are soliciting from him.  Maybe what I could -- I would like to request from you is as follows:  When you interviewed number 15, was number 10 present?  Because you told me that you were still with number 10 when you interviewed people who were not in prison as detainees, and on the basis of the answer which you will give 
me -- which you will give me, maybe I can give you additional information, but first you have to tell me whether you interviewed number 15 in the presence of number 10.  Number 15 knows very well that you -- he was unjustly arrested and detained.  So, he has to constantly conduct himself with tactic, particularly when he answers questions put to him by the Prosecutor.  And we know, very well, that the survivor he is referring to is one of the people who are exerting pressure on members or judges of Gacaca courts.  
Q.	For your information, Mr. Witness, if we turn to page 176 on the bundle, and you don't have it in front of you, but I will read it.  It reflects the presence of two people who were speaking to number 15.  There's the name "Don Webster" as the interviewer, and then where -- there is indication of the other persons who were present, there is another name, and, indeed, that's the name of number 10.  So that's what -- the record of the interview suggests or confirmed, but based on what you have just said, it is apparent to me that the persons who met number 15 introduced themselves fully, which is just what we reviewed with you when you first came back in the room, that the persons who spoke to number 15 told number 15 who they were and what they were doing, and before speaking to him -- or, when speaking to him, indicating to him why they were asking him questions.  That seems to be what you were suggesting in your response.  
A.	What I would like to tell you is that he did not tell you that he knows number 10.  I think that I have already explained what number 10 is doing.  That's what I said yesterday because I noticed that you read out to me various statements given by various people, but given the fact that I did not know that number 10 was present there, I did not understand why some people said things which they said.  I think that his presence must have influenced the statements given by some people.  I did not understand why that person was present during the interview.  I do not know whether you were the one who asked him to help you or he also did services to you.  But I know that his presence has influenced a lot of statements given by witnesses.  And the reason why number 15 said what he said is because number 10 was there.  So be it the case of number 15 or number 16, both of them were intimidated by the presence of number 10.  Maybe when the witness gave you that statement, he was afraid, because in his presence was number 10.  Now, if you look at numbers 19 and 25, you will notice that they were saying some things for the very first time, and this is not surprising because number 10 was present or he had contacted them prior to that. 
Q.	Well, did number 15 tell you that he recognised number 10 and that he felt intimidated by his presence?  Is that what he told you when you spoke to him on the 28th of March? 
A.	I think that I have already explained to you what he told me.  He told me that he was afraid.  He told me that the team was composed of some very wicked people.  I told you that he did not give me a lot of information because maybe such a thing would have cost him dearly.  But since we are both Rwandans, we know one another very well.  We know how Rwandans act.  That person was arrested unjustly.  If you had seen him alone, he would have given you different information from the information he gave you.  But since he was already aware that the prosecutor general was present, the prosecutor general was criss-crossing the region in search of various case files and information, he could not have said otherwise.  I know very well that number 10 must have done everything to clear himself -- to clear his name because he had been implicated.  You say that you relied on names that I mentioned, but I realised that those are not the only people I mentioned, for example -- and there are other people I never mentioned, such as number 17, for instance.  And there is number 23 and number 24, whose names I never mentioned.  

Then there is number 9 and -- number 8 and number 9.  I did not know how come you mentioned these people.  And I do not know how number 10 contacted them.  Maybe he wanted to clear his name.  
Q.	But the question I asked you still remains unanswered,  Witness, five minutes after hearing from,  and it is a very simple question.  And all you have to do is say yes or no.  

Did number 15 tell you, specifically, that he felt intimidated because of the presence of (inaudible) whom he recognised at the time?  That is the only question I am asking you, yes or no? 
A.	I do not want to answer with a simple yes or no.  I think that I have already explained that.  He told me that people who had come to see him had intimidated him. 
Q.	And I am asking you, specifically, whether -- did he say anything with specific mention of number 10?  You can answer that, yes or no.  You've already explained yourself at length, but I want a simple answer to that simple question.  
A.	I told you that we spoke on the phone, but he is not someone who was very rich so as to be able to speak on the phone for hours and hours.  However, he told me that you had gone to interview him and that he had not dared give you certain information.  But I told him that he should not be afraid, because there would be no adverse consequences subsequently.  That's what I told him.  

My question remains intact.  Why did you go to see him with number 10?  Because you were aware that number 10 was involved, as well as other peoples' names I have mentioned.  They were in the same group.  So why did he accompany you If he really wanted to help you ascertain the truth. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will simply move on because it is apparent that you cannot answer or will not answer a very simple question.  But going back to your previous response where you explained that number 15 could only give the type of information that the Prosecution would want to extract from him.  When number 15 says, for example, they, referring to Samvura, Epimaque, and another party who were involved in the Gacaca, "They manipulate the Gacaca to arrest prisoners who were released."  Wouldn't you agree that that's a statement that is critical of the authorities in Ruhengeri? 
A.	They are not only talking about detainees.  That is what Samvura said.  But, if you wish, I can give you the names of people who were present.  And what he said is that he could not be at ease.  He could never feel at ease if a -- there were hundred -- 50 people who were hacked with machetes.  This is what he said.  Everyone knows about that and everyone knows what he's been saying. 
Q.	I am not talking about Samvura, Epimaque, Mr. Witness.  I am talking about your (By order of the court, this word has been extracted and filed under separate cover) -- I am talking about -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me.  Could I request the Chamber excise that last slip of the tongue mentioning the relationship? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We extract the reference to the relationship.  Redact the reference to the relationship from the record.
MR. WEBSTER:
I apologise.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm talking about what number 15 told us about the authorities in Gacaca.  Number 15 criticised Samvura, Epimaque, and was implicitly criticising the Gacaca, because he told us that, "They", and he is referring to Samvura, Epimaque and the Gacaca, persons associated with the Gacaca, "They manipulate the Gacaca to arrest prisoners who are released."  And I am suggesting to you that that is a critical remark, critical of the authorities in Ruhengeri, and that's a remark that he felt comfortable making to the Prosecution team that saw him on the 28th of March.  Wouldn't you agree to criticise Gacaca and to criticise Samvura, Epimaque, who you described as someone who was colluding with the state or who was colluding with the authorities, wouldn't you agree that that statement is critical of those authorities? 
A.	I think the whole thing is that Samvura was able to influence Gacaca members and judges.  You are trying to say he was -- the witness was free, but he was not free.  Even if he was critical of the three organs -- I beg your pardon, or, he was critical of those bodies, he still gave you a very little amount of information.  Do not tell me that he was at ease so as to be able to give you all the information you wanted.  I know that he had a -- he was a defendant in one case which involves Samvura, and the reason he made comments in respect of Samvura was because he had problems with Samvura, but otherwise he could not criticise everything that he wanted to criticise. 
Q.	Yes, and number 15 was acquitted of the charges against him.  In other words, whoever investigated or handled his prosecution, determined that they could not prove that he was responsible for the crimes and he was acquitted.  And, in spite of that, he said, "I think Samvura does exercise undue influence in the Gacaca in Busogo."   That was his opinion, which he expressed to the two persons that visited him on the 28th of March.  
A.	I think he said that because everyone is talking about it.  So he makes comments which other members of the public in our area say.  Do not tell me that he did not have limits.  I know that in our area there are people who attack other people, and people talk about such things.  So, he could not have told you everything.  Let me give you an example.  You told me that he was acquitted, but people realised that it was Samvura -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness did not complete his sentence. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I don't want to go too far afield.  So I am not trying to limit what you say, but I am really trying to stay focused on our examination so that we can complete this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yesterday afternoon you said you will use half an hour (inaudible).  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yesterday afternoon I did not have a motion from Mr. Robinson that held us up a bit, Your Honour.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Your Honour.  I know that it seems like now that cross-examination has -- or, the redirect examination has either exceeded the length of the cross-examination, and I know that we laboured under time standards during our examinations.  I don't think you rigidly applied it to us and I don't think it is necessary to rigidly apply them to Mr. Webster.  But I think that you are to impose some time standards, and then he can apply for leave if he feels he needs to exceed that.  But he has now exceeded all his estimates of the length of his examination.  He has taken a lot of time to make what seem to be some pretty small points, and I think you have to impose some time standards on him, at this point in time.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, along the same lines, I remember that not long ago when we were cross-examining, the Prosecutor said that Mr. Weyl has taken one hour 42 minutes of cross-examination.  He has only 18 minutes left.  I have noticed that Mr. Webster is -- has been conducting a redirect for more than two days, and this is well above the time that had been allocated to us.  

And it was not the Prosecutor who said that, Mr. President.  It was rather, Mr. Hometowu, as having mentioned the time taken and time remaining.  Thank you, sir.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would like to move ahead expeditiously, and I will move as quickly as I can.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think I should make a comment on the issue of time standards.  It is our intention to manage the evidence delivery efficiently, and that implies that there has to be some regulation of the time spent in examination.  

Now, Mr. Robinson had used a phrase that we "did not apply rigidly".  We thought that we did apply rigidly, in one sense.  When we granted extensions of time, it was always because we thought that those extensions were necessary in the interest of justice, because we appreciate that time standards can only be indicative and need to be adjusted whenever the interest of justice require.  

But we have expressed the view before, and we intend to do it now, that the time taken for cross-examination, rebuttal examinations, should, in general, be -- not exceed the time taken in 
cross -- in examination-in-chief.  We had granted some additional leeway when you had cross-examination -- in-chief -- when you had cross-examination by multiple parties.  In this case, the cross-examination by the Prosecutor, single party, we don't expect it to exceed the examination-in-chief.  

Now, we have not been aggressive with regard to this particular witness, because we, as the Bench, have been taken a little bit by surprise at his testimony.  So, we have considered, as of now, it will be reasonable to grant him some additional leeway, in the interest of justice, in the re-direct 
questions -- questioning.  

But, Mr. Webster, you are constantly expanding your time allocations to the extent that we are beginning to consider whether -- what reason really requires.  So, we ask you -- we are now having to ask you to be a little bit more specific in terms of what else is required to complete a fair examination of this witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I have another two lines of enquiry to make.  The difficulty I am encountering is that the witness responds very expansively, and I had not tried to control him, because in the interest of justice, the Chamber and all the parties should hear fully what he has to say.  But I will make more effort to narrow the scope of his response by intervening more aggressively.  But if it's taken us longer than expected, it is because, in the interest of justice, I made a determination or an evaluation that what the witness has to say should be presented to the Chamber, given the importance of the issue and the types of allegations that he is making.  But I will continue and I will make greater effort to control him and to move forward expeditiously.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, let us continue.  And what concerns me, especially, is the last thing that is recorded from number 15 in paragraph 4 on page 178 of our bundle.  And I have raised this with you yesterday and I will do it now.  

This is what number 15 told the Prosecution team on the 28th of March before he spoke to you.  "If," and then he mentions your name, "is now changing his account of the genocide, it is probably because he is angry that genocide survivors keep accusing him of other crimes."  He mentions your name again, you, Mr. Witness, "once complained to me about them."  He said that if the survivors keeps accusing him that he will change his evidence.  He was angry because he felt that he had pleaded guilty to help them and now they are the ones making things difficult for him.  And he mentions your name again, said you, Mr. Witness, "Told me that he would change his evidence, so it doesn't surprise me if he is now changing his earlier accounts -- if he is now claiming that his earlier accounts are false.  I know that what he said earlier is true and that what he says now is the fabrication because," and then he mentions your name, "himself told me that."  Now, that's what number 15 said.  
A.	Yes, you mentioned that to me yesterday.  This is what I have to tell you.  From the outset, number 15 was very -- was not really aware of my testimony here in Arusha.  He did not know the contents of my testimony.  But I am coming back to the fact that when he gave his statement he knew, very well, the situation in which he found himself.  He knew that if he said anything else, his security would be threatened.  Even if they come to know what I am saying here in Arusha, it would have consequences on him.  As you said, he said if he is now changing.  He was not affirmative.  He put it in the conditional.  And as I told you yesterday, when he saw you arrived, he became afraid.  And when he was answering your questions, he was quite aware of his situation.  And a short while ago I told you that he had omitted telling you some information because he was afraid for his security and the security of his family. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I don't doubt that number 15 has much more to say about you and about why you have changed your testimony.  What I have put to you was exactly what he told us, and we have your response to that.  So we can move on to something else.  

He also told us that he visited you where you are living now, and he said that your condition, where you are living now, is pretty bad; that you are in difficulty.  Is that true? 
A.	Yes, when he came to see me, it was actually because I had problems. 
Q.	He said that you weren't working; that you had no visible means of support; that you had to live with other people and accept their kindness.  Is that account accurate? 

MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. Webster.  Could you tell me where that is in the statement?  I couldn't find that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Right.  My apology.  It is not reflected in this interview note.  I would rephrase the question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think this is the problem when Mr. Webster has conducted an interview and then he wants to use material from that interview that he hasn't disclosed.  I don't think he should be allowed to ask any questions concerning materials which relate to an interview and which has 
been -- has not been disclosed to us in advance.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I will rephrase the question. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how about -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, Mr. Webster, you have to be careful not to -- not to give the impression that you are providing a type of information that the witness will provide, as you conduct the examination.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Now I will refer the parties to page 175 in the bundle, at the bottom, at the very last paragraph. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Number 22 explained in his statement that you, Mr. Witness, "Told me that living was difficult for him where he is now and that he did not have any substantial work."  This is what number 22 was saying.  "I do not know how he is managing to reside there.  Maybe the Rwandans residing in that place are assisting him.  On three occasions, number 15 sent him some money through me.  Once he sent a hundred dollars.  Then he sent 10,000 Rwandan francs on each of two other occasions.  "Also, once I assisted him and gave him around" -- and then he provides a certain denomination.  So number 22 has described your situation as being rather difficult, which is what you, yourself, has said.  So I am asking you to explain to us how bad your situation was where you reside now.  
A.	I have problems because I do not have a job.  That is sufficient to explain to you my situation.  I do not live in my own country.  I do not have my family with me.  I do not have a job, so each time I have to ask for assistance from the person with whom I am living.  Even when I need soap, I have to ask that person.  I am far away from my country and my situation is not easy.  That is what I have told you, I am not employed. 
Q.	So, you are in need of money?  You need employment, you need some way of earning money? 
A.	Let me tell you one thing:  I have the feeling that your question is tendentious.  You always need money to survive, and you can have money by working or carrying out a trade.  You, yourself, if you do not have a salary, you cannot survive.  That is obvious.  Whatever the type of job you are doing, whether it is an honest or dishonest activity, you need to have money.  You have to look for work in order to have a salary.  I believe that is clear. 
Q.	We move on to something else.  

Mr. Witness, do you know -- did number 15 or number 22 tell you what they did with the letter you gave them? 
A.	I gave the letter to number 22 to give to number 15, who would later on give it to number 16, and then to the actual addressee.  I believe that is what was done. 
Q.	And the actual addressee was the President of the Tribunal; isn't that correct? 
A.	I wrote a letter to the President of this Tribunal and I sent a copy of that letter to WVSS, as well as to the office of Defence counsel and to the OTP.  
Q.	In other words, you are suggesting that you had four separate letters that were delivered to 
number 22? 
A.	I wrote -- I wrote a single letter to the President of the Tribunal and I made two copies of that letter supposed to be given to two other people.  I also wrote a letter to my younger brother.  I do not know whether you want us to discuss that, but I believe that is my private life. 
Q.	No.  I just wanted some clarifications on how many documents you gave to number 22, to give to number 15, to give to number 16.  And you have clarified that.  There was one letter and two copies.  And now I am asking you, do you know, because of course, you weren't present with them, but did they tell you how they transmitted the three documents that you passed on to them to the ICTR? 
A.	I sent the letters to number 22, who was supposed to give them to number 15, who in turn was supposed to give them to number 16.  And I believe that number 16 used his own means to transmit the letters to the addressees.  The essential thing is that I sent those letters and they actually 
arrived -- number 16.  These are people I trust, and even if they read the contents, it does not change anything.  So it was up to number 16 to find a way to actually transmit those letters to the addressees. 
Q.	And my question to you is, did number 16 ever tell you how he transmitted those letters to the addressees? 
A.	No, number 16 did not tell me how he went about it.  What I know is that the Defence team of 
Mr. Bicamumpaka came to see me and they showed me a document.  This means that the letters had effectively been received by the people concerned. 
Q.	And here you are referring to your interview of the 8th of February 2008.  At that point, you saw the Bicamumpaka Defence team and they showed you the same letter that you had dispatched.  Is that what you are saying, Mr. Witness? 
A.	No, what I meant is that when the Defence of Mr. Bicamumpaka came to see me, they showed me a document.  That is the document which had been drafted after the letter transmitted by -- by number 16 had been received by the Defence team. 
Q.	When was that? 
A.	This was when Bicamumpaka's Defence team came to see me in February. 
Q.	That's what I asked you, whether it was the interview in February of 2008.  Was that the first time that you had seen the Bicamumpaka Defence team since sending the letter? 
A.	Yes, it was the first time that I was meeting with that team after having dispatched the letter.  A certain Musonga called me and told me that certain people were going to come and meet me, and I realised that these were members of the Defence team of Mr. Bicamumpaka.  I had not met anyone else connected to this Tribunal after I had sent the letter. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know an individual by the name of Hahirwa Valens?  Hahirwa is H-A-H-I-R-W-A; Valens is V-A-L-E-N-S.  
A.	No, I do not know that person. 
Q.	Do you know if number 16 -- well, let me tell you -- let me withdraw that.  Let me tell you what that person said when he communicated with this Tribunal sometime in September of 2007.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I am going to have an objection here.  I think you've been -- if you look at the documents that have been distributed to you, if Mr. Webster is about to ask him about Annex B, and since the witness has already said that he doesn't know -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we have the witness leave the courtroom if we are going to deal with this expansively?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, perhaps we could take -- the witness could take our morning recess a little early and we can excuse him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may leave now.  You will return after the morning recess.  
(Pages 1 to 17 by Sheriffo Jammeh) 













1025H 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I don't think that Mr. -- I don't fully understand the use to which Mr. Webster is going to put this document, which is annex B, because it details -- it's from -- as I understand it, it's from the investigator of the Bicamumpaka team as to how he came upon this letter.  But the witness has already said that he turned it over to number 16 and doesn't know how number 16 communicated it to the ICTR.  So there is no good-faith basis to believe that this witness has ever seen this document, or that he would know anything about its contents.  And I don't understand how Mr. Webster can utilise this document under these circumstances.  Perhaps he can explain this.  I'm missing something. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour.  The parties should recall that when Mr. Robinson referred to the letter in question, which he introduced as Defence exhibit, I asked him if he could clarify where he obtained a copy of the letter, and he declined to do so.  My understanding, based on all of the documentation in relation to this witness -- and this is simply my understanding.  I cannot make an assertion -- is that the only copy of this letter from BTH was made available to the parties here and to this Chamber through the Bicamumpaka Defence team; that they obtained the letter directly from number 16; that it did not make its way to the Office of the President; that it was never distributed to the parties -- to the Prosecution from the President's office.  And the only way that we have come in contact with this particular letter from this witness is through the Bicamumpaka Defence team.  And I would like to ask the witness if he is aware of how number 16 was able to contact the Bicamumpaka Defence team, and that's a legitimate question, or I would suggest to the Chamber that in the context of this witness's testimony, which leaves many things to be investigated, one of which is how a member of the Bicamumpaka Defence team was able to arrange a contact with number 16, given the relationship of number 16 to the other parties that we have been discussing.  So it's a simple enquiry.  It really shouldn't generate this type of debate.  And had Mr. Robinson volunteered this information when I asked him, we could have avoided this.  But I would like that clarified on the record. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, first of all, it doesn't explain the providence of the document, how it could be used with this witness, which is my objection.  But, secondly, I don't understand, really, how this line of enquiry is relevant.  And maybe an enquiry should be made of me, if you want to insist that I have to be called as a witness.  But this witness doesn't have the information that Mr. Webster is seeking to establish, so I don't understand how he can use the document in this manner.  And my objection is that he be precluded from putting the contents of this document to the witness if there is no foundation that the witness would have any idea about its contents. Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm not challenging the witness on the basis of the document.  I'm using the information in the document to ask the witness if he knows anything, or if he could clarify matters for us, which is a legitimate line of enquiry.  It's not as if I'm confronting the witness with the document and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You now describe it as a line of enquiry.  Previously you said you had one question.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't recall saying that, Your Honour.  If I did, I misspoke. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, explain what the line of enquiry is -- 
MR. WEBSTER:  
I would like --
MR. PRESIDENT:  
-- because I don't think that -- you now seem to have an idea that you have an unlimited right to cross-examine indefinitely.  So it's just expanding and expanding.  This is about the fourth time-standing you've given us of when you are going to complete.  Now I'm wondering if you intend to finish today at all.  What do you mean by "line of enquiry"?  We now -- it seems as though we are going to have to note it as a little bit more -- more interventionist in the extent and duration of your examination.  We've been leaving it to your discretion completely up to now.  What does this mean now, "line of enquiry"?  Could you explain that?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I had two or three questions for the witness about how his letter arrived at the Tribunal. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's the issue?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is one issue. And then I have another --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What's the issue? 
MR. WEBSTER:  
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
What's the other issue?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The other issue -- Your Honour, I think it puts me at a bit of a disadvantage. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The witness is not here. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The other issue is this witness's motivation to change his evidence because he is being compensated to do so.  That's the other issue. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, you'll have to give us a little bit more explanation because it was our understanding that this had already been explored with the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
It has not been thoroughly explored with the witness.  One issue, in terms of being -- of him seeking money was explored in relation to his explanation in regard to an incident in 2004.  I am making another enquiry now in regard to another offer of money to him that Mr. Robinson raised in June of 2006, which is a separate issue.  They are related, but it's a separate issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, now I have to act to pin you down.  How much more time do you need for your cross-examination?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The time I need is contingent upon the witness's response -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not entirely true.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I will need until the luncheon recess. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You know, I think you'll have to explain why you need so much more time.  Yesterday afternoon you said that you were at the end of your cross-examination, and you had less than half an hour to complete.  Now, this morning, you are dealing with three-and-a-half hours, at least.  Why is that expansion required?  Are you inventing cross-examination as you go along, or weren't you frank with us yesterday?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I can show the Chamber my notes, if that would satisfy the enquiry, because there is a line of enquiry that I'm making and I'm pursuing.  And I think I've been doing that as efficiently as I can.  But the witness has answered expansively; the Defence have interrupted with motions on, at least, three prior occasions; we've discussed many more issues than I anticipated discussing, and it's --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, let me make a comment.  I don't appreciate the fact that you always blame everybody else when I ask you a simple question.  The Defence's motion was based on something which is a general principle of law of fair trial.  It is never expected that counsel addressing the Court should be a witness before the proceedings.  In most countries, that's prohibited.  Now, you have been giving the expression that you have been given information that is in your personal knowledge when you examine the witness.  So I do not think that the objections raised were unreasonable.  They've followed as a direct result of what you have been doing. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm not suggesting that the objections are unreasonable, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We will take the adjournment now.
(Court recessed from 1035H to 1107H)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I hope everybody has followed my example and had a pacifier during the tea break.  Now, let's try and complete the testimony as best we can. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know if number 16 on the list has ever testified at the ICTR? 
A.	I do not have the list with me, Mr. Prosecutor. 

I believe you asked me a question concerning number 16.  I do not know whether this person has testified in the Tribunal, or not, but I have heard it said that employees of this Tribunal went to see him, but I do not know whether he has testified, or not.  But those staff members came and saw him years ago. 
Q.	Years ago in relation to your letter, the letter that we have been discussing, or in relation to something else? 
A.	I heard about it a few years ago.  I believe I learnt about that information in 2004.  Officers of the Tribunal went to see him.  It's a certain Révérien Rukundo who told me that the number -- number 16 had been interviewed by officers of this Tribunal. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I'll go on to something else. 

Mr. Witness, in June of 2006, when you were testifying in this case, you accused Counsel Robinson of offering you money to change your testimony, and when he examined you on Thursday of last week, you admitted that that was a lie.  Isn't that right?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But when you were engaging that -- in that exchange, when Mr. Robinson was examining you back in June of 2006 -- this was on the 13th of June, starting at page 7 in the transcripts -- he accused you of offering to change your testimony if he paid you enough money to get out of Rwanda.  Now, are you saying that that is true, that you offered to change your money (sic) if he would give you money? 
A.	I was explaining to him that I could not change my testimony.  I told him that for reasons of security, given the country that I lived in, I could not change my testimony.  I told him that I was poor.  I could not leave Rwanda.  And it was for that reason that I could not change my testimony. 
Q.	I'm going to read you from that transcript so that there is no ambiguity.  On page 7, line 26, by Mr. Robinson: "Witness BTH, during this meeting, you offered to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda; is that correct?"  And then you responded to him in the same way that you are responding to me now.  You talk a lot without getting to the essential enquiry.  

And then he follows up on the following page, again, page 8, line 25:  "So, BTH, you offered to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda, correct?"  And, again, you go into a long explanation.  And you start talking about a certain Muhumbo in Europe who had contacted you, as you allege, back in June of 2006.  At that point, your explanation was that it was Muhumbo that contacted you to change your testimony.  And Mr. Robinson asked you another question, on page 9:  "Well, isn't it true, Witness BTH, that it was you who contacted an individual named Muhumbo in Europe by telephone and you offered to change your testimony if Mr. Nzirorera would give enough money to leave Rwanda?"  And then, of course, you respond with a long answer that does not go straight to the enquiry.  

So tell us today, Mr. Witness, back in June of 2006, did you offer Mr. Robinson -- or, did you suggest to him that you would change your testimony if he would pay you enough money to leave Rwanda?  You can answer that by beginning "yes" or "no", and then you can explain, but start with a "yes" or "no". 
A.	You want me to give you the answer that you -- you want, but I will give you the answer that I believe is correct.  You have just read out long excerpts to me.  I do not know whether you think I have understood all of it.  You have to ask shorter questions. 

As you have said, the answers -- or, rather, as I have said, the answers that I gave at that time were given because I was in a difficult situation.  The authorities had asked me questions that had made me afraid.  I was not aware that information could be communicated to the government of Rwanda from this Tribunal.  So when I answered questions, I answered them bearing in mind my security because I had to return to Rwanda, and I knew that certain employees of the Tribunal communicated information to the Rwandan government.  So, in answer to the questions put to me, I always bore in mind my own security. 

At that time, I was accusing Mr. Nzirorera.  I was not in his camp.  But Mr. Robinson insisted by saying that he knew I was lying, and I told him that I could only change my position if I was outside of Rwanda, because when you are in Rwanda you have to comply with the instructions given by the Rwandan government.  And if you testify for the Defence, you cannot return to Rwanda and live in peace.  And so when I gave that answer, it was on the basis of my situation.  

I have told you that I had received threats at that time, and threats that were actually carried out subsequently. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I still don't think you are answering the question, but we will go over it slowly, and we can read the whole transcript of that day to you, if that would make it easier for you. 
But let's start with this:  Who raised the issue of changing your testimony first?  Did you raise that issue when you first saw Mr. Robinson, or did Mr. Robinson raise that issue when he first saw you?  Because that's where the enquiry has to begin.  
A.	Now I'm going to tell you the truth.  I explained to you why I gave that answer at that time.  Mr. Robinson told me that he knew that I was lying, that I was continuing to lie.  That is what he told me at that time.  He told me that he knew very well that I was lying. 
Q.	Did he ask you to change your testimony, or did you offer to change your testimony?  That's still the question.  
A.	He told me that he was aware that I was lying, and that if I told the truth, it would be more courageous of me, that is, to tell the truth, rather than to lie. 
Q.	So he was telling the truth when he said you offered to do that, to change your testimony, and to join his camp if he paid you enough money to leave Rwanda; that was true then? 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, Mr. President, I hesitate to intervene, but the witness to be commenting on whether I was telling the truth seems a little awkward.  And I think that this whole enquiry is -- maybe not the -- this is not the appropriate forum, if Mr. Webster wants us to launch an investigation into me.  But, in any event, it seems improper to ask a witness whether someone else is telling the truth. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, I can assure the Trial Chamber that I'm not launching an investigation.  I'm examining the credibility of his wit -- of this witness in relation to accusations that Counsel Robinson made against this witness when he appeared in court on the 13th of June 2006 at the very beginning of his cross-examination, and that's what I'm trying to explore.  I'm not accusing Mr. Robinson of anything.  And I think the witness should be able to answer the question, but I'll leave it to the Chamber to give us some direction on that point. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, we don't think we should make any ruling.  We think we should leave it to your good sense.  So, proceed. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I'm going to read to you from the transcript, and this is at the very beginning when Mr. Robinson first introduced himself to you.  He spoke to you in Kinyarwanda.  You responded by saying:  "Good morning, Counsel.  I am well."  

Next, "Witness BTH, we last spoke to each other on Friday, the 2nd of June; correct?"  Your answer, "You're right."  

On the next page, page 7, question:  "And that was in the witness room where you wait before you give testimony, just outside this courtroom; is that correct?"  And your answer:  "Indeed."  
Question:  "And when we met, there was also my legal assistant, Leopold Nsengiyumva, and the protection officer from the witness victims support section, Mr. Diop; correct?"  And your answer:  "Yes."  

Question:  "And when I had made a request to meet with you, you had agreed to that request and requested the meeting be without the presence of the Prosecutor; correct?"  And your answer:  "Indeed." 

And then Mr. Robinson had an exhibit placed in front of you.  The exhibit was D. NZ128.  And it was the paper that you signed indicating that you accepted to be met and contacted by the Defence counsel without the presence of the Prosecutor.  Mr. Robinson's first substantive question to you, Mr. Witness:  "Witness BTH, during this meeting, you offered to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda; is that correct?"  That's the first question of substance that Mr. Robinson asked you when he cross-examined you on the 13th of June 2006. 

So you can answer that question again now.  Did you offer to change your testimony if Mr. Robinson gave you enough money to leave Rwanda?  
A.	I think I have just answered that question.  I had already had one interview with Mr. Robinson before he put that question to me.  We had already spoken in that waiting room that you have mentioned.  At that time, he was cross-examining me. 

He had a different way of putting his question.  Just like you, you pretended to be reading from a document, whereas it was not true.  You, therefore, have to know whether it is true or not that I told him that I wanted to leave the country.  You should rather ask why -- you should rather have asked why I wanted to leave the country.  That is the real issue. 
Q.	And back on the 13th of June, you made the same sort of response.  What you said was different, but you gave a long-winded explanation that didn't get to the heart of the issue, and Mr. Robinson asked the question again, and you did the same thing again.  And at one point, Mr. Robinson said as follows:  "Mr. President, I think this is time" -- "this is a matter of time for your intervention.  I've asked the witness the same question twice, and he doesn't want to answer."  

You did the same thing back on the 13th of June that you are doing right now, that you did yesterday, that you did the day before yesterday.  "He wants me to ask him different questions.  I think you need to inform him that it's his responsibility to answer the questions that are put to him."  The same applies right now.  You can ask -- you can answer the questions that I've asked you.  Did you offer to change your testimony back on the 13th of -- back in June of 2006 when you met with Mr. Robinson?  Did you offer to change your testimony and join his camp, as you saw it, if he paid you enough money to leave Rwanda; yes or no? 
A.	I did not ask him to give me money for me to change my testimony.  I never told him that. 
Q.	So Mr. Robinson was lying when he said that to you in court? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, please withdraw that statement. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
It was not a statement, Your Honour.  It was a question to the witness, but I will reformulate it. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, I'm speaking to counsel at the moment. 

I have tried to insist on a certain degree of civility in my courtroom, and I expect that counsel will treat other counsel with a certain degree of respect.  

Yes, Ms. Diagne, what did you have to say?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I apologise for having interrupted you.  I did not notice that you were speaking.  It is not usual of me to do that, but I would like to join my voice to that of the other Defence teams to say that what Mr. Webster said is inadmissible, and it is important for us to join you in saying that, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Let me reframe the question.  And my apologies if the question offended anyone.  That was not my intention. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you suggesting that Mr. Robinson was mistaken when he put that issue to you in that way back on the 13th of June? 
A.	You should ask him instead why he was asking that question.  The Trial Chamber should ask him whether he was telling the truth or not.  I cannot answer in his stead.  

As far as I'm concerned, I can say that when I answered the questions put to me on that day, I was doing so while bearing in mind my situation.  Whether I told the truth or not, I did so while thinking about my situation, and that is because if you have been instructed to say something and that the people who gave you those instructions are powerful people who have the power of life or death over you, you comply with those instructions. 

I have always told you that the testimony that I gave here was communicated to the Rwandan intelligence services.  You are insisting that I give you answers without explaining, and so I gave those answers, because I was thinking about my situation and about my future.  I did not have peace of mind at the time, and this was because of the problems I had which had been caused either by you or by the Rwandan government. 
Q.	Well, that's just the point, Mr. Witness, because your answers to this Tribunal always seem to depend on what is in your own best interest.  Mr. Robinson challenged you.  He asked you, back in 
	June of 2006, whether you, indeed, had offered to change your testimony if he paid you, and you still can't answer that question.  But then the enquiry went on beyond him, because you gave the excuse that somebody else had called you and offered to pay you, and then Mr. Robinson asked you another question.  You've heard it already.  I read that question to you just 10 minutes ago, and I will do it again. 

On page 9 of the transcript:  "Well, it's true" -- and this is a question from Mr. Robinson -- "Well, it's true, Witness BTH" -- "Well, isn't it true, Witness BTH, that it was you who contacted an individual named Muhumbo in Europe by telephone, and you offered to change your testimony if Mr. Nzirorera would give you enough money to leave Rwanda?"  

And I'm asking you the same question now:  Did you contact a certain Muhumbo in Europe and offer to change your testimony if Mr. Nzirorera would pay you enough money to leave Rwanda?  
A.	I never did that.  When Mr. Robinson asked me that question, we had not talked about it.  I had not told him that I had telephoned any Mr. Muhumbo.  I believe that my answer is clear now.  And, in fact, allow me to give you my own answers.  Do not compel me to give you the answers that you are expecting. 
Q.	What is clear now, Mr. Witness, is that you were willing to change your testimony in June of 2006; as far back as June 2006, you were willing to change your testimony if somebody paid you to do so.  That's what's clear.  It's clear from your response today, and it's clear as we look back and see the progression of your evidence.  
A.	No, no, not at all.  You just asked me whether someone offered me money, and I told you "no".  
	I changed my testimony because I did not have a clear conscience because I had lied.  This seems clear to me. 
Q.	And what motivated you to clear your conscience now?  Is it the fact that you're outside of Rwanda, that's why you can tell the truth now and you couldn't before; is that what you are saying? 
A.	It is because I'm no longer under the control of the person who asked me to give that testimony.  That person had asked me to do someone harm, and this tormented me.  Now that I am no longer in close proximity with that person, I'm no longer under his control, and that is why I want to clear my conscience.  That is clear. 
Q.	And you also don't want to go back to prison for 19 years, as you were ordered to do by the Gacaca court in Busogo, or to go back to prison for 30 years, as you were ordered to do by the Gacaca court in Musumba; isn't that right? 
A.	That happened after my departure.  I was not aware of those judgements.  I was no longer interested in them.  I explained to you the reasons why I left the country, and I do not know why you continue speaking about those sentences of 19 or 30 years. 
Q.	Yes, and you also testified that it was foreseeable to you.  You testified yesterday that you knew that judgements against you would be forthcoming because you saw the same thing happen to other persons who had been freed provisionally after pleading guilty.  So you knew eventually your crimes would catch up to you; isn't that true? 
A.	I did not commit any crime.  The only crimes that I committed, I have already been sentenced for that.  I cannot continue to express myself on that, regarding the allegations against me, because it is not my trial here.  When I left the country, some information was already available.  But the fact of having been sentenced to 30 years in prison, I only learnt about it here.  I was not aware that those judgements had been handed down. 

I know that certain people here betrayed me and communicated my testimonies to the Rwandan authorities.  These people wanted me to go back to prison after they had used me.  I had completed my task, and they no longer had any use for me. 

For example, you, you did not explain to me that the information I was giving here would have consequences on my trial in Rwanda.  If you had told me that, I think I would not have testified for the Prosecution.  But since you have interests to protect in this trial, you told me that there was no problem, and yet later I learnt that this information had been communicated to the Rwandan authorities. 
Q.	And now you're accusing those authorities of forcing you to give false evidence.  You're accusing the authorities in Rwanda of being responsible for what you say is your false testimony.  Wouldn't you agree that by suggesting that now and giving that evidence today in this international Tribunal, that you are making yourself unwelcome in Rwanda? 
A.	That's obvious.  I have given you the names of people who were killed.  Rwandan authorities went to look for information on the people who had been denounced.  And I know that when you went there, you went there with those people.  And if those authorities were not worried, they would not have reacted.  So I'm asserting that the Rwandan authorities played a role, and an important role, for that, in respect of testimonies which had been given by various witnesses, including myself. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, in view of your testimony today, or for the last four or five days, do you think this Tribunal should find a way to protect you?  Do you think you should get some sort of asylum so that you don't have to go back to Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda in 2006.  The Tribunal was not protecting me.  At that time the Tribunal did not know where I was.  I did not come here to testify so that the Tribunal could look for a country of asylum for me.  I raised the issue of security here because there is a witness protection unit here, but that unit has never protected me.  So the Tribunal has to review the protection system applied to witnesses, but I am not, as such, asking the Tribunal to seek asylum for me. 

I think the first -- the Tribunal found where I was in 2007.  And, between then and now, they have not extended any protection to me. 
Q.	Yes, but I am asking you now.  Now that you have come forward, testified again under oath in an international Tribunal, and accused the Rwandese authorities of forcing you to lie, do you think this Tribunal should prevent you -- or, should find a mechanism to prevent you being brought back to Rwanda?  That's what I'm asking you.  
A.	I do not know the rules of this Tribunal regarding witness protection.  The Tribunal is free to take measures which it deems to be necessary.  You can even ask staff of the Tribunal dealing with the witnesses, and they will tell you that I've not spoken to them about asylum. 

My question is, why is the Tribunal not protecting us?  I'm asking you that question, as well.  I was a Prosecution Witness, and how come information contained in my file here was transmitted to Rwanda?  Now I'm asking you what will you do, because you had promised me that my testimony will not be disclosed to the Rwandan authorities, but you did not keep your promise. 

I left Rwanda for various reasons.  I talked about the problem of the French issue, which has nothing to do with this Tribunal here.  The Tribunal should provide security to me by implementing the existing mechanism.  But, otherwise, I have not come here so as to be given any asylum.  Before leaving my country of residence -- or, before I left my country, I did not ask this Tribunal for protection.  I'm not -- I've not asked the Tribunal to send me to any country.  I don't know what the Tribunal will do regarding my security, so I'm awaiting measures that will be taken by this Tribunal -- by this Tribunal in connection with my security. 

I had -- I've done what I had to do.  I've spoken the truth; namely, Rwandan authorities compelled me to lie, and I wanted to appease -- or, rather, to relieve my conscience. 
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the trancript has been extracted and filed under separate 
	cover)
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I just want to call your attention to the fact that when you asked Mr. Webster about the two lines of enquiry that he had left, he told you what those were.  He's now, once again, expanded his cross-examination into a completely different line of enquiry, which is becoming very repetitive.  And so I ask you to terminate his cross-examination.  And either he was not candid with you when you asked him what his lines of enquiry were, or he's imagining things as he's going along.  I think it's time to terminate his cross -- his redirect-examination.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
As a preliminary issue, I would just like to make -- redact the issue -- redact the state -- the sentence of where the witness is to be returned to because that is where he came from.  I was under the impression that that was protected information. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm not quite sure I follow, but my reference was to Rwanda, Your Honour.  But I will reformulate that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I beg your pardon?  You are saying it is true that the witness came here from Rwanda?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Where he originates, that's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, that's not the question that you put. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  Well, I will reframe the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And, in any event, I thought that where he came from is protected information, that's why I simply made an order for redaction.  But you don't think it should be redacted?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I didn't realise that a country was mentioned in that statement, but I will simply re-ask the question in another way. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, isn't that what this is all about -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, may I have a ruling on my request that his cross-examination be terminated because he has gone beyond what he represented to you as having been the lines of enquiry when you gave him permission to continue?  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we have decided not to stop the Prosecutor.  It seems to us that he is in the winding-up process, and I'll just get his confirmation on that. 

Mr. Webster, how much more time do you have?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
This is the last -- these are the last series of questions.  I am winding up, in fact.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
My question is:  How much more time did you anticipate?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe another five or ten minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Proceed, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what I'm suggesting to you is that you've created a situation whereby you would expect this Tribunal to ensure that you are not returned to Rwanda.  That's what's motivating your recantation, isn't it? 
A.	No.  For example, it was not the Tribunal here that asked me to leave Rwanda, because prior to leaving Rwanda, I did not ask the Tribunal to extend security to me where I was.  I've explained to you why I left Rwanda.  The reason I changed my testimony is because the first time I had lied and, secondly, because I was no longer under the control of the person who had asked me to lie.  And I've told you that my conscience was not at ease because I had lied.  

But when I left my country, this Tribunal was not protecting me in my country of current residence.  I have tried to make do so as to be able to live.  I've not returned to Rwanda.  And that has nothing to do with what you are saying by claiming that the Tribunal will help me so that I do not go back to Rwanda.  

You do not want to accept my reasons. But, it's not your opinion that is not -- your opinion is not important.  It's the Trial Chamber that will assess my testimony.  But I changed my testimony because I wanted to have a clear conscience, because the last time out, I had lied. 
Q.	Would you like the Tribunal to protect you now, to house you in a safe house, to keep you safe here in Arusha?  Is that what you're looking for? 
A.	I have told you that I do not know what measures the Tribunal is going to take.  You have revealed some information which could reveal my identity.  Further, you said that you went with number 10 to Rwanda to the various places.  

So, Prosecutor, what is your opinion?  You have just said that you have told some people that you are my friend.  Now, as a friend, what measures would you ask the Tribunal to take?  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you answer my questions, not the other way around, and I'll proceed.  The bottom line is that you came before this Tribunal on four separate occasions, starting in 2004, and on each of those four occasions you took an oath to tell the truth; correct?  Just say "yes" or "no".  That's all I'm interested.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you gave evidence on each of those four occasions that was critical to determining the guilt or the innocence of Joseph Nzirorera, Jérôme Bicamumpaka, Casimir Bizimungu, and 
	General Augustin Bizimungu; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	That's right. 
Q.	You knew that your evidence was important -- or, would be important in this Tribunal's assessment of whether those four individuals were responsible for very serious crimes?  You knew that?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When you testified in June of 2006, and you accused Mr. Robinson of offering you money to change your testimony, you knew that that was a serious allegation against a lawyer, did you not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you knew that Mr. Robinson himself could be charged with a crime, based on what you were saying, sitting right there in the witness box; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And, now, based on evidence that is diametrically opposed to what you said those four previous times, you've given evidence that can be used to charge at least four or five other people with crimes.  Your evidence over the last week can be used to charge -- and if you look at the list that we've been working from, your evidence over the last week can be used to charge number 2 with a crime; you accused him of lying to the Tribunal; you accused him of getting other people to lie in their testimony before the Tribunal; right? 
A.	Yes.  You may continue. 
Q.	For GBU, your testimony this week can be used to convict him of a crime, if it's believed, right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	With respect to number 5, your evidence this week can be used to charge him and convict him of a crime? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	With respect to number 10, he can be charged with a crime, based on what you saw -- what you said today and yesterday? 
A.	Yes.  I think that he should be prosecuted.  I do not think that the others should be prosecuted, but number 9 should be prosecuted.  He should be interviewed so as to say who gave him the orders to do what he did.
(Pages 18 to 31 by Joe Reynosa)












1200H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'm not asking you who you think should be prosecuted.  I'm asking you if you realise that your evidence can be used to charge him with a crime and that if you are believed, he could, in fact, be convicted of a crime.  And you've agreed, right?  Yes or no?  
A.	I think I've answered that question. 
Q.	Answer it again.  Yes or no?  
A.	I'm saying that number 10 committed offences and therefore he should be prosecuted.  
Q.	You've also implied that number 23 and number 14 were in cahoots with authorities and that their evidence was untrue and was deliberately given in an untrue manner when they testified; isn't that true? 
A.	I think that everything that I said, be it yesterday or the day before yesterday, has been noted down.  So you can look at the transcript of the proceedings. 
Q.	So we can agree, Mr. Witness, that whether we're referring to Mr. Nzirorera across the courtroom or the other three ICTR Accused persons, Bicamumpaka, Casimir Bizimungu or Augustin Bizimungu, and now if we include the persons that we've been referring to on this list, that somewhere someone is going to be implicated in crimes just because of what you said here today?  You understand that? 
A.	I do not know the decision which will be taken by the Tribunal.  All that I know is that I had given a false testimony which could cost the lives of some people.  So I had to come back here in order to retract what I had said.  And if there are people who must be held accountable for what had happened in Rwanda, then those people should be found accountable not on the basis of the testimony which I had given here.  That is why I have come back here in the present trial, because initially people caused me to come here to tell lies, and this time around I have come here to counter those lies.  I have not come here to waste time.  

I think that when I started testifying here in the present matter, I apologised.  I apologised because in the past I had told lies.  But with regard to the decision that will be handed down by this Tribunal, I don't know anything about the direction of that decision.  
Q.	Yes, but now you as well must be held accountable and take responsibility for your lies.  Are you prepared for that?  
A.	Yes, I know that I can be prosecuted, but I also know that one can be forgiven if one provides valid reasons.  I've explained to you the reasons which made me lie, but I'm convinced that what I'm saying now is the truth.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, the one thing I can assure you is that this is not Gacaca, and a public apology does not suffice to absolve you of your crimes.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And with that, Mr. President, I have no further questions.  I do have exhibits that I would like to tender. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
About how many?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think one that should be entered into evidence which is a document from 2007.  It's the one that I circulated that was not in the bundle.  I don't think we've given that an exhibit number yet.  It's the Gacaca record from 2005.  If Mr. Issa could tell me what the last Prosecution exhibit is, the number and what the document is, that would assist. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, if it might assist, the Gacaca judgement of May 2005 was admitted already as P. 300, and the appeal judgement of December 2005 was admitted as P. 301.  I think this document is already an exhibit. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  Thank you.  There are the statements that I referred to when I was confronting the witness that I would like to have identified as IP documents.  What I can do is draw up a list and present it to the Defence counsel and work that out and then come back before the Chamber and handle it administratively. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  That's acceptable.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
There is also the document that I circulated to the parties which has -- it's the list of 26 individuals, but there is other information on it, and I think that should become a part of our record just for clarity.  I think it's appropriate to offer it as a Prosecution exhibit.  If the Defence objects, then we can -- I can request that the Court identify it as a Court exhibit.  But it shouldn't be a problem.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, Mr. Webster is -- is he referring to the same list that the witness has had in front of him with a separate column with the pseudonyms?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's it.  I'm suggesting that that should be part of our record, since it will assist anyone reviewing this testimony to locate previous testimonies of those individuals, their background -- it will assist in --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, a little slower, please.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  

I'm suggesting that it should be a Prosecution exhibit under seal.  If there's an objection, then we'll handle it another way. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I don't object, but there are three inaccuracies on the document.  Number 5's pseudonym should be included there, which is GNK.  Number 6, the pseudonym is GNK, but it's -- that's not that witness's pseudonym.  The witness's pseudonym is GFF.  And number 7 should be ANU.  But with those corrections, I don't have any objection to it being admitted. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I had actually made a new document with those -- with those -- those corrections, which I was planning to show to the parties and admit.  I did not get one of the corrections that Mr. Robinson mentioned, but I'll do that and then we can -- we can handle this with the IP documents later on today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, with respect to the IP documents, I think there's a serious issue that has to be raised with respect to those and also the future conduct of the trial.  But maybe we can deal with this witness and then excuse him, and I can explain that to you, because I'm not going to have any request to recross-examine this witness.  And I -- you can check with my colleagues, but if there is no further recross-examination, perhaps we can excuse the witness and deal with the issue of these documents.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any further cross-examination requested by anybody?  Well, that's an answer.  There's no further cross-examination requested.  

Witness BTH, your testimony has come to an end.  We thank you for testifying before the court and assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You are now excused.  
THE WITNESS:
I'm the one thanking you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, with respect to the documents that are proposed to be marked as -- for identification, these consist of a series of statements by individuals.  Mr. Webster confronted this witness with those statements -- or with what those individuals had said.  And now that we're still in the Prosecution case, I think it has to be clarified what the status of those individuals will be during the course of this trial, because certainly they couldn't be called as rebuttal witnesses since the Defence case hasn't begun.  

So if they were to -- if Mr. -- it was Mr. Webster's intention to call these people as witnesses, I think that he would have to make leave -- make application for leave to add them to his witness list, and that testimony would have to take place before the Defence case commences.  If he had no intention of -- or has no intention of making such a motion of calling of these witnesses, then I believe that all of that -- that it was improper for him to have put such statements on the record before the trier of fact in his cross-examination of the witnesses.  And then the -- not only should the documents not be marked for identification, but I think that there would be -- other motions would have to follow from that as well.  

So it's my position that the Prosecution must at this time either seek to vary its witness list by adding these witnesses and calling them during its case or not -- the Trial Chamber should not allow the receipt of these documents.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to support what has been said by my learned colleague, Robinson, but I would like to add something.  If materials are tendered for identification, it should be material that has been placed before the witness himself.  But I realise that all the documents that are being tendered for the identification purposes at no one time were actually presented to the witness.  We were limited to the readings made by Mr. Webster, and those were only a few excerpts.  Otherwise, I fully support the observations made by Mr. Robinson.  Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, the Defence of Édouard Karemera would like to support the observation of Mr. Robinson.  When you want to tender a document, you have to call a witness who is likely to confirm the authenticity of those materials.  So that is our opinion on what Mr. Webster would like to do.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I think Mr. Robinson is jumping the gun a bit, I believe.  I would suggest that his motion is a bit premature.  The Prosecution does intend to file a motion to vary its witness list.  We should be able to do that by Monday and we can take it from there.  

There is an application that I'd like to make in closed session.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, before we go into closed session on that point, then I would ask that the commencement of the Defence case be postponed.  Obviously we can't commence our Defence case until the Prosecution's motion to vary its witness list has been decided.  So, I would ask that the motion be ordered to be filed on Monday, we'd be given five days to respond, Mr. Webster be given five days to reply, and then following the decision by the Trial Chamber, we recommence, whether it would be with additional Prosecution witnesses or with the start of Mr. Karemera's Defence case.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I just want to find out.  The -- I won't ask the question yet.  

You say you have a motion now for closed session?  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour, yes.  Which should take no more than five minutes or so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can see that the waiting public is already leaving the courtroom, so I will simply say we go into closed session now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 37 to 42] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 32 to 36 by Sherri Knox) 






























MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, any report?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I can assist Your Honours by saying that the investigator Hamadi is in the field.  He went out last night.  His first stop is Gitarama, and I'm hopeful of some information before we resume at 2:00.  

I should also mention, Your Honours may be aware that there has been a server problem, which has meant that some e-mails sent from Arusha to outside have taken an inordinate length to be delivered.  Although, e-mails sent from outside to Arusha tend to be delivered quickly.  That has caused a certain complication in some of what is being undertaken in Kigali.  If there is any development as a consequence of any complications, I will be able to inform Your Honours at 2:00.  The short point is there is an investigator in the field, and I'm hoping for some form of information by 2:00.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that we -- when we resume at 2:00 Witness BDW be here so I can conduct my cross-examination on the document he produced.  I think it would take one hour or less.  But since I'm not going to be here again after today, I would like to make that the first order of business and then perhaps we could either discuss the future course of events after that, or we could continue with 
Ms. Diagne's cross-examination.  But I'm concerned to be able to complete my cross-examination this afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, do you have an idea how much time you require on the information that you already have?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Before my idea about the time, I would like that the materials expected should be available for my cross-examination.  This is a way of working that I am not very happy about.  The witness's testimony was very important for my client, and I would have liked to have all the available documents to be able to make my cross-examination and in order to assess those documents and give a precise idea to the Trial Chamber.  I do understand that my colleague, Mr. Robinson, has to travel and that he wishes to carry out his cross this afternoon, but in the interest of my client, proceeding in this way would not be very useful to us, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, just to -- it's now 12:45.  We think that we should resume at 2:30.  

Mr. Morley, that gives you an extra half an hour. 
MR. MORLEY: 
And I'm grateful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1245H to 1458H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Madam registrar, could you open the proceedings?  

Oh, okay.  Thank you.  That's completely unnecessary.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I assist, Your Honours?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The witness who is now before Your Honours in the witness box is the returned BDW for completion of his cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I also mention that I'm presently in text communication with an investigator called Hamadi, and I am awaiting the answer to the question, because as we speak, the last text tells me the file is being perused.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Mr. Robinson, in light of that information, do you still want to complete your cross-examination now?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Actually, I don't want to complete it, but I'd like to continue it.  I think I could usefully -- documents -- just limited to the documents he provided to us the last time he was here, I think it would be -- I could do a cross-examination that would be useful for that.  Even if the document is -- even if OTP finds some documents, then they have to bring them, translate them, everything; I think we're weeks away.  And then if they don't find anything, then there would be no reason to bring the witness back.  So I think it's best if I complete -- do the most I can do today.  And then if it turns out that he comes back, I can ask him some questions about the new information. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We understand.  I just wanted to know if you were going to be making an application to postpone.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No.  I would like to do my best right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  

Witness BDW, good afternoon.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we are going to resume your testimony.  As you are aware, the information which had been sought has not yet been found; so, although the Prosecutor is expecting to be able to provide some more definite information shortly, in the meantime, in order to make the best use of your presence here, the cross-examination on the information which already exists will continue.  And Mr. Robinson will continue his cross-examination of you now.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  Mr. Robinson will now continue his examination.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony commenced.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President. 
WITNESS BDW,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDW, muraho.  Amakuru ki?  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  I'm very well.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, just to summarise where we are right now, I said that you had never accused Édouard Karemera in any written documents while you were at Kibuye prison.  And in response to that, you produced your document dated December 2002, which is now D. NZ444, correct? 
A.	Since the beginning of my testimony, my answer has not changed.  I told you that I started accusing him in December when I started providing testimony to the relevant authorities or bodies.  So that was on the 20th of December 2002 in Kibuye.  So, this is information I was providing.  However, as father -- as far as the testimony before the Tribunal here is concerned, when I began to testify against Karemera -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness does not finish his sentence. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, after you produced that document dated December 2002, I said that that was a montage, that pages 2 and 3 were on lined paper and that there were different pens used.  And in response to that, you produced a document -- or some documents, including one dated the 26th of October 2002 to show that on other occasions, you have used lined paper and different pens, correct?  
A.	That is correct.  I handed over these documents because you alleged that the document I had produced was a montage, and I wanted to prove that I could use paper of different types in one same document and that I had done so on other occasions.  Therefore, I brought to you documents that are copies of other documents I provided for my file so that you can ascertain and confirm what I said.  However, I know that to date, you are not in agreement with me.  

The documents I have provided are documents that I wanted the Trial Chamber to take into consideration with a view to understanding that I could use paper of different types or varieties in one same document.  I did this because you claimed that the document I handed over to you was a montage, and I know that you even claimed that it was a document I had drafted in the intersession period.  

However, this document dates back to 2002, just like the other documents I handed over to you recently, even if they were not drafted during the same month.  And this is the answer that I provided to the Trial Chamber during my testimony. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  We understand each other perfectly.  

Now, if the registrar could show you the four-page document that you handed over last time you were here.  It's dated 26 October 2002.  And I'd like him to show you the original.  

Now, Witness BDW, you've been handed the four pages of the document dated 26th of October 2002.  And can you tell me, were these four pages all submitted at the same time in the same document?  

And I'm glad to see you have your glasses today.  
A.	I have no problem with that and I shall answer you.  These four pages were part of one and the same document that I handed over on the date written on these documents, and that was during my trial. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I will move to admit this document dated the 26th of October, under seal, as D. NZ463. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ463 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, if you look at the third page of the four pages, indeed the third page is written on lined paper while the other three pages are unlined, correct? 
A.	That is correct, and that is what I have been trying to explain to you, that I might use paper of different varieties in view of the meager means, but I must say that all the other copies are not made on one and the same paper.  There are other copies where you might not come across this type of lined paper. 
Q.	Okay.  And also on this page 3, if you look at it, it looks like it was written in two different types of ink, correct?  You changed pens during -- during the writing of page 3, correct? 
A.	I have already mentioned this in answer to your questions.  This was during the trial, and I was using the pen that I had at hand.  And these are the conclusions that I was drafting for the attention of the Judges.  And as I told you, it was my responsibility to buy my own paper and pens.  And I did not have many means.  

I do not know quite whether you have understood me correctly.  It was for the very same reason that I wanted to show this document to you.  And I believe that as regards the documents you have been able to consult in my judicial file, you will come across a similar document.  And I do not believe that you should base yourselves uniquely on this copy that I have handed over to you, because you have had access to my judicial file and you have been able to note the presence of this document in the file.  
Q.	Well, Witness BDW, I concede that this page 3 proves your point, that it's on lined paper in a document which otherwise has unlined paper, and two different types of ink are used in the same document, just like the document in December where you mention Karemera.  But I put it to you that this document you've presented to us is also a montage and that page 3 of this document was not this lined paper with the two inks but was another piece of paper, and that in order to prove your point to the Trial Chamber, you have created yet another montage by substituting this lined paper with the two inks for the real page 3 of this document.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	I do not see what you are basing such a claim on.  Even if I had used non-lined paper, would that have changed anything?  I used the paper I had at my disposal.  And even if I had used another type of paper, it would not have changed anything, because I still remain the author of this document.  Today I might not be able to use this type of lined paper because I have access to unlined paper, for example, but as I said to you earlier, I do not see why you are still making such a claim when you can find a copy of this very document in my judicial file.  And if I wanted to show you this document, it was because you alleged that I could not use two pens with two different types of ink in one -- on one same page or that I could not write a document using different types of paper.  But I wanted to prove to you that during a trial one uses the very first pen that one can put one's hands on.  And I believe that one should consider, rather, the content of the document.  

I do not know whether you are contesting the fact that I committed the crimes I was accused of, and the contents of the document bears witness to the fact that I was defending myself against the accusations laid at my door.  I quite simply wanted to show to you that during the period from October to 
December 2002, I might have written documents using different types of paper, and in -- on same occasions I used pens with different inks in one and the same document or maybe even on the very same page, and the situation might have changed subsequently.  
Q.	Now, I'm going to ask the registrar to give you one of the other pieces of paper that you gave to us the last time you were here.  And this is the one that has the word "suite 3" on the top of it.  It's a single sheet.  

Now, Witness BDW, you've just been handed one of -- one piece of paper.  Can you confirm that that was one of the papers that you turned over to the Trial Chamber the last time you were here? 
A.	This piece of paper is part of a document, a document in which I was defending myself during my trial.  These are answers I gave to the Judges during the proceedings.  And when I handed over this document, I wanted to prove that I could use different types of paper.  

As regards the contents, these are the answers I gave to the questions that were put to me after the testimony, and I handed over these pages -- this is a document of three pages -- because I wanted to show that at one moment in time I drafted documents that contained different types of paper and that I might also use different types of pen. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may this single-page document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ464, under seal?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ464 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, you see on the top of that document it says "suite 3", correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  And this page follows on from other pages.  And if you read the document, you will note that it comprises answers put to me on the subject of witnesses who had testified.  Therefore, these are not conclusions.  And were one to compare the contents of this document and the document shown to me a few minutes ago, the difference is that in this document of one page, I answer the questions put to me, whereas in the other document it contains conclusions that I wrote down once I had left the Chamber.  

Now, as far as what is contained in this one sole page, these are responses I provided during the hearing, and this page follows on from other pages.  I believe that the entire document might comprise approximately six pages in total.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Now, I would ask the registrar to obtain that original document from the witness and to put before the Chamber -- the Trial Chamber the original of the two documents that we've dealt with today, the four-page document and this page 3.  

Now, if you could just leave that with the Trial Chamber.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, it appears to me that Exhibit 464, the one page, was really the true page 3 of Exhibit 463, instead of the lined sheet of paper that is now inserted.  And I want to tell you why I think that, and I'll give you a chance to respond.  
A.	I shall answer that question, Counsel.  The contents are different.  If you look at the contents of this document comprising one sole page, it contains the answer I gave during the hearing.  If you look at 
	D. NZ463, however, this document comprises the conclusion I drafted after the trial.  However, as regards the other document, the unique or sole page you showed me, the contents are, in fact, the answers I gave with regard to the questions on the subject of the witness who had testified during my trial.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, let me just give you -- put -- suggest to you what appears to me about this document.  The document on page 1 says that you have something to say against those charging you, and then you go on, on the middle of page 1 after the Roman numerals, to start off with a numeral 1, and you talk about Mucuruzi.  That's M-U-C-U-R-U-Z-I.  Then on page 2 the numbering continues, and you continued to talk about those who accused you.  

Now, if you look at the other document, the separate document, D. NZ464, that says "suite 3" or "continuation 3" on the top, and that begins with the number 5, whereas page 2 leaves off with the number 4.  And the numbers appear to be written in one kind of ink with red markings over the numbers on both page 2 of your four-page document and the single page which I claim is page 3.  And indeed the text seems to continue to be answers that you are providing to the accusations against you.  

Now -- let me finish and I'll give you a full chance to explain.  

Near the bottom of page 3 of the single document, you switch from numbers to hyphens and you start to make your separate points with hyphens.  Now, if we go and look at page 4 of the document 
D. NZ463, you see that the hyphens continue at the top and go all the way down, all the points are made by hyphen now and ends with your signature.  

And so I suggest to you that the actual document that was presented was pages 1 and 2 and 4 of your document dated the 26th of October and the separate document, "suite 3", which you handed to us separately, and that the lined document that you have attached to page -- to the four-page document as page 3, in which you also show that there are two pens used, was not part of that single document.  Now, would you like to comment on that?  
MR. MORLEY: 
And before the witness does so, can he have back the original?  I know that Their Honours have it, but at the moment he doesn't have any materials in front of him, and it may assist him to answer. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  That's a good suggestion.  When the Trial Chamber is finished with the original, it should be given to the witness before he answers.  
THE WITNESS:
This does not stop me from answering because I know how these documents were drafted.  Even if we see the words "suite trois" -- "suite 3" on those pages, these pages are not part of this very same document.  In the document of four pages, I was writing my conclusions after the hearings in my trial.  However, in the document of one sole page, this document comprises answers I gave during the hearing with regard to questions put to me on the subject of the witness.  

Now, even if you say to me that I used two different pens, this is only normal, because I used the pens that I had to hand.  And when you say to me that I have used paper of different types, I've already told you that this is quite normal, because I had to use the means at my disposal.  And when I had run out of non-lined paper, I might then resort to using lined paper. 
(Pages 43 to 50 by Sherri Knox)

















1530H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
I do not know whether you are claiming that the -- the -- the answers contained in the document of one page were never given during the trial, or whether you are saying whether the conclusions contained in the page -- in the document of 4 pages is not included in my judicial file.  Well, if I showed you this document, it was with a view of proving to you that I could use different types of paper in the same document, and that I might even use different pens of different inks in one same document.  I wanted to show to you that you were wrong on that subject.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Now, there are two other pages -- two other documents that you provided, and I'd like the registrar to show those to you and we'll try to put them into evidence.  

	Witness BDW, those two documents that have just been placed in front you, are those documents that you provided to the Trial Chamber last time you were here, in your own writing? 
A.	Yes, I am the author of these documents. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that the first document, which is actually written on both sides and starts with the numeral 1 on the top, be Exhibit D. NZ465 under seal; and the second document, which has no writing on the back, be Exhibit D. NZ466 under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.  
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ465 admitted, under seal)
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ466 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, can we agree that in none of the four documents you produced the last time you were here does the name Édouard Karemera appear? 
A.	I agree with you.  Édouard Karemera's name does not appear in any of the documents, but this is simply due to the fact that Karemera was not concerned by my case, because in the four documents I explain myself on the charges leveled against me, and in -- in that case, Karemera was not a co-accused.  

I talked about Karemera in a document -- or, rather, in a statement which I gave in connection with charges made against me.  In the four documents, mention is made of crimes which I allegedly committed in Muciro commune, and whereas Karemera is not at all concerned with -- or by those particular acts covered in those said documents.  
Q.	Can we also agree that nowhere in any of these four documents do you acknowledge having been involved in training of Interahamwe? 
A.	These documents concern my case.  He was not a co-accused in my case -- and, if you wish, I could give you the summons which I received.  These documents concerned my case and charges against me, so there is a difference between my trial, on the one hand, and the evidence I gave on the other.  Here, we are talking about my trial and accusations made against me.  Later, I gave explanations concerning other accusations.  The -- I gave my evidence in respect of another count, which concerned Mr. Karemera.  
Q.	But can we agree that you never mentioned in any of these documents that you, Witness BDW, hadn't been involved in training of Interahamwe? 
A.	That is why I'm telling you that I did not mention that act.  I decided to talk about it.  There were accusations which were not made against me; you can see the list of counts and charges against me.  I was accused of having attended one meeting unjustly, but they did not talk about other meetings which I attended.  

There are other facts or cases and events being dealt with before Gacaca court -- courts.  I've not been accused of all the acts in which I was involved.  If that had been the case, then certainly, we would've talked about Mr. Karemera in these documents, but I was not -- but I was not accused at the same time or with Mr. Karemera in that particular case -- my case, which we're talking about here.  
Q.	And isn't it a fact that in that four-paged document, the 26th of October 2002, down -- after -- in the paragraph numbered 1, you say that you didn't have a gun during the genocide?  And you'll find that after the reference to Kayibanda.  
A.	Yes, when I was in -- when I was there, I did not have a firearm; I did not use a firearm in that area.  And you'll see that in that area, guns were not used.  But in other areas or in another area, I had a firearm, but in Muciro, we used only traditional weapons.  No one was killed with a firearm in that area.  At that time I was not a soldier; it's true that I trained Interahamwes, but I was not a soldier.  I had already left the army.  I was not wearing a military uniform and I did not use a firearm in that area.  
Q.	And so when you said, "I never had a gun", you were referring only to that area; correct? 
A.	Yes, that's what I'm saying, and that's what I said in my case -- i.e., in that area I did not use a firearm, we did not use firearms at all during the massacres in that area.  You see, one -- one confesses one has to talk about weapons used, give names of accomplices, and so and so forth.  You see, in that area the incidents took place in a village.  We did not really need to use firearms.  
Q.	But you did have a firearm at that time, didn't you? 
A.	You're reading this document.  In this document I say that I did not have a military uniform; I did not have a gun.  If I had a firearm in this area, I would have said so.  You can have a gun, but you don't have to carry it everywhere you go.  In my area, I did not use a firearm.  We used guns in areas 
where -- where we had to defend ourselves, but in -- in that area, in that area there was not resistance.  No one was resisting and that is why we did not use firearms.  
Q.	And so do you maintain that your confessions -- such as, the one on 26th October 2002, were the truth? 
A.	Why are you claiming that I did not speak the truth?  If you can, go and see what is happening before Gacaca courts, and what is said there is the truth.  You don't -- you do not agree that I'm speaking the truth because you're -- you're defending your client.  However, the appeals court I'm sure will find that I've been telling the truth.  

My trial is not over yet; you have to bear this in mind.  Maybe you want to say that my confessions will not be admitted, but if investigations are carried out, and if the law is respected and laid down procedure are complied with, then my confessions will be accepted by the court.  So it's not you -- it's not for you to decide whether or not my confessions will be accepted.  
Q.	No, but I'm basing myself on your judgement on the 15th of November 2002 in which the judge rejected your confession because he said you were lying.  So it's not me who's accusing you of lying; I'm just repeating what has been found to be the facts in your case.  
A.	What you're saying is true, but what I am saying is also true.  If I had agreed with the judgement I would not have lodged an appeal.  They have not yet ruled on my appeal.  It is the appeal court that will decide in the last instance; it's not you.  Even the judgement in the -- at the first instance court is not final, because the appeals court has not delivered its decision yet.  It's the court of last resort which will finally rule on my case and not you.  

I did not agree with the judgement at first instance court, because that court, I said, erred and that's why I lodged an appeal.  I'm saying that I told the truth; I'm still telling the truth and I'm sure the appeals court will rule in my favor.  The Kibuye first instance court, which delivered the judgement in 
November 2002, erred in its findings and that is why I appealed, and my case is before the appeals court.  You, sir, as a lawyer, maybe could ask the appeals court to deliver its judgement as soon as possible so that we can know what the truth is, rather than for you to rely on a judgement with which I do not agree.  

Counsel, I -- I will also like to add something else.  What I know is that you should rely on my testimony. Although I did not plead guilty, I could be called to testify, so you should not think that only people who have not been found guilty have been speaking the truth.  I testified to events in which I participated and to events to which I was an eyewitness.  So you have to make a distinction between confessions and testimony.  If you have any doubt, please ask the appeals court to deliver its judgement as soon as possible.  That way we can have documents on which we can rely.  The original -- the initial judgement was the judgement I did not agree with and, therefore, I appealed against it.  
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, after that judgement you were transferred to the Ruhengeri prison in 
February 2003, you've told us, and stayed there until July 2007.  We've had a lot of evidence recently about what goes on in Ruhengeri prison, but can you tell us, first of all, when did you start working at the garage there? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, I do not know whether the fact that I worked at the garage is an accusation in itself.  You see, in prison, we had teams and we would work in different places according to the needs of the prison.  I don't think that I have to give an explanation on this subject before this Court.  If you're talking about my transfer from Kibuye to Ruhengeri, I'll answer you, but if you want me to talk to you about what I was doing at the garage, I don't see why I should do that.  I was transferred from Kibuye to Ruhengeri, and when I got to Ruhengeri, whenever they required my services at the garage, they 
would -- they'd call -- they'd send for me.  
Q.	So you arrived in February 2003 in Ruhengeri, and can you tell us about when it was that you first were set forward to work at the garage?  How long after you arrived, approximately? 
A.	I asked you to not put that question to me; I cannot answer it.  Now, I'm still in prison, so when I'm asked to do any work, I do the work demanded of me.  Even at the prison where I am right now, I work.  I could work, for instance, today and tomorrow, I might not work, but I don't see of what interest is this to this Trial Chamber.  This is not part of my testimony, really, unless you want me to give you testimony regarding an incident which occurred at the garage or something which was taught at the garage.  And that's -- that's why I'm saying that otherwise the garage -- questions regarding the garage are not relevant. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question:  When did he start working at the garage in Ruhengeri prison?  It's for you to decide what's relevant, not the witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
My only thought is that we've covered this ground through cross-examination before, and we're just going over it again.  It's a matter for Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't recall having heard the answer to this question, though, and we do think it's relevant because of the testimony of another witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, I can see that, but my recollection is we've had questions about the garage and this witness's timings in it during the previous appearance by the witness.  But if I'm mistaken, I'm mistaken. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you just have a better memory than me.  I -- I would be interested in having the answer to this question.  

Witness, we -- the Judges would like to understand your answer to the question.  
THE WITNESS:
If we are to talk about what happened at the garage, I'll give you the date then.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
It was in the month of March 2003; that is when I started working at the garage.  So I continued working at the garage up to my departure from Ruhengeri.  It was -- I beg your pardon, from March 2006 up to 2007.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I think the last time Mr. Robinson asked me whether I had worked with another witness at the garage, so I -- so I did not know whether he wanted -- whether -- I don't know whether Mr. Robinson wants to ask me whether I -- the other witness and I damaged any equipment there.  If that is the case, I think he can do so.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I don't need to do that, Witness BDW.  

Now, Witness BDW, do you have any other documents that can show us that you accused Mr. Karemera or Mr. Nzirorera while you were in the Kibuye prison? 
A.	I have already given you -- I beg your pardon, I've already given the document to the Prosecutor.  I did not bring it with me here, so I -- I'm not the person who is personally making accusations against Karemera.  I'm simply giving evidence against him in respect of what he had done.  I'm not a prosecutor, I'm testifying to events which concern him.  I gave a statement and evidence in that regard to the Prosecutor, but I do not have a document regarding him in that connection with me here because I'm not a prosecutor.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness BDW.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Are there any other questions of this witness? 

Ms. Diagne, you're not responding.  Do I take it that you don't wish to cross-examine the witness any further? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President, I intend cross-examining this witness.  Are you asking me to do so -- to do so before I receive information which we are expecting from the Prosecution? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me ask Mr. Morley.

What is the position?  
MR. MORLEY:
Notwithstanding, it's been clear to the investigator in Kigali, now in Gitarama, that I'm in court; he's been trying to ring me instead of texting me.  I've sent Mr. Mbutu, who's behind me, out of court to telephone him and that's what he's doing at the moment.  So I don't have information, but something is going on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now -- now, it's now 4 o'clock on Thursday.  Do you have any suggestions as to how we proceed? 
MR. MORLEY:
I would invite that Ms. Diagne can begin her cross-examination.  All we're waiting for is -- perhaps, if the witness might take off his headphones, please.  

All we're waiting for -- did that sentence not scan very well?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  The timing of his response to your request suggests that he understood the English.  
MR. MORLEY:
Ah, well, it may just have been my tone of voice, Your Honour.  He knows that whenever I stand up, he has to take his headphones off.  

But, all we're waiting for in respect of the witness is whether or not an enquiry being conducted in Gitarama now discloses that in an archive being looked at now, is a copy of the letter of the 
20th of December 2002.  I, for my part, cannot see how that piece of information, whether it is affirmative or negative, prevents Ms. Diagne from starting her cross-examination.  I just don't see it.  Anyhow --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's hear her on this issue. 

Yes, Ms. Diagne?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I think it's unpleasant to have a learned friend try to dictate to the other party how we should conduct our business.  Because I have my -- we have our own method of organising work.  
Here, before this Trial Chamber, we are still waiting for the results of the enquiry.  And I think 
Your Honours asked that such information to be brought here, because I believe you think that it's relevant to the case at hand; and therefore, I do not really see how and why I can proceed with my cross-examination without the information.  I'm just complying with the instructions given by the 
Trial Chamber.  

You even suggested to my learned colleague, Mr. Robinson, to wait for the document to be available so as he could continue -- he could proceed with his cross-examination this afternoon.  So I don't see what has changed -- what has changed all of a sudden to make my learned friend across the courtroom believe that I can proceed without the document in question.  

We're -- all we're hearing is messages not getting through or someone going to call -- make a 
phone call.  So it is my submission that the Court should be more firm so that we ensure that we get the document here.  Because what is at stake here is the credibility of this witness, and that document is part and parcel of the enquiry which we are carrying out on our part -- and also, in respect of all doctored or manipulated documents that have been shown to us up to this point.  

This -- these are my submissions and, of course, I'm in the Court's hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we need to evaluate whether there will be a need to have this witness appear on Monday morning, because we've decided that we will not sit tomorrow in keeping with our former scheduling announcements.  

But we propose, therefore, that we will take our mid-afternoon break now to allow you to get updated information.  If we -- we will rise anyway, so that you can get the updated information.  If we do not have to sit on Monday, we will ask Ms. Diagne to complete her cross-examination this afternoon.  If it will be necessary to sit on Monday, then there's no point in having us start now.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, I understand.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will rise for a few minutes to make a decision on that issue.  
(Court recessed at 1601H)
(Pages 51 to 57 by Jean Baigent)









(Court resumed at 1637H) 
MR. MORLEY:
May it please, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
And perhaps if the witness might take his headphones off.  

In the time that I have had available to me, I have been in contact with those in Gitarama, speaking to an interpreter and also to the investigator, and I can report the situation as is follows:  

The enquiry has been conducted and it seems in the right place because they have sight of all the cartons of materials which have been offloaded from Kibuye prison, which has now been closed down and knocked down.  The difficulty is that the material is not organised in a filed way and, as a consequence to having to go through all the cartons in order to see if they can locate a file of what has been preserved in respect of this witness, I don't think we are going to get an answer today, but we might, and my phone remains on silent, but available for texts.  That is the position.  Large numbers of boxes, lots and lots of material very chaotically organised being rummaged through now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A suggestion.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours had in mind that to assist Ms. Diagne, it may be wise for the witness to come back on Monday, and I would have thought by then we will have an answer as to whether there is a file for BDW, and if there is, what is in it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If information is forthcoming before Monday, what will happen?  
MR. MORLEY:
As it goes through my left hand, it will be put in my right hand and sent out to my learned friends.  So as soon as I get any answer to the enquiry, my learned friends would be on notice moments after.  

A secondary issue would be, potentially, once we establish what, if anything, is in the file, if we find there is a document in the file, that would be copied and it will then be scanned and sent back here.  So those two phases.  If the answer is -- or, whatever the answer is will be communicated to me on the phone.  If the answer is positive, then the second phase is, we have to get a copy of the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Morley, I think it would be late to hear something from Ms. Diagne before we get back to you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, there are different types of consequences that can arise from what you have just heard.  One consequence is that you will be in a position to complete your cross-examination on Monday.  Another consequence is that you might not be, for different reasons.  We don't want to attempt to anticipate the decision now, but what we want to do is to guarantee that in the event that you are not in a position to complete your cross-examination on Monday, that the -- you start adducing evidence from your witnesses.  

So we would want to leave here on the understanding that the case will continue on Monday, either with your cross-examination of this witness, if the circumstances permit that to occur.  If circumstances do not permit that to occur, then you will proceed with your witnesses until it is possible to complete the examination of this witness.  So that's the plan of action that we would like to direct.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Mr. President, thank you.  I would like to first recall that I am at the total disposal of the Trial Chamber.  It is only that this particular solution is problematic to me because it adds to the prevailing confusion, because the Prosecutor's case will overlap with our case.  We -- as you are well aware, it's been anticipated that our witnesses will start testifying on Monday, and we have taken the necessary measures for that.  Before that we had thought that, naturally, this time around, the Prosecutor's case would be definitely closed this week, which is not the case, apparently.  

Mr. President, I thought that we could have a mini status conference because I have some concerns regarding the proclamation of my witnesses in that there are many pending matters on which 
hinges -- on which hinge the commencement of our case.  And I have in mind the various motions the Prosecutor has promised, the various measures that have to be taken after what happened in respect of the evidence of the witness who was here till this morning.  

In short, Mr. President, I wanted to tell you that the situation as you envisaged, will only, in my opinion, create further confusion.  So I would like us to stop -- to pause a bit, put things in their place so as to be able to continue.  This is a suggestion from me, with all due respect to the Trial Chamber, and recalling again that I am at your disposal and will duly comply with any measures or instructions issued by the Court.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And excuse me, Mr. President, if I could just say that our position is that, we do not believe that the Defence case should commence until the Prosecution case is completed, full stop, no asterisks.  
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, although we have been avoiding using that language, it's our position that the Prosecution case has closed.  We think that the Chamber has the power to order Prosecution witnesses to be examined after the case has been closed, and that's a step that we have taken.  
We, also, on the other hand, we are not completely unsympathetic to the rationale behind your suggestion.  But we don't think that we can allow -- allow that to have an indefinite impact on the conduct of the proceedings.  The particular issues involved in this matter is a -- is limited.  It is not an issue which is going to have an impact on the general -- on the evidence that is going to be adduced in general.  It is a limited issue which we don't think is going to interfere with the selection of the testimony, or the selection of the enquiries to be made from the witnesses who are scheduled to give testimony in the next couple of weeks.  So that is why we felt that there would be no harm to the fairness of the process if those witnesses give their testimony.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think it's Rule 85, but, basically, the process -- the rules are that the Prosecution calls its witnesses first and finishes its case, and then the Defence begins its case after the Prosecution has finished.  

Now, you can certainly recall a Prosecution witness during the Defence case if new information arises, and I think that that can be done if, in fact, Mr. Morley's team comes up with new information.  But I think that it is required under the rules that before the Defence commences its case, the Prosecution's case is concluded, including cross-examination, up until the time that the case is to be closed and that's what happened with BDW, my cross-examination was deferred.  You closed the case subject to completion of my cross-examination of BDW.  

Now, you have allowed Ms. Diagne to also have cross-examination, a supplementary cross-examination.  So, in my view, under the rules, the Defence is not required to proceed until the Prosecution's case is closed.  And the Prosecution case is not closed until all its witnesses have completed their testimony, direct, cross and re-direct.  

Now, also, I believe that we are entitled to make a motion under Rule 98 bis for a judgment of acquittal in light of the testimony of Witness BTH, because we didn't deal with credibility issues at the time of the original motion because credibility only comes into play when the Prosecution's case has broken down.  Well, I don't think a case can be broken down any more than what you saw over the last week, particularly, with respect to the allegations in Mukingo against Mr. Nzirorera.  

So before the Defence case commences, it's our position that we should have the opportunity within seven days of the completion of BDW's testimony to make a motion under Rule 98 bis, and to have you decide that motion before the commencement of the Defence case.  So our position is that it would not be proper for -- nor authorised by the rules for the Trial Chamber to commence -- to order the commencement of the Defence case until the Prosecution case is closed and we have had an opportunity to have our Rule 98 bis motion adjudicated.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think we've sort of gotten a bit distracted here.  I thought we were going to address this issue as a separate matter; the issue that Mr. Robinson is raising now, but I see words interwoven with Madam Diagne's submission.  I can address Mr. Robinson's concern about the close of the Prosecution case, but I think that should be done independently, after this witness is excused. 

Madam Diagne is concerned.  I am concerned about who the next -- who her first Defence witness will be, because, according to the information that we received recently, it is Witness LLK.  That's the witness for whom we received identifying information only on the 14th of April.  And my understanding is that the rules provide that we should have 30 days in which to prepare for a cross-examination of a Defence witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you assist by identifying which rule says that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe it was this Chamber's order that all identifying information should be provided. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, it's not the rules; it's our own.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It is this Chamber's interpretation of Rule 73 ter, and it is a subject of a pending motion.  

Ms. Diagne filed the motion sometime last week.  We answered it today.  She filed a motion to vary her witness list.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you made your submission at what time?
MR. WEBSTER:
I just signed it five minutes ago, and it's not a submission.  It's a response to Madam Diagne's submission and it is one of several motions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can see -- Prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
I can appreciate that it's a humourous matter, Your Honours, but we are simply responding -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I think you are late.  I had been reading the decision already.  
MR. WEBSTER:
A decision on her motion to vary her witness list?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I haven't seen the decision.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we signed it and filed it today.  That what's funny, because I think you filed your submissions after the motion was adjudicated. 
MR. WEBSTER:
But, usually, motions are adjudicated when the opposing party has an opportunity to respond, and I don't see where we have passed the deadline for a response to the motion.  Our response was filed today within the time limit and I have not received the decision yet.  And I am looking at my Lotus notes right now.  So I don't know what the content of the Court's decision is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I still think you are late.  
MR. WEBSTER:
In any case, the fact remains -- the situation remains regardless of how this Chamber has decided that motion without the Prosecution's response.  What do we do on Monday?  

We have a witness for whom we received identifying information only three days ago, the 14th of April, by my notes.  We can have that witness's direct examination, but the Prosecution is not going to be prepared to cross-examine that witness.  

With respect to the second witness Ms. Diagne has listed, the witness that we can test appears to be an expert witness, and she has not filed an application to hear expert testimony.  So there are a number of problems in terms of how we move forward with Ms. Diagne's Defence case, and this is a subject of several pending applications for this Chamber to enforce compliance with Rule 73 ter.  

There are so many pending applications in regard to this issue that I am not even sure where we are with the resolution of that particular point in this trial.  So it is problematic for us.  It is going to be a practical problem on Monday.  She can call the witness and we can hear the witness's direct examination, but then we are going to deal with the issue of should -- could cross-examination proceed and how it should proceed.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  What we are wondering -- since there is a request on both sides of the floor for some discussion before the case actually starts, would tomorrow morning be a suitable time to convene a status conference? 

Mr. Robinson, we have taken into account the reasons for scheduling it tomorrow morning is really to accommodate you, as you have stated an intention to leave tomorrow.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I can -- that would be very nice.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You actually think we are nice sometimes.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I do.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it is totally impossible for Mathieu Ngirumpatse's Defence time because in the schedule set by the Trial Chamber and new information, we know that we are not sitting on Friday and neither my learned friend in our team, nor myself, will be here tomorrow.  And it seems that it is a delicate matter to just have our assistant represent us for the status conference tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Weyl, you have not raised any particular issues which need to be specifically addressed tomorrow.  If there are problems that you have, they can be addressed next week.  What we wanted to do tomorrow was to raise -- to adjudicate, or to -- not adjudicate as such, but to discuss the problems which had been identified by the Karemera Defence, the Prosecutor and the Nzirorera Defence.  
So there are three issues which we will put on the table which we thought we could assist to clarify by a brief discussion tomorrow.  We don't anticipate that the conference is likely to last longer than half an hour to 45 minutes, as there are clear-cut answers to some of the questions at trial to issue them, in any event.  And we think that the four decisions that we filed a few minutes ago would also help to clarify some of the issues that have been raised in the last few minutes.  

So, I don't think that you need to fear that there will be any binding orders which are going to have a permanent impact upon the presentation of the Ngirumpatse case, but we hope that the situation will become clear if we will have an opportunity to have a discussion like this.  The alternative to wait until Monday -- the alternative to wait until Monday seems to be more problematic than the alternative of doing it tomorrow morning. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I wouldn't want to insist by asking you to stick to a decision that we are not sitting on Fridays, but the issues raised by Counsel Diagne and Mr. Robinson require necessarily a response from Mathieu Ngirumpatse's team.  I don't see how a status conference in a joint case can be held without all the parties being present.  

Now, with regard to the issue relating to what Mr. Webster said, what he said in his options will have an impact on our team, Ngirumpatse's team.  The question put by the Chamber to Mr. Webster which 
Mr. Webster was supposed to have answered this afternoon interests us.  The question related to 
Mr. Webster's issue regarding the disclosure within 30 days to assist a preparation also interests us.  I am on my foot, and on an ironic tone, I would like to respond to Mr. Webster by saying -- by telling him the 30-day decision, does it really concern only his party, or does it concern all parties?  

Now, for example, they talked about his colleagues looking through some dusty boxes somewhere in Gitarama, and -- whereas, normally -- how can we be sure that they are not going to doctor those documents when we do not know their chain of custody.  And all these questions, if they will be raised at the status conference would require our presence.  We are in a joint trial, and, therefore, I do not understand the direction we were going.  I respectfully request the Trial Chamber not to plan for a status conference under the circumstances I have just outlined.  And I humbly submit that in view of the calendar set, I think that Mr. Ngirumpatse would be present here in the courtroom in the second part of the morning session, that is, after the tea break.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I have just -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't understand you, Mr. Weyl.  On the -- after the tea break on which day?  

Mr. Weyl, I didn't quite -- I am not certain there is a translation problem.  You said Mr. Ngirumpatse will be here after the tea break, on which day? 
MR. WEYL:
On Monday, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, in response to -- which schedule is that? 
MR. WEYL:
I do not quite grasp your question, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it was not exactly a question.  It was a kind of provocative comment, because here we are, all of us together trying to make an arrangement, an accommodation to suit some of the Defence teams.  You object to it because you said we have an agreement as to calendaring.  And in the same breath, you speak about your personal convenience, which is inconsistent with the calendar, because Ngirumpatse's team should be here at a quarter to nine on Monday morning, and not after the tea break, and you straighten it like that.  So it was just -- it wasn't really -- it was a comment which seems inconsistent with your early insistence that the calendar should be meticulously observed.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to make a comment.  I would -- well, I accept what you have just said with one or two reservations.  Firstly, we were taking into account the schedule as it had been drawn up, and we thought that we could give over the mandate to one of our colleagues to do something without this affecting the schedule of the hearing.  

And, secondly, the Trial Chamber knows only too well that nothing is dictated in our behaviour by personal issues.  Everything is actually dictated by professional undertaking. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have just received the four decisions that the Court was referring to.  Two of them seem to have a direct impact on how we proceed, and my suggestion is that we simply rise for 15 minutes, give everyone an opportunity to read the decisions and come back and resolve the issues that the Court had hoped to resolve tomorrow morning.  With the issue for Mr. Weyl is -- he's unavailable here tomorrow.  Let's try to resolve everything today, even if it means staying a little later.

My concern is that we organise in a way that we proceed next week.  It is impossible to do unless we have some substantive discussion.  I would like to appreciate the contents of these decisions.  And the Prosecution's suggestion is that it's completely feasible to take 15 minutes now so that everyone can read the decisions and then come back to resolve some of the outstanding issues.  

The Chamber had anticipated that we could resolve matters within 30 or 40 minutes.  Certainly, if we return at 20 past 5, we should be able to finish a little bit after six o'clock.  So that is my suggestion, but I rely on the Court's discretion.  But there are definitely issues that we need to raise with the Karemera team.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we will accept.  It's a suggestion we are trying to do what we can this afternoon.  So we will excuse the witness now.  

You will be excused until Monday morning, or till further notice, as the case may be.  And then we will rise and resume in 15 minutes or so for a status conference.  But I will be -- we have thought that I should disabuse Mr. Weyl of one thing.  We have not made any order or said anything which should be interpreted that the Chamber will never sit on Fridays.  What we have done is, we have responded to the request of counsel who have asked us to consider not sitting on Fridays, and we have expressed a general inclination to accommodate that request.  But we reserve the right to sit to the extent that we think is necessary to ensure a proper administration of justice, and we have had a lot of unexpected developments this week which we do not want to impact on the overall conduct of the case.  

Now, we have on this occasion decided to accommodate the conveniences that have been expressed to us.  But we want to make it clear that we are not going to be put in a position where we cannot make scheduling decisions which we think are necessary for the proper administration of the case.  

Now, we rise for 15 minutes.
