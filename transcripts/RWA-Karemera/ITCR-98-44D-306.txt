MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Could we start with the appearances of the parties please, starting with the Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Representing the Prosecutor is Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; Memory Maposa, appeals counsel; Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; 
Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Ephrem Mutashya, language assistant; two interns: Igor Barilik and Jamet Marion.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Defence, please?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Defence bench today is made up of 
Philippe Larochelle, Nathalie Leblanc, Callixte Nzabonimana, our intern, Erick Sullivan, Élise Legall; and myself, Courcelle-Labrousse. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We would like to welcome you back to the proceedings.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you arrange to administer the oath to the witness, please. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Declaration made by Witness T92 in French)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  You have just taken an oath to tell the Trial Chamber the truth, and we would like to remind you to keep that oath in mind as you testify.  We would like to welcome you to the Tribunal and give you a briefing on what the procedures are here.  

We are happy to note that you are careful in switching on and off your microphone, depending on whether you are speaking.  So continue that practice because if you leave your mike open and there is another one on, it interrupts the interpretation and the recording of your evidence as well as its understanding.  

Regarding the procedures, the Defence which has called you as a witness, will ask you questions to begin with to lead your evidence in-chief.  The Defence is seated on your left.  When the Defence is done with asking you questions, the Prosecution will, in turn, put questions to you.  And the Prosecution is seated on your right in front of the translation booth.  

The translation booths clearly demonstrate that these proceedings are conducted in various languages, so you have to speak slowly and clearly with intervals in between your narration to allow clear interpretation and recording of your evidence.  And if you are going to speak in French and counsel who will lead your evidence will also speak French, that will cause problems.  So you will have to wait until the interpretation in other languages is finished before you can begin to answer.  

Answer all questions put to you by all the parties.  And if you have not understood a question, you may ask for it to be repeated or clarified.  You are a protected witness and if you consider that the answer you may give may disclose your identity, alert the Trial Chamber to take appropriate action.  Give 
brief and direct answers to the questions put to you.  Don't beat about the bush because that makes your testimony long as questions have to be repeated and answers to be repeated as well.  We require you to be courteous to all those present here and they, in turn, are also required to extend the same courtesy to you.  

the Judges may ask you questions any time and as we said, you have to answer all questions.  If a question put to you is not proper, the Trial Chamber will say so.  So that is the briefing we wanted to give you before you start your testimony.  

Yes, I am reminded that I omitted one aspect.  

We conduct these proceedings in both open and closed session.  It is for the Trial Chamber to decide whether you should testify in open session or closed session.  A closed session allows you to mention -- to give any information, even if it may identity you because the public is excluded from such a session and the record made of it is never made available.  

Now, an open session like the one we are in is open to the public and the public is entitled to receive a record of it should they desire to have it.  So we will let you know whether we are in open or 
closed session as we go on.  If we are in open session, be careful not to give any information that may identify you.  So that is the end of the briefing, and we now want to know whether you have understood what we have said, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  I have understood everything.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel.
WITNESS T92, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	I believe you have a form or a sheet already, or if you don't, it will be given to you, a 
	personal identity sheet.  

Could you look through that document and see if it is free of errors.  If it contains errors, then you will have to correct -- make the corrections, if you have a pen there.  And when you are done, kindly sign the document.  
A.	I have made some corrections on this sheet.  There are some typing errors and some corrections as to the content of the document.  Thank you.  
Q.	Well, then.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Could the registry officer take that document if he has signed it.  Has he signed it?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I have not signed the document, but I can sign.
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	If the corrections you have made to the document are legible, please -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we would like to know the corrections made to the form and, if need be, we will go into a closed session for that purpose.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes.  Since I imagine that apart from the typing errors, those corrections have to do with his identity.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, the corrections you made, are they related to your identity?  
A.	No.  No, no, not in my opinion.  
Q.	So, please, tell the Chamber the points on which you have made corrections.  
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  It has to do with my mother's name.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we go into a closed session, Registry?  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 5 to 11] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 4 by Sithembiso Moyo)


























MS. BEN SALIMO:  
We are now in an open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are now in open session, so be careful not to give information of people or places that may be linked to your identity.  If you are not sure of what you are going to say, alert the Trial Chamber.  

Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, do you know whether Callixte Nzabonimana, when he was appointed minister, belonged to a well-known political family in Rwanda? 
A.	A political family, you say?  That confuses me somewhat because that was only the political party in Rwanda, which at the time was the MRND.  Thank you, Madam President.  
Q.	Again, more specifically, his native area, did he come from a well-known family? 
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  To my knowledge, no.  Thank you.  
Q.	As far as you are concerned, was there any reason, I mean a political reason, for President Habyarimana to appoint someone like Callixte Nzabonimana, him being someone from Gitarama, a native of Gitarama?  
A.	Let me answer, Madam President, that there may have been other reasons that Callixte may have had, and I think that this was because of his skills and it was important that these be of benefit to the government.  
Q.	Witness, you were with Callixte Nzabonimana in the political arena in Gitarama at the time 
	of the multiparty era beginning.  Would you be able to tell the Tribunal what was 
	Callixte Nzabonimana's political situation or standing at the time of multipartyism in Gitarama? 
A.	He was the chairman of the MRND in Gitarama.  
Q.	At the advent of multipartyism, what was his political weight in relation to the other leaders in Gitarama? 
A.	He represented -- and I say he was the spokesman of the party in the préfecture of Gitarama, so he was the spokesperson of his party.  Thank you.  
Q.	In Gitarama, who were the leaders of the MDR at the advent of multipartyism? 
A.	At the advent of multipartyism the leaders of the MDR in Gitarama were 
	Prime Minister Dismas Nsengiyaremye, Callixte's older brother, himself, whose name 
	was -- Nyagahima.  I had a lapse in my memory there for a moment, Nyagahima, 
	Shingiro Mbonyumutwa.  I would believe those were the ones.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, if you could assist us with the spellings of those names, please.  We are not familiar with the Kinyarwanda names.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Can you, please, spell them out.  It would be much faster than if you wrote them down.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May I suggest, Madam President, that it would be quicker if the witness wrote those names down and then spell them out.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was saying Nsengiyaremye, which is written N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  Dismas was the 
first name, which is spelt D-I-S-M-A-S.  I mentioned Nyagahima, which is spelt N-Y-A-G-A-H-I-M-A. Nyagahima.  I believe his first name was Faustin, which is spelt F-A-U-S-T-I-N.  I mentioned 
Shingiro Mbonyumutwa and this is spelt -- Shingiro is spelt S-H-I-N-G-I-R-O, and Mbonyumutwa is M-B-O-N-Y-U-M-U-T-W-A.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, if you find it easier to write the names down first, you can do so and then spell them, because there will be a quite a number of spellings.  And if you feel that you need to write them down first or as you go along, you are free to do so.  

Yes, Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Who was Shingiro Mbonyumutwa's father? 
A.	Let me spell that.  Thank you, Madam President.  His father was M-B-O-N-Y-U-M-U-T-W-A, Dominique, spelt D-O-M-I-N-I-Q-U-E.  And he was the first interim president after the 1959 revolution.  I thank you.  
Q.	Witness, do you know one Esdras Mpamo?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
	M-P-A-M-O, spelling for Mpamo.
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I knew Mpamo, a politician of note in the MRND party.  He was a seasoned politician because during the first republic he had been a préfet, he had been an ambassador.  And during the 
	second republic he was appointed bourgmestre of the Masango commune, M-A-S-A-N-G-O, one the communes of Gitarama préfecture.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, when you are spelling a name, slow down.  You are racing a bit and the interpreters sound a bit strained.  So slow down a bit when you are spelling the names.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, a while ago you said that Callixte Nzabonimana was president of the MRND -- the spokesperson of the party at the préfecture level.  Did you, as a politician -- were you in a -- one of 
	his subordinates? 
A.	No, Madam President.  Callixte was a militant and I was also a militant in the party.  That was 
	my choice.  Callixte could not make me change my party.  I could not receive any instructions or orders from him.  We were both militants.  We had to decide what we had to decide to move forward our party.  There was no superior-subordinate relationship between us.  There was not some kind of hierarchy among the militants.  We were all militants.  We had elected him to be our party spokesperson, and that is where it stopped.  If I wanted to leave the party, I could have done so without asking for his opinion.  Thank you.  
Q.	What about someone like Esdras Mpamo, was that the same kind of relationship you had with him? 
A.	That is correct.  Even with Callixte, it was the same thing.  
Q.	When you say Mpamo was a seasoned politician, it is an expression -- it is a hackneyed expression that is -- may not be well understood.  Could you explain more?  
A.	When I say a "seasoned politician", I mean someone with vast experience of politics.  I have mentioned the posts he held in the first and second republics.  You do not just assume such posts anyhow.  So he was there; he had vast experience.  As compared to us, he had a 30-year experience in politics.  That is what I meant, Madam President.  
Q.	Do you know a certain Straton Sibomana? 
A.	Yes, I knew him, Madam President.  
Q.	Did you know his political affiliation in 1994? 
A.	From what I could observe, I never saw Straton adopt the colours of any political party, at least not that of our party.  
Q.	Let me now turn to the events that started on 6th April 1994.  Could you tell the Chamber briefly, Witness, where you were on 6th April 1994, in the evening and the subsequent days?  But without delving into a daily narration of your activities.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And, Witness, we are in open session, so be careful about what you say.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  

If you want me to cite venues, places, and you think that those places could reveal my identity, then we should move into closed session, because the places I am going to cite may have some incidence on my identity.  Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, I think if you just mention your cellule -- where you were -- it will not identify you.  
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  

On 6th April I was at home in Gikondo in Kigali.  And on the 12th I went to Gitarama and I stayed in Gitarama.  Well, I carried out my activities in Gitarama.  I don't think I can go on because if I -- if I were to give a name in relation to my travels, it could identify me.  Thank you.  But I am actually saying that I was in Gitarama.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, when you say "12th", which date are you referring -- which month and year are you referring to?  You just said "12th".  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  Well, since we talked about 6th April 1994, I just went on to say that it was on 12th April 1994.  Thank you.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So in the evening of the 6th you were in Kigali; 6th April.  And then on 12th April you were in Gitarama.  Could explain to the Chamber why you left Kigali and went to Gitarama?  Briefly. 
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  I left Kigali for security reasons.  

On the 9th of April 1994 someone -- my sister-in-law died in my home.  A shot had been fired into 
her head by unknown persons who could not be identified.  So there was fear and panic that overwhelmed the family, and I had to find a solution to place my family in a safe place.  Thank you.  
Q.	Was there any special reason why you decided to go to Gitarama? 
A.	When I got to Gitarama I quickly learned that a government was there.  So I said, "Well, this is great.  Since the government is here, there is security and protection all around."  So Gitarama, to me, was the ideal venue that was protected at that point.  Thank you.  
Q.	Earlier on, you had said that you had a secondary residence in your native commune.  You did not go to settle there?  
A.	No, for the simple reason that I was still afraid of insecurity.  I did not know where the danger could come from.  Prevention was better than cure.  I had to stay in a place where security was relatively better because you could see everybody who was fleeing.  To me, it was ideal.  
Q.	Did you, nonetheless, visit your native commune?  And if you did, why did you do so? 
A.	Yes, I went there for purposes of some activities that I had before, some commercial reasons.  I had a business that I was managing and so I had to go there to collect money; especially with the prevailing times, one had to keep money in a safe place.  The banks were actually operating in Gitarama.  
	Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, I will mention some names and you will tell me whether you know those persons or not.  

In 1994 did you know Jérôme Bicamumpaka? 
A.	No, Madam President.  
Q.	Nonetheless, do you know to what party he belonged in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, because I heard about it, as any other person, on the radio that he had been appointed 
	minister for foreign affairs.  I was told that he was a member of the MDR party.  
Q.	Did you know one Jean-Baptiste Ndayigijimana (sic)? 
A.	Yes, I knew Ndagijimana because he was once bourgmestre of Rutobwe, and since one could know the bourgmestre in the Gitarama constituency, I knew him.  I also learned that in 1994 he had been appointed sous-préfet of Ruhango.  
Q.	Now, if you know, I would like you to tell the Chamber in what month in 1994 he was appointed sous-préfet of Ruhango? 
A.	If I remember correctly, he was appointed in May 1994.  He was a worker of the national bank, and I saw him myself in Gitarama.  I saw him myself.
Q.	Did you also know one Jean-Damascène Ukulikiyeyezu?  I have some trouble with that name.  
A.	Yes, I knew that name.  He was a major, a member of parliament, Jean-Damascène Ukulikiyeyezu.  I know that he was also appointed préfet of Gitarama and that he was also appointed a member -- or, the president of civil defence in Gitarama. 
Q.	Do you know whether he is still alive? 
A.	No, Ukulikiyeyezu was killed.  Well, it is said -- I don't know whether these reports are true -- that he had been killed and his wife's body was exposed at the Gitarama parish for quite some time.  That was after the RPF took over power.  
Q.	Now, if you know, could you tell the Chamber at what date or at what period, approximately, he was killed and under what circumstances.  
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  What I can say is that he had already -- I had already left.  And since people were trying to recover their property, it could be said that Ukulikiyeyezu was picked out from the persons who were returning and taken to Gitarama parish and he died with his wife.  I was -- I don't know about the exact period because I was not there with them.  
Q.	Witness, I would like you to be very clear.  

Now, you say that you had already left.  When was that when you had already left? 
A.	I left Rwanda from the 17th to the 18th -- 17th to 18th July 1994, in the night.  
Q.	Now, you said -- the English says that, "people were trying to recover their property".  Do you mean that people were going back to Rwanda?  I did not quite understand.  
A.	Well, what I mean is that as the RPF advanced in its struggle, people were fleeing, and it was from Kibuye that the -- people who were there.  I can confirm this because I had ********** -- I met ********* somewhere, and he told me what had happened -- that *********** had told everyone.  He was telling everyone with a megaphone to go back home because peace had returned, because the RPF was a new regime and that they had to collaborate with the new regime, and that is precisely when he returned.  

The ****, himself, told me that his father was called up together with his mother and some other persons close to him.  They were taken to the Gitarama military camp.  And what happened after that was a tragedy.  
Q.	So if I properly understand your testimony, from what the ************** told you -- and this is 
	July 1994 -- in July 1994 Major Jean-Damascène Ukulikiyeyezu told the population to return to Rwanda and accept the new regime; is that correct? 
A.	To be specific, Ukulikiyeyezu -- well, what does it mean "to return to Rwanda"?  He was in Kibuye.  People were told to go back to their property.  So there were flights.  Lots of people had come from Kibungo, Kigali, Gitarama, many people from Gisenyi, who were gathered there in Kibuye.  So he asked those people to go back.  That was the situation.  
Q.	What about Dominique Makheli? 
A.	Yes, I know him.  He was a journalist with Radio Rwanda. 
Q.	Do you know what became of him?
A.	I know from the press and even from human rights defence groups, the trial that he had.  It was a protracted trial and he ended up winning his case.  I don't know what happened after.  I don't know whether, after winning his case, he remained in Rwanda or what he may be doing.  I don't know.  
Q.	When you say "human rights defence groups" and Dominique Makheli, what happened? 
A.	Well, I mean that he was a journalist and that journalists are registered with the organisation that takes care of journalists in the world.  They all stood up and insisted that Makheli should have a fair trial.  It was lengthy and the media continued to pick holes in the trial.  There were defects in the procedure but ultimately, he won his trial.  
Q.	Aloys Simba? 
A.	Yes, I know him too.  
Q.	One Marianne, who was alleged to be the president of the MRND in Ruhango? 
A.	Yes, I know her.  She was a militant of the MRND.  So we met, as a matter of fact, in the 
	***********************.  I knew her well.  
Q.	Witness -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But when he says, "Yes, I know her", does that mean that he confirms that she was the president of the MRND in Ruhango? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, she was the president in Ruhango.  Yes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Very well, Witness.  

Now, we move to the essential thing.  You know, do you not, the charges that were brought against you, you and Callixte Nzabonimana in relation to the genocide? 
A.	Yes, Madam President, I know those charges.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  
	You do know that you -- well, you are not accused since you are here as a witness.  Do you know about the meeting that took place in the home of this Marianne in the presence of Jérôme Bicamumpaka, Dominique Makheli, Jean-Baptiste Ndagijimana, Aloys Simba and other persons?  Well, depending on the various versions, what could you tell the Chamber about that meeting? 
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  I formally refute, deny all these false accusations because there was never any such meeting.  Never, I confirm.  
Q.	Witness, are you also aware that you stand accused in courts -- or, it is alleged that together with Callixte Nzabonimana and Major Jean-Damascène Ukulikiyeyezu, you distributed arms in Ruhango?  What do you have to say about that accusation? 
A.	I also deny that accusation.  It is a setup.  It is a false accusation.  It never happened.
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I am sorry to take a little break, but we may have some translations problems.  We need to see.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, did you also know that it is said that you belonged to a crisis committee in Ruhango?  A security committee with Callixte Nzabonimana and other persons, including Marianne, the 
	bourgmestre of Ruhango, and that you allegedly planned and incited the population of that commune to massacre Tutsis? 
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  All of that is fabrication.  These are all lies.  It never existed.  It never happened.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, during the events of 1994 -- first, did you see Callixte Nzabonimana during those events? 
A.	Thank you, Madam President.  From April 1994 until the time when I left, I never saw 
	Callixte Nzabonimana.  
Q.	And you did not see him at a meeting in Ruhango cellule, Rwamagana secteur, Tambwe commune, Gitarama préfecture? 
A.	No, I did not see him.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, can you please tell the Chamber when you came to know, for the first time, that such allegations were being made against you.  
A.	I believe the Court is well aware that I have been here also, and this has been mentioned in 
	another trial.  This has been mentioned and I knew about them.  And, afterwards, I also carried out 
	my own investigations so that I get to know more, and this is why I am able to tell you that this is 
	pure fabrication.  

Let me just add one thing though.  All those who are making those allegations are people who have nothing to lose.  To the contrary, they are people -- there are people who are planning things behind bars and there are people who are saying that, "These are the ones who said this.  They did everything."  So it is very easy for them to blame this on somebody else.  

So now, I am saying, Madam President, I am not in fear of anything, and I do not fear justice.  And proof of that is that I am here.  If I am to be tried in a fair trial, be it here, be it in Rwanda, I believe the conditions are not the same and I know that for my safety, there would be issues.  And the poor lady who went to represent Ngabire, what did she face?  So it is not easy in that country.  But I, if I have a fair trial -- I had been faced with all these people making up against me, what I would want is that 
my name be cleared.  I don't have any blood on my hands for anything that happened in Rwanda.  So I am saying that I am not in fear of justice, and I am here and I am living in a place which is known.  I have not changed my name, and at any time that you want to see me, I would be there.  But all I am saying is that there is a lot of fabrication and this has become very current in Rwanda.  And I can even show you documents, Madam President, if you so wish, where a former prime minister who was minister of national education, prime minister from 1995 to 2000, in February, together with the RPF, once he left Rwanda -- three months after he left Rwanda he was removed and he left also because the situation was untenable, and he too found exile in the United States.  And he is being accused of being a génocidaire.  

Now, can you realise that this is a former prime minister.  When he was in Rwanda, he wasn't accused.  But once he left, he is being -- he's been facing allegations against him, and I think this is very easy for the RPF.  And I think light needs to be shed on this issue.  I am not afraid of justice.  I don't have any blood on my hands, and I don't want my name to be dragged in the mud continuously for nothing.  Thank you, Madam President.  
Q.	Is there any indictment against you? 
A.	As far as I am aware, there is no warrant of arrest issued against me.  
Q.	Have you already come here to testify in another trial?  And in what year was that? 
A.	Yes, I came here, and this was in 2004, yes.  December of 2004, in the Aloys Simba case.  
Q.	The investigators of the Prosecutor or even the Prosecutor himself, did they come to look for you in your country of residence in order to try and find out what your position is? 
A.	No, Madam President, no one has come to meet me.  But I can confirm that I am open.  If someone wants to come and meet me, they would be able to find me.  There is no problem.  Thank you.  
Q.	One last question, Witness.  Do you have anything to say or do you know anything on the conduct of Major Ukulikiyeyezu, Jean-Damascène, during the events of April to July 1994? 
A.	I cannot say anything because, quite simply, we didn't see one another.  You know, all I can say -- well, I didn't ask where he was, but I presumed that he was in Bulinga because that was his residence.  So I presumed he was there.  
Q.	Very well.  I thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, Your Honours, I am done with my examination-in-chief of this witness.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

Prosecution, are you going to cross-examine this witness?
