MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 15th of April 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the

Mr. Robinson, we again wish to defer the subpoena motion until after the mid-morning recess.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine, Mr. President.  

Colonel Renzaho, good morning.

MR. ROBINSON:
I didn't think I'd been promoted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Well, you may now begin, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
	Thank you.
THARCISSE RENZAHO,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, we've had testimony from a witness, ZF, in this case who claimed that a number of military and civilian authorities were members of a secret group called the Friends of the Alliance, or the Abakabozi or Dragons, and you were listed among those who he claimed were a member of those groups.  Is that true? 
A.	No.  I was never a member of the sort of group you just referred to.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'd ask that the registry show document number 8 in my bundle of exhibits to the witness.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, document number 8 is a letter dated the 15th of April 1993 to the prosecutor general, and it's indicated that it's from you.  Do you recognise that? 
A.	I do, Counsel. 
Q.	And can you tell us what is the gist of that letter and what were the circumstances under which you sent it? 
A.	Regarding the contents of the letter, I was sending the letter to the office of the prosecutor at the Kigali court requesting him to conduct relevant investigations on people who were allegedly members of clandestine organisations associated to what was described as the death squadrons, after the report by the international commission of enquiry that had just conducted its work in Kigali from the 
7th of January 1993.  The names were those that appeared in a document that had been found among the population and which was creating an abominable situation among the people with respect to people who were being accused and denounced, whereas they had not been interviewed or given a chance to provide any form of an explanation regarding the allegations against them.  

So I felt that the situation was a difficult one and potentially explosive.  And with regard to the prevailing situation, atmosphere in the country, I felt that honesty and social peace depended on clarification through the relevant legal institutions.  

Regarding the circumstances, maybe I would have a chance to explain that further, but that is how I put the question to the relevant authority because the prosecutor general has the power to enquire into any circumstances that threatens the peace of the people, and even based on complaints by people who came and complained that they had been undressed in public for no reason.  

And this created a very bad political situation, and I asked him to enquire, in which case, if it turned out that some people were involved in criminal cases, then he should arrest those people and make them appear before the relevant courts, but that people who were accused unfairly should be allowed to carry on.  That is what the contents of the letter are.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that that letter be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ781.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ781 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, we've also had evidence that on the 23rd of October 1993 a rally was held at the Nyamirambo stadium at which Froudouald Karamira made the utterance of "Hutu Power".  And I would like to ask you, who was it who applied for permission from the préfecture to hold that rally? 
A.	Counsel, before I answer your question I would like to ask if there's -- additional information with regard to the first question you asked is very necessary.  I have no doubt that the President's bench probably heard about the issues in Rwanda.  But what I would like to add is that, with respect, those alleged organisations which were clandestine in nature were part of the prevailing propaganda in Rwanda that has been ongoing since 1992.  

Yesterday we talked about a letter by Mr. Gasana who was talking about the Interahamwe and Akazu, and the Interahamwe were associated to a group which apparently was clandestine in its operations in view of having people to disappear.  At the same time there was something known as Africa Janvier, and Africa Janvier was talking about death squadrons, claiming that he had attended meetings chaired by the head of state himself.  He was lying.  

Africa Janvier was found in the Kigali prison, and international observers got in touch with him, and he told them his unbelievable story, and that is how that story spread at the international level.  

And, one thing leading to another, we ended up requesting an international investigation, which the Rwandan government approved.  But through some interferences in the document, which I heard about when I heard -- when I heard about it on mission to -- when I was in Canada from the president of the International Human Rights Federation Commission and about people who were on the plane from Kigali at the end of '92.  This must have been around the 5th or 6th of January.  And the investigations were conducted under those circumstances, and I tried to follow it.  And also some things happened.  

So I just wanted to give you that background to tell you that this is not a stand-alone incident, because it is part of a strategy to destabilise a country and accuse people as part of a revolutionary strategy I referred to yesterday and which concretely targeted the deaths of some people, because all of these people who were mentioned -- and I had this confirmation by looking at some documents -- all of the people who are mentioned are either killed, or those who had not been killed are here.  

So clearly it shows you that this matter has to be considered with a lot of seriousness, as it is part and parcel of a revolutionary war which we went through between 1990 and 1994.  Thank you.  

Now, with respect to the second question, you wanted to know who notified us of the meeting of the 23rd of October 1993 consisting of a march towards Nyamirambo stadium in the centre of the stadium.  The answer:  It is the MDR that made application and which associated with other parties in that march, but the application was submitted by the MDR, and we granted it, as usual.  

There was no reason to object to that demonstration, especially as it was -- the only one which was organised on that day as the principal was that.  As a matter of fact, we were -- we tried to stop the organisation of two demonstrations on the same day as that could lead to a clash between the two organisations and affect public order.  So the MDR made application and we granted it. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, turning your attention to the 5th of January 1994, were you present at the CND during the activities that day, which included the swearing-in of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Counsel, I confirm I was present. 
Q.	And was the swearing-in continued until the afternoon for further swearing-in of members of the transitional assembly? 
A.	No.  The ceremony of the 5th of January 1994 comprised the swearing of the president before midday.  And he left stating that the second part would take place in the afternoon.  In the meantime, an incident occurred.  The incident consisted in the refusal or the boycott of the RPF, which did not agree with the list of officials who were supposed to be part of the transitional government.  I'm talking about the members of government and members of the national assembly.  

And that incident continued, and as a result, the second part of the ceremony, which was supposed to be in the afternoon, did not take place. 
Q.	And did anyone block deputies from returning to the CND to be sworn in for the afternoon ceremony? 
A.	As far as I am aware, no.  There was no reason for that.  No.  I didn't get any information to that effect on that day, no. 
Q.	We've had evidence that during the following weeks and months there were efforts made to swear in the broad-based transitional government but it was unable to be sworn in.  During that time, from January and February and March of 1994, was there an escalation or a decrease in tension and violence within Kigali? 
A.	Thank you for the question, Counsel.  Granted, from the failed ceremony of the 5th of January 1994, there was rather a stalemate -- a talk of war between the president, who wanted to institute -- to set up the institutions and the problems that led to a political stalemate and the results of divisions within some political parties and a certain involvement of the RPF, who wanted people that it approved of.  That is the way we should understand things.  
And from then on there was never, ever going to be an agreement on the list of people who were supposed to be members of the official institutions.  And this stalemate was the result from -- was the result of the refusal of names which were proposed by a responsible party but which were turned down by the RPF, which felt that it had more authority to vet lists which had to be introduced for the admission of proposals made by parties with regard to members.  And so this led to a stalemate, resulting in a situation, an explosive security situation, because hardly five minutes went by without a gunshot here and there in the city, and then people would start being murdered.  

So as from that date there was an escalation in insecurity among the people.  And the stalemate, far from bringing resolve, got worse up to the time when officers of the RPF entered -- who had come to Kigali to take part in the transitional institutions, chose to withdraw from Kigali quietly to the 
Mulindi headquarters.  And from there the RPF -- indeed, the RPF no longer hid this -- the RPF felt that it was in a state of war, and they withdrew as from the 26th of February 1994.  

I hope I answered your question.  But I would say things were getting worse, and we never got to a position where the parties concerned understood -- reached an understanding in view of implementing the agreements. 
Q.	Now, we've had evidence that on the 31st of December 1993 the RPF battalion arrived in Kigali and were housed at the CND.  During the period after they arrived, did the insecurity in Kigali increase?  And if so, was that due to the arrival of the RPF battalion? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I believe -- and this is the truth -- the third battalion of the RPF arrived Kigali on the 28th of December 1993.  And it was an extraordinary event, as the people were out on the streets to welcome them to Kigali.  And it is true that all through the war the city underwent lots of permanent insecurity at times.  Some periods were worse than others.  But it is also true that with the setting up of the RPF battalion in Kigali, insecurity escalated, and maybe there's a reason for that.  

The setting up of the battalion occurred after the signing of the Kigali agreements -- the agreement for Kigali.  With regard to national responsibility, I believe that it was a lot of weakness from our part, because we were unable to understand what was happening, because to understand what was happening we had to be part of the decision-making organs -- bodies and have information and also have the means of action.  

So with the KWSA agreement, it was the UNAMIR that had to ensure security and that sought assistance of the gendarmarie company.  And programmes for patrolling the city or any other action for security could only have been ordered by the UNAMIR.  

Yesterday maybe we talked a little bit about it, and maybe I should seize this opportunity to talk about it again, but when the RPF army came in at the same time as the Rwandan army was consigned to specific regions of the city, the RPF armies had no restrictions with regard to where they went and a specific problem with respect to identification.  And this indeed created incidents here in the city and, as if by chance, an incident which occurred at the rue marché.  And the soldiers got there and the people panicked, and that -- that was very close to something very, very bad.  The same thing for 
Nyabago (sic)  and also for Nyabugogo roundabout.  

And you had incidents here and there to the extent that, not having the possibility of acting with regard to the situation, I proposed to the minister of interior -- and giving him a broad explanation on the situation that was prevailing, I requested that a meeting at least of the officials should be held so that the officials be able to hear themselves the comments from those who represented the population, particularly the members of cellules, conseillers themselves, concerning the situation, if there was no way of taking measures to coordinate things such that the specific authority would have the opportunity to make some suggestions in order to contain the situation.  Because things were getting really, really bad.  The situation of panic was escalating and the atmosphere was bad.  And this meeting effectively took place at the Kigali-ville préfecture on the 3rd of February,  February 1994.  

This meeting was co-chaired by the minister of interior and the minister of defence.  And we had the commander of the forces present and even the commander of the Kigali secteur.  And I'm talking of Dallaire and Marchal.  And these were present and so heard the statements made by the population and the questions that were asked and talking about repression.  

And what I read in Dallaire's book was not satisfactory to me.  He felt that the population was not understanding the stakes of the presence of UNAMIR in Kigali.  The problem was something else.  It was how to help the public authorities to follow the movements of the RPF from the CND outwards, because they were not only stopping at Kigali.  

And so we -- we had a difficult situation from the installation of the RPF soldiers in Kigali, and more so because the fact their arrival once again fell directly, squarely in the RPF military strategy.  Because what are we witnessing here?  We're now witnessing the installation of battalions such that later 
on -- well, those who know the Greek history anthology know the story of the Trojan horse.  That was the Trojan horse strategy which was used from the lot, the nucleus that was there in Kigali.  And the RPF just continued increasing its numbers there in Kigali, using tricks and atrocities here and there, and I could name a few.  

But that was the facts.  And they continued filtering in equipment into Kigali.  And the people, Rwandans, had known one another.  They lived -- they lived -- were close one to the other.  And the neighbours, whatever is in your house, the next person knows what is in your house, and so everything was known.  

And so recruitments were done there on the spot, recruitments of young people who, on the pretext of going to share a glass or drink with friends at CND, in a very subtle manner they were kept there and trained and sent back into the neighbourhoods.  It was not only people who came from Kigali.  We also saw people from other préfectures, particularly from Butare, Bugesera, Kigali-rural, Kibungo, all over.  

And so, to maybe complete this picture, as most soldiers who had come, that battalion were either from Kigali or had relatives in Kigali.  They were authorised to visit members of their families in their homes.  And -- well, it's true.  I mean there was even a witness who was courageous enough to expose this.  Relatives of this RPF soldier who had other close relatives or friends, whatever the case, who were members of the RPF took young people who, from some families, were receiving uniforms and -- by nights.  And on the next day vehicles could go to Mulindi.  And under the cover of transporting firewood, these vehicles could bring in fighters and exchange them for recruits who were also supposed to go back and have training at Mulindi.  

So we had the situation which led to strengthen the number of RPF elements in Kigali.  And these operations were not invisible to the population.  And we, therefore, witnessed an increase in the number of RPF fighters in the neighbourhood and which was obvious towards the end of February.  We even witnessed a bizarre phenomenon where a drinking spot in a -- in a neighbourhood in Nyamirambo was totally distinguished.  You had drinking places for Tutsi young people, as it is for the RPF, and others which were not open to others, and things like that.  I spent the month of March going from one place to the other within the secteur to try to bring people together.  

And so we gave the floor to the population to enable them to express themselves, and we even recorded statements of some people, which we have in Radio Rwanda, records where people very publicly denounced the crystallisation of passion between the different parties in the population.  We invited everybody to be quiet, to be calm, to peace.  

But despite all that, there was intense activity of mobilisation that was ongoing.  And I didn't think that particularly at the meeting which took place at the Kicukiro parish where there was a contingent of refugees and officials who came after, whom I had met with Colonel Marchal.  We met them on our way as we were going to call on the people to stop people from property that was going to be burnt, because we had to carry out pacification meetings.  I thought that things were calm, and UNAMIR was saying that they were doing everything to protect people.  But they went after us to say that we were misleading them and that terrible things were going to happen.  
Now, these are facts.  And so you understand that at the time when we were trying to bring some calm, to disperse all tension, to get people to promote collaboration and hierarchical solidarity, as was necessary in time -- at the time, others came in and rather whipped up emotions and sort of poured fuel on the fire, and there was indecision.  

And so, in short, with the battalion, the RPF battalion at the CND, this caused a rather -- a process of crystallisation of passions and which was going to culminate in an explosion in the days thereafter of violence.  We did all that we had to do, but war's accidents which occurred later are known to you.  But that situation was real.  The backup -- this background was real.  I want to confirm and concur about that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if the witness can be shown Exhibit D. NZ178 and 179.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, looking at Exhibit D. NZ178 first, do you recognise that? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And can you tell the Chamber what that is? 
A.	Thank you very much, Counsel.  This is a report, the minutes of a meeting, a meeting which I attended, a meeting that was convened by the joint chief of staff who died with the president.  And I think it was on the 29th of March 1994.  

And there is a cover letter accompanying the minutes of that meeting to the minister of defence who was the authority in charge of defence, in charge of maintaining security.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	And what was the project that was discussed at that meeting? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I believe there was no specific project, so to say, to this project.  But, rather, it was results that flowed from a discussion because initially it was clearly a global thought process on the security situation in which we found ourselves.  

We have just talked about the presence of RPF, which was increasing its ranks and that had reached about 4,000 by the month of January.  Reliable information was available, since the UNAMIR intelligence services states such information.  And concomitantly I also mention this:  The presence of UNAMIR was a good thing.  But again the transition organs were supposed to be put in place as soon as possible but which was not the case.  But again, it was nonetheless a force to reckon with, a force that was covering KWSA.  This was present in Kigali.  

And so you also have the different military camps, the army, the gendarmerie there in Kigali.  And so 
at the time there were three armies gathered in Kigali.  So the global situation was divided.  At the time of this meeting, on the date of this meeting, the 29th of March, we had gone through all the various episodes of failures, of initiatives, blunders carried out by eminent members of the 
international community trying to put in place the transitional institutions.  

All these blunders visibly were due to the RPF.  Most of those who led these missions, these reconciliation missions, noticed it very, very clearly.  I was talking particularly to the 
minister of foreign affairs of this country who did not hide his disappointment when he tried to assess the issue of the intransigent attitude of the RPF and they would not listen.  

I also talked about the eminent personality who came to Kigali to try to bring parties to sit down together to the same table and he failed.  Things did not work.  And the last initiative was certainly that which failed or crushed on the 28th of March concerning a proposal which had been accepted by both parties initially, parties which had no problems, MDR and PL parties, who were supposed to implement this decision.  

And so the diplomatic corps, under the guidance, the leadership, of the secretary general in Kigali, decided to go and meet the RPF leadership in Mulindi to get them to accept the compromise of giving a seat to the CD party, which was clamouring for the agreements to be able to sign them, and concerning political ethics and which had become an insurmountable obstacle.  And, once again, they witnessed a failure.  

So the impasse was there.  And I was telling you a few minutes ago that when the RPF officials left Kigali on the 26th of February to get back to Mulindi, it was just a matter of saying that they were at war.  The prospective of a war was more -- was more palpable, was more concrete there in Kigali, considering these incidents which we had just witnessed.  And apart from the incidents of -- incident of Gatabazi, Mutagabaza (sic), all the killings, we faced various attacks, grenades.  

I spent the month of March trying to calm down the population.  And as if all those incidents are not sufficient, on the 30th of March RPF soldiers killed (inaudible) in the Biryogo secteur in Nyamirambo.  And so the Biryogo secteur witnessed killings, killings which sparked off a lot of violence.  And I think there were four people killed.  There were refugees who were killed.  

I think the situation, which finally became unmanageable -- until the 6th we were occupied handling this situation in Biryogo secteur, which was a situation that was gone out of hand.  And so you can understand, therefore, from the general trend, the war was cropping up and was going to break out right there on the horizon.  So the question arose, exactly what do we do?  What can we do to handle the situation?  

During the period when things were crystallising, strategic positions were held by UNAMIR authorities.  If a war broke out in the city, it was certainly going to carry away many people.  And so no measures had been taken to put people in certain shelter to grant some protection.  What we wanted to do if we wanted to put people in a certain area of shelter, how are we going to feed them, provide water?  There were problems that we were facing.  Were we just going to go out there like sheep that are running astray?  And going to where?  

And so we discussed this issue lengthily, and we concluded that, since we cannot know when exactly this thing is going to happen, also the thing to do was subscribe to the idea put forward by other armies and which exists in western armies for a long, long time, particularly as part of the psychology of nuclear wars.  They had a series of installations and resources put aside to step in inside of the population when you have such an outburst.  And so this is what happened within the framework of 
civil defence.  

And what I am telling you here tallies exactly with the thoughts that we had at that time, considering that if a war breaks out in Kigali, what would we be doing?  Of course, it would affect the population, and what would the population do?  And so the thoughts were supposed to be taken to the political level for which we were supposed to have and find the resources to address the situation.  

And so clearly I just shared with you the philosophy that underlay the drafting of this report, which does not expose everything but that which just gives you a summary of what we discussed concerning this issue.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Colonel Renzaho, we are wondering whether it is possible to make explanations a bit more concise.  I know you have been trying to respond fully to the questions put by counsel, but maybe if you listen to the questions more carefully you may be able to find a more concise way of responding to the issues he's trying to elucidate for the trial.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, with respect to that document, D. NZ178, was the general staff of the army proposing some form of civil defence be instituted in Kigali? 
A.	Thank you very much, Counsel.  I believe the document is explicit in itself.  It's a report.  It was not an order for operations to be carried out from the high command.  And concerning the préfecture of Kigali, that's not what's defined here.  That was not a manifestation of a directive of the préfecture.  

So this is a report of that meeting, a report that was forwarded to the political authorities from the minister of defence and security.  The process could continue until government takes the necessary measures.  But no directive -- it's not a directive.  It's not an order for operations to be carried out.  And so we have no element from which I could do whatsoever in terms of defence and security, especially when we're talking about a purely military issue.  It has to do with the defence of the territory.  It's not a 
matter -- it's not of civilians.  It was a matter of the army.  Thank you.  
Q.	And take a look at Exhibit D. NZ179, which is also in front of you.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  So tell the Chamber what that document is.  And try to do it briefly.
A.	Here we are dealing with the transmission of a list of persons to be able or qualified to receive the necessary training for civil defence in case that became necessary.  These persons were supposed to be convened, after a decision of the government, by the army, and the joint chiefs of staff could appoint those who were maybe the head of the military in Kigali and who'd have authority to chair all measures that have to do with security in Kigali.  

And so I gave this list to the joint chiefs of staff who were supposed to wait for the political decision to do the work in its own sphere.  That is all that it means.  That's what it's about. 
Q.	And did the MRND party have any involvement in preparing that list or suggesting the names of people who should be on that list? 
A.	No.  No, because it was not the MRND that was leading the country.  I was the representative of the 
public administration, préfet of the Kigali préfecture.  I had administrative units under me.  I do not see how the MRND could have been intervening more than the MND (sic), PSD and maybe from any -- or any other party, because I just did it within the framework of the structure of the administration because that structure existed at the time.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	And by the 6th of April 1994, was the project of civil defence implemented? 
A.	Absolutely not. 
Q.	Now, were you aware of any plan to exterminate the Tutsis by the 6th of April 1994?
A.	I was not aware of any such project at all.  And I think you did well.  You prepared the terrain with what we've been talking about since yesterday.  That is a clear indication of the fact that we were along the pathway to ensuring that things worked at best to bring peace and take care of the Rwandan population.  That was it.  We were not in a criminal pathway.  Thank you very much.  
Q.	Were lists of Tutsis ever compiled, to your knowledge? 
A.	As far as I am aware, I know no list of Tutsis who had to be ill-treated.  As a matter of fact, I know nothing at all with that respect.  

Now, I can't be answerable about an individual with respect to his neighbour or a splinter group and so on and so forth.  But I know absolutely nothing about those lists.  And these documents were certainly found in archives here, and it is evidence to the fact that had there been a list for killings, many things happen here and many people have come here.  I believe that that list exists in the imagination of -- in the minds of people.  In my capacity as the préfet of Kigali, I never knew anything about that list.  
Thank you. 
Q.	Were you a member of any joint criminal enterprise with the three Accused here to exterminate Tutsis? 
A.	No.  No.  And the question you just asked is relevant because I have been charged in an indictment before this Tribunal, and this indictment is grounded on joint criminal enterprise.  Unfortunately, what I noticed during the trial is that I did not see any member who, along with myself, could have been involved in a joint criminal enterprise.  Among the people mentioned, there is none among your clients found here.  Therefore, I believe that there is no case, and I was in no joint criminal enterprise with anybody and, in any event, not with your clients here present. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And I want to ask you about your contacts with Joseph Nzirorera.  Can you tell us, first of all, how it was that you first came to know him.
A.	I came to know him when he was a member of cabinet, and I believe I saw him in late -- the 
late '70s or early '80s when I was at Kanombe garrison when he came there.  We welcomed him in officer's mess, and I had a chance to talk with him.  That was the first time.  Subsequently I got to be acquainted with him.  I wasn't that -- we're not related.  We used to see each other in family -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm not too sure, Mr. President, what the witness's -- the last part of the witness's answer was.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you repeat the last part of your answer for the interpreters, please.
A.	Maybe I spoke too quickly.  What I would like to say is that I knew him, that is true.  In the circumstances I talked about in Kanombe I knew him as a personality, and he was a member of government, except around the end he was no longer a member of cabinet.  And I knew him like that.  I have nothing further to add.  He wasn't somebody I could go and joke with or ask out for a drink.  Maybe I could have done so, but I didn't have a chance to do so.  But I knew him as a government personality.  He was a member of government and minister for public works.  I knew him like that.  I don't have any further information to give. 
Q.	From the time he became secretary general of the MRND in July of 1993 until the 6th of April 1994, did you have any contact with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  Maybe during meetings that were held while I was a member of the crisis committee.  But I spent only very little time in that meeting, as I had administrative duties.  And I saw him, but I -- I did not organise or hold meetings with political officials, and on the 12th everyone had left Kigali.  So I didn't see him under any other circumstances.  Because I remember that on the 8th political party leaders met to agree on modalities for setting up an interim government.  I believe that I went there for a little while. 
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, I think either you misunderstood my question or it was wrongly interpreted.  But, in any event, I was asking you between the period of July of 1993 and the 6th of April 1994, between those two dates.  So it's not necessary right now for you to tell us anything that happened after the 6th of April.  We are going to come to that.  But I'm asking you during the time between July of 1993 and the 6th of April 1994 whether you had any contact with Joseph Nzirorera.
A.	No. 
Q.	Okay.
A.	As far as I'm aware, no. 
Q.	Now, do you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I know him very well. 
Q.	And what about Édouard Karemera? 
A.	I also know him. 
Q.	And during the period of time prior to the 6th of April 1994 when they were officers of the MRND, did you have any contact with them? 
A.	Counsel, to be specific, I believe I must tell the Trial Chamber that I was a member of the 
national synthesis committee that was carrying out its work during that time and that I worked with 
Édouard Karemera, and Mathieu Ngirumpatse was also a member of that commission.  I saw them there but within the framework of our political duties.  What special thing did I have to do?  Because I was an administrative staff.  I know that I worked with Édouard Karemera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse in the national synthesis commission from -- the commission was set up on the 1st after the 5th July -- let me see -- 1990.  And so we worked on that project until when the draft documents were submitted in 1991 leading to the multiparty constitution in 1991 and the legal instruments on political parties and so on and so forth.  

But that was work.  But within the framework of the party I was not in a situation to go and see them.  I had nothing to do with them.

1015H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	During the period when the political parties were applying to hold rallies, or when there were clashes among the youth wings of political parties, did you have any occasions to speak with Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Édouard Karemera? 
A.	Not in any particular manner, because the situation I stated yesterday happened, that is to say, clashes between political parties through their youth wings.  But I cannot see the peculiarity, the special thing that could have led me to go and see especially the higher ranking official officers of the party, because you had party officers at the préfectoral level, especially the person to whom I sent a letter which you presented before the Court yesterday.  These were people who came -- to whom problems could be presented.  But to go to the high-ranking officers of the party -- party, I believe that's not something I did. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  

Now, I want to turn your attention to the 6th of April in the evening.  Can you tell me where you were on the evening of April 6th, 1994? 
A.	I was at home, my house.  I had just returned from work.  I was at home in Kanombe.  My house was in the Nonko cellule in Nyarugunga commune in Kanombe.  An incident happened when I had just returned home.  I believe that the entire family was there and we were about to have -- we were having dinner.  Thank you.  
Q.	How far was your residence from the president's residence? 
A.	About a hundred members -- metres, maybe less.  Sorry, 8 -- about 800 metres, maybe less. 
Q.	And how far was your residence from the military Camp Kanombe? 
A.	From my house to the fence of the barracks, about 350 metres.  
Q.	So did you hear any explosions on the night of the 6th of April? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I heard two huge explosions with -- which lit up the area, including the -- the interior of the house.  So I felt something strange had happened.  I didn't understand, and I was in no position to even comprehend what happened.  Yes, I heard two explosions. 
Q.	Did you have a telephone at your home? 
A.	Unfortunately, no.  And it is something I have always been asked to explain.  I had no telephone, because when I transferred from -- when I moved out from Kigali to Kanombe, it required certain things to be done and had requested that a telephone line should be established.  But the telephone service, that is, Rwandatel, had promised that they were going to do it.  And after the 6th of -- of April they -- I still had no telephone.  People didn't want to believe it, and I even had to take witnesses to say it.  But the truth is I didn't have a telephone. 
Q.	When did you learn that President Habyarimana had been killed? 
A.	Thank you.  I heard about it in the morning.  In the morning, because, at the time I was leaving home, I met soldiers who were living in the neighbourhood, and we discussed and they told me that apparently it was the president who had been killed.  

But prior to that I had listened to the radio, and there was a communiqué over the radio to the effect that the head of state on return from mission had been shot down.  I had no further information, but I continued to chat -- continue -- continued with these soldiers to the Kanombe barracks to get more information.  And it is the commander of the Kanombe barracks who briefed me on what had happened.  Thank you. 
Q.	Did you go to the préfecture office on the morning of the 7th of April?
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And what did you find there when you arrived? 
A.	I met the police who were on guard.  I also met people who had sought refuge there at night.  We didn't have many people as the office was still closed and the civil servants had not yet come to work.  There weren't many people.  So the -- the city was practically paralysed.  I indeed had to personally call my private secretary.  I sent a police vehicle to go and collect him.  But, from Kanombe to the préfecture, I could already have -- I already had noticed a lot of things.  Did -- did I answer your question? 
Q.	Yes.  

Now, were there some Tutsis that you found at the préfecture office who wanted to take refuge there? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  I talked to you about two people that I met there.  It was the general manager of the ministry of the interior whom I -- I knew, and another former diplomat who had converted to business.  Subsequently, during the day many refugees came to the préfecture.  When I went to the office later on, I met many refugees there.  
Q.	And what was your instructions to -- as to whether or not the refugees would be allowed to take shelter in the préfecture office? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  I asked the staff to provide accommodation, and we provided them almost the entire office, because I have always been blamed for organising meet -- meetings.  But meetings were held in the hall; whereas, the offices had been occupied by the refugees.  No secret could have transpired in the préfecture.  So they received accommodation, and the little means that we had, we accommodated them.  
Q.	Did there come a time on the morning of the 7th of April that you left the préfecture office, and if so, where did you go? 
A.	Thank you.  I -- I indeed left the office but was around a little before 10 o'clock.  Probably five minutes to ten.  In any case, around 10 a.m. I left the office and I went to the army command post because I had to get information about where the officers' meeting was going to be held.  I had heard information when I went to the Kanombe barracks from the Kanombe barrack commander, having heard information that there would be a meeting of officers and he felt that the -- or the meeting could be held at the army staff headquarters, to ask them exactly.  So I went there to the barracks to ask them where exactly the meeting was going to be held.  So the officer on duty told me that the meeting hall was too small and that he felt that the people in attendance would be many and that they were going to try to make arrangements in the cinema hall of the ESM and that that is where the meeting would be held.  So I left the -- I left the -- there and went to the ESM.  
Q.	What took place at the ESM? 
A.	Firstly, I tried to identify the conveners of the meeting, because I had no -- no attire to attend that meeting.  I didn't know in what capacity I was going to attend that meeting.  If it had to be the -- the service heads of the national gendarmerie, the commanders of the operational sectors, or the army, I was none of those.  

However, I felt that considering the prevailing crisis -- crisis, I needed it -- to be told exact -- what exactly was expected of me.  My worry, of course, was the population.  What was going to happen to them in all of -- in that situation?  So I identified the officers who were organising the meeting.  I saw
General Ndindiliyimana, Colonel Bagosora, and I asked them if I could attend the meeting.  They granted me permission to attend, and that is how I attended the meeting.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1121H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Robinson, we have decided that we will be issuing the subpoena.  And the documents will probably be filed before the close of business today. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, can you please tell us what decisions were taken at the meeting at ESM on the
	7th of April.
A.	Counsel, let me answer your question.  Thank you.  I would, however, not be exhaustive with respect to the decisions taken at that meeting, but I recall three which are salient.  The first decision is that the meeting decided to give responsibility to some officers during that period of a vacuum -- power vacuum and that those officers were in a crisis committee.  

The second decision was to charge the director of cabinet of the ministry of national defence to get in touch with political parties for them to meet as soon as possible in order to find an -- a solution to the crisis in view of setting up of an interim government to discuss with the RPF to solve the crisis.  
And the third decision was to ask the various unit commanders to do everything in their power to restore order in the units, as well as to restore disciplined -- discipline and everything in their power to restore public order and tranquility.  

In that regard I was expected, as was the case with all préfets in the country, to take the necessary measures to restore public order and tran -- tranquility, including administrative measures.  And these were the -- the administrative measures which concerned me that I executed.  It was also understood and sought that we should be in a position to appeal to the nation for calm and quiet, considering the circumstances.  

Those are the few decisions I can tell the Trial Chamber off-the-cuff.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  And were you appointed to be a member of the crisis committee? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  But I was appointed as an auxiliary to Colonel Muberuka, who was in charge of security in Kigali. 
Q.	Can you tell us what you did after that meeting? 
A.	The same day? 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	After the meeting I was part of a team of officers who were assigned a duty to draft a pacification message that was going to be addressed to the nation.  So I worked in that team to draft that message until around 2 p.m., when General Dallaire came and told us that the RPF had left the CND and had gone on the office -- offensive.  That's it.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  And what did you do at that time? 
A.	What I did.  We had just completed the task assigned us and we had submitted the document to General Rusatira, who had to do what was to be done for the rest -- for -- with the document.  I went to my office, where I noticed a -- a drastic situation; that is to say, the office was being filled up by refugees.  There was a very little number of our -- of my workers who had come for work, very few people.  So I got a report from my secretary, whom I had assigned a duty to get in touch with the authorities of the commune of Kicukiro, Kacyiru.  

	In fact, when I was returning, I met the bourgmestre of Kacyiru who had fled to the préfecture, and I knew that the situation was getting out of control.  As when Nyarugenge, the secretary -- secretary had tried to get in touch with the bourgmestre and the conseiller -- and the report which he submitted to me was not reassuring.  Many of them did not respond to the call.  The préfet of Nyarugenge commune was not available and many conseillers did not respond to the call.  

On the whole, it was a very worrying situation, and when I saw the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, I told myself things were very dangerous.  I was running the risk of no -- of no longer having them under control.  And as a matter of fact, I had no control any longer on the 7th, because the Kacyiru commune was out of the network.  The Kicukiro commune alone, from there only the Kimisange conseiller came.  I didn't see the others.  And I didn't have any information from the other secteurs.  So it was quite drama -- dramatic -- disastrous.  

I don't know if I can carry on with regard to that day, because it -- I sent a little message to announce that it was not complete disorder, that there were still some officials.  And the message was appealing to the people to remain calm and to avoid taking advantage of the disruptions or -- or the chaos, or the absence of authorities to attack neighbours or hurt others and to try to abide by the instructions that were being given.  That is what was done on the 7th.  Thank you.  
Q.	Did you also make arrangements for a meeting to be held on the 8th of those officials of the préfecture that couldn't attend? 
A.	Yes.  Indeed, Counsel.  Considering the report I just made, I asked my collaborator to -- to confirm a meeting that ought to have held the following day and to try to contact the bourgmestre who had not responded to his call, as well as the conseiller, to inform them that I was going to hold a security council meeting which exceptionally would include the conseiller of the secteur.  Because my feeling was that the -- that the absence of some -- a certain number of bourgmestres -- I mean, if there was only one who had fled who no longer had the control over his commune was an indication.  It was giving me a picture of the situation throughout the secteur.  And I wasn't sure either that I was going to be able to bring together the usual cadres.  

In any case, I spent out the message for a meeting the following day on the 8th at 9 a.m.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us, turning to that meeting itself, what decisions were taken at that meeting? 
A.	Thank you.  On the 8th we -- well, I tried to garner information from people who -- from among the population in order to have a grasping of what the prevailing situation was.  My utmost concern was to see all -- globally how the people were going to face the situation and also to organise, to the best of our ability, as many people as possible to deal with the emergencies, because there were many emergencies, you must understand.  

Now, in terms of decisions -- we felt that the situation was moving at a fast pace and was very dangerous and that we had to organise ourselves to keep track of them.  And that is how we set up a crisis cell, including the little amount of people who were present, including the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, who could no longer run matters in his commune.  

In addition to those -- to -- to that, there was an extremely urgent matter, that of refugees we had to take care of, because those who had come to the préfecture were a clear indication of what was happening elsewhere all over the commune.  And those people had nowhere else to go.  
As a matter of fact, many of -- we thought many might not have been able to come to those places where they would be welcomed.  And those camps for them, you know, were even difficult because we didn't plan to organise them.  And I already mentioned this with -- to you with respect to civil protection.  So my feeling, what I felt, was that it was necessary to have a team that would be in charge of receiving and identifying the refugees.  

Now, where would we do that, because -- maybe I will come back to this later on.  But in any event, it was difficult to go about the entire Kigali préfecture.  In any case, we had to grant -- give responsibilities to people who were to be in charge of these issues.  And the chief of service of social affairs, I knew where he lived.  He had been in an accident before, and since I was unable to get hold of anybody to replace him, I asked that he should be made to understand the -- that the gravity of the situation forced me to have him come over and do something. 

He also -- I also had noticed that people had panicked -- the people had panicked and were scattering in all directions -- and that at that stage roadblocks had been set up in an anarchical manner.  And firstly, in the parts where combats had broken out in the north and southeast parts of Kigali and with the RPF offensive in the afternoon, those roadblocks were -- became widespread all over Kigali, and nobody had any control over them, and that, in any event, people were leaving the city.  

And it was, therefore, urgent, and so I told myself that the earlier the better.  Any waiting could engender any further problems of drama.  There could be piling of persons there, and that would cause more damage, particularly with the arrival of the RPF which had started coming in as from that evening.  We, therefore, had to organise services to evacuate those persons from the town.  

So what -- how did we handle this?  We found it necessary to provide safe conducts, laissez-passers for them.  And in case there were many they would -- we should constitute a corridor and get an escort to show them out of town.  So our team sat down to do that work and enabled the population to leave.  

Other measures that were necessary had to do with supplies in the interests of this -- of Kigali town, which is a landlocked town.  From the moment you close entrances, the town is totally closed down.  So we had to organise ourselves and find ways and means of supplying the town.  I was lucky I had had the opportunity of working with a team of traders who were transporting foodstuff into the town.  We worked together sometime ago, and so I looked up one of them, one of these groups, and fortunately, they accepted to cooperate with us, and we simply had to come to an agreement with the gendarmerie and come up with escort teams or squads to help those people to leave.  

But first of all, we had to organise and decide who was going to handle that work.  I can assure you there was nothing I could do.  Nevertheless, that service was done concerning logistics and supplying Kigali town.  

But there was another very urgent problem, and this had to do with water supply and, for as much as possible, maintain communication lines, maintain electricity power supply.  And since my -- my -- my staff was not very -- very available -- they had run into some difficulties - I, therefore, had to resort to ÉLECTROGAZ services, to obtain specialised staff and put them at the disposal of the préfecture to work towards making water available so that supplies are directed towards the centre of town where many people had already found refuge.  

So, in broad strokes, these are decisions which were taken, teams that were put in place and that were at the disposal of the crisis -- crisis committee in order to help the population.  That is it.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  Was a decision also taken at that meeting to distribute some weapons to people? 
A.	It is very difficult to -- to -- no.  No.  The answer is no.  It was very difficult to reconcile needs and objectives at the same time.  No. 
Q.	Were there some weapons distributed to people from the ministry of defence after that meeting? 
A.	No.  
Q.	It's -- 
A.	No.  No.  Maybe that would require some additional information.  All along I have talked about the meeting on the 8th.  Nobody is interested in that.  But let me tell you, the issue of weapons was not
	on -- on the table.  And during the meeting -- and even with the participation of a UNAMIR soldier who only came and told me, "Please, just manage, find your way out, try to do something.  We don't -- we cannot really support you."  And things like that.  And so there was that there were many people.  It was a public thing.  I don't think we could have had any clandestine meetings -- or the issue of weapons at the meeting of the 8th did not take place.  And I am here.  I've -- I spent very, very nasty times here in this -- in this Tribunal.  

Weapons, we only made talk about them on the 16th.  Maybe we will get there.  But for the day of the 8th, there was no issue about weapons.  And I think it is true, that is correct, it is accurate, we did not talk about it.  And the talk about weapons, no, we could not talk about it.  We did not have any weapons to distribute.  That's also only proper.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	Thank you.  Were there any representatives of political parties in attendance at the meeting of the 8th? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Were there any Interahamwe present at the meeting on the 8th? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, you talked about roadblocks that had been erected by members of the population without permission of the authorities.  What steps did you take to deal with that problem? 
A.	The first thing is that at that meeting I asked participants to do all to take over the situation at a time when things had deteriorated very, very badly.  And I asked that the communal authorities should try to regain control wherever that was possible, because Kacyiru was no more able to have contact with his administrators.  It -- with his subjects, it was impossible.  Kicukiro as well.  For him, I had totally lost contact with him.  Nyarugenge, I tried to know what had happened to him.  I was expecting to hear from him any time, but he only showed up much later.  And so the staff that was available was, in short, a few conseillers that were available, and some participants, some usual participants who attended the security council of Kigali town.  But all of them were not there.  I already said this yesterday.  

And so the first thing which I asked from the local authorities was to try to have a hold over the situation.  But that was what they could not do.  Because the situation had become so dynamic, things had gone volatile so fast -- provoking movements helter-skelter, populations that were going all over the place.  They -- they could not.  And, therefore, I asked that we should -- they should try -- they should do all they could to try to contain the situation.  That is what we -- we could do, because those roadblocks were not ordered by anybody.  But that is the problem.  And I think maybe we will get there subsequently.  

But the situation was -- was such that things had gone adrift and authorities had had nothing else to do than to try to catch the train which was already out of the train station or was -- things were already out of control and they finally could not -- that was the situation.  Thank you. 
Q.	Did you have communal policemen under your authority? 
A.	Yes.  I had communal police available.  
Q.	And were you -- did you give them any instructions, or were they able to do anything to help to stop the violence in Kigali? 
A.	I will try to answer very succinctly your question, which to my mind is an ocean of problems -- to -- to -- to clarify the judges.  We had a police force -- that is correct -- 200-man strong, only about a hundred hard weapons.  These policemen did not have any camp, and the modus operandi was through decentralisation, because the policemen were deployed all over the commune and the secteur to help the local authorities to do their work, but for a small number that was at the préfecture, for needs arising.  That is information which you need to know.

Now, regarding the events of the night of the 6th breaking 7th -- took unawares a number of policemen in their places of work.  These staff, or very few of them, could reply -- could answer "present" when the préfecture called upon them.  

And on the 8th I -- I indeed saw them, and to my greatest surprise I could only gather 42 policemen.  The situation being a very, very urgent and serious one, we had to do all to avoid any centralisation that we wanted to do, because the police force was distributed to serve the local authorities, and so we had to help, and that was the instruction that was given, help the local authorities to restore order in their respective space of influence or turfs.  

And since the conseillers had -- were giving orders to the policemen that were available on the 8th, the conseillers, in the presence of the gendarmerie officers, were told that they were supposed to collaborate more than ever before with the territorial gendarmerie and to try to help the population as much as possible.  Those are the instructions that we gave to the police force.  And that is what we gave to the local authorities.  I don't know whether I have answered your question. 
Q.	Yes.  You have.  

What about the gendarmerie?  Couldn't they stop the killing? 
A.	Counsel, I believe that in a situation of war you need to get things clarified.  A few minutes ago we were talking about policemen.  And if you want to talk about gendarmerie, it is the same thing.  And so there were Kyum -- forces from Kyumba.  And forces were put in to maintain lots of peace and order.  These are two different things.  

It's not a situation where time stopped for you to know exactly how people were fighting and killing themselves to carry out operations of peace and order as would have been done in times of peace.  

Contrarily, in a situation of war -- where you have attacks, bombs, infantry, alongside killings, with people settling scores here and there and all types of things happening at the same time in a war situation.  And neither the police was equipped for this, because if I told you that less than a hundred had old guns, Enfield guns, that was not what was going to frighten anybody.  That was not what was going to stop the strikes that were breaking out because of bomb explosions here and there.  And people were saying we did not -- it is not the neighbour who is guiding the bombs and sending them here.  I hope -- I hope you understand what I'm saying.  

Now, in addition to all of this, there is the fact that we could not transpose ourselves into a situation other than that which was prevailing before that.  

Also, because the letters of engagement of -- engagement were very strict -- there was only 
one recognised force, the UNAMIR force, which was controlling the situation.  And the gendarmerie was hooked up to that force and could do nought without the authorisation of the UNAMIR force.  And so the reaction of the UNAMIR forces was not known to us.  

I took part at the meeting that took place on the 7th, during which Dallaire insisted on the KWSA agreements, saying that these were to be strictly obeyed.  And he is the one who came and said that the RPF forces had come out and that they had a strategy and that we had to put up ours.  

And so that being the situation, therefore, I think we need to be very, very relative in the way we address issues.  Neither the police nor the gendarmerie were -- had enough equipment to -- to launch a war.  Gendarmerie units that were deployed in the operational secteurs had left -- had a series of operative equipment.  But at the time that hostilities broke out in Kigali, the hostilities broke out nationwide on all the fronts.  And they could not -- it is also not possible that the gendarmerie should anticipate on the possible activities of UNAMIR, get their staff who had been deployed in 
others -- across secteur, for them to come back and do the work of peace -- of maintaining peace and order.  We did not have enough staff to place a solder before every home, before every family, for things to be contained.  That was the problem.  And so we had a situation where -- that things were totally dramatic.  A situation which we were looking into, we were thinking about, because I took part at the meeting, the crisis meeting on the 7th evening, and we received a report about the unfolding of the fighting and the -- and the situation.  And so in the evening we quickly noticed that that which was happening was absolutely catastrophic and such that to help the population to alleviate the burden of pain we had to do everything to stop the war, to stop the fighting.  And we, therefore, put together a delegation of Rwandan armed forces who asked General Dallaire to lead or, rather, to submit our request to the RPF asking them to come for a discussion for a cease -- ceasefire as soon as possible.  

What happened after happened and there -- there was no will to do anything else.  But it was not because of a failure on the part of the Rwandan officials.  But I remain totally persuaded and convinced that the only way which could have helped the population to put an end to the killings was a ceasefire.  And so the police did not have the equipment to do it, did not have enough staff to do it.  The gendarmerie neither had the equipment to do it.  And so it was a situation that was a situation of fighting.  And whoever was in Kigali could testify to this.  That is it.  Thank you very much. 
Q.	And what had caused the population and the individuals who were doing -- committing crimes in Kigali to begin erecting roadblocks and killing people?  Was it orders from some officials? 
A.	For a better understanding of the question, I would like you to be more specific.  

Are you trying to know what authority authorised the erection of the first roadblocks in the city?  Is -- is that the question, or did I misunderstand you?  
Q.	No.  Actually, I want to know why the people started erecting roadblocks on their own initiative and why they started killing people on the 7th of April.  Was it a result of somebody's orders? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  You know, the question is really poorly formed, because this is the second time that you've given exactly the response you want from the witness in the question.  
So the witness had asked you -- the witness's question to counsel was actually quite appropriate, in that some degree of leading is not objectionable.  When the specific answer is repeatedly being suggested to the witness, it is not appropriate. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't think I was suggesting the answer I wanted, Mr. President.  But I can rephrase the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please go ahead. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Préfet Renzaho, what was the cause of members of the population coming out of their homes, erecting roadblocks, and killing people? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  The erection of roadblocks can only be a result of the offensive by the RPF in the night of the 6th to the 7th.  Because personally, I left my office on the 6th after 7 p.m. and I used the Umuganda boulevard that goes past RPF positions -- positions leading to my house.  So I wasn't worried at all that something was going to happen.  And during the entire day -- you can even read the UNAMIR report for the 6th -- it was a very calm day.  And I insist on that because I spent the day of the 6th in Kigali.  No one could have thought at anything whatsoever.  

So the roadblocks which were erected probably around dawn on the 7th in the Remera, Kicukiro, and so on and so forth -- that is the secteurs where the RPF had attacked -- are merely the results of the RPF offensive.  

And I would like -- also like to state on the morning of the 7th, when I passed, I saw no roadblock, except for a military roadblock that was downhill from the Remera crossroads.  And I was lucky to have seen it because I could have -- I would have taken the same road used by the RPF which was moving towards the airport.  

So the proliferation of roadblocks was strengthening the other parts of the city which had not known this phenomenon because of the RPF offensive, because there were rumours -- and as a matter of fact, already in the morning as from some secteurs such as Rugenge and others had started receiving refugees who were fleeing from secteurs which had being attacked during the night.  Those people came and said that they had lost this and that and that they had fled.  And panic which was already among the population resulted in the proliferation of roadblocks around the city.  

So no authority ordered the erection of those barriers.  That is clear and should be clear, because when I tried to get in touch with authorities on the 8th, I only got in touch with some of them.  And these are conseillers.  The bourgmestre of Kacyiru had fled.  As the one for Kicukiro, I didn't even see him.  So you must deduce from this situation that led to the erection of barriers -- is the offensive of the RPF on the night of the 6th to the 7th.  Because during that time -- and I believe there's evidence, documentary evidence in this -- in this Tribunal.  There's no doubt as to that.  That is what I have to say with regard to the situation.

1205H
THE WITNESS (continued):
Now, killing -- I believe that it is a contagious phenomenon as there was a major massacre on the 7th in Remera and people who were fleeing were saying that they had lost their relatives.  So -- as I told you yesterday -- as well the rather difficult situation, the sort of mistrust, mutual mistrust, between the members of the population.  

I told you about the tour we made into the various communes at the end of February and early March to pacify people and to try and get people together.  And you have this feeling which was a result -- which was imposed by RPF operators within the population.

And when the war started, the suspicion was there, and people felt that their neighbour could be the first one to open fire.  And so things escalated completely.  I can't find any other explanation I can give.  That is it.  

And the messages that I gave were certainly heard but failed to produce the expected effect because, had the war stopped, if I had another alternative -- because we simply didn't have to say, "Do this and that and that."  You had to show people indeed that they were secure and that order had been restored. Yet we never had that chance.  That is the situation.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And who were the people who were erecting these roadblocks and doing the killing?  Were they Interahamwe? 
A.	Counsel, I think I would be going beyond my abilities if I tried to tell you who was erecting those barriers because the entire city was not inhabited by Interahamwe only.  Yesterday I told you that in the city you had -- and as a matter of fact, not only youth who were doing all of that.  It was practically the entire population.

I don't know how this can be taken, but who was saying that is something I don't understand.  Maybe you could add the phenomenon of banditry.  You had all these refugees from Nyacyonga, all these thousands of hungry people who were in there.  Who set up these roadblocks?  Who was controlling them?  That is the crux of the matter.   
Q.	To your knowledge, did the leaders of the MRND have any responsibility for ordering people or asking people to erect roadblocks or to kill Tutsis?
A.	Thank you for the question, Counsel.  It is two pronged.  Firstly, was the erection of the barriers -- of the roadblocks done based on MRND -- orders from MRND authorities and then if the roadblocks had been erected in order to kill Tutsis.  

Now, the first question is not something I'm going to try and insist on.  I've tried to explain how these roadblocks were erected in Kigali, the surprise I faced, which is something which any Rwandan official must have been faced with because the events were not predictable.  No one could have said that war was going to break out in the city and that -- and that the events were going to unfold in the manner as in A, B, C, D, and so forth.  These are events which surprised everybody.   

So I cannot fathom the idea that political officials of the MRND may have consulted each other in order to issue orders that night to go and erect roadblocks in order to kill Tutsis.  That is what I noticed.  That is my feeling.  That is what I'm telling the Trial Chamber.  

And as a matter of fact, even in the event where you were to read from some newspapers or the form of literature which we are now used to, these orders -- what happened to the political parties:  Their youth wings, their militias?  What happened to them?  Could the MRND have ordered all those people?  Was there an agreement between a given party to submit -- subject its authority to the MRND to give it preponderance and to obey its instructions?

Simply put, I humbly believe that you can put yourself in the form of the overriding feeling that was over the population.  And it was difficult to manage them.  That is what I remember from when I saw them and considering the brutality and the unfolding events.  That's what I believe.

I would also like to make some clarifications with regard to the second part of your question, with regard to instructions to set up roadblocks to kill Tutsis.  In my view, once -- in my view, it is also something that is unusual in what I know about our Rwandan society.  

Roadblocks would not be erected somewhere to wait there for the neighbour to probably go through there in order to kill them.  That is probably theoretical, and it doesn't tie with Rwandans that we know about because neighbours who live together -- one can be Hutu, and another would be Tutsi, and another would be Twa.  And they know each other.  And if they have a grudge against each other, they would do it in their house.

I can't see what sort of mental gymnastics would lead you to go and set up a roadblock somewhere for someone to kill.  I believe this is the outcome of some form of literature which we know.  But the reality of the matter is that that is unlikely.  

Maybe we will get to a point where we can look at those issues in depth.  But in my humble view, to answer your question directly, no authority, in my view in any event, maybe -- you maybe don't want to step back and think about something else because it is something that is going on and people don't want to think out of the box.

I think no one gave an order for the roadblocks to be set up, and no one asked that Tutsis should be killed there.  If they wanted to kill someone, they could have gone and killed the person in their house.  

Now, maybe I should further buttress this point by -- rather, with regard to reports which were drafted, especially by officials and the Kigali secteur commander who noticed that Tutsi movements had already started to get together the people who -- those of them who were feeling threatened were getting into places, especially religious institutions.

And I was aware of this because there were many of them in Kigali because in the Sainte Famille people had not left.  Also in Centre Christus or at the Kicukiro parish, people had not left it until the 6th.  So the tendency was for people to assemble somewhere at night to seek refuge, especially those who felt that they were under suspicion for one thing or another or for having a close relationship with the RPF.  

That was the overriding feeling, and the strangers who were in our country reported this.  So I am not inventing anything.  So it is difficult for me to see how suddenly this tendency would have reverted for people to run around the city to go and get killed at roadblocks.  It's something I can't understand.  I have asked myself this question for a long time, and I still cannot get an answer to it.

If the tendency was for people to assemble together at a given place in order to seek refuge from February to March, how would it be that on the 6th people suddenly started running about to get killed at roadblocks?

My personal view is that this is an exaggerated explanation of the situation.  Otherwise, maybe people did not quite explain what allegedly happened on the roadblocks and how those roadblocks -- considering the situation of war and everything that comes along with the war.  Thank you.  I hope I clearly answered your question.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  You did.

Now, we've had testimony from a witness who was a conseiller who has the pseudonym AWE that at one of the meetings you held with the conseillers you told them that the decision to erect roadblocks had been taken in consultation with Mr. Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, and Karemera.  Is that true?
A.	That is untrue.  That is untrue, and I -- I did not see those authorities, and I can't see where we could have met to set up those roadblocks and at what time.  I have just told you my itinerary from the 6th.  And up to the 8th, I cannot see at what time -- where I could have met with those authorities to agree to set up these roadblocks which already existed.  Unfortunately, I have to say no to you. 
Q.	Now, turning your attention to the 10th of April, did you attend a meeting with the Red Cross?
A.	Yes, indeed, Counsel. 
Q.	And what was the purpose of that meeting? 
A.	The meeting was convened at the initiative of the International Red Cross Society.  And I -- and I commend him because he had the courage to intervene in favour of the people.  And he wanted to inform us that after close to a week of fighting and killings in various neighbourhoods, the -- the city was running into the danger of a pandemic and that there was need to organise for relief.

And I was invited by the army chief of staff who called me to tell me that the meeting had been planned and I was expected to attend.  So I went there.  So we got the information, and we did everything in our capacity to assist the Red Cross Society to help the people of Kigali.

We had to act to try and approach those people who were at the roadblocks.  We needed to ensure that the Red Cross personnel could move about, and this assisted the population.  So I attended that meeting which started around 10:30 a.m. at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now, also on the 10th of April, we have in evidence Exhibit D. NZ74, which is a communiqué which says, "Once more, the préfet denounces criminals of all categories -- killers, bandits, and other persons who threaten one another's safety -- and urges that anyone trying to infiltrate in the various districts, neighbourhoods should be denounced."

Did you make such a communiqué? 
A.	It was a communiqué in which I requested the disbanding of the unauthorised roadblocks in the city.  What you read is just part of the message.  Yes, I sent that message to the people. 
Q.	And were you sincere in that message, or were you using some kind of double language? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It is not always nice things to answer questions, but I will try.  To say -- you're asking me if I was sincere in transmitting that message.  I have always been sincere in everything I did.  And maybe that is my major shortcoming.  Because in some places it can be appreciated, but in others it may not.  But considering the circumstances, I was very, very sincere.

And I was not the only person who had that feeling.  I believe that is how many officials felt.  And I believe that we have tried to overview some action, messages.  Everyone's concern was for people to live in peace in spite of the war that was weighing down on us.

So I was sincere, and the fact that the message went on the 10th -- it was in line with the message I had sent on the 7th when the events broke out when I asked the people to be calm and, in any event, not to attack neighbours for whatever reason; that they simply had to be cognisant of the gravity of the times and to maintain social coherence.

So I fail to see under what circumstances -- under what circumstances I could have sent this message with an underlying hidden message, hidden meaning.  Because considering what I had faced a month ago -- you know, double meaning in war, I, in my capacity as a soldier -- this is against my training, and it's something impossible to do.

If you gave a verbal order to the people and which is even what should be -- and what should be done, as a matter of fact, is that a verbal instruction should be accompanied by a written instruction.  Double meaning cannot be -- this is not something that can be used in a public that is made up of diverse people.

Double meaning -- I really can't see what that concept is about.  I was deeply sincere I must tell you, Counsel.  And we did everything in our power for it to be sincere in the actions.  For instance, in that meeting of the 8th in the crisis cell, we told the public about a phone number which they could call in case of emergency because we were unable to know what was happening in each family.

And we did not know -- we were unable to know what was happening in each family.  And so we felt that, if someone could make a phone call to tell us that they were facing a danger or that they were under threat, we should be in a position to come to the rescue of that people.  And that is what we did.

Now, to call it double meaning, no.  I didn't do it, and I say it's part of a certain type of literature which I have always found to be exaggerated because that literature by itself is likely to cause other victims. 
Q.	Turning to the 11th of April, did you attend a meeting of the préfets convened by the prime minister, Jean Kambanda? 
A.	I'm positive, yes.  Indeed I attended that meeting. 
Q.	And were any of the three Accused present:  Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, or Karemera? 
A.	I didn't see them.  I saw the participation of the préfets of the préfecture of the country minus those who, for their own reasons, were unable to attend.  And you had ministers in attendance.  But the people you're referring to did not attend that meeting. 
Q.	Did the préfet of Butare attend that meeting? 
A.	No.  He was not in attendance. 
Q.	Was any mention or comment made by Prime Minister Kambanda to the effect that the préfet of Butare would pay dearly or would somehow have some consequences for not having attended that meeting? 
A.	Counsel, once more, I believe that that question is not in line with the presence or the idea behind the convening of that meeting based on what I heard from the various contributions of the participants and the prime minister himself.  The primordial concern for everyone was to see how the violence could be stopped, and the prime minister's instructions were in that line.  

I didn't hear -- as a matter of fact, his speech was recorded by Radio Rwanda which was present.  These are things which can be cross-checked, cross-checked in the radio report transcripts for that day.

In any case, as an individual, I didn't hear the prime minister addressing any form of threat towards the préfet of Butare.  I heard nothing of such. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take our luncheon adjournment at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take our luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1415H)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  I have just two quick matters with you before we resume with the witness.  The first is that on the 9th of April I had submitted a draft transcript of the interview I had with Witness GAP.  And I've asked the Prosecution to look it over and let us know whether they agree with its accuracy.  And they're still working on that.  So they're not in a position to give me a final answer.

What I would like to do in the meantime, however, is to give these ID. NZ numbers because I'm going to be filing an appeal on Monday concerning your decision not to investigate Witness GAP, and I think it will facilitate the Appeals Chamber's work if there is some written transcript in the record as opposed to simply listening to the audio on the CD.  So I would ask that the transcripts -- there are two.  One is a verbatim transcript, and the other English only -- be marked as the next ID. NZ numbers A and B.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
Perhaps I could assist you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
After our session with GAP during the last trial session, the Prosecution submitted the audio tape that was entered into evidence from Mr. Robinson to the language section in Kigali, I believe it was.  And they came up with a transcription, and I forwarded that to Mr. Robinson so he could review it, and he was dissatisfied with that transcription and came up with his own.

So we actually have three texts:  That one, the one that was initially prepared by the Prosecution which was submitted to -- I'm not sure if it's the language section or the registry or the language assistants of our office in Kigali.  It was done in Kigali.  He was dissatisfied with that and then came up with what he has just suggested to the Court.

I have not had an opportunity to compare all three texts and to develop an opinion on which is the most appropriate to be entered into evidence.  So I have no opposition to Mr. Robinson's current suggestion which is that he mark his transcripts for identification so that he has a way of referring to them when he files his submissions.  And then perhaps sometime next week, we can come to some agreement over what should be actually entered into evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Robinson, we don't have to deal with it right now.  We can mark it for identification now, but you still have to pass it for certification.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No.  Actually, for Rule 91 motions, there's an automatic appeal.  It's due within 15 days of your decision.  Your decision was on the 6th of April.  So I can appeal directly to the Appeals Chamber.  In fact, we've already had two direct appeals under that rule.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But nonetheless, we will mark it for identification now, and then next week we will address the remaining issues as to which, if any, should become formal exhibits.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much.  

If Mr. Issa can give me the next ID. NZ number, I would appreciate that.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The next ID. NZ is 73.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And then the full transcript would then be ID. NZ73A, and the English would be ID. NZ73B.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
(Exhibit ID. NZ73A and ID. NZ73B, marked for identification)
MR. ROBINSON: 
The next issue is -- and I've discussed with the parties subject to the Trial Chamber's agreement -- I would like to be able to interrupt the testimony of Colonel Renzaho when we finish the 
direct examination of all of the Defence parties and commence the direct examination of Ferdinand Nahimana, the witness who has arrived today from Mali, and then to resume the cross-examination by Mr. Webster of Préfet Renzaho when we complete Nahimana's testimony, and I would ask that the Chamber allow us to do that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, Mr. Robinson and I discussed that this afternoon.  I have no opposition.  So it's certainly appropriate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  The Chamber approves of the arrangements that have been made.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Colonel Renzaho, we can continue with your testimony, and I apologise to you for some delay in completing it.  I hope you won't mind that.

Now, we've had evidence that on the 12th of April 1994 the interim government left Kigali.  Were you consulted about that situation?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel, for that question.  I think that consultation -- well, I was neither a minister nor was I concerned with government business directly as such in my capacity as préfet of Kigali.

So I was not consulted.  I learned of the departure of the government at around 11:30 from someone who had called me to inform me or to ask me whether I was aware that the government was leaving.  I was very surprised.  I went to the Hôtel des Diplomates, and I was only able to see the last 
government officials leaving the hotel.  So I was not consulted, and that wasn't a problem. 
Q.	What was the effect of the population on the government leaving Kigali? 
A.	That is a difficult question to answer.  This experience was unique in our history.  The situation was very difficult.  And the experience was painful, very painful.  All the inhabitants of Kigali city, including myself principally -- we were very affected by this.  And I believe that all the inhabitants of the city were affected by this situation irrespective of their leanings.  And this, once again, pointed to the fact that the country was about to sink.  The danger was extreme.  Thank you. 
Q.	And how did the departure of the government from Kigali affect their ability to control what was happening in the country? 
A.	Once again, I am not in a position to answer on behalf of government.  You see, ordinarily, there was a command structure in place.  And if you did not belong to that structure, you would not be able to command as would be required.  So clearly, the available infrastructure outside of Kigali, even that which was available in Gitarama, would not have enabled government to function properly.  And that is only my personal assessment.  Thank you.

1430H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	We've had testimony from Witness T that, when the government left, the population lost a lot of respect for the government, considered them cowards maybe.  Would you agree or disagree with that? 
A.	Your questions indeed are extremely difficult.  Well, although the situation was extremely serious, as it was -- and the fact that government had to leave Kigali was not an easy decision.  And this must have been as a result of the operational military situation on the ground.  Therefore, it was absolutely necessary for government to continue to perform, and it was probably for those reasons that they decided to proceed in that manner.  

I do not think that beyond these considerations one can extricate oneself from the rather complicated situation that was obtaining on the 12th, including the fact that all strategic positions, including that held by UNAMIR, had been captured by the RPR -- by the RPF.  And they had the necessary heavy equipment and were able to shell all targets within the capital, including even the hotel in which the government was, which did not have a basement -- at least a basement from which they might have been able to work.  

However, it would be pretentious on my part to claim that I am in a position to fully assess the grounds on which the government came to that decision because, by the way, I didn't take part in that decision-making process.  All I can offer to the Court is my view of what happened on that day.  

Yes.  Indeed the situation was serious.  The situation was such that the population had been affected from the very onset of the war.  So people were living in misery, and this was their daily lot.  So I think we ought to understand that such was the situation we were experiencing at the time.  I thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, between the 8th of April and the 12th, when the interim government left, did you hold any other meetings of the authorities -- préfectoral authorities in Kigali, such as the conseiller, other than the one that you've told us about on the 8th?  So between the 8th and the 12th, did you hold any other such meetings? 
A.	Counsel, thank you for the question.  I organised a meeting at the Kigali-ville préfecture on the 11th, between 9 and 10 a.m. before going to attend the meeting of préfets at the Hôtel des Diplomates, and that meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Kambanda.

During that meeting at the préfectoral office, which we hosted in our building and which was chaired by members of government, namely, the minister of health and the minister of public works, in the presence of the international Red Cross as well as staff from the government serving at the international Red Cross -- so this meeting was holding at the préfecture.  And for reasons of protocol, I had to be present to receive these guests and be part of their deliberations.  Maybe it is for this reason that the meeting was very brief, lasting only one hour.  And then maybe it was as a result of the meeting we held the previous day, on the 10th, at which it was deemed necessary to quickly put in place the international Red Cross services as soon as possible.  

And that is how on the 11th, the next day, at 9 a.m. we had that meeting to coordinate the various activities between the international Red Cross and the other services of the Rwandan government.  That is the only meeting that comes to mind which held between the 8th and the 12th.  We have already discussed the 8th.  But between the 8th and the 12th, there was a meeting on the 11th at the préfectoral office between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.  I thank you, Counsel.
Q.	Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, may the witness be shown Exhibit D. NZ78.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Colonel Renzaho, this is a radio broadcast -- transcript of a radio broadcast on the 14th of April 1994.  And in this broadcast, which is already in evidence and has been commented on by some other Prosecution witnesses, we have our -- a statement from you that, "I would like to warn with my last energy some unscrupulous groups noticed in some quarters who continue to perpetuate shameful acts."  And it says that, "I want to tell you that instructions have been given to security personnel so that whoever caught in such barbaric acts of looting or killing be punished accordingly."  And then it goes on to say that, "I would like to recommend you to maintain your security, especially in fighting, looting, theft, and killings."  And then it says, "We held meetings with parties' representatives at the préfecture and commune levels."  

And I'm going to give -- put these in front of you so you can refer to them if you don't recall or if you have any questions.  But I -- to make it go a little quicker, I've tried to read to you the parts that I'm interested in.  

So you say that -- on the 14th of April, you are telling the public that, "We held meetings with parties' representatives at the préfecture and commune levels.  And the meeting was fruitful, as we agree that those who worked closely with the population should stand and do their best to explain to the population that it is not those criminal acts which will help us to win the war.  On the contrary, they have to avoid them so that we may unite and fight against the common enemy who attacked all of us inhabitants of this zone where we used to share everything."  

And you said, "It is not through killings that we may solve the problem of Inyenzi, Inkotanyi.  We have to unite and fight that war and fight it quickly."  And you go on to say that you have made the following decisions at this meeting with political party leaders, or among political party leaders, that, "From tomorrow in all secteurs of Kigali, security meetings will be held at the secteur level gathering in nyumbakumi, members of the cellule committees and representatives of political parties -- so they may come up with clear decisions to stop criminal acts."  

And so I would like to ask you:  What meetings were held with political party leaders, and particularly at what level, prior to this announcement being made on the radio?  
A.	To begin with, when I held the meeting that took place on the 8th, government did not exist at the time, and so I did not know exactly what was to be done.  I -- all I knew was there was -- there were some consultations going on and there were a -- a consultation of parties after the protocol of 6 April 1992, putting in place the transition government.  

And I could not invite political parties to that meeting when they were occupied in coming up with a compromise or consensus -- consensus to come up with a programme that would enable the putting in place of an interim government.  Nevertheless, I asked what the situation looked like, and those in the knowing what the situation was in the secteurs and the communes, all those authorities that had been fragilised by the competition between different political parties -- that these conseillers, local responsables could not do anything and were of no interest to the political parties.  And so they would not take into consideration security problems.  

As a result, this was a directive which I gave to those who attended that meeting that took place on the 8th.  Apart from that, between the 8th and the 12th and even the 14th -- on the 12th, well, everybody is leaving, and so all the bosses had left Kigali.  And it was difficult for me to bring together all the different political leaders after the 12th in Kigali.  They were no longer there.  

But I also know that there at -- within the secteurs there were -- or at least they do -- had to do this.  They had to sensitise everybody to look into (inaudible) problems.  And if I talked about this in my statement on the 14th, it was because I knew that, if these projects were underway -- it was a way of confirming.  

Furthermore, the -- the commitment to pacify the nation, to put an end to the bloodshed between neighbours, to put an end to a war, a war in which saw bombs falling on them and problems being solved by violence -- and so my concern in pronouncing that speech was for that.  But that process had already been put in place on the meeting of the 8th, because I did not hold any other meeting with the administrative authorities.  

But inviting them to the préfecture for a particular meeting -- I only confirmed on the 14th of April a process which already had been put in place from the 8th of April when I asked the local authorities to take the situation in hand and to bring things in control by involving political leaders within each administrative unit.  That is my answer, Counsel.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, when was the next time that you held a meeting of the préfectoral authorities, including the conseillers, after the 14th of April? 
A.	Well, I don't have the exact date in my mind.  But you should bear with me and understand that I was very, very active.  I moved from a -- into a phase of organisation.  And I couldn't say things that could -- ought not to be said.  I had an urgent problem in my hands, and the problem I set out to handle was to appoint members and committees that were supposed to work out in the field and try to identify various people who were now scattered in all areas so as to get them to work together.  

And I did all of that on the 9th.  On the 10th, the 11th, and after -- the 11th to the 12th that -- that -- the team was now out on the -- on the field.  That was what was most pressing for me.  

So if there was a meeting with the préfectoral authorities, this must have been later on, perhaps after a certain date which I do not have in my mind.  Because apart from that, I got into problems of making sure that the different committees function as they took care of refugees at the refugee camps, shelters, contacts with -- with the refugee high commission and the Red Cross, and the -- all the committees that I talked to you about had to be put in place.  That's what I did.  And, in fact, that was the concern at the time.  

But we held meetings even after.  The meeting that comes to my mind, for example, is the meeting of the 22nd.  We did a certain evaluation to -- just to check -- taking stock of the measures taken.  Did they bear fruits?  And so there were meetings in the future but at dates which do not pop up to my mind now. 
Q.	Thank you.  Was there ever a meeting at which it was decided and implemented that five weapons would be distributed to each conseiller by the minister of defence? 
A.	For me, I did not under -- organise any such meeting.  And once again, I -- I am sometimes accused of being a man of principles and being a pragmatic and principled person.  How come -- would you expect that on a date posterior to the 12th communal authorities and others would raise the issues of having weapons?  Weapons to do what?  Because the town is totally taken over.  And if I can give you details -- I can give you details on this.  

So on the -- I want to dwell just on the principle.  I did not hold any meeting during which I allegedly gave any instructions for anybody to go to the ministry of defence to fetch arms.  That is clear.  That is crystal clear.  

Furthermore, I -- I believe that the witness who said this certainly gave you indications about participating at such a meeting on the manner in which those persons were instructed and to go and get weapons from the ministry of defence.  Who was it that gave the order?  Because the minister himself had -- had moved.  He had transferred.  He was gone.  Who, authorised by the minister, may have given such an order?  

Now, considering that exactly under my -- I had the service of the police under -- under the command of a high-ranking officer -- and certainly the witness who came here, narrated this business, certainly had no speciality in -- no training in armaments, and he certainly was not conversant with the elementary procedure for manipulating weapons, be it -- neither could -- could do anything about knowledge on these weapons and for what reasons these weapons were supposed to be distributed.  

Why would there be -- why would I use a person who is unqualified, and yet I had people who were in charge?  And -- and even to this question, we need to be able to establish the consistency of such a statement.  

Please look at this.  I am a professional.  I am not an amateur.  When I talk about weapons, I know what I'm talking about.  And I know the necessary elementary measures accompanying such.  And so, please, I am -- I'm a -- I had a major, a commander of the police -- of -- of urban police at my disposal.  That person could -- at least did not attend the -- the alleged meeting.  And even if this person had been the minister of defence and whatever the situation of the number of policemen available, there were specialists who could have helped in distributing such weapons, if that was the case.  These are situations which should reveal to you, as a matter of fact, the validity of such allegations.  Thank you. 
Q.	I want to ask you about some testimony we've had in this trial from a witness known as UB.  He's a conseiller.  And he claims that on the 16th of April 1994 he attended a meeting of conseillers led by yourself at the préfecture office.  And at the conclusion of that meeting, the conseillers went to the ministry of defence and received five weapons each.  Now, you've now told us that that is not correct.  

But he also says that at the commencement of this meeting on the 16th you had told him that that morning you had met with Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Now, did you meet with Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 16th of April or anytime in Kigali after the 12th of April?  
A.	I want to state and affirm.  I did not meet him at all.  I did not meet him.  And I asked myself, by the way, under what circumstances?  At what time?  At what venue could I have been reporting to a conseiller?  That I had contacts with authorities?  At what time?  

Now, these are things which -- which -- which -- which -- which rather bother my mind.  I -- I need to understand.  It is impossible.  So no, I did not meet him. 
Q.	Now, this conseiller also says that during the course of that meeting he asked you a question, and the question was:  "What should we do with Tutsis who were members of the MRND or Hutus who were members of the RPF?"  And that you answered him that the people who were Tutsis were the same, whether they were members of MRND or not, and the Hutus who had joined the RPF were brothers who had gone astray.  Did that happen?
A.	I am very sorry that I have to tell you once again that I did not hold any such meeting in my life.  I never made any such statements.  And as for the witness in question, when -- when will we -- when will we begin taking ourselves seriously?  If this individual had the courage there to state before this august assembly that on the 7th -- at 7 a.m. on the 7th of April, he telephoned me at my home at Nyarugenge when -- that's a lie.  I was not living in Kigali since 1992.  

So you see the type of witness who keeps on narrating untruths, lies, just to distract people.  That's not true.  I did not say that.  He couldn't have been the only one attending such a meeting.  I did not say that.  

And even -- what is more, on the 16th -- and let me point this out again -- on the 16th of April 1992 -- the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge went from there on the 12th.  How do you expect that I -- I should not be worried to know exactly what to -- or to deal with serious matters with a person who was supposed to be under my authority to the bourgmestre?  And I go and look for people who are under the bourgmestre.  

And so the bourgmestre did not attend that meeting.  The bourgmestre does not talk about a meeting.  Would it be that the -- the préfet had replaced the bourgmestre to convene an alleged meeting with conseiller communal in lieu of the bourgmestre?  That's a question that needs to be addressed.  That could not have been possible.  And this, again, is additional proof that this meeting of the 16th did not take place.  It could only have taken place if it had indeed been convened by the bourgmestre, and the préfet would have come to -- there to support the authority of the bourgmestre.  

And if, by chance, the préfet had convened such a meeting, he would have gone through the bourgmestre who was present, because, in fact, I lived with him at the préfecture.  From the 
12th -- because he had set up quarters there, and we were in contact with one another day and night.  So that is what I thought I should give as -- by way of clarification on this issue.  It did not take place. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, we've also had testimony from some people who are together in Kigali prison after the war that in late April 1994 a meeting was held at the préfecture office in Kigali at which Mr. Nzirorera and yourself was -- were present and that this meeting, which included conseillers as well as Interahamwe, involved Mr. Nzirorera thanking the Interahamwe for what they had done in Kigali and giving 100,000 Rwandan francs to an Interahamwe named Sued Ndayatabi; is that true? 
A.	That is not true.  To begin with, according from what I have in my mind, I did not hold any such meeting with political leaders at the préfecture of Kigali town and -- from the 6th April until the 3rd of July when we left the town.  That's the absolute truth.  

In addition, I did not organise a meeting where leaders of -- youth leaders of political parties were present.  I believe that they are people who have testified before this Trial Chamber.  And if there are any who made such statements, I wish to have any con -- confrontation with any such persons.  Never.  

And so, for having lived with all these people, there's some parts on which -- that have touched me in this test -- in this testimony.  How could Mr. Nzirorera have given a hundred thousand Rwandan francs, to thank Interahamwe and all the other youth wing part -- the youth wings of various parties?  How could he have done that?  I cannot understand.  

And, in addition, we are in Kigali, and officials of the Interahamwe are right there.  How could he have given such a huge sum of money to an unknown individual when, on the list of members of the national committee -- executive committee of Interahamwe, I have never met -- seen this name?  I -- I don't even know the name, only the person.  

And yet right there in Kigali during the same period Kajuga must have been there, Rutaganda must have been there, and all the others.  Why -- how come this amount of money was not given to any of the bosses of the Interahamwe?  I cannot understand that.  That is already an indication to prove that somewhere these things were framed.  This is manipulation.  It's not true. 
Q.	Now, after the interim government left Kigali on the 12th of April, was there ever an occasion in which you saw Mr. Nzirorera in Kigali? 
A.	I saw him at the préfecture.  He came with somebody else.  I was upstairs handling the issue of refugees.  When there were offices for urban development, these had been transformed into a shelter for refugees.  The welcome -- I greeted the refugees.  I saw the things that they wanted to get in Kigali.  So he said -- we exchanged greetings, and he left.  That was the only time that we met, because 
we -- we could not sit down to chat or whatever.  I think I greeted him, and they left.

1500H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And who was the other person that he was with at that time? 
A.	Was it not Mr. Semanza?  I think it was Mr. Semanza. 
Q.	Did Mr. Nzirorera tell you why he had come back to Kigali? 
A.	Well, I said just in -- in exchanging greetings, he told me that -- that there were things that had 
left -- that had remained in Kigali and he left.  He -- he went away.  
Q.	Can you explain that?  I didn't exactly understand that.  What did he say about why he had come back to Kigali? 
A.	He said, if I -- my memory serves me right, he said that there were some things which were -- had been left behind in Kigali, he had come to collect them, and he left.
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And then can you tell us approximately when this was?  
A.	If I'm not mistaken, it was at the beginning of the May.  Now, as for the date -- the exact date, I can't tell, but it was at the beginning of May, early May 1994.
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, there's been testimony -- there's been testimony by Witness ALG that you gave fuel coupons to a violent Interahamwe named Kigingi; is that correct? 
A.	That is very, very far from the truth.  That's not -- that's not correct.  
Q.	And did you have any dealings with this Kigingi?  
A.	Dealings with this individual?  No, this was very difficult.  First of all, (inaudible) was the -- was the person who arrested him; I gave him the resources to do so.  He was caught and put in jail at the préfecture.  Such circumstances did not augur well for any contacts with him.  Why would I be meeting him?  He was a criminal.  We locked him up there.  

And the problem is that, in Kigali, the prison had been emptied because -- from -- the RPF had plundered this entire prison and the services had abandoned the place.  The jailbirds had escaped and had joined the flocks of thieves and bandits that had invaded the city.  

And so we could not put him in prison per se.  But this individual -- those are the circumstances under which I received him.  And now to claim that I gratified him with a petrol fuel coupon, that is very, very surprising because the same person who says this complained at some other time somewhere that, for some time, he had pointed out the -- the problem of this individual (inaudible).  But the authorities did not act in that way and that someone else had replaced him in -- as -- as the bourgmestre.  He was the one who was supposed to act or to react.  But now, that -- he did not do that.  

At a certain time, huge resources were put in play.  He's put in prison.  And then he goes now to say this individual that we had in prison had thanked him by giving him a fuel coupon.  Now, this is a tragic comedy or something of that kind.  And -- well, we knew we had witnessed many things of that kind at that period.  

And, in addition, may I add to specify, fuel -- we did not have any fuel.  We did not have any fueling station.  Fuel coupons, I received them from the minister of defence for official vehicles that were there.  And the service was handled because all these vehicles went back to the garage to receive the fuel.  

Now, this is some clarifications which I thought I should give on this issue.  Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could you help with the spelling of the individual's name, Kigingi?
MR. ROBINSON:
I think maybe Préfet Renzaho can do it better because I don't know the Kinyarwanda so well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Préfet Renzaho, can you spell the name for us? 
A.	Kigingi is spelt K-I-N-G -- or, rather, K-I-G-I-N-G-I.  Kigingi.  I think I spelt it right.  Kigingi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Colonel Renzaho, we've had evidence that a number of people took refuge at the 
Mille Collines hotel, and on the 3rd of May, there was an incident when they were -- there was an attempt to evacuate them to the RPF zone.  Can you tell us what happened that day?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  There was a convoy of 72 persons who were under the care of the UNAMIR humanitarian services.  They were in UNAMIR vehicles and were headed for the RPF zone.  But when they got to the flyover in Nyarugenge secteur, where we had a road for heavy lorries at that time -- it appears that things have changed since, so the flyover, which led to Kimihurura and Kacyiru was at that location and it is there that the convoy ran into a crowd of people at a roadblock at that location.  

At about 9 a.m. in the morning, there had been bombing around this SOPECYA fueling station from the RPF positions and people had been killed at that spot.  I was not aware of that operation.  I really did not know anything about that operation.  I had known for a while that for some time some negotiations had been going on, and I knew -- and I had informed the UNAMIR that they needed to proceed in a manner that was mindful of the prevailing circumstances.  

So my idea was that, maybe, we could use some dissuasion and work with UNAMIR to pre-empt any further shelling by -- of that centre, which had hosted at least some 18,000 persons who had gone through that location.  And you might not believe me when I say this, but that is the reality.  And the majority of those people who had gone through that centre were Tutsi.  

Maybe you have been told that the various people were divided here and there and that most of them were at the Mille Collines and, therefore, could receive some measure of protection.  But all of this did not stop the shelling.  And on that day, what happened was that the convoy got to that location and members of the population were fully aware of what was happening on the other side.  

In fact, people who were being held by the UNAMIR got killed on a daily basis.  And I was in my office in the afternoon when I was told that the convoy had run into some problems and that people had been brought out of the vehicles and that there might be some victims.  There was a risk of people being killed.  What could I do?  Those who had come to notify me were officers of the Rwandan army.  They came to tell me this in my office.  

So I told them, "Well, I don't know what to do."  And that is how we went to the location together.  And the officers stopped at a certain point, and my duty was then to go on and to try to engage some dialogue and discussion with a crowd of people who had gone crazy, so to speak.  And I tried to locate a number of persons who might have some influence on that group.  

I was lucky.  I took some very serious risks because there was shooting here and there.  The crowd was huge and anything could have happened.  But to make a long story short, I was lucky to identify a few people who were able to talk to the others and to tell them that the person who was before them, talking to them, is the préfet of the préfecture and that he has come to talk to them about collective or joint security for all within our area.  And so they appealed to them to listen to me because I had something to say to them.  

Relying on the goodwill of that individual, I then proceeded.  And may I say that this person was somebody who could easily identify with the crowd and it was not easy to manage such a rowdy crowd.  But now that I had identified him, I asked him to try and look for other people who might show some understanding of the situation.  

So he identified three other persons.  And we went -- we set ourselves aside and had a small discussion.  You see, the idea was not to try to engage in any struggle or fight against 2,000 people when I had maybe just one or two policemen with me.  

At about the same time, I saw some soldiers coming from an operation in Kicukiro and I was afraid that things might get worse.  But, fortunately, as I discussed with those persons, I brought them to understand that the convoy had -- was under the authority of UNAMIR and we had agreed that those people could move to the zones which they had chosen, and that in previous meetings we had agreed that such types of operations could take place.  
But, unfortunately, this particular convoy had been organised secretly and we were not aware of it.  So we appealed to their good judgement and asked them to let the convoy through.  

It was beginning to rain; it was getting dark.  And so I proposed a -- an interim measure which would enable all parties to properly organise a convoy that would spare us these types of problems, and I felt that such a proposal would have been accepted.  

So I asked him to tell the crowd that, given that it was getting dark and that the conditions were poor, I was taking it upon myself to withdraw the convoy and take them back to the Hotel des Mille Collines and to continue discussions with all parties as to how best to organise the return of these persons to the RPF zone.  

That is how the incident unfolded.  I was lucky because once that announcement was made, there was some resistance, but the majority of the persons present accepted that proposal.  And I indicated for the vehicles to turn around, and that happened and the vehicles went on to the Hotel des Mille Collines.  

But there was a problem.  I noticed that at the time of that withdrawal, some of the demonstrators had taken a young girl from the convoy with them, and I insisted that such an action was not acceptable, because this was a single operation and it involved all persons and all of them had to be evacuated.  

So I went back and negotiated with the crowd.  And they said, "No, we have already accepted your first proposal, but on this point we do not agree with you."  So I insisted to them, telling them that it was no good to try to play games with someone's life.  There was an operation of 72 persons which we needed to conduct successfully to its completion.  And, therefore, I asked someone -- I asked someone who was close to that young girl to bring her forward.  There was protest, but in the end the girl came forward and I suggested that she should go quickly to the vehicle.  

So my driver was familiar with all these things.  He kept his engine running and -- so he was able to take off quickly from that location because he already had experience with these types of situations.  

This is how the operation of the 3rd of May unfolded.  This is how we managed the incident.  And the solution which was finally accepted by the crowd was the right solution, which enabled the crowd to disperse and the others to be returned to the Hotel des Mille Collines.  That gave us an opportunity, subsequently, to organise a proper convoy to evacuate these people to the RPF zone.  This is what happened on the 3rd of May.  And I thank you.  
Q.	Thank you, Colonel Renzaho.  Now, turning to later in the month of May, on the 25th of May, did you and other préfets receive instructions from the prime minister concerning the civil-defence programme? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And what were those instructions, in general? 
A.	In general, the instructions related to the implementation of the civil defence.  I cannot delve into the details, but the directives dealt with the implementation of the civil defence.  
Q.	And prior to the 25th of May, had you taken any steps to implement a civil-defence programme in Kigali? 
A.	This is what I have been trying to explain to you relating to how I could have set up a civil-defence movement in Kigali.  The fact is that it was impossible to do so because from the beginning, the situation was not controllable and it went from bad to worse.  Therefore, it was impossible to set up a civil-defence programme in Kigali.  Impossible.  

When could that have been possible?  Maybe it would have been possible if we had started to put in place such a program from the 6th.  But you know that there was such chaos in town.  Even on the 7th, with the movement of the inhabitants here and there, with disruptions -- total disruptions in the administrative services, with no control over Kacyiru and Kicukiro communes.  And yet, further still, on the 9th, Gatsata secteur in Nyarugenge commune was lost.  

So how could we have -- how was it possible -- how would it have been possible to set up a civil-defence structure at that time?  Who would we have been working with?  The bourgmestre of Nyarugenge came to our services on the 12th, and by the 12th, already the situation was catastrophic.  So it was impossible.  

I don't know if I've answered your question, Counsel.  
Q.	Yes, you have.  Now, was the purpose of the prime minister's civil-defence programme to kill the remaining Tutsis in Rwanda? 
A.	Counsel, I -- I think that we cannot incriminate the system upfront, a system which applies in all armies in all countries across the world.  The civil-defence system, as I have already told you, is an integral part of the internal defence systems of each country.  And there are two important components when one is looking at defence.  It can be the defence of our borders or boundaries where soldiers are professionally trained to do the job according to the standards laid down by the hierarchy.  
Then you have internal defence, which does not only deal with the defence of persons and property, but also looks into matters of protection of the inhabitants or population in times of war or in times of disasters.  

These plans are generally developed during peacetimes with different levels of alert or -- and various systems put in place to signal those levels in order to ensure that the population is protected accordingly.  So in all countries of the world, these systems are in place.  
In our country, it may not have been as refined and as properly organised as elsewhere, but we had a system in place.  I had had the luck of studying abroad and I was familiar with those systems.  And so we cannot simply say that because there was a defence system in place or a civil-defence system in place it should be incriminating as such.  I don't think so.  I thank you.  
Q.	What was the purpose of the civil-defence programme? 
A.	Well, you see, the purpose -- and, by the way, I was not very interested in -- in that aspect because we were almost on our way out and this happened in June.  And so we did not pay much attention to the civil-defence programme because it mainly involved those préfectures which were not yet involved in the -- in the war.  

They had the possibility of working with the army and the administration to ensure that the basic needs were met, and to ensure that there's an inter-dependency between the defence and the population's needs, as well as the setting up of a coordination committee to ensure that the army and the population are working together in that context.  

However, maybe in Cyangugu préfecture, which had not yet been affected by the war, maybe in Kibungo, the system -- or Gikongoro, the system might have been in place.  So it is only those préfectures which were not yet involved in the war that would have been in a position to talk about the civil-defence programme.  
Q.	Was there any training of youth as part of the civil-defence programme in Kigali? 
A.	No, there was no training of any youth civil recruits into the civil-defence programme in Kigali.  I hope that this is clear.  There was a recruitment for the army in order to supplement the various battle fronts or war fronts and to make up for the losses that had been incurred at the various war fronts from the RPF attacks.  

So maybe we need to be careful to distinguish these things clearly.  There was some confusion to the extent that some conseillers in Nyarugenge talked about a recruitment exercise which took place late April-early May.  But that was a recruitment of soldiers for the army for deployment to the various fronts.  

The civil-defence system programme, as I have said, was not put in place in Kigali.  I personally did not receive any instruction to train people and to send them to the civil-defence programme.  I had people on the field -- on the ground, officers who were commanding a number of units who talked to me about this recruitment exercise, and that is true.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I will next be showing the witness an exhibit.  I think it will take some time.  So can we take our recess at this time and resume on Monday.  I think I can finish in one hour or less on Monday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Mr. Witness, we have to take our adjournment.  This is the end of our session for this week.  We'll resume on Monday when your testimony will continue.  

I remind you, as I did, that you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this or any other adjournment while you are on the witness stand.  
THE WITNESS:
I will respect your instructions, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now.
