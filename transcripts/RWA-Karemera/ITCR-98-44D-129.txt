MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 21st of June 2006 for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Could the witness just leave the court for a short while, please?  Okay.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have decided to allow the Prosecutor to adduce brief evidence on the massacre at Mudende, for the sole purpose of showing the cooperation between civilians and the military authorities.  I don't know if I need to go further than that at this stage.  We think there was notice of the issue with regard to the cooperation between those bodies.  The massacre itself cannot be a material fact that will be used against the Accused.  

You can please bring in the witness now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, I have a few other scheduling matters I would like to bring to the Trial Chamber's attention.  The first one is a question regarding the Seromba closing arguments and whether there's going to be any sitting -- attempt to sit under Rule 15 bis in this case.  I'd like to be heard on that if there is.  I tried to communicate with your Trial Chamber coordinator about that, but she never gave me an answer.  So, I now bring it to your attention, as much as those arguments are scheduled for next week.  So if you're thinking of sitting under Rule 15 bis, I would like to be heard on that now.  If you're not, then we have can move on to something else. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As of now, you can move on to something else.
 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  The second thing is with respect to the decision on judicial notice, the trial -- the Appeals Chamber has remitted to the Trial Chamber, for the exercise of its discretion, the issue of adjudicated facts.  And we would like to be heard on that in light of the new standard that the Appeals Chamber enunciated concerning acts and conduct of the Accused.  And I note that some of the facts have now also been eclipsed by evidence in the case.  So, I was going to ask if you could make some kind of scheduling order.  To me, it seems like the Prosecution should also be first required to state which of the adjudicated facts it's still pursuing in light of the current state of the evidence, and then we can be given an opportunity to file briefs on that before the Trial Chamber decides.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, with regard to what my friend Robinson has raised, I'd like to say that for our part we have a major problem.  It is that we have taken cognizance of a decision taken by the Appeals Chamber on the 16th of June, but do not have the privilege of accessing a French translation, which would be accessible to the Accused and francophone counsel on points that are essential.  And it is difficult for us to envisage a schedule without first receiving the French translation of the decision so that we can fully appreciate its scope and continue our mission, or mandate, with full knowledge of the contents of the decision rendered.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, assuming that a French translation was available, how much time would you need to respond, if requested?  If we decided to make a scheduling order, what is a reasonable time standard that you would think would be appropriate?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think -- I have still not received the French translation of the Prosecutor's motion and annexes to that motion.  I'm thinking of the motion on judicial notice that was presented in the spring of 2005 and annexes to that.  To our knowledge, we do not have the full French translation.  Therefore, in order for us to give complete reply, it is difficult for me to say.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would just like to support the motion requiring disclosure of the French translation of the Appeals Court decision, and therefore would request that you instruct the translation service to carry out translation of the decision so that we may debate it with our clients.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to the rest of the Trial Chamber.  We had actually not anticipated making any further filings in relation to the Appeals Chamber decision.  My assumption was that the Trial Chamber would go back to the original motion.  But if Mr. Robinson wants to make submissions, he should do so and then we'll respond to his submissions.  I'm assuming he wants to do that orally.  But if he wants to -- however he wants to proceed, we'll respond to that, but the motion stands.  

In terms of evidence that's already on the record, that has no bearing with our request for the Court to take judicial notice of previously adjudicated facts.  As far as we're concerned, the motion stands in its original form.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will need to consider this a little bit and decide how we're going to proceed.  

Could you bring in the witness?  

Mr. Lahaie, are you still on schedule to complete this witness's testimony during the course of today?  
MR. LAHAIE:
I think so.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony can now continue.  I remind you that you are still on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began yesterday.  The Prosecutor will continue his examination now.
WITNESS XBM
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	So, we had reached the point where we were discussing your presence at the Mudende university on the 7th of April, you may recall.  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That is what I said, indeed. 
Q.	When you arrived at Mudende university on the 7th of April, what did you notice when you got there?
A.	Once I arrived, I found the students of that university.  It was clear that some of the students had fled following actions of other students.  There was definitely unrest. 
Q.	And the students who were present in the university, what was their ethnicity? 
A.	That university was attended by students of both ethnic groups, as well as even students from other countries.  
Q.	Were there gendarmes at the site? 
A.	There were some gendarmes protecting the students, responsible for the safety of the students. 
Q.	Can you give us an approximate idea of the number of these gendarmes? 
A.	They were not many.  In any event, they were no more than 12 or 13.  It was a handful of gendarmes. 
Q.	So, Witness, I gather that you spent the night close to the Mudende university; is that correct? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, leading.  
MR. LAHAIE:
It is a question that is basically reductive, but I can reformulate it.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Where did you spend the night, Witness?  
A.	We spent the night in the vicinity of the institution.  There were people living there, and it so happens I ************************************************************. 
Q.	So, on the morning of the 8th, did you return to the university? 
A.	In fact, I cannot say I returned to the university because I spent the night within reach of the university.  I spent the night in the area surrounding the university, so I stayed in the perimeter.  
Q.	And when you got up in the morning, what did you hear? 
A.	Even before we got out of bed in the morning, between 5:00 and 5:30 -- around 5:00 or 5:30, we heard fire -- gunfire in the area close to the institution.  Some people got up early and noticed what had happened, to ascertain why we were hearing gunfire. 
Q.	Did you go to see where the shots were coming from and where they were being fired from? 
A.	Yes.  Just like the others, I could not stay there when there was gunshots being heard, so I escorted the others to find out why -- the whys and wherefores of these gunshots. 
Q.	And what did you see at the place? 
A.	Among those who rushed in search of a hiding place were Tutsis, Tutsis who attended the university. 
Q.	And who was shooting? 
A.	During the night it was people carrying out night patrols who were shooting, that is, Interahamwes and others persons armed with rifles who would patrol at night. 
Q.	These other armed persons, were they soldiers or others?  Civilians, for instance? 
A.	At any rate, they were civilians because no soldier was supposed to be there.  The patrols were carried out by civilians.  However, these were civilians who had undergone military training. 
Q.	And who were these people shooting at? 
A.	They were firing on the Tutsi refugees who were running away.  Some came from Ka -- Ruhengeri.  These are the people who were being shot, and they were seeking refuge at Mudende. 
Q.	Were you able to see if some of these people were shot, whether the gunshots actually hit them? 
A.	There were some who were wounded as they arrived.  Others fell on the road.  But those we saw were the wounded. 
Q.	What would happen to these wounded persons? 
A.	I did not seek to find out what became of the wounded.  I do not know if they received medical attention or if they did not.  I did not stick around to find out. 
Q.	Did you remain at the university that whole day? 
A.	What date?  Are you referring to the 8th, Mr. Prosecutor?  
Q.	The 8th. 
A.	At 2 p.m. I went back home. 
Q.	And did you return to the university? 
A.	Not on that day.  The following day, yes, I returned to the university. 
Q.	Can you briefly explain to us why you came to return to the university on the 9th? 
A.	On the 9th, the reason I returned is that -- or, rather, is because of the conseiller, the responsable de secteur.  He came from the commune office and he happened to be********************************** ************.  He found me in the bushes, and he told me that on the 9th there were people who wanted to deliver a message to us. 
Q.	And was this message actually delivered to you? 
A.	Actually, I went to Kayondo (phonetic), about 200 metres from the communal office, and we thought we were going to meet officials.  However, at the Kayondo primary school, I came across a meeting, a gathering of the population, and these were mostly young people, people aged 45 years or less.  Those are the people we found -- I found. 
Q.	Were there any other people?  Were there any people other than civilians at the meeting? 
A.	At that centre, the school complex, primary school, there was a military position, so Lieutenant Nduwayezu, who was in charge of that military position, in my view, gave certain information and he was the one holding the floor.  When I got to the meeting, the meeting was just about to end, and this lieutenant was addressing the participants. 
Q.	What did the lieutenant request of you towards the end of the meeting? 
A.	Towards the end of the meeting he told us that the gendarmes had just called him from Mudende, and that the gendarme had told him that many Tutsis were gathered in Mudende and that he was overwhelmed by the situation, and that the officer should do something to assist him. 
Q.	And what did the lieutenant ask you? 
A.	He was just asking us to carry out patrols to ask passers-by to produce their identity papers.  So we were to hand over all arrested people, though Tutsis were not to be deferred - or, handed over to any authorities.  
Q.	Were the civilians present at the meeting armed? 
A.	Ever since President Habyarimana's death, no one would move without a weapon.  All members of the population were asked to be vigilant.  Even an old woman was supposed to be armed with a stick.  No one could move without being armed. 
Q.	What sort of weapon or weapons were the civilians present at the meeting holding? 
A.	Those who had received firearms were armed with those weapons.  Some people had received firearms.  Various others were armed with spears and clubs, and many other sorts of weapons.  
Q.	By any chance do you have the name of the lieutenant who held the meeting? 
A.	Earlier on I told you it was Lieutenant Nduwayezu.
MR. LAHAIE:
That is number 63 on the list of names.
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	From the communal office, did you then proceed to the university? 
A.	I was not the only one who made that movement.  All the participants at the meeting went to the university.  Even other members of the public who had not attended the meeting, out of curiosity, went to see the Tutsi.  It was unusual and, therefore, provoked a reaction.  It was said that the Tutsis had played a role in the killing of the Tutsis, so that no one was indifferent. 
Q.	And why did you all go to the Mudende university? 
A.	I have just explained why.  It was because we understood there was a problem between the Tutsi and Hutu students, and that the issue had its origins in the 7th or the 8th or the 9th.  The people in charge of security at that institution had telephoned the lieutenant saying that many Tutsis had sought refuge in that place, and that they were overwhelmed by the situation.  Therefore, there was a sudden change in the situation in the country, and there was a need to see how it could be restored to normality -- normalcy. 
Q.	What did you notice when you arrived at Mudende university on the 9th?  
A.	We saw the Tutsis there.  There were lots of refugees at the institution, and next to the infirmary there were Tutsi students.  The other students were within the building.  That is what I noticed when I arrived. 
Q.	And how many Tutsis would you say were present in the university, approximately? 
A.	I did not count but I would estimate that there were more than 2,000 Tutsis.  
Q.	And apart from the lieutenant, Lieutenant Nduwayezu, were there any officials or officers on the site, be they soldiers, or military, or gendarmes? 
A.	There were gendarmes there even -- they had been there for a very long time, as I told you.  But 30 minutes after I arrived, a bus from ONATRACOM arrived and it was used -- these buses were being used by the soldiers at the time.  The bus came from Tamira, from the ISAR institute in Tamira.  It is not a military camp. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the Kinyarwanda booth. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	And who was aboard the ONATRACOM bus? 
A.	I have told you that there were soldiers, about a hundred soldiers in that bus. 
Q.	What did they do upon their arrival? 
A.	Once they got to the site they assembled, took up positions in preparation for the task that awaited them.  They spoke to Lieutenant Nduwayezu and one of the people in charge of ISAR at Tamira, namely, Lieutenant Udahemuka.
MR. LAHAIE:
Udahemuka is number 82 on the list.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Were there high-ranking soldiers on the spot? 
A.	At the -- or upon the arrival of the vehicle, there were no officers present.  They only arrived later, 30 or 40 minutes later.  
Q.	Before the arrival of the officers, what did the soldiers do? 
A.	The soldiers surrounded the building, took up positions around the institution, all along the barbed-wire fence, and they took up position. 
Q.	Were any persons within the perimeter evacuated? 
A.	The people who were evacuated were the Hutu students and the sick; those are the ones who were evacuated from the site. 
Q.	So, you told us a soldier came a half hour later.  Who was the soldier? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I have an objection to this and I would like to have the witness not hear my objection, or Mr. Lahaie's response to that, so can he be excused?  Unless Mr. Lahaie would like to speak in English, which he's very good at.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, we have to ask you to leave the court for a few minutes.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I am expecting that what's to be elicited now is the presence of Colonel Nsengiyumva, a member of the alleged joint criminal enterprise in the case.  And I think now that, if evidence is to be offered that is going to go beyond your ruling of this morning and certainly beyond the notice that we've had concerning this event, because they've already elicited that military personnel were there.  They can certainly elicit the facts of the massacre pursuant to your ruling, but to include a member of the joint criminal enterprise for whom Mr. Nzirorera can be held responsible would go beyond anything that we've received notice of and beyond what I believe was your ruling this morning.  

So I would ask that the witness not be allowed to answer that question, that no evidence concerning the participation of Colonel Nsengiyumva in this incident be elicited.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Obviously, you have rendered a decision this morning to the effect that we could establish a link between soldiers and civilians, which is what we're preparing to do.  And if there are officers who were in authority over the soldiers in that place and who were collaborating, and if there was a collaboration between civilians and the military, which is completely admissible, it doesn't really matter about the soldiers.  

Up to now the Prosecution has not gone outside the bounds of what was communicated to the Defence, and we'll not do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lahaie, I don't fully understand your answer in relation to the specific objection that was made.  The objection that was made related to the introduction of testimony against a participant in the joint criminal enterprise.  That was the specific objection that was raised, and your response didn't address that.  
MR. LAHAIE:
I intend to establish the presence of the witness -- not of this witness, but the presence of the responsible officer, who was a colonel.  I'm not going beyond that.  The rest will be assessed by the Court, in that they will make an assessment of his participation.  I do not intend to admit -- or have admitted conversations with the colonel.  The only thing I want to establish is his presence as a soldier, as well as the presence of civilians, which we will see later -- which civilians assisted the soldiers.  I submit that it is immaterial whether the colonel participated in the enterprise or not.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could add a few comments, Your Honour.  The evidence is important for us precisely because Colonel Nsengiyumva was there, and we don't see this as a notice issue.  This was mentioned in the witness's statement.  There are two statements from the witness; both mention Colonel Nsengiyumva.  The witness testified previously in the Bagosora trial.  There was extensive testimony on Nsengiyumva.  All of that was disclosed to the Accused.  It's simply not reasonable for them to assert that they had no notice of these events.  We cannot plead every single fact in the indictment.  

The Defence made numerous motions, some of which were granted by this Trial Chamber, for us to give specific listing of names of the members of the joint criminal enterprise.  We expanded the listing.  We cannot now go back and plead all of the facts, or all of the allegations against each member of the joint criminal enterprise.  The indictment would run to 500 pages.  

We all have to exercise a degree of reasonableness towards these issues.  It is simply untenable that the Defence did not have notice of this matter:  four different documents; there was at least five days of testimony in the Bagosora trial, all of which was disclosed to the Defence, in addition to the two witness statements.  So notice is not the issue.  

The jurisprudence that addresses this issue asks the question:  Was the Defence reasonably made aware of the case that they would confront?  And it's simply untenable to suggest that they weren't put on notice of these issues.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could briefly respond.  When I heard you give your ruling, you said that you'd allow the Prosecutor to adduce brief evidence of this -- events at Mudende university for the sole purpose of showing cooperation between the military and civilian authority.  And it seems like they've done that.  And to now involve conduct -- when one wants to involve a member of the joint criminal enterprise, it becomes conduct for which the Accused can be held responsible.  So it crosses a line, I think, that you were trying to draw when you gave your ruling.  

The question of notice we discussed yesterday, but the cases are legion that notice does not come from witness statements or prior testimony, but comes from the pre-trial brief and the indictment.  So we didn't have -- we had notice that this witness was accusing Colonel Nsengiyumva, certainly, but we didn't have notice that that would be proved or attempted to be proved during this trial because those documents which form the basis for what's to be proved at this trial didn't make any mention of that.  Thank you.  

And, also, if I could just make one more point, and that is that if we get to -- cross the line where Colonel Nsengiyumva is involved in this incident, then it becomes a matter that has to be addressed during the Defence case.  So some day down the road, 2008, 2009, wherever, I think we'll be dealing with Mudende university, and this is the time where you can exercise some discretion and avoid that.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I completely agree with my friend Robinson, but I would like to respond to what Mr. Webster has said.  

Mr. Webster is confirming the fears we had expressed regarding the indictment when, in motions, we point out that there are parts of the indictment that are not exact, which give the Prosecution a chance to extend its scope infinitely and to prosecute on events all over Rwanda.  We had pointed out that we would withdraw our motion because you would exercise your discretion.  Now Mr. Webster is asking you to exercise discretion to explode the indictment and include elements in the prosecution of the Accused by including events that took place at any time at any point in Rwanda, and thereby the Prosecutor is trying to extend prosecution indefinitely.  

We ask you to put up limits, and now we've reached a crossroads.  It is up to you to contain the Prosecution, based on the indictment, without interpreting it extensively and infinitely. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, my concern with Mr. Weyl's remarks is that -- his reference to pleading events any time and any place, and that's certainly not the case.  These facts took place on -- according to this witness's testimony, on the 7th of April, the day following the shooting down of the presidential plane.  This is germane to the issue of how the violence was put in motion.  That's the core of the case here and the core of the defence.  The Defence position has consistently been that there was no control by the government authorities, that this was some sort of spontaneous - 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, can I ask you this:  Are you contradicting Mr. Lahaie's statement that the only evidence adduced -- to be adduced is the presence of the colonel?  He said evidence was not going to be adduced about what the colonel said or did, but that he was present.  Are you contradicting that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour.  But the colonel -- the colonel figures in this witness's testimony in several instances, not simply his presence at the university that day.  Because he said things in a meeting, and there will be other references to the colonel during the course of this witness's testimony.  

Now, I heard the Court's ruling this morning.  The witness has taken quite a long time to get to this point in his testimony, I thought we would be much quicker in getting there, but that just happens to be the way that this witness answers questions.  Other witnesses get to the point much faster.  But the point -- the -- what we are looking for in this evidence is exactly the role of the military authorities, and specifically Colonel Nsengiyumva.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's different to what was said yesterday afternoon. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a bit different to what was said before. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think it's consistent, Your Honour.  I'd have to be reminded about what was said yesterday afternoon.  But the point is that everything has been disclosed in the witness's statement and in the -- his previous testimony.  There's been ample disclosure on this point.  This is not something that is taking the Defence by surprise.  And what is key in this evidence is the role of military authorities and the collaboration between military and civilian authorities in moving forward the violence that started on the 7th of April. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, if this is a material fact that is important for the Prosecution case, why wasn't it put in the indictment?  You are now elevating it to a different level than we had been given information about earlier.  If it's a material fact, it should have been pleaded. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not a material fact, it's part of the context -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But then -- but you are suggesting -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- and it's part of the -- and it's part of the narrative. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But then you must be careful in how you address us, because your last remark suggested that it was a material fact that was essential to your case.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness's testimony is one narrative, Your Honour, and it starts in its most -- one of the most important aspects of it is what happened after the 7th of April, and that's where this portion of the testimony started.  And the presence of Colonel Nsengiyumva is part of that narrative. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know, but you are now going a bit -- much beyond what Mr. Lahaie had said earlier.  Do you see?  Now -- now, I'm now putting -- now, what are we supposed to expect?  I had a fairly clear idea of what to expect until you've introduced these additional elements, which is now raising other issues.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If we were to allege every instance where any member of the joint criminal enterprise were part of a narrative, the indictment would expand to 300 or 400 pages. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we are not dealing with a general -- with a general principle of the indictment now.  We are    dealing --
MR. WEBSTER:
How are we not -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- we are dealing with what testimony we are going to let this witness adduce.  Now, we have made a ruling that although the Mudende massacre was not referred to specifically in the indictment, nor in the pre-trial brief, that the reference to cooperation between civilian and military authorities before and during the massacres was sufficient notice to allow evidence to be given of that cooperation, using as an example the Mudende massacre, and that we are permitting evidence for that purpose.  And that was consistent with what we were told yesterday was the evidence to be adduced on this issue.  

Now you are now introducing other elements which you are saying that -- which seems to me to suggest that you are trying to prove direct responsibility by a member of the joint criminal enterprise, which elevates it to a position -- elevates the massacre to a material fact.  If that evidence is going to be adduced, it changes the purpose of the testimony that we were made to understand it was being adduced for. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, Your Honour, respectfully, my submission is that the position I've just enunciated is consistent with what the Court said earlier and is consistent with what -- the earlier parts of your comments of a moment or two ago.  Colonel Nsengiyumva is one of the military authorities in Gisenyi.  I don't see the contradiction between -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, the contradiction is this:  We understood from Mr. Lahaie that evidence was going to be adduced that he was present; that evidence was not going to be adduced of conversations he had or behaviour he made.  Now, that's one thing.  

You have now gone on to say that evidence is going to be adduced of speeches that Colonel Nsengiyumva made, which is something different.  That's the issue that I was picking up, as to why I asked if you are contradicting what Mr. Lahaie had said earlier.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that was the simple issue.  That is the hypothetical question I was asking. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, perhaps I should end my -- end my submission here, because I don't recall saying that we would lead evidence on Nsengiyumva's speeches during the course of the massacre. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)... that is what was different.  That is what was different, factually, between what you said and what Mr. Lahaie said.  So my question really was the factual difference between you both.  But if there is no factual difference and that what we are going to be hearing is evidence of Mr. Lahaie -- of Colonel Nsengiyumva's presence, and not his conversation or conduct, then I think we could rule pretty quickly on that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  I'll allow Mr. Lahaie to pick up where he left off. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we have to rule first. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I just think you should know what Mr. Webster is alluding to, because we're going to come back to this time and time again during this testimony.  Because there's a number of other meetings.  You see that in the pre-trial brief there were two meetings referenced, but the witness statement contains a number of other meetings of the CND -- CDR party, particularly, in which either Colonel Nsengiyumva or Colonel Bagosora attended and made remarks.  And I'm anticipating that what Mr. Webster is alluding to is the fact that the Prosecution will also want to introduce evidence of those meetings which are not pleaded anywhere.  

So when you make your ruling, keep in mind that the small door that could be opened could lead to a very large room. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will come to that hurdle when we come to it.

Mr. Lahaie, we think that the evidence of the colonel's presence would fall within the ruling that we had made.  So, in relation to the description of what you had said you'd elicit from the witness, we allow that line to be pursued.  

Could you bring the witness back?  

How long will it take you to complete the evidence on this issue?  
MR. LAHAIE:
I think 15 minutes should be enough.  That's my impression.  One-five.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Are we still on schedule to finish today?  I'm wondering whether we should take the mid-morning break now or complete his testimony first.  It's 10:30.  No, no, no, this issue.  Sorry.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
With your permission, I shall try to finish today, but we have to remember that we began yesterday at 3 p.m., and already took three-quarters of an hour yesterday discussing Counsel Robinson's motion.  And again this morning we've taken 15 minutes for the follow-up to that, and now another half hour.  So, in view of all that, I will try to finish today, but I couldn't swear to it at this stage.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1105H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Lahaie.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, what happened after the arrival of Colonel Nsengiyumva? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, there has been no evidence as to the identity yet of the person who arrived.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	So, Witness, can you tell us how it happens that you can name the officer who arrived? 
A.	Before answering the Prosecutor's question, I should like, if you allow me, to say something to the President of the Trial Chamber, to the presiding Judge, because I should like to know my rights before this Trial Chamber.  So, I should like to know -- be informed as to the procedure in force before the Trial Chamber and then, after that, I shall continue testifying.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not certain exactly what your question is, but in relation to the -- your general position as a witness, the duty of the Judges would be to evaluate whether questions that are put to you are in accordance with the rules of evidence and procedure.  If we come to the conclusion that a question is improper, we would advise you not to answer it.  So, basically, we are the judges of what is a proper enquiry, and we will allow proper questions to be put to you and prevent improper questions from being put.  I don't know if that covers what your question was.  Or is there something else you'd like to ask?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  You have answered the question that I had not yet put.  I was asking you, in fact, for permission to put the question.  I did not yet put the question.  It's simply this:  The laws in force here are international laws that -- with which I am not familiar, so there are many things that I am not familiar with.  I should like, therefore, you to authorise me -- allow me to put the question because I feel a bit confused.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may ask the question you have in mind.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  It is not by chance that I am before this Trial Chamber.  I made statements in Rwanda which were brought here to Arusha, and then I was summoned to testify.  It is therefore not by chance that I am here.  It was something that was organised.  Since yesterday, therefore, until now, I was able to note -- observe -- imperfections in the proceedings.  I note that the man sitting next to Mr. Nzirorera harbours concerns.  I see that he conducts himself as someone who attempts to dictate to the Trial Chamber what it should do, and whatever questions put by the Prosecution, he wants me to answer as he wishes.  I have never seen such conduct, and I'm wondering whether this Trial Chamber, this Tribunal, should really hire such people.  

I know the Prosecutor has the right to put whatever question he wants to me, and I know that the cross-examination has not begun yet.  I have been asked to leave the Trial Chamber on several occasions because of that person.  I no longer understand, and I should like you to urge him to follow your instructions.  I see that he is trying to take the Trial Chamber hostage.  I know that you want to discover the truth, but as I see it, the truth cannot be discovered under such circumstances.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the procedure of the Trial Chamber is governed by rules of practice and procedure, and if you are interested, these are public documents with which you have access to, if you wish.  In a trial of this nature, there are rules which govern what questions can be asked and what questions cannot be asked, and parties in the trial have the right to apply to the Judges to make rulings on those issues.  

Now, sometimes it is felt that when the legal issues concerning the question is being discussed, it would be better that the witness not hear the discussion because it may influence the way the witness answers questions afterwards.  So, on the occasions when you are asked to leave the court, it was simply for the exact reason that confused you:  It was to prevent you from hearing our discussion, just to minimise the possibility that what we say or what anybody said may have a bearing on the way you gave your evidence.  So it was -- those instances were exactly in conformity with the rules that we operate under.  

On each occasion objections have been raised, the Bench has ruled, and the trial has been conducted in accordance with the rulings that we have made.  In our system, each party has the right to make objections and it is the duty of the Judge -- the Judges, to decide how those objections should be resolved.  

Now, with regard to the last question that was issued, you had been asked just before the break a question concerning the identity of the military official who had entered.  And although it was clear from the statement you'd previously given what your answer would have been, the objection had been made before you made your answer.  

Now, when we resumed just a few minutes ago, the question was put to you as though you had already answered, and the comment from counsel was that you had not yet answered the question.  That's what the meaning of his question was.  So the Prosecutor, without any intervention from the Bench, put the question to you again in a different manner, which would enable you to explain how you knew the identity and what the identity of the person was.  So I think it's quite proper for the proceedings to continue in this way, and for you to answer the question put to you by Mr. Lahaie.  Does that answer your concern?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Yes.  You have indeed made it clear what the proper procedure is.  
(Pages 1 to 15 by Karen Holm)











1120H 
THE WITNESS:
I should like to add a word in respect of your explanations which was, indeed, very clear.  With respect to proceedings here at the Tribunal, before continuing, I wonder whether counsel really wants to know what happened.  He should allow witnesses to answer before rushing to raise motions.  I am a Rwandan, he is a foreigner, I know what happened.  Even if you don't have my previous statements, I can -- I am able to repeat to you what is written in those statements.  No one can order me as to how to say it.  The essential thing, as far as I am concerned, is not to exclude someone who testifies.  Apart from deliberations between the Judges, any member of the public has a right to follow the debate.  It was a serious matter that has required the presence of your Honourable selves.  It is a bit strange that the witness is not left the time to explain himself, narrate the events, and that we discuss the various matters arising from the testimony.  However, your few words of guidance have, indeed, enlightened me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now we can proceed now, Mr. Lahaie. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I would like to make an intervention here.  First of all, I would like to assure the witness that he will be given a full opportunity to say anything he wants to say, if not during the Prosecution questioning, during my examination.  So I don't think he should be concerned about that.  But I do think I should raise before the Trial Chamber now, since he has talked about his rights, the fact that he testified during the Bagosora case about the events in Mudende university, and some other events that occurred on the 8th and 9th of April.  And after he gave that testimony, some Defence witnesses came and testified in the Bagosora case.  For example, ************************************** ***********************************************************************************************************, test --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Robinson, this is not -- 
MR. LAHAIE:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it is not appropriate at this stage to do this.  
MR. ROBINSON:
What I am suggesting is that perhaps the Trial Chamber should advise him of his rights against self incrimination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  He is not asked that question.  If he has a question about self incriminating, he can ask it.  He is -- he raised the question which was answered, and I have answered this question.  This matter will be explored in cross-examination if you wish. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
But I think it is important for the Trial Chamber to note that there exists, on the record -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know, but I don't think it is appropriate for you to bring it at this stage or in this manner. 

Mr. Lahaie, could you continue, please.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, to come back to the question:  Why do you say that the officer who came was Colonel Nsengiyumva? 
MR. WEYL: 
We still haven't heard the name.  This is -- the question is the answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lahaie, I think what happened was this, that when you asked the question before the break, as to the identity of the officer who came, the witness has not answered that question as yet.  So if you could just ask that question so we could have the witness's answer, and then we can move on. 
MR. LAHAIE:
I'm sorry, I thought the witness had given the name, which was why the objection was raised.  So now -- okay. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Witness, you said an officer came.  Witness, you say that an officer came after 30 or 40 minutes, after the arrival of the ONTRACOM bus.  Can you tell us who that officer was?
A.	Thank you.  The officer in question was Colonel Nsengiyumva.  We don't need to spend so much time on this.  I knew him well.  Even before I saw him there, I knew him.  He was the ops commander Gisenyi, so I knew him.  I don't know if you've got any particular interest in this.  There are other things to discuss.  I knew that individual very well.  And you don't need to suggest -- there is no question of your suggesting the name to me, it is someone whom I know well.  And I don't know why we are wasting so much time on that topic.  
Q.	Well, thank you, Witness.  To come back to the events, what happened after the arrival of           Colonel Nsengiyumva? 
A.	After the arrival of Colonel Nsengiyumva, other soldiers -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could you ask the witness to repeat those names.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the interpreters have requested that you repeat the names.  They didn't get them. 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And, perhaps, you could speak a little slower too, sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And they have also requested that you speak a little bit slower to facilitate with the translation. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will repeat.  After Colonel Nsengiyumva's arrival, other officers,     Lieutenant Udahemuka, Fidèle, Lieutenant Nduwahezu, Sergeant Rukara, who is in charge of the gendarme, stationed at the Mudende university. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	And what happened then? 
A.	They asked for the inhabitants, the locals to be -- to move away from the enclosure, which they did.  They fell back about 100 yards, 100 metres. 
Q.	And when the population -- when the locals fell back, what happened then? 
A.	When the locals fell back -- let me backtrack slightly.  Once Colonel Nsengiyumva had ordered that the locals fall back, the colonel left.  And it was the officers that I just mentioned Udahemuka, Fidèle, Nduwahezu and Sergeant Rukara took over and led the operations there.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to ask that the portion of the witness' testimony where he indicated that Colonel Nsengiyumva ordered the civilians to move back be stricken as being statements of Colonel Nsengiyumva which you have already ruled should not be elicited.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we don't agree with you.  We can't -- the witness's testimony was basically evidence that the colonel left, and to strike any part of that testimony makes nonsense of his evidence.  He wanted to say that the colonel left before certain things occurred, and it is his way of describing the time of his departure. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, and I don't have any objection, Mr. President, with the fact that the colonel left, but what the colonel said -- you'd already ruled that he wasn't allowed to say what the colonel said, and then he volunteered it.  I agree, Mr. Lahaie didn't do anything to elicit it, but now it's on the record and I'm asking that it be taken off record. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't take it off the record now. 
MR. LAHAIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	So, after the departure of the colonel, you said that the remaining soldiers proceeded with their operation.  Now, what was that operation? 
A.	As I said, the locals were removed.    
Q.	And then? 
A.	The Tutsi who were in that establishment were invited to come out, and that those who had firearms should hand them over. 
Q.	Yes, and after that? 
A.	They were also invited, if there were any Inyenzi among them, to identity them and bring them forward. 
Q.	And did any students, to the best of your knowledge, identify any Inyenzi to the authorities? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And then what happened after those who came out were taken away? 
A.	Then, subsequently, there was exchange of bad words, insults flew back and forth.  The people inside the establishment began to throw stones at the soldiers, and the soldiers began to shoot at them. 
Q.	And how long did the shooting last? 
A.	It lasted a long time, I think about an hour and a half or two hours. 
Q.	And what happened to the Tutsi who were being fired upon, shot at? 
A.	Well, you know when you shoot at someone, he is hit with bullets and he either is wounded -- he's either injured or killed. 
Q.	I understand that you stayed for some time at that place.  How long did you stay there yourself? 
A.	I stayed there for quite some time; I think I went home at about 5 p.m. 
Q.	And did you return to the university on the next day, the 10th? 
A.	You know, local people had no longer anything to say.  We couldn't go to the fields to do our normal farming.  People were wandering around everything because of all of the killing that was going on.  So I went back on the 10th. 
Q.	And when did you arrive at that place? 
A.	At about 11 a.m., I think. 
Q.	And can you tell us what the situation was at the university then? 
A.	Among the people who had been fired upon, some were dead.  Their bodies were still there; the corpses were still lying there.  Inside the establishment there was a garden with small grottos and humps of earth, and they were seeking to see if there weren't any people hiding there. 
Q.	And who was doing the seeking? 
A.	Some of the soldiers, but also there were Interahamwe civilians who knew the place, were familiar with it, so it was they who undertook that operation. 
Q.	Do you remember the names of any civilians who took part in that operation? 
A.	Yes, there are some people whose names I still recall. 
Q.	Could you please tell the Trial Chamber what they were? 
A.	There was one Masogisi, one Mburana -- Masogisi, Mburana, Semanza, Pascal Rugirangoga. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Masogisi is number 49 on the list; Mburano, that is number 50 where it is written Mburana, but really it is Mburano, number 50.  Semanza is not on the list.  
A.	If his name is not on the list, it might be one Wacaca. Rugirangoga is also not on the list, R-U-G-I-R-A-N-G-O-G-A. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think the witness added the name of a person.  Could he repeat that name and spell it out, please, if possible. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, you gave us the name of Wacaca, unless I'm mistaken.  Was it that person's name, or a nickname, or an alias? 
A.	Semanza was an Interahamwe who was well known, and he was nicknamed Wacaca, which means -- which is spelt W-A-C-A-C-A, Wacaca. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  To change the subject, during the period during which you were a member of CDR and MRND -- and MDR, rather, did you ever attend political rallies?  
A.	Are you referring to the period prior to 1994 or after 1994?  Yes, I attended political rallies. 
Q.	Why were you attending these political rallies? 
A.	I have told you already, if I'm not mistaken.  I think I told you yesterday that I was a member of MDR and that******************************************************.  As I told you, my party numbered about      400 members.  Some of the CDR members were -- and they tried to get me to leave the party.  I was beaten, even, and I had to report this to the relevant authorities because in Gisenyi préfecture the party was not well regarded.  So I had to align myself with that party for security reasons.  I did not want to keep being suspected.  I was closely monitored.  And that is why I attended those political rallies.  
Q.	And in autumn 1993, did you attend a political rally in Gisenyi? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately what period of 1993 the meeting took place? 
A.	It is very difficult to remember the events which took place a long time ago.  I remember that even when I was addressing the investigators, I told them it was around November or October 1993. 
Q.	And in which part of Gisenyi did the political rally take place? 
A.	The political rally was held at the Umuganda stadium. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court who had organised the rally? 
A.	I did not organise the political rally, but I was supposed to attend it because I wanted to know what was going to be said. 
Q.	What political party organised the rally?
A.	It was a political rally of the MRND party. 
Q.	Do you know the approximate number of people who attended the rally? 
A.	It is difficult for me to be precise, but the stadium was full.  I know that even prior to the political rally we would attend matches there.  And it was said that the stadium could hold 5,000 people.  Therefore, I think that on the occasion of the political rally, the stadium contained between 3,000 and 5,000 people.  
Q.	Can you tell us if you remember some of the political figures in attendance at the meeting? 
A.	There were the leaders of the party at the time. 
Q.	Who were they? 
A.	There was the party president, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the vice president, Karemera, and the second vice-president, Kabagena, as well as the secretary, namely, Joseph Nzirorera. 
Q.	Were there any other figures apart from those people? 
A.	Yes, there were.  I can cite Ngirabatware; the president of MRND in Gisenyi préfecture, Wellars Banzi; military authorities like Bagosora and Nsengiyumva. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Now, to spell the names, Ngirabatware is number 68 on the list.  The others, I think, are well known.  
BY MR. LAHAIE: 
Q.	Who was president of assembly during that political rally? 
A.	When you say "assembly", I think of the parliament.  Is that the question you are putting?  Are you referring to the assembly, the gathering of people in that place?  
Q.	Who was chairing the meeting, or presiding at the rally? 
A.	Generally, it is the president who should chair such meetings, and the president was indeed present, namely, Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Can you tell us what you recall about the meeting, as well as the people who took the floor, what they said and who they were? 
A.	People took the floor one after the other, and all of the speeches were basically on the same theme, that is, they were sensitising members of the population to the party.  They were there in search of members.  In brief, all the speeches that were made were on that subject. 
Q.	So, can you tell us, first of all, who were the main speakers at the event? 
A.	The first speaker who took the floor was the president -- that is understandable -- the president of the MRND in Gisenyi préfecture, it was Mr. Wellars Banzi. 
Q.	And can you summarise his remarks, Mr. Wellars Banzi's remarks? 
A.	He talked about the party.  He said the party was strong, that it had lots of members, but he said there was a need for the membership to grow.  He gave the number of members of the MRND.  He said that the MRND had 75 percent of the population in that area as members.  He saluted the members or the authorities who were present, and he asked them to take the floor to sensitise the population to keep joining the party. 
Q.	And who was next speaker?  
A.	Other people spoke, but some spoke for only a few minutes.  I no longer recall, but we listened to the speeches by the top officials very carefully.  So, generally, one can remember the points that were brought up. 
Q.	Of the important personalities who took the floor at the meeting, can you tell us who you remember? 
A.	I remember that Ngirabatware spoke and that he spoke about the party.  He said that, in Gisenyi, at the place where the political rally had been held, that that area was close to his native area, and that if the MRND has 75 percent of the membership of the population, that that was still insufficient.  And, therefore, he stressed the need to keep increasing the numbers so that the MRND was represented a hundred percent in that area, as was the case prior to the advent of multi-party politics. 
Q.	Of the other speakers, important speakers, who was the next one you remember? 
A.	I'm not sure if I should tell you about everybody or whether I should just limit myself to those Accused who are present. 
Q.	Of those whose names you cited a few minutes ago.  
A.	Bagosora also took the floor, but he was not in uniform.  He was in civilian attire. 
Q.	And what was the content of his speech? 
A.	He talked about the Arusha Peace Accords, and he said that he had never had confidence in the accords.  He said he was not at all happy because he could not fathom how power would be shared with the people who had killed his relatives.  He said that the RPF had nothing good to bring.  He said they would simple restore serfdom.  He called on the youth to support the national army so as to confront or face the RPF.  He said the RPF was thirsty for power and that they were just playing games in terms of what they said. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Webster, could you ask counsel to repeat that question, please?  Sorry.
THE WITNESS:
It was quite understandable.  There was a need to undergo training, military training, so that if ever there was a need to recruit soldiers, such an operation would go down very quickly if it was already in place and that it would not result in problems. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Thank you. And was there any question of financial contributions? 
A.	The youth were invited to support the army, to undergo military training in order assist the army.  And this shows that the youth were supposed to be prepared to deploy their strength.  As for the rest of the population, they were invited to make contributions. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Because we missed Mr. Lahaie's question in English, I am wondering is he still speaking about what Bagosora is saying, or are we talking about some other speaker?  

MR. LAHAIE:
The question was in the context of Bagosora's speech. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just clarify it and ...(inaudible)
MR. LAHAIE:
Yes. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	When you say you were asked to make financial contributions, who asked you to make financial contributions? 
A.	It was said that the army needed the contributions.  And he wasn't the only one who said it.  He said that we should not -- that the RPF did not believe in sharing power.  From what he could see, the RPF would continue to fight. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, in relation to the other people you mentioned as being present at the rally, from the list you gave us, who else took the floor? 
A.	It is Karemera who was next, who took the floor. 
Q.	What did he say? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe counsel said off mike.
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	What did Mr. Karemera say?
A.	He simply urged members of the population to remain vigilant.  I thought I had answered the question. 
Q.	Did he say anything else? 
A.	He just urged members of the population to be tolerant and to prepare to co-exist with the Inkotanyi, even though they had been offended by the Inkotanyi.  He said that if ever the Inkotanyi arrived and began to stir trouble amongst the population, ways and means to resolve the problem would be found. 
Q.	Was he more specific in his speech? 
A.	I told you what I heard, what I understood from the speech he made.  He did not make it any clearer.  He just told the population that even if Rwanda had -- or, was engaged in war against the Inkotanyi, there was, however, a policy of tolerance, so that we could cohabit with the Inkotanyi.  He went on to say that even though the Inkotanyi had offended or attacked members of the population, like those in Ruhengeri préfecture, during the elections, there would be a chance to avenge this vis-à-vis the Inkotanyi so that violence was not to be employed.  In the meantime, he also went on to speak about the sensitisation process that would ensue, nothing out of the ordinary since other political parties were also doing it. 
Q.	In his speech, did he mention the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Yes.  When he said if ever the Inkotanyi acted badly, they should not be allowed to speak, and by that one should understand that they should not vote.  And he said that if ever the Inkotanyi started acting badly, we should no longer comply with the Arusha Accords. 
Q.	And that meeting lasted how long? 
A.	That rally lasted about three hours.  That political rallies lasted about three hours. 
Q.	And who closed the rally? 
A.	It was the president who brought that -- that was Mathieu Ngirumpatse brought the meeting to a close -- the rally to a close. 
Q.	Can you tell us what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said in his closing statements -- the words, speech? 
A.	He spoke of the party.  He said that the party was strong, that it had the necessary strength to defend itself.  He went on saying that if anybody doubted that, they only had to look at the Interahamwe.  There were more than 500 Interahamwe.  Those that came from Kigali, wearing uniforms, brought to the place of the rally in buses from Ruhengeri and various parts of Gisenyi. 
Q.	And what did the Interahamwe -- and what did the uniform that the Interahamwe were wearing at that rally consist of? 
A.	Well, I don't know how to explain it.  All I can tell you is that they had special types of clothes. 
Q.	Well, can you give us a description of the particular type of clothes that the Interahamwe were wearing? 
A.	Well, they were, first of all, made of material normally worn by women, a material -- a textile called kitenge.  Normally it is women that wear wraps of kitenge, or shirts could be made of kitenge.  They were wearing trousers and shirts made of kitenge and caps or hats. 
Q.	And what were the colours of those clothes? 
A.	Green -- especially green and a bit of yellow. 
Q.	And why were those colours in particular worn by the Interahamwe? 
A.	Well, maybe the people who supplied those clothes can tell you why.  I can't go into details concerning the party.  Those people can tell you why they gave them such clothes. 
Q.	And when you say "the party", is it because those colours are -- were particular -- were associated with a party in particular? 
A.	Well, indeed, each party chose the colours of party members.  Whether shirts and trousers or caps, I think it was a way of recognising each other by members of the same party.  Each party had its specific colours. 
Q.	And those colours in particular, which party were they associated with? 
A.	The colors I mention, the green and yellow, I think there was also a bit of red, were the colours of the MRND.  And those people wearing shirts and trousers and caps may even -- made up of kitenge material. 
Q.	Was mention made of military training in what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said? 
A.	Well, as he was backing up what Bagosora said, he also asked that the youth go on undergoing training so that they might, if necessary, intervene on the front, and they should be kept on the back burner so as to intervene when necessary and to contribute financially to the army. 
Q.	And the means of defence discussed at the time, was there a place where such techniques had been taught in the past or where they should be taught in the future? 
A.	In 1993 the apparatus existed, but it was clear that it wasn't yet established everywhere.  We had to increase efforts and there would be several places where the training could be organised and rapidly dispensed and the material should be increased.  I know that military training was dispensed in a military camp and, in view of the distance, it was necessary to find another place away from local residences to give the military training.  So at the ISAR -- I-S-A-R -- Mutura communal officers and Bigogwe.  Training was given in those places.  
Q.	And who was giving that training? 
A.	Soldiers. 
Q.	And who underwent that training? 
A.	Youth.  The young people and some adults, but who had the necessary strength, were still sufficiently strong to undergo that training. 
Q.	And were those people soldiers or not? 
A.	Do you mean the people receiving the training or the trainers? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel should be invited to observe a slight pause.  I think he was saying the people undergoing the training. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Well, if are you a soldier, why should you receive military training and manipulation of firearms? 
A.	It was people who didn't know how the use firearms.  They were the people receiving the training. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Well, that line of questioning is now completed, Mr. President.  I don't know if you want to take the break now or if I should start now the following line of questioning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you still on track to complete this afternoon?  
MR. LAHAIE:
Yes, unless there is any other -- there are action by my learned friends opposite which might delay things.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Lahaie, I take it that you have given an undertaking and, on that basis, we take the adjournment now.  We take our lunch recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1220H to 1425H)
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	In early 1994, did you attend any other meeting at the Gisenyi préfecture? 
A.	Yes, I attended another meeting, that was between the month of April and March.  It wasn't a meeting like the others, it wasn't a rally like the others, it was rather a meeting. 
Q.	That meeting was for party officials who had gathered to discuss some issues and look into some matters which had become problematic.  Where did that meeting take place, specifically? 
A.	The meeting held at the MRND palace in Gisenyi. 
Q.	How many people attended that meeting? 
A.	About 500 people. 
Q.	Could you give us the names of the figures of authority who were present at that meeting? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to any evidence of this meeting because it is not contained in the pre-trial brief or the indictment. 
MR. LAHAIE:
Well, Mr. President, what is happening is that the witness is giving an idea of the date at which the meeting took place.  And if my learned colleague would look at the statement, he would realise that we are talking about the same meeting.  It is not the same -- it is not different from the meeting mentioned in the indictment. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I believe that this is only a supposition on the part of the Prosecutor, which is to my mind baseless because nothing has been led to establish that to stand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)... there has been no evidence for now.  Yeah, what I said was that in view of your statement that this is consistent with the meeting that was in the indictment, we will allow you to proceed on that basis. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, there is no meeting in the indictment.  So this is not consistent at all with anything that's in the indictment, but in the last sentence of the pre-trial brief, for the witness summary, it says the witness will testify about an MRND and CDR rally held in February 1994 in Gisenyi, and now the witness is talking about a meeting at the -- in March or April.  So if it is the same meeting, then it is in the pre-trial brief but not in the indictment.  But there is no meeting in the indictment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lahaie. 
MR. LAHAIE:
That meeting is, indeed, mentioned in the pre-trial brief which, as we know, is complementary to the indictment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But when you said the indictment, you meant the pre-trial brief; is that the position?  

MR. LAHAIE:
Yes, that is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you can proceed to identify the date when this meeting took place. 
MR. LAHAIE:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now let us return to the question.  Could you give us the name of the main figures of authority who were present at that meeting? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Can you identify the date of the meeting first before we go on to talk about those who were present at the meeting? 
MR. LAHAIE:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, could you be more specific as to the date on which that meeting originally took place? 
A.	It is very difficult to be specific as to the date on which the meeting originally held.  All I can say -- can only be by way of approximation.  I am not in a position to give you an exact date because I am not the one who organised that meeting.  
Q.	What then would be your approximate date, Witness, for the benefit of the Court? 
A.	It was towards the end of February and early March. 
Q.	Which political party organised that rally? 
A.	The CDR. 
Q.	So, returning to the initial question, who was present at that meeting among the figures of authority whom you know? 
A.	CDR party officials were present, military officials were also present, Barayagwiza and Hassan Rugeze were present on behalf of the party.  Now, as far as the army goes, Anatole and Bagosora were present. 
Q.	When you say Anatole, could you please spell out his name, his full name? 
A.	Anatole Nsengiyumva. 
Q.	Who spoke first at that meeting? 
A.	If I remember properly it is Mr. Barayagwiza. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court your recollection of the meeting and what Mr. Barayagwiza said? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I have an objection to this.  It has nothing to do with the pre-trial brief.  I would like to be heard on this outside of the presence of the witness. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it is too early.  Let us hear the witness's answer first and then I can see if it is necessary to hear you on this. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, it is a relevance objection, so I don't think the answer should come in until you have decided. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have -- you may have the benefit of anticipating what the witness is likely to say.  We don't have the benefit of that.  So there is a lack of -- it is a little bit illogical for us to make a determination of the relevance and we don't know what he is likely to say.  We will (microphones overlapping) on the point of relevance, but I just need -- the pre-trial brief has made a -- has indicated something and I would like to find out whether what the witness says is consistent or not. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, before Mr. Robinson speaks, could he please be asked to raise his microphone. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Witness, do you want me to repeat the question? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber your recollections of Mr. Barayagwiza's speech? 
A.	In his speech he, first of all, said that the CDR had agreed to take up the post that had been given to it within the parliament.  He went on to say that the CDR had agreed to take up the post, whereas the party had for a very long time refused it.  He added that there were difficulties faced by -- or, posed by people who did not want the CDR to occupy that post.  So the minister of foreign affairs,           Anathase Gasana, who had refused to approve the post, including that minister.  He gave the reasons that led to acceptance of the post by the CDR.  He said that the CDR had only been granted one post, and yet the CDR was a very important party because some politicians had betrayed the CDR and the country, and that those politicians wanted power to fall into the hands of the RPF.  He also raised the issue of some politicians who had been killed and added that the RPF was attacking Hutu politicians and that it intended to exterminate them.

He also gave the names of Bucyana and Gatabazi, or made mention of those names.  He said that this was a long-term plan, that there were accomplices in Kigali, many accomplices, and by accomplices, one must understand the people supporting the RPF.  So he said that these accomplices having benefitted from all of the advantages on offer in the country now wanted to side with the RPF having been spoiled.  He invited the participants to the meeting to address members in their party to fell trees, so that these tree trunks could be used to barricade the roads, so that the city of Kigali would not be supplied in foodstuffs from Gisenyi.  It was to be noted that Gisenyi préfecture provided food supplies to Kigali.  He was referring to potatoes and beer produced at BRALIRWA.  He said there was a need to continue the training undergone by the youth, that the number of youths undergoing the training should be increased because he had noticed that under such circumstances force was to be resorted to.
In summary, therefore, that is what I remember of the contents of his speech.  I recall that, indeed, there were demonstrations in Kigali city four days later, I believe, so there was a response to the invitation given.  
Q.	Was there mention of weapons, to be specific, firearms, in his speech? 
A.	I just mention the fact that he said there was a need to continue sensitising the youth to participate in the military training.  And in order to dispense the training, military training, there was a need to have firearms. 
Q.	Did Barayagwiza make specific request of the soldiers in his speech? 
A.	That is exactly what I have said.  He said there was a need to provide weapons to the youth.  So you could not just train the youths, they were also to be given firearms so that the youths could arm themselves with them. 
Q.	Thank you.  And who was the next speaker? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  May I now be heard on my objection?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Outside of the presence of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we don't think the witness should go out.  If the issue has to do with relevance, he has already given his testimony and he can't be influenced by the argument. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well I beg to differ, Mr. President, because I think he is going to give testimony about other things said at the meeting.  My relevance objection deals with the entire meeting.  I am going to ask you to strike any reference to this meeting.  I recall Judge Short asked us, at one time when we were discussing relevance, "Why are you conducting this discussion in the presence of the witness with his headphones on?"  And I remember I said, "You are right.  We should have the witness take his headphones off." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but, you see -- if are you going to address the relevance of matters that he has not spoken about, we cannot address it at this stage.  If the issue is relevance, then I would like to hear what he has to say. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, we seem to be departing from the normal way you conducted this trial, and I fear that it is in some way a reaction to what this witness said about me controlling the Trial Chamber which is, of course, not true. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that is not the point.  We are dealing now with your argument about relevance.  I said earlier       that -- that in view of what has been happening; we have not had the benefit of knowledge of the witness statements of this witness.  So we are, in a sense, not well armed to make a logical appreciation of relevance until we know what he said.  It is a bit illogical to rule on relevance if we don't know what is said.  So once -- I thought that we were going to hear you on the relevance of the last thing, about which evidence has already been given, in case he can be influenced.  If you are going to include in your submissions relevance or matters which have not yet been said, we are not going to be able to adjudicate.  So, in that case, it would be better for you to allow him to give his testimony and then we can hear your argument properly. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, what I have to say relates to what he has already said and extends to what he will say about other speeches.  And if he hears what I have to say, he could adapt what he says about the other -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that, but then -- just -- we don't want to hear the argument twice.  So if you are going to make the argument again, let's hear his testimony, we get rid of it and then we can hear your argument. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, with all due respect, Your Honour, in every trial, especially when there is a jury, judges have to decide relevance before they hear the testimony, but --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but we don't have a jury in this trial. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
But we haven't proceeded in this trial, up until now, to hear all the testimony and then un-ring the bell.  That is what you are asking us to do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but this -- I know, but this is not -- this is -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think if it is a problem of the witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, the problem is, Mr. Robinson, when we started out this issue with this witness this morning, it turned out after the testimony had been given that there was a bit of a storm in the teacup.  And I don't want to waste time with that same thing now.  So it would seem to save time and would be in a position to adjudicate more effectively if we could assess the evidence on the basis of what the witness has said.  It just seems to be a more effective way of approaching this matter. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, from the point of view -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
And, in any event, right, what has happened up to now does not seem to differ -- does not seem to be too far outside.  I don't want to say anything more at this stage if we are dealing with matters for the future. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, as an advocate -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
-- we don't -- I don't think it is a very good practice to have the Trial Chamber hear evidence and then be expected to erase it.  I realise you are professional judges, but you are also human.  And we wasted a lot of time to hear evidence that might be excluded rather than dealing with it up front.  And to me this seems to be a different approach that we are taking with this witness than we have taken in the past, but, in any event, I will sit down and let you hear -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, it is very difficult for the French interpreters to operate between exchanges.  The exchanges are so frequent and there is no pause given for the interpreters to work and finish the translations.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. President, may I say something?  

Mr. Robinson, if a witness starts to talk about a meeting, and before he gives facts about the meeting, you get up and object, it seems that your objection is sort of premature, because we don't know exactly what meeting he is going to talk about.  You see, so isn't it better to wait to hear the evidence and then you draw our attention to the fact that this evidence about this particular meeting was not relevant or has not been pleaded.  If you jump to your feet, even before he has given evidence about the meeting, how are we able to determine the issue of relevance?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Because I -- I waited until he gave the part -- the identity of the participants of the meeting.  And once he had given the identity of the participants of the meeting, my relevance objection became very understandable to you, if I were allowed to do it in a way other than speaking in a riddle because the witness is here.  So once the participants of the meeting were known, my objection would make sense to you, if I am allowed to state it.  But we spent a lot of time, you know, going around this and, in the end, it is very -- to hear the whole -- to hear the whole story of the meeting and then to hear my objection seems to be a very backwards way of proceeding.  And it seems to me if my objection were well taken; you would not have to hear any of the content of the speeches, but -- and that is the way I am normally used to proceeding.  If you make a relevance objection, you get the right to state your objection and you get -- the judge thinks it's premature after you have had a full opportunity to state your grounds and they can deny the objection, but it seems like I'm being expected to wait until the whole story is out and then, by that time, my objection has a lot less force since you have heard all of the evidence.  And we are just dealing with what can be in your judgement and what can't be.  It doesn't seem very satisfying to have you hear evidence which is not relevant and then tell us that you are going to disregard it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lahaie, how much time is involved in leading the rest of the evidence of this meeting?  
MR. LAHAIE:
I think 30 minutes should be sufficient because this morning my colleague was objecting to us going beyond the preliminary brief and now he is criticising us for sticking to the parameters of the preliminary brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that is not what I understand.  He says that this evidence that you intend to lead is not falling within the pre-trial brief; that is what I understand his objection to be.  Is that the point,                                  Mr. Webster -- Mr. Robinson?  I apologise. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No.  I'm saying it is within the pre-trial brief -- I'm saying it is not relevant.  So there's nothing to do with whether it is within the pre-trial brief or the indictment.  It is not relevant to the charges in the indictment, whether it is in the pre-trial brief or not because of the participants of the meeting.  I can be very -- you know, I could have explained this very clearly if we could have done it without the witness listening.  I could do -- if he just takes his headphones off and you don't hear from anybody in French, we can do it right now.  But it is very difficult to express my objection under these circumstances. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
May I offer a practical solution and we can discuss this in English and the witness can remove his headphones?  Would that satisfy Mr. Robinson?  He can represent the Defence and I will represent the Prosecution in English?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, in that case we may withdraw from the courtroom. 
MR. WEYL: 
Do I need a video link conference with my learned friend?  Indeed, I do not think, Mr. President, that this would be a solution. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
My understanding is that Mr. Robinson's request was that we speak in English, the witness would remove his headphones, he would not hear the interpretation in French, and he would not understand what was being said, but he would still remain in the room.  If I am wrong, Mr. Robinson can correct me and the Court can suggest another solution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, that was what Mr. Robinson suggested as well, but Mr. Robinson is not the only person in the courtroom.  So I think one has to respect the interests of the other lawyers, the francophones. 
Mr. Witness, although you complained this morning about being asked to leave the courtroom, the situation has again developed where we need to have a discussion which ought not to be heard by you in the middle of your testimony.  So, unfortunately, I have to ask you once more to excuse us for a few minutes. 
THE WITNESS:
No problem, Mr. President.  But before I leave, I would like to say something, Mr. President.  Before I leave Mr. President, I would like to say something.

I am asked -- we are sure the Defence lawyer -- I see he is very worried.  I do not understand why he is so worried.  Before I appeared before this Court, the day before yesterday, he told me he wanted to see me, he wanted to meet me, so I refused, but I do not see why he is afraid.  I am relating the facts as I know them.  I am not making anything up.  I am not preventing you from pursuing your interests.  I therefore do not understand why you are afraid. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness adds, Mr. President, that he does not understand why he is constantly being made to exit the room.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  My objection is that this meeting of the CDR party, at which no MRND officials attended, contrary to what is indicated in the pre-trial brief, has no link whatsoever to any of the issues in this case to any of the Accused, and therefore it is irrelevant and it shouldn't -- no evidence of this meeting should be heard, or the evidence that has already been heard should be stricken because meetings of other political parties, whether they be with military officials or not, certainly they are not pled in the indictment, and they are not relevant to the charges against the Accused whether -- even if they were in the pre-trial brief.  So our point is that this evidence is -- should not be received because it lacks any link to the Accused.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, Your Honour, I beg to differ.  If you will -- if the Court will recall, during the testimony, I believe it was Witness T, I believe it was Mr. Robinson that brought out, during his cross-examination, the notion of an alliance between the CDR and the MRND and several other parties.  That evidence also came to light from witness Mbonyunkiza, if I'm not mistaken, but at least two or three other witnesses were asked questions both from the Prosecution and from the Defence, and I think the Defence dwelled on it much longer than the Prosecution, about the alliance between the CDR and MRND and several other parties that was assembled during towards the end of 1992.  

In the pre-trial brief and in the indictment there is a reference to the parties acting together.  I can refer the Court to paragraph 30 of the indictment and paragraph 50 of the pre-trial brief.  So there are several references both in the pre-trial brief and the indictment, and from the witness testimony, and from this witness's statement, and from the thrust of the cross-examinations in this case that deal with the issue of parties working together, one coalition versus another coalition, MRND and CDR, PECO and PADER on one side of the line, and some of the opposition parties on the other side of the line.  In fact, it was Mr. Robinson that introduced in evidence an exhibit that documented the alliance between the CDR and the MRND.  So I fail to understand why he sees this as an irrelevant issue from this witness when he himself brought it out from other witnesses.  So I disagree with his submission and I would ask the Court to allow us to proceed. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, for one thing, the alliance was over -- introduced by other exhibits in the case in nineteen -- early 1993 when the CDR sent a letter, which is an exhibit in evidence, saying that they no longer -- they repudiated the alliance.  So Mr. Webster is factually incorrect, given that this meeting took place in 1994.  But nevertheless, simply because other political parties are involved with the Rwanda events doesn't make it relevant to these Accused everything that is said at meetings which they were not participants.  And this is, again, another area where, once you open this door to allowing     meetings -- evidence of meetings that are so remote from the indictments and from these Accused, you simply will require us to answer these factual issues and lengthen the trial.  This is another opportunity to exercise some discretion concerning the scope of the allegations that we have to face.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Well, Your Honour, while I agree with Mr. Robinson that sometimes -- that at some point in 1993 there was a disagreement, or there was a -- a disagreement on certain policy issues between the CDR and MRND, they still came together, and if there was no formal alliance, there was a de facto alliance.  In fact, the last witness that testified, Witness BTH, spoke about a militia force of Impuzamugambi which several witnesses have identified as the youth wing of the CDR acting in concert, or working hand in hand with the MRND.  He described the CDR party in Ruhengeri as working hand in hand with the MRND party.  Every witness that has testified thus far has made the same observation.  All the way through to July of 1994, the CDR and the MRND were working hand in hand.  So for Mr. Robinson to suggest that this type of information is irrelevant simply is not reasonable at this point.  We have had too much evidence on this issue already.  The indictment itself mentions numerous individuals as part of the joint criminal enterprise.  Among those persons listed are Jean Bosco Barayagwiza,          Anatole Nsengiyumva, two of the persons that this witness has already stated were present at that meeting.  There are numerous references, in the witness statements, in disclosure, in the pre-trial brief, in the indictment, in the testimony we have heard so far.  So to suggest that this is irrelevant, to me, is simply not reasonable and is so irrelevant that it shouldn't hurt the Defence case.  It is something that is not relevant to proving the allegations in the indictment.  Mr. Robinson need not deal with it.  The point is it is relevant and we would like to proceed with this evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We have come to a decision on the matter, but before we do that, right, we want to discuss the issue of the witness and the request that he leave the Court.  We don't see anything in the discussion that took place that could not have been heard by the witness that could have influenced the witness' testimony in any adverse manner.  And -- and we felt, or I felt that one has to act on the basis of professionalism of the counsel appearing before us.  Now, it -- particularly in view of the witness's comment this morning, it is obvious that making him leave the Court in this way is -- he considers it to be an unpleasant exercise, and we are now of the view that it was unnecessary to ask him to leave.  So I will have to tell him that when he comes back in.

Now, we are also of the view that the testimony cannot be rejected on the grounds of lack of relevance, for a number of reasons.  And particularly the evidence that has already been addressed it is connected to issues which have been alive in our trial up to now, and they are consistent with a number of allegations in the indictment.  The names of the participants of the meeting, the issues of the co-operation between the political parties are matters which we cannot say are not connected to the indictment and the issues raised in this trial.  So we allow the testimony.

Bring back in the witness, please. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I just want to tell you that the reason I didn't want to make this statement in front of the witness is because the witness said in his witness statement that the meeting was an MRND and CDR meeting.  And I was concerned that if I -- he was aware that the objection was that there was no connection the MRND, that he would add that when he started giving his answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But he is already giving evidence.  He has already stated what the meeting was and who the participants were. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That is correct, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the point.
MR. ROBINSON:
-- he was only at the beginning of talking about who was saying what, so he could change.  So --  

MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the advantage of hearing the argument after his testimony, because then he can't change it.  He's already given it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
But you've already heard it, so -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but -- so he can't -- he would not be influenced by the discussion because he already put his testimony on the record. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Bring in the witness please.
(Witness enters courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, during your absence from the courtroom, we heard the legal discussions by both parties and we have made our ruling.  Now -- however, in relation to your leaving the courtroom, we were aware that you did not consider it a pleasant exercise.  And at the time when we asked to you leave; we accepted the concerns expressed by the professional lawyers before us.  However, after having heard the discussion, it was quite clear to us that it had not appeared to be necessary for you to leave the courtroom.  And -- so we are sorry we asked you to leave.  But we can continue now and we trust that there will not be any more unnecessary requests of this nature.

Mr. Lahaie, you can continue. 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Witness, I had asked you who the next speaker was.  
A.	First of all, I would like to thank the President and the Honourable Judges who looked into the issue that I raised, because it is not pleasant for me to have to go out all of the time.  So I want to thank them for looking into this matter.  Thank you, Your Honours.

Having said thank you to the Judges, let me now turn to the Prosecutor's question.  You see, when I left Rwanda to come here it was not to go in and out of rooms, but to testify, and that is why I want to answer the Prosecutor's question.  My recollection is that Anatole spoke next.  
Q.	Could you tell us whether he talked about military training in his speech? 
A.	Military training had already begun with a view to strengthening this training.  He said that it was necessary for such training to be intensified.  But prior to that, Bagosora had indicated his satisfaction with the fact that in Gisenyi members of the opposition and the issue of accomplices had been solved.  So Anatole said that the training was necessary and that, as far as he was concerned, material and equipment should be provided in order for the training to be effective. 
Q.	You have just told us that Bagosora took the floor at some point.  Could you tell the Court what he said? 
A.	As I have already said, all the speeches do not readily come to mind in detail as to what each speaker may have said.  All I can give you is a summary of what each speaker said.  So my testimony amounts only to a general idea of what the various speakers said in their statements.  You see, I did not know that there would come a day when I would be asked to remember what was said in each of the speeches or what each individual did.  I did not know that questions would be put to me in that connection.  But investigators came and talked to us and put questions to us about those speeches.  
Now, briefly speaking, Bagosora took the floor and gave a quick picture of the situation prevailing in the country.  He said that politicians were being killed and that such was not a good thing.  He said that Inkotanyi had killed people in Kigali.  And he went on to say that the country was encountering problems because some bad or evil politicians were seeking to hand power over to the Inkotanyi, and specifically mentioned Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Faustin Twagiramungu.  He said that                 Prime Minister Agathe had moved her office to Inkotanyi premises and that she was handing over power to the Inkotanyi, and Twagiramungu was of the same opinion.  He also said that Prime Minister Agathe had gathered senior military officers and had told them that Habyarimana was a matter of the past that he was someone who had been overwhelmed by the events and that the time had come to topple him and reinstate order in the country.

She, therefore, called on the senior military officers, particularly those from Byumba, Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, that is from the north, and that, by the way, is the region from which Habyarimana hails, since he was from Gisenyi.  So these officers from the north did not agree with the prime minister when she made such a request of them.  So he said that the situation had become critical.  And at that time there was a suspicion that President Habyarimana would be killed.  In fact, the Kangura newspaper had predicted that President Habyarimana would be killed in April or towards Easter.  So he went on to say that weapons should be distributed to members of the population.  He added that if there were any traitors hiding within Gisenyi préfecture, and that if there were any people who were afraid of denouncing these people openly, they should do so by writing their names on a list so that these traitors can be tracked down.

1520H 
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, what was the impact of those words, or those statements, on the crowd that was in attendance? 
A.	I believe that everybody reacted to those words individually.  I do not know how my other colleagues reacted.  I can only talk about my own reaction; I cannot speak on behalf of anyone else who was present at the meeting.  My personal understanding was that things had got up to a point of great concern and that the situation was serious.  As an inhabitant, I was not aware of all the available information, but it was my presumption that these intellectuals and politicians were fully aware of the prevailing situation.  
Q.	Did Bagosora, in his speech, talk about any guidance or supervision that should be provided for the youth wing? 
A.	All the officials always talked about training, and everybody was in support of the training.  At that time, as time went on, things got worse.  Whether it be in the area where we lived, or across the country, one could observe that the youth had been mobilised, and that the youth were ready.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, what was Bagosora's position within the state system? 
A.	I have already explained that he was the director of cabinet in the ministry of defence.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, did you attend any ceremony whatsoever involving the RTLM?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I object to this.  This is not in the indictment or the pre-trial brief.  What is about to be elicited is another meeting in connection with the installation of RTLM facilities at which people spoke.  So -- and it's clear that this is one of the meetings that this witness referred to his statement, but which is not contained in the pre-trial brief or in the indictment.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Mr. President.  Well, I believe we can say this in the presence of the witness.  This question relates to collaboration between the military and civilian officials.  This is contained in the pre-trial brief, as well as in the various statements that were disclosed to our learned colleagues in 2003, if I am not mistaken.  

Furthermore, it speaks to the -- to paragraph 30 of the indictment, namely, that all accused persons attended public rallies with other individuals, and that they did plan, prepare, or scheme, or execute some campaign strategy with a view to eliminating Tutsis.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, this clearly demonstrates the difficulty we have in dealing with objections in the presence of the witness.  Because if the witness did not know what he was supposed to talk about, and the mission which he had to accomplish in answering these questions, now a road map has been placed right before him.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, again we are talking in the presence of the witness to which I object, but the fact is that there will be no testimony, as I understand it, that the -- any of the Accused were present at this meeting.  So it can't fall within paragraph 30.  But meetings and ceremonies at which speeches are made, you've already held those to be material facts that need to be pleaded in the indictment.  It's not pleaded in the indictment.  You've already held that witness statements are not sufficient to give notice of what evidence is going to be led during the trial.  

Now, if you allow the one sentence, that the witness will testify to cooperation between the soldiers and the civilians prior to and during the massacres, to be used for specific meetings, when the pre-trial brief already listed two meetings, then you're making a mockery of the requirement that the pre-trial brief be -- provide notice.  Because this can provide notice of nothing.  It's not specific, and there's no way that we are supposed to divine that there's a meeting to be discussed from that sentence, when they specify two other meetings in the pre-trial brief and don't include this one.  So, it would be completely dispensing with the requirement of notice for you to allow this evidence of this meeting.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I would beg to differ, and I would redirect.  My colleague did mention paragraph 30 of the indictment, but I would like to direct the Court to the last sentence in paragraph 30, and I will read it:  "Furthermore, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, among others --" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, if counsel would slow down for the interpreters and the court reporters, please.
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have the indictment before us. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  So if the Court would direct its attention to the last sentence in paragraph 30, there's a specific mention of RTLM.  RTLM is also mentioned in the pre-trial brief.  I don't have the paragraph reference at my fingertips, but it's unmistakable that there's a reference to using RTLM as a means of spreading propaganda in the pre-trial brief.  In the opening statement it's there as well, and in the witness statement it's there.  

There is nothing criminal, per se, about forming or assembling a private radio station.  What's criminal, and what's relevant -- what makes this issue relevant to our case is the way that this private radio station was used and was intended to be used.  To me it's simply unreasonable for the Defence to assert that they were not on notice that RTLM was going to figure in the testimony of witnesses and in the evidence in this trial.  

If we made an allegation of fact for every factual assertion that is relevant in this case, the indictment would grow to 2- or 300 pages.  It's simply unreasonable, it's not necessary, the Defence have been placed on notice, we've already referenced the jurisprudence that goes to this very point.  We've covered this issue over and over again, and simply making the same motion repeatedly is not going to make the point any stronger.  So I would urge the Court to allow us to proceed, so that we can finish this witness today.  

Clearly RTLM, the creation, the financing, and the operation of RTLM is in issue in this case, and it's specifically referenced in the accusatory instruments and in the disclosures.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, yesterday I was wondering about the relevance of Rule 73 bis of the rules.  Because ordinarily any witness who appears before the Court speaks to a specific aspect of the indictment -- it would seem to me that this is not being respected, because the annex for this witness indicates the points on which he will testify.  But if we continue to allow the witness to expand and testify on any question raised by the Prosecutor, then clearly this will take forever.  So, I believe that we must revisit Rule 73 bis of the rules, Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, in support of what my friend, Felix Sow, has said, you only have to refer to the notice for XBM which accompanies the pre-trial brief, and which made no reference to article 30, because they go immediately from 25.2 to 31 of the indictment, which is of no use to the Prosecutor, no help, and inadequate, because it is not contained in the memo regarding Witness XBM.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you for the discussion.  We will consider and rule after the mid-afternoon recess.  

We take our mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1535H to 1604H) 
MR. SOW:  
Mr. President.  Mr. President, I would like to tell you that Mr. Édouard Karemera is absent.  During the break he was summoned by Dr. Epée.  Mr. Karemera is experiencing the same problem you may recall, so he has an appointment with Dr. Epée, and it is certain that he will return presently.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Sow, just consideration of the issue, and that you don't object to going on in his absence.  
MR. SOW: 
No, Mr. President.  It goes without saying, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Not for everybody, apparently. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
 Mr. President, I'm not going to speak on this issue, but I'm just going to remind you of the time you said that I was a masochist.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I hope I don't live to regret that. 

To commence, we're going to allow the question.  We are in the process of preparing our decision on the issue of the indictment and the admissibility of testimony, and I think that our reasoning will be clarified in that decision.  And, if necessary, we will also implement -- we will have to adjust any other decision that we -- that is necessary as a result of that.  But, basically, our current thinking on this matter is that the -- there was notice in the indictment itself, and although it was admitted from the pre-trial brief, the witness statements of this witness included reference to this issue.  We are aware that that does not cover all of the legal arguments that need to be responded to, but we thought that it would be safer for us to wait for our complete deliberation on the subject, when we will address it more fully.  

So, Mr. Lahaie, continue.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	We shall now revisit the ceremony relating to the RTLM station.  Can you tell me the month and the year you attended the ceremony?  
A.	I remember it was in September 1993. 
Q.	And what was the venue of the ceremony?  
A.	The ceremony was held on Muhe hill. 
Q.	And what was the purpose of the ceremony? 
A.	This was the laying of the first stone, or cornerstone, for the RTLM antenna project. 
Q.	So, if I understood you correctly, there was no existing infrastructure for the RTLM?  
A.	Yes, they set the first stone for installation of the RTLM antenna.  It was a project at -- in its early stages.  There was no antenna before that. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell me which public figures attended the ceremony? 
A.	Unless I tell you the names of those who spoke during the ceremony?  
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	At the ceremony -- or, rather, the ceremony was attended by those who spoke.  I would say Barayagwiza.  Anatole, I would also say. 
Q.	And Anatole would be Anatole Nsengiyumva, right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Yes.  Can you tell us, Witness, who spoke first at that ceremony? 
A.	Barayagwiza was the first person to take the floor, and he spoke ardently.  He was very zealous and active at that ceremony.  
Q.	At the very beginning of his speech, what he did say? 
A.	He said that the purpose, the main purpose of installing that antenna was to enable the inhabitants of the Mutura, Karago, Nkuli, and Rwerere regions, that is, in the volcanic areas, to listen to Radio RTLM comfortably.  He said that there were members of the CDR and MRND in that area, and that they deserved to be able to listen to those programmes in that area because they were outside of the FM range.  He went on to say that the desires of the inhabitants had been met since a major project had been initiated in their area, to enable them to follow radio programmes, know what was happening in their country, and be able to know who the enemy was.  He said that members of the population should take all necessary measures to check the enemy.  

He went on to say that prior to 1990, he was personally married to a Tutsi woman, but that Tutsi woman had not done anything wrong against him.  But with the onset of the war, he said that he had been forced, or compelled to send away that Tutsi woman, because it had been established that that woman supported the Tutsi.  He therefore said that members of the population should understand the way things unfolded.  He said that the RTLM was an instrument that would enable members of the population to understand the habits and the behaviour of the Tutsi, and also to understand that times had changed.  

He went on to say that weapons were available, or that he had promised to make available weapons to the Impuzamugambi.  
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court why those weapons were promised to be given to those people? 
A.	He said that weapons had been promised to the Impuzamugambi not to be used against thieves or wild animals, but that the weapons were to be used as a means of protection against the enemy.  The weapons were distributed with a view to enabling the population to protect themselves against the enemy.  That was the main reason for which the authorities had distributed the weapons.  
Q.	Who was the enemy? 
A.	I have just said that when the war broke out, he had to send his Tutsi wife away because she was Tutsi.  So, we can understand that he was referring to Tutsis when he talked about the enemy.  
Q.	Did he mention any date on which the weapons would be delivered? 
A.	He had made the promise that the weapons would be distributed in June of that year.  He was to contact officials of the army and, as I have already told you, I attended only one meeting in June 1993.  And it is at that time that he promised to source weapons for the youth wing, and he said he was going to contact the commander of the army.  The weapons were, therefore, available at the time he spoke, but we did not see those weapons on the day he was speaking.  
Q.	Thank you.  Who was the next speaker, Witness?  
A.	Since there was this problem of weapons and the issue of the RTLM, the decision was taken that an ordinary civilian would not be charged with distributing those weapons.  So, it was said that the ops commander of Gisenyi should be present at the time the weapons would be distributed.  He therefore took the floor after Barayagwiza and endorsed the statements that had been made by Barayagwiza.  He went on to say that, as a soldier, he was aware of the position of the enemy whom they were fighting at the front.  He said that the time had come for the civilian population to know the enemy.  He specified that the inhabitants knew themselves, but that they should flush out people from the fields, and said that the enemy was the person who defended the interests of the Tutsi and could be said to be someone who had no rights.  
Q.	Did he make any specific request of the civilian population with regard to the Tutsi? 
A.	He said that the soldiers were at the battlefront fighting the enemy, and that the time had come for the civilian population to track down the enemy who was within the population.  That was the request he made of the civilian population, and I believe that it was clear enough.  
Q.	How many persons were present at that ceremony at which the first stone, or the foundation stone was laid? 
A.	Between 600 to 800 persons.  And that is only an approximation.  
Q.	How long did that ceremony last? 
A.	There was no reception at that location because people wanted the weapons that were available to be distributed.  So, it was necessary for those weapons to be distributed.  After the statements on the launching of the antenna, party issues were discussed, the CDR youth wing sang some songs, and I believe that the entire ceremony didn't take more than one-and-a-half to two hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Lahaie.  I don't know if there's a translation problem, but this meeting was alleged to have taken place in September, and there was a reference to distribution of arms that was to take place in June of the same year.  I don't know if there was a problem with the translation.  I wonder if you could clarify that.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Maybe we can ask the witness, Mr. President, to clarify that part of his testimony.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, I put the question to you again.  When were the weapons to be distributed, the weapons in question?  When were they to be distributed? 
A.	I believe that I have already provided explanations as to what I saw.  And as the President has said, there was no issue of distributing weapons in July.  The meeting held in June '93, and Barayagwiza promised the youth that he would do everything in his power to ensure that weapons are made available so that training can begin.  And that was in June 1993.  We left Ruhengeri and we went home, along with those CDR officials, including Barayagwiza and Bucyana, who went back to Kigali.  

Now, when we got to Bigirimana's bar, it was mainly CDR and MRND members who were together.  And we were given some beer, seven crates of beer, three crates of lemonade, and three other crates of drinks, and we were requested to identify five persons from our secteur who would receive weapons.  Each secteur, therefore, went on to draw up a list of persons to receive the weapons.  The weapons were not yet distributed.  The purpose of the list was to facilitate the organisation of that exercise.  

It was in September 1993 that Barayagwiza provided explanations on the distribution of weapons, at a time when that stone was being laid, the foundation stone was being laid.  So, you may want to cross-check; I never mentioned the month of July.  
Q.	Well, Witness, maybe I'm mistaken, but please correct me.  You referred to a meeting that took place in June 1993 and at which a list of persons was drawn up with a view to providing weapons to those people.  Was that the proper understanding of your testimony, Witness?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, let us return to the ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone of the RTLM.  Were weapons effectively distributed on that day?  
MR. ROBINSON:
(Microphones overlapping)
THE WITNESS:
Yes, weapons were distributed on that day, immediately after the ceremony.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I want to object to any testimony of the distribution of weapons.  Once again it's not in the indictment, it's not in the pre-trial brief, so I realise that you're going to be issuing a written decision, but it seems to be clearly an issue that should -- is a material fact that should have -- we should have received notice of.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Mr. President, once again I would refer to the documents that were disclosed to the Defence, including the annex to the pre-trial brief, in which reference is made to cooperation between the military and civilians before and during the massacres.  Now, if distribution of weapons is not a manifestation of that collaboration, that would indeed surprise me.  

Secondly, that information is available in the statements that were disclosed to the Defence counsel in 2003.  That is the same statements which have been available to my colleagues, and which could have facilitated all possible manner of investigations on their part. 

I hope, Mr. President, that these arguments will be taken into consideration when you rule, even on the previous objections.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will take your arguments into account and then include that in our decision which will follow.  

You may proceed.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Let me return to my question.  Were weapons effectively distributed on that day?  
A.	Yes, weapons were distributed on that day.  And that is clear, we don't need to belabour that point.  
Q.	Where were those weapons? 
A.	The weapons were in a jeep belonging to Anatole. 
Q.	What type of weapons were distributed? 
A.	Guns, ordinary long guns -- the type that one can see everywhere.  
Q.	How many guns were there? 
A.	I saw some 50 guns, about 50.  
Q.	Did you see any ammunition along with the weapons, or with the guns? 
A.	Yes, it was necessary.  The guns were there, the magazines were there, and they were full.  The ammunition was loaded -- was available, rather.  
Q.	Now, who offloaded the weapons from Anatole's vehicle, Witness?  
A.	Do you want me to spell out their names, or do you want me to refer just to the group?  
Q.	Well, if you have the names, please do, Witness.  
A.	I recall one Ruhura, the junior brother of Barayagwiza.  Ntigambe was also there, Bukware, and Bunoti.  There was also one Nirere, and others. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Ntigambe and Ruhura, those names don't appear on the list.  But it's spelt N-T-E-P --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, if counsel would repeat, the interpreters could spell after him.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Bukware, B-U --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The interpreters have requested you to repeat so they could do their job properly.
  
MR. LAHAIE: 
With pleasure.  Ruhura, R-U-H-U-R-A.  Ntigambe, N-T-I-G-A-M-B-E.  Bukware, that will be number 21 on the list.  And Bunoti, number 22 on the list.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, to whom were these weapons distributed? 
A.	The weapons were distributed to some of the people appearing on the list drawn up in June.  Do you want me to give the names of some of the people I remember?  
Q.	With pleasure.  
A.	I would like to start with one Joseph Bamporineza, Aminadab, Ruhura, Ntigambe, Abiyingoma, Nzabarihanya (phonetic), Pascal Ujirongonga (phonetic), Gakwaya. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
I have some names to spell.  Abiyingoma is number 1 on the list.  Bamporineza is number 7.  Gakwaya number 27.  Ntamabyariro is number 77.  Ntamabyariro.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Were you aware of the use, or the -- of what the weapons were used for?  
A.	All I know is that there was a Tutsi by the name of Muhikira who resided in Kabari in the former Mutura commune.  Another person named Bahinira, one Murego, all these people were persecuted together with a driver named Karasira, who was the target of a gunshot fired through the window -- a window into his house.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Lahaie, the answer he gave was not an answer to your question.  Your question was whether he knew what the weapons were to be used for.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Actually, in French my question was -- I don't know how the translation was -- my question was:  "Do you know the use to which the weapons were put," which is quite clumsy in English.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
And the witness went on to mention a series of names, and indicated that all those names he mentioned were persecuted, together with a driver.  That's all he said.  But if you are happy with the answer, that's okay.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
What I understood from his answer, among others, is that the driver had been killed with one of those weapons.  As for the others, I will ask him to be more specific in his answer.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	In answer to my question you said that the Tutsis were either threatened or harassed.  Can you be more specific as to the manner? 
A.	As a matter of fact, that was not my concern.  It was not one of my duties and no report was made to me.  I simply know that following distribution of the weapons those people were attacked, were assaulted by people who had received weapons, which therefore demonstrates that people had began to use the weapons to commit violent acts.  I don't know if it is clear to you, although I think it is.  
Q.	Thank you for your answer, then.  You told us that Ruhura, Barayagwiza's brother, had received a weapon.  Did you witness Ruhura using the weapon?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Oh my goodness.  
THE WITNESS:
I would say that the weapons had been distributed, and I noticed there was no fighting in my area.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I apologise, the microphone was off for the minute.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
I have been informed that the answer was not understood, or heard, rather, in English.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Sir, could you please repeat the answer to the question?  
A.	I told you that in answer, therefore, to the question put to me, that is, as to whether I had seen how Ruhura, Barayagwiza's younger brother, had used the weapon provided to him -- I believe that was the question put to me.  And my answer to you was that on one occasion I came across Ruhura in his native secteur.  Very close to the roadside there was a group of people who said that Ruhura had just killed a Tutsi woman by the name of Kanori.  When I saw him he was holding his firearm, he was in the midst of the group, and he had just killed a person.  Therefore -- I do not know what translation was provided to you in English. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So, in the month of January 1994, were you summoned to the Mutura communal office? 
A.	Yes, indeed, we went there.  We were told that training for the youth would be provided in that place, and during the distribution of weapons, there was a soldier whose name I did not catch, together with other people I found there.  But on that occasion Barayagwiza had brought 42 rifles which were distributed.  But they were not distributed on the spot; they were stored at the communal office -- dropped at the communal office, or, rather, the secteur office.  So, they were dropped at the communal office and the people who were supposed to receive them withdrew them, or retrieved them thereafter.  

All the speakers said that it appeared that Rwanda was sinking in chaos, and that CDR was ready to take over, and that the CDR was prepared to be a part of the government in which even the RPF would participate.  And so, on that occasion, 42 rifles were brought and dropped at the communal office.  
Q.	Where did the rifles come from?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me.  Excuse me, Mr. President.  I want to now object.  We're now yet again hearing about another meeting in January 1994 that's contained nowhere in the indictment and the pre-trial brief.  Thank you.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
My comment remains the same.  Once again we are talking about collaboration between civilians and the military, which is, once again -- and I don't want to repeat myself, but it is contained in the pre-trial brief, which is disclosed to my colleagues.  And therefore I suppose that this objection will meet with the same fate as previous ones.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much more time do you have on your examination?  
MR. LAHAIE: 
I would say -- without venturing too much, very little time.  By 5:30 we will have finished, definitely.  Possibly even before that.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, we will reserve our decision on this matter.  

You may proceed for the time being.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, to revisit the question:  What was the provenance of the weapons, the firearms?  
A.	It is not easy to ascertain the provenance of the weapons.  It can be said they came from Rwanda.  I do not know if the weapons originated from or in Gisenyi or Kigali.  It's not easy for me to say.  But, however, the weapons came from within the country; they did not come from outside the country.  
Q.	What sort of weapons were they -- were these?  
A.	They were identical to the ones I told you about.  They were long rifles.  They were not handguns.  These were ordinary individual -- personal, rather, weapons.  
Q.	Were these hunting weapons or military weapons? 
A.	The weapons resembled weapons of soldiers.  I do not know much about hunting guns, but these weapons resembled combat weapons.  They resembled combat weapons.  
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell us if, in May 1994, at the time you were in Gisenyi, if you witnessed the touchdown or landing of a helicopter? 
A.	Yes, I was in Gisenyi, I think towards the end of May, about 1 a -- p.m. or 2 p.m. when I saw a helicopter overfly Mount Rubavu and head towards Camp Gisenyi, the military camp in Gisenyi.  
Q.	And were you able to see who was in the helicopter? 
A.	It is not easy to know the passengers in the helicopter.  It was in the air.  And when it landed, it landed in the middle of a military camp.  When you are on the ground, therefore, you cannot identify the passengers in a helicopter.  
Q.	After the helicopter landed, was a meeting held? 
A.	In any event, in town a loudspeaker was taken -- used to call everybody, especially the youths, members of the party, as well as others concerned, other concerned parties.  They were being invited to gather at the Méridién to hear instructions to be issued to them.  
Q.	So, did you see who was operating the loudspeaker, whose voice it was you heard through the loudspeaker? 
A.	You will understand that in the town, or -- or, in town, there were many people -- there are many people.  I do not know who was speaking on the loudspeaker, although I did see the vehicle moving about town.  But I could not identify the person speaking on the loudspeaker.  
Q.	Was the vehicle in which the loudspeaker was placed a military or civilian vehicle? 
A.	A civilian vehicle. 
Q.	Thank you.  And how many people went to the meeting? 
A.	It is hard for me to say exactly how many people attended the meeting.  I can only give an estimate of the number.  The fact is I went, and when I arrived at the site, I found there were about 500 participants. 
Q.	Were there any public figures in attendance? 
A.	There was no politician present.  There were only soldiers. 
Q.	Who were the soldiers present? 
A.	Anatole and Bagosora. 
Q.	Were you able to speak to -- or discuss with Bagosora? 
A.	No, he just greeted me.  Other than that I had no other matter to discuss with him.  
Q.	I gather you knew, or had known Bagosora before? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How had you come to know him? 
A.	I know him because******************************************************************************************* ******************************************************************************************************************** *************************************************************************************.  
Q.	Thank you.  And I gather that Bagosora addressed the crowd.  What did he say?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I am going to once again object to another meeting never mentioned in the indictment and pre-trial brief.  I also note the absence of civilian authorities.  I am sure that you can find a way to fit this within the language of the one paragraph in XBM if you're so inclined, but to my way of looking at it, this is -- we've had absolutely no notice of this.  Thank you.

1700H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We reserve on this again.  Do you wish to add anything in your submission?  
MR. LAHAIE:
I beg your pardon?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to add anything in your submission?  
MR. LAHAIE:
Yes, I wanted to react, but I think it would be wasting the Court's time.  It is more or less the same arguments I have been presenting since the early afternoon.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, for the record, I would like it to be clear that even we want to save the Court's time, and that our submissions are also being repeated -- are also the same.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell us what Mr. Bagosora told the crowd?  Can you tell us what Mr. Bagosora told the crowd?  
A.	At any rate, he thanked the participants in the Nyundo massacre; he congratulated them.  He gave them 500 francs assistance, and encouraged them to keep looking for -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
And the witness does not say what was to be found -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- and he also asked or called on the youth to select a group that would be taken to Mugina.  There was a group called Ibikurankota (phonetic), that is, the contract killers.  And he said that the people should -- those people should go to Mugina to kill people.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	You mentioned that he -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I didn't mean to interrupt, but I think there was a translation error because we heard in English "500 francs," and I believe they heard in French "500,000 francs".  So could we have that clarified?  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us once again what was the sum of money given?  
A.	I said 500,000 francs.  
Q.	You told us that people were congratulated for the Nyundo massacre.  Who were these people who had committed the massacre? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, objection.  So we started the day allowing the Prosecutor to make brief reference to the massacre at Mudende university.  We are now, five or six meetings later, coming to yet another massacre not contained in the indictment or the pre-trial brief.  I object.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Your Honours, my intention is not to talk about the massacres as such.  It is not to recount or have the witness recount the massacre.  We are still in the context whereby we're talking about collaboration between the civilians and the military.  I don't want to repeat myself, but I can tell my colleagues that that is the stage we are at and what we're driving at. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, once again, the witness now knows what answer he should give because Mr. Lahaie has just reminded him of it, that what is the purpose of the response and -- and what argument should be supported.  We maintain our arguments, but it is difficult to talk about perpetrators of the massacres without bringing up the massacres themselves.  
MR. LAHAIE:
I have just one answer to Mr. Weyl's intervention, and I can tell you that if there hadn't been an objection, it would not have changed much in the witness's answer.  My colleagues are well aware of what the witness will say.  They have that information, and have had it for a long time now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We reserve again.  Continue.  
BY MR. LAHAIE:
Q.	Now, back to the question:  Who were the people who had participated in or committed the massacre at Nyundo?  
A.	I do not know all the events that took place in Nyundo, but the people who participated in the Nyundo massacre showed themselves, came forward at the Meridien hotel, unless you are asking me to tell you which persons came forward when we were at the Meridien hotel.  Moreover, in 1994 there was no shame for some people, the killers, that is, in saying that they had gone to kill.  Some of these killers are in prison, whereas others are in exile. 
Q.	Were those people soldiers or civilians? 
A.	It was a mix of soldiers and civilians. 
Q.	And to whom were the -- was the 500,000 -- were the 500,000 francs given? 
A.	That amount was given to Serushago. 
Q.	Who was Serushago?  Do you have his first name, first of all? 
A.	Omar. 
Q.	And who was Omar Serushago? 
A.	A member of the MRND party, a very influential member in Gisenyi préfecture. 
Q.	Was a soldier?  Was he a civilian? 
A.	He was a businessman, a civilian. 
Q.	Thank you.  Was the use of that 500,000 francs discussed? 
A.	That amount was earmarked for purchasing Interahamwe uniforms. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. LAHAIE:
Mr. President, I have kept my word, and I will now conclude my examination-in-chief.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Mr. Prosecutor, just so we can be certain that we understand you properly, it's your -- it's been your submission in relation to each of the meetings to which objection has been raised that the evidence was adduced solely for the purpose of demonstrating cooperation between soldiers and civilians, and not for any other purpose.  Is that -- are we to understand that that is what you have been saying?  If not, we would be grateful if you could kindly clarify your position.  
MR. LAHAIE:
That is the case for most of the meetings, and whenever Mr. Robinson has reason to object, it has been for the same reason, namely, that it didn't appear in the indictment and did not appear in the pre-trial brief either.  And my answer to him has been consistent, namely, that what we wanted to prove in respect of those meetings is the collaboration between soldiers and civilians.  Now, as far as paragraph 30 goes in relation to RTLM, this is clearly stated in the indictment, and my position is that this does not only demonstrate collaboration between the military and civilians, but it also is evidence adduced in relation to the establishment of the antenna.  It is for the Court to decide, but I believe that the witness has testified as to why the antenna may have been built.  But we defer to the Court on that.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that clarification.  We are going to take our adjournment now, but I think we should just give a little scheduling explanation.  Our Trial Chamber will not be sitting tomorrow or Friday or Tuesday, so we are going to lose those three days of trial time.  We will resume on Monday, at eleven o'clock.  Now, I don't know how that -- yes, Mr. Robinson, you are trying to attract my attention. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I actually want to make a motion before we recess, but it doesn't have to be this minute. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So, Mr. Witness, we take our adjournment now, and the Court will resume at eleven o'clock on Monday, when your testimony will continue.  At that time you will have to answer to the attorneys designated on behalf of the defendants charged in this case.  So you are excused and you may go now.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have time constraints with regard to your motion.  We don't have more than a couple of minutes.  
MR. ROBINSON:
My motion is to postpone my cross-examination because of the mistake I made on Mr. Nzirorera's behalf of thinking that I only had a few small areas to investigate for this witness, since his witness statement was provided to us before the pre-trial brief.  When I read the pre-trial brief, I thought that I knew the parameters of the direct examination.  I was seriously mistaken in that, and I'm not prepared to cross-examine until we've had a chance to investigate the broad matters that the Trial Chamber has allowed the Prosecution to introduce through this witness.  So I would ask that this witness be recalled during the next session, during which time, in the interim, I'll conduct our investigation.  And I think this is the consequence of, you know, allowing -- there has to be some reciprocation here.  

The Prosecution has now been allowed to expand this witness's parameters greatly, so now the result of that is that the Defence, in order to have a fair trial, must be given the opportunity to meet the evidence which has been led which was not contained in the pre-trial brief.  So I'm asking that our cross-examination be deferred until October and that we hear the next Prosecution witness on Monday.  
MR. LAHAIE:
I am somewhat surprised, Mr. President, at that request.  Once again, and I am certainly repeating myself, we know that Mr. Robinson is a very strict person, but I am surprised that today he would claim that he did not investigate into issues which he was aware of since 2003.  In the witness's statement all of these matters are mentioned over and over, and the material is clearly and easily available in the pre-trial brief annexes.  So, Mr. President, I don't believe that the cross-examination of this witness should be deferred.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to say briefly that, as far as we perceive this matter, and speaking from a civil law background, if we look at an inventory of witness statements from the Prosecutor, they amount to more than 300 witnesses.  If we were to conduct all manner of investigations, that would not be good for our judicial process.  It is true that we have briefs which must be taken alongside with the summaries of what the witnesses will be testifying on.  

Now, if the pre-trial brief and the annexes and the statements do not serve any purpose and we have to look only at statements that were produced by hundreds of witnesses, with the attendant amendments, then I wonder why we would have to rely on the rules.  If we are told here that it is only the statements that must be taken into the consideration -- into consideration, whereas the pre-trial brief is being shoved aside.  

Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, just a word or two, in order to save judicial time.  Mr. President, I do not know whether I understood clearly, but it would seem to me that the Prosecutor has just said that this was included in the annexes of the pre-trial brief.  I am sorry to say that many of the issues delved into are not at all contained in the annex.  What I am saying is that when issues are expanded, that puts the Defence in a position where they must uphold the interests of their clients and the principle of fairness, and that is why we want to be given time to cross-check this information that has been freshly produced.  I, therefore, want to endorse the motion of my learned friend Peter Robinson.  
MR. WEBSTER:
May I offer a final comment, Your Honour?  With respect to the cross-examination of this witness, there's no reason why we cannot proceed on Monday.  

First of all, the witness testified substantially on the things that were listed in the pre-trial brief, so there's no reason to delay the cross-examination.  We can move ahead to the extent that the Court wants to consider Mr. Robinson's objections.  We can certainly take the cross-examinations on those portions, which he clearly should be prepared for, which are the things that are in the pre-trial brief and the indictment.  

Now, my saying that is not a concession to any of his arguments.  My position, which I've stated several times, is that all of these issues have been -- I'm sorry, the Defence has been placed on notice of all of these issues.  There were extensive disclosures; they have the witness statements; they have the testimony of this witness in the Bagosora trial.  This is not a notice issue, period.  I state that emphatically.  There's no reason to revisit this issue.  

We await the Court's decision, and the reasoning the Court will offer when it renders its decision.  But in terms of disrupting the pace of this trial, there's no reason to do that.  Cross-examination should proceed, and at the extreme -- the most extreme measure that should be taken by this Trial Chamber is to call the witness back for additional cross-examination, if it's warranted.  And my submission is that it will not be, that notice has been sufficient.  So we should proceed as planned on Monday morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't have any time to continue our deliberations now, so we cannot make a ruling at the moment.  What we advise is that both sides should keep their options open, so the Defence should prepare to the extent that they can to cross-examine, and the Prosecutor should have another witness available, to the extent that that is possible.  We will make our ruling on Monday morning.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I understand the Court's concern and the Court's advisement, but it is not practicable for us to make another witness available on Monday and to use -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, that's our ruling at the moment.  We are not ruling now.  And we advise both parties to keep their options open.  We take the adjournment now.
