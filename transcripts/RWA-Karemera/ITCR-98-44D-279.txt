 MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  I'd just like to report that I'm back and in good health, and I would like to thank everybody for the good wishes sent to me during the last couple days.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday, the 21st of April 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The appearances are the same.  
MR. NIMY: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Let me avail myself of this opportunity to welcome you back amongst us and wish you good health for the rest of our proceedings.

The lead counsel is not present.  He travelled.  And apart from that, our team remains the same as far as the appearances are concerned, Mr. President.  I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Nimy, you are ready to proceed this morning?  Yes.  Mr. Nimy, what's your agenda this morning?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, we have Witness Ferdinand Nahimana who is already in the witness box, and we are going to be examining him this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long is that going to take?  
MR. NIMY: 
Well, Mr. President, with all reservation, I would say I would take the morning for his examination-in-chief.  I might perhaps go a little beyond to the early afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before your testimony begins, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by Ferdinand Nahimana in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel, and Mr. Nimy will begin his examination.  
FERDINAND NAHIMANA, 
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Nahimana.
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Very well.  We are going to begin your examination this morning.  Let me, first of all, make sure that you have in front of you a document that reflects your identity.  Do you have that in front of you, Mr. Nahimana? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I have the document before me. 
Q.	Now, I would like to ask you to carefully look through its contents.  And if you have no corrections to make, please let us know so that we can tender it into evidence before the Chamber.
A.	I would like my date of birth to be corrected.  I was born on the 15th of June 1950, not the 16th. 
Q.	Could you please amend the date that appears on the document, and beside your amendment you initial the correction.
A.	That is done. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like to tender that document as an exhibit, Exhibit D. NZ782.  I would like Mr. Issa to confirm whether I'm correct.  
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, the correct exhibit number is D. NZ783.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ783 admitted) 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, thank you.
Mr. President, I thank you.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, tell us briefly, what is your academic background? 
A.	Thank you.  As I underscored, I was born on the 15th of June 1950.  In September 1964 I had 
	just completed my primary school studies, and I began secondary school studies at the 
	Catholic minor seminary of Byumba.  And after that from 1964 to 1971, I was in the Rwesero minor seminary where I graduated with a diploma in the humanities, but I specialised in orientation.  And in October 1971, I got into the faculty of lettres of the National University of Rwanda where I spent three years in the department of history.

And in our higher education system in Rwanda, three years of university studies led you to what was referred to as a baccalaureate.  After that first degree diploma, I went and continued my studies at Laval University in Canada, and the University of Laval is in Quebec City in Canada.

I was there from January 1975 to October 1977.  I had a master's in lettres, and my specialisation was history.   As you see, after that I would like to move on to the year 1984 when I returned to university studies in the Université de Paris VII in France where I did a diplôme d'études approfondies in history.  And after that I defended my doctorate thesis in November 1986.

I left that university with a Ph.D. in history with distinction and the congratulations of the jury.  I thank you. 
Q.	Now, what about your professional career? 
A.	Immediately after I finished my first cycle studies in the National University of Rwanda, in July 1974 I was employed in the ministry of information where there I was the directorate general for culture.  I was employed in that ministry in that directorate general for culture.  I worked there from September 1974 to January 1975 when, as I earlier said, I left for further studies in Canada.

When I returned from my studies that led to a master's in history in October 1977, I was chosen by the teaching corps of the faculty of lettres of the university and the director of that university to become an associate professor in the National University of Rwanda in the history department.  This was in November 1977.

Let me immediately add that in the department of history I was the first Rwandan -- or, rather, the second Rwandan to be employed in that faculty.  At the time there were more mostly expatriates there.  And two years later, I was elected by the teaching corps to the post of vice-dean of that faculty.  And in 1980 at the early age of 30, I was, once again, elected as the first Rwandan dean of the faculty.

In 1982/'83 I was appointed to the position of secretary general of the Ruhengeri campus of the National University of Rwanda.  In 1984, as I mentioned earlier, I left for further studies.  And upon my return in November 1986, I took my position as history professor in the faculty of lettres at the Ruhengeri campus of the National University of Rwanda.

In late 1988 I was appointed to the position of director of the service in charge of Rwandan culture and civilization within the institute of scientific and technological research of Rwanda where I worked as a researcher in that institute while I was a professor at the National University of Rwanda.  This went on right up to December 1990 -- I believe it was on the 8th of December 1990 -- when I was appointed to the post of director of the Rwandan information agency or authority.

And I held that position right through to the 28th of April 1992.  When I left the Rwandan information authority, I went back to the National University of Rwanda as a professor.  And during the time I spent at the Rwandan information authority, I continued to lecture at the university but as a part-time lecturer.

From 1992 when I left the ORINFOR right through to the time when I left Rwanda as a refugee in 1994, I was professor of history at the Ruhengeri campus in the history department of the 
National University of Rwanda.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  Can you tell the Court why you were dismissed from your position of director of office Rwandais d'information, the Rwandan information authority.
A.	In April, April 1992, just -- or immediately after the multiparty government was installed after the restoration of multiparty politics in Rwanda and the inauguration of 
	Prime Minister Dismas Nsengiyaremye, this prime minister received in audience the 
	Burundian ambassador in Kigali.

At the end of the meeting, the prime minister's office drafted a communiqué or a press release which was brought to the journalists.  The journalists, not having received any other instruction, treated it just like any other document of information.  And at the time of the news broadcast, first in the national language and then in the French language, the journalists simply broadcast some extracts taken from that press release.  

The prime minister's office itself called me -- first it was the prime minister's office and then the prime minister himself personally -- to tell me that I had censored the prime minister's document.  
First of all, I was struck.  I was surprised because I was not -- as director of the information authority, I was not aware of that communiqué or press release.

On the basis of that incident, during the first cabinet meeting, he asked and, in fact, required that I be dismissed from my post.  After a discussion of the matter in a cabinet meeting, it was decided that I had to leave ORINFOR.  That is the reason why I was dismissed from ORINFOR and I had to return to the University of Rwanda as a lecturer full time. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, kindly remind the Court how you found yourself arrested, tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.
A.	I was in Cameroon in the town of Yaoundé as a refugee.  That was in the month of March 1996.  I was arrested on the basis of the international warrant of arrest issued by Kigali.

Thereafter, in the month of June of the same year, the Prosecutor of this Tribunal took charge of my case file and, through the Cameroonian judicial authorities, addressed to me an indictment.  And the proceedings started, so much so that on the 27th of January 1997, I was transferred from Cameroon to Arusha.

And on the 3rd of December 2003, I was convicted by the Trial Chamber and sentenced to 
life imprisonment.  I launched an appeal.  And on the 28th November 2007, the Appeals Chamber acquitted me of all the charges, of all the crimes which were charged against me on the basis of 
Article 61 of the statute of this Tribunal.  I was acquitted of all those crimes.   

However, I was convicted on the basis of Article 63 for the crime of direct and public incitement to commit genocide and for the crime of persecution and crimes against humanity.  And if my memory serves me right -- I'm trying to quote -- on the basis of RTLM broadcasts that were made after the 
6th of April 1994, on the basis of that single act, the Judges of the Appeals Chamber sentenced me to 30 years of imprisonment. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, if you remember, can you remind the Court of the charges that the Appeal Bench dismissed, which charges were the basis of your conviction at the trial level.
A.	Trial Chamber I, as I said, sentenced or convicted me on the 23rd of December 2003 for the crime of genocide, conspiracy -- the crime of conspiracy to commit genocide, extermination, the crime of direct and public incitement to commit genocide, the crime of persecution, the crime of -- a crime against humanity.  And these were crimes under Article 61.

But as regards the crime against humanity, namely, persecution, and the crime of direct and 
public incitement to commit genocide, I was at the same time convicted on the basis of 61 and 63 of the statute.   

So all these crimes -- or, rather, I was acquitted of all these crimes by the Appeals Chamber.  I was acquitted of the five crimes, crimes that were brought against me under 61.  So all the crimes charged against me as a perpetrator were dismissed.  I was acquitted of those crimes by the Appeals Chamber. 
Q.	What is the status of your appeals proceedings at present? 
A.	First of all, in 2008 I requested the Appeals Chamber to take cognisance of the errors of law.  The Appeals Chamber did not consider my request favourably.  I intended to ask for reconsideration immediately after my appeal was dismissed, but it happens that the Appeals Chamber itself did what I consider unacceptable.  The Judges decided to renounce their inherent powers to reconsider their own judgement.

I would take advantage of this to say that as a historian, I would consider this to be a serious error, a serious error committed by the ICTR.  Even one who is not a judge, even an ordinary person, can reconsider his decision if there are facts indicating that a decision be reconsidered.  But anyway, that is a decision of the Appeals Chamber.  Thereafter, I considered the new facts that meet the requirement for an application for review, and that is the stage where I am. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  And I would like to assure you that your judicial background which you have just brought to the attention of the Chamber does not in any manner undermine your credibility as a witness before the same Chamber.  Rest assured that all that you will say will be taken into consideration by the Chamber.  Thank you.

Mr. Nahimana, now we are looking at 1990/1991, and this is the period of the advent of multiparty politics in Rwanda, isn't it?  
A.	Yes.  From 1991, 1990/1991, there was a movement for multiparties or various parties to be created, and this became effective in 1991.  That's correct. 
Q.	Now -- and on the inception or at the birth of multiparty politics, what choice did you make amongst the various parties that just came into being and took root in Rwanda? 
A.	During the transition from single party to multiparty politics, I chose to join the MRND. 
Q.	If we look at your academic pedigree or your academic background, which is brilliant, one would see that you were not a political activist.  But why did you choose the MRND?
A.	I think multiparty politics came into being after a single party situation as I just said.  And in 1991 I was a member of the MRND, the single party.  I must assure you that I was a supporter of the policy that prevailed then, a policy that was based on peace, unity, and development.

I must also tell you that regarding a course or a lecture on the contemporary history of Africa and, more specifically, during a seminar that dealt with the development of the Great Lakes countries of Africa in the eastern region of Africa, both in Rwanda and in the University of Paris VII, I directed a seminar, discussions on the harmonious development.  

And the illustration or the concrete example that I took was Rwanda.  I analysed the programme of the MRND at the time and the programme of President Habyarimana.  My conclusion as an academic was that peace is the condition precedent for harmonious development, the indispensable condition for development.  For there to be peace, cohesion is necessary.  Therefore, unity was absolutely necessary.  

And as a specialist of culture, I added that it is not enough just to talk about unity and peace but that it is absolutely necessary for the people concerned to be conscious, to be aware, of the importance and the value of peace and unity.  At the end of this analysis, I wrote a book which I entitled, quote/unquote, Conscience chez nous, confiance en nous, Culture is the Basis of our Harmonious Development.

This is to show that, while being within a university context, I was very interested in the ideas and the policies of MRND.  Therefore, it was not surprising for me to join the MRND in the context of the multiparty politics that came into being in our country, especially because, in spite of the reform that was necessary, the basis of the ideology of the MRND party remained the same.

So I joined that party because I was familiar with the ideological basis of the MRND party.  And I would also add that another reason was that we were already in a time of war.  So the idea of peace spoke for itself.  And I could not but join a party that advocated and preached peace. 
Q.	I thank you.  Mr. Nahimana, do you know Mr. Nzirorera, Joseph? 
A.	Yes.  I know Mr. Nzirorera, and I knew him since we were young people.  I know him, to be more precise, since September 1964, the date when both of us entered secondary school in Byumba.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Byumba is spelt as follows:  B-Y-U-M-B-A.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	And how did your relations evolve?
A.	We went to school together for some time.  As I just said, we entered secondary school at the same time.  We are practically of the same age.  We continued to the minor seminary in Rwesero.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
R-W-E-S-E-R-O. 
THE WITNESS:   
So we were there in the minor seminary for one more year.  Thereafter, he left on the decision of our bishop.  He left for the Musanze school where he did purely scientific subjects.  I continued with my education in that minor seminary.

But once more I met with him at the National University of Rwanda in 1971.  I stayed with him for 
three years at the National University of Rwanda in Butare.  He was in the faculty of science whilst I was in the faculty of arts.
And during that time while we were in the Musanze school, we used to see one another very frequently.  We were friends, and our friendship became stronger, especially when we met at the National University of Rwanda.  I left him in 1974 in the National University of Rwanda.  He had to complete his engineering course in that university whilst I went to Canada to continue with my master's degree.  That is from 1975 as I've said.

Later on after 1977 when I returned to Rwanda, he was already a civil servant, senior level civil servant, in the ministry of public works.  In fact, a few years later, he became a minister of public works.  And as I said, I was a teacher at the faculty of arts or faculty of lettres.  And my career, as you yourself underscored in the questionnaire -- I continued my university training, but we remained friends.  We visited one another.  He would come to my place, and I would go to his place.  

This continued right up to the moment when -- following my appointment to ORINFOR, I was living in Kigali.  Now we were close to one another.  Then -- or later on we were together in politics from the rebirth of multiparty politics and when I joined the MRND party, in particular, from the month of February 1972, the date when he and I -- 1992 rather -- when he and I were elected by the 
MRND congress in Ruhengeri préfecture.  We were elected members of the préfectoral committee of the MRND. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  Indeed we'll be talking about this préfectoral committee of the MRND in Ruhengeri.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry to interrupt.  Did the witness give a month in 1992?  And if he didn't, could you kindly elicit that.
THE WITNESS:
I'm afraid I did not quite understand the question.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	The Prosecutor is asking you whether you can say the month.
A.	Thank you.  If I understand properly, you're referring to the month when Nzirorera and myself were elected members of the MRND préfectoral committee.  It was precisely on the 12th of February 1992. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, Mr. Nahimana, you were elected as a member of the MRND préfectoral committee.  What exactly were your duties as a member of the préfectoral committee? 
A.	As a member of the préfectoral committee -- I will try to be very brief -- we were responsible for the implementation of party ideals and on the statutes of the party and to get members of the population of the area under our jurisdiction to be aware of those ideals; to understand the achievements of the MRND; and of course to get them, members of the population, to espouse the platform of our MRND party.  If I were to summarise it, that is how I would put it. 
Q.	Now, in the course of the implementation of these party ideals, did you hear mention of Interahamwe za MRND in particular? 
A.	Yes.  I know that Interahamwe za MRND existed.  That was conceived and created by a group of 
	young people who were members of the MRND and were led by a certain Murenzi.  So I am aware of the Interahamwe even at the level of rallies. 
Q.	Did these Interahamwe za MRND exist in Kigali? 
A.	I would say, rather, that it was in Kigali that it really existed because the group of about 12 or 15 
	young MRND workers, because these were people who were working in private government and semi-public organisations -- that group was operating in Kigali in the capital city.

And it is there that other young people were mobilised.  And according to them and according to what I know, it is from Kigali, using Kigali as a base, that they tried to get the younger people to understand the ideas of the MRND.  That was their main objective.  So I know that they existed in Kigali. 
Q.	Now, what about Ruhengeri?  Were there Interahamwe za MRND there? 
A.	In Ruhengeri Interahamwe za MRND did not exist as an organisation which was part of the party in Ruhengeri.  And in order to avoid any confusion, let me actually say that never, even at the 
	national level, has the Interahamwe been an organisation that was integrated into the MRND party and approved by it as such.

But as long as the MRND is concerned, Mr. President, Your Honours, as a historian and given my career as a professor, I have learned not to speak in abstract terms because sometimes that rubs off the relevance of what is being discussed.

At the time of multiparty politics which led to the creation of youth wings, we were at war.  And my native préfecture, Ruhengeri, was at least about three-quarters -- about three-quarters of that préfecture was at war.  All the communes of northern Ruhengeri were at war.

And amongst the 16 communes of that préfecture, virtually 11 of them were concerned.  And a 
good number of displaced persons flocked into the préfecture.  I would actually call them refugees.  Let me point out that following the express written request from a member of the préfectoral committee whose name was Pierre Ntanushoboro, spelled N-T-A-N-U-S-H-O-B-O-R-O -- that is a long name, but I think that is correct.  And this person prepared a letter relating to the organisation of Interahamwe za MRND.

Mr. Ntanushoboro wrote a letter which I personally countersigned along with another colleague whose name was Mbarutsa, spelled M-B-A-R-U-T-S-A.  And that letter was addressed to the 
bureau of the Ruhengeri préfectoral committee.  And the letter was asking that consideration of the possibility of creating Interahamwe za MRND in the préfecture should be placed on the agenda.

And indeed the chairman of the party in Ruhengeri, Mr. Casimir Bizimungu, placed that item on the agenda.  And at the end of the proceedings, we decided that on account of the very special situation of our préfecture, of the situation of the young people of our préfecture who were displaced persons in the majority, it was not proper, either for us in the MRND or for members of other political parties, to get these young displaced persons into the youth wings of the parties; that it was necessary to get them enrolled in a state programme, as was the case with all the other war-displaced persons, and that it was not proper to give young people the impression or the hope that the fact of belonging to the youth wing called Interahamwe za MRND was going to entitle them to some benefits and take them out of the misery which the war had brought on them.  And that is the main reason that led us to take the decision that in Ruhengeri there would be no youth wing of the Interahamwe za MRND. 
Q.	If I understand you correctly, Mr. Nahimana, what you have just said is also valid for Mukingo commune.  Am I correct? 
A.	Absolutely.  In fact, Mukingo was already affected by the war.  In fact, on several occasions before 1994, Mukingo was attacked.  In fact, one of the areas of Mukingo which was not affected by the war was a place where displaced persons gathered.  And that was true for the entire commune. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, I thank you.  But now, do you know Mr. Charles Hategekimana? 
A.	Yes.  I know him very well.  He was the permanent secretary of the MRND préfectoral committee in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Nahimana, during the various court sessions, we have had the opportunity to look through a document sent by Mr. Charles Hategekimana on the behalf of Dr. Casimir Bizimungu who was the chairman of the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture, and in that letter where he was calling on MRND militants to carry out a number of activities, he addressed a copy of the letter to the Interahamwe in Mukingo.

How do you explain that attitude?  Tell the Chamber.
A.	Let me start off by saying that I'm aware of a number of correspondences made by 
	Charles Hategekimana in relation to what you have just said, Interahamwe and so on.  Let me say that, after the decision we took, we reacted to the correspondence from him.  We decided that we had to listen to him first, and the committee called him to ask him to explain why he could talk about Interahamwe in our préfecture when those of us in the préfectoral committee had decided that we could not allow the creation of that youth wing in our préfecture.

And during this exchange, he explained that the Interahamwe he was referring to was not the Interahamwe as was understood in Kigali; that he conceded that there were young people who were members of the MRND party, and since Interahamwe sounded good -- and it should also be said that the Interahamwe were animating party activities at the local level, at the préfectoral level, in other regions.
And in Ruhengeri we had young people who, even during the single-party system, that is, before 1991, were wearing the uniform of MRND.  To him all those young people who had continued to belong to the MRND -- he called them "Interahamwe".  And that is terrible confusion at our level.  And this made us to ask him to stop creating confusion, "Now, if you want to address young militants of the MRND, please say so and do not say you are addressing yourself to Interahamwe za MRND."  That, for one.

Mr. President, Your Honours, secondly, he did not comply with our instructions.  And we'd asked the chairman to sanction him.  And in fact, part of his salary was held, and he was suspended for a 
fortnight.  These are steps that we took or measures that we took because he did not comply with the orders of the préfectoral committee.

Now, when people say "Interahamwe", please understand that in his mind he was referring to these young people who were animating party activities at the local level when there was a meeting or rally in the area, these young people who had actually declared themselves as members of the party but not the organisation as was known in Kigali town.  There was no such entity in Ruhengeri.  So this was misuse of language which even led to punishment.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Pardon me, Mr. Nimy.  I have no objection.  I just have a request.  Could you elicit from the witness when this conversation took place with Mr. Hategekimana.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Yes, Witness.  Could you address the Prosecutor's concern.  That is, he would like to know when this conversation with Mr. Charles Hategekimana took place.
A.	I believe I gave information that would lead you to answer that question.  That is, if you take the first letter written by Hategekimana, you would see the date.  I do not have the letter before me.  It was immediately after that first letter because, given the situation in Ruhengeri, we met often.  Even if the rules allowed for a quarterly meeting, we were holding meetings on almost a monthly basis.

So if we take that first letter, after that first letter that mentioned Interahamwe za MRND, we reacted.  And shortly after our complaint, he continued, and we punished him for that. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, these young people you have just talked about who were interested in the Interahamwe za MRND, without being the young people that Mr. Charles Hategekimana was talking about, as far as you were concerned, did these young people have anything to do with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Not at all.  These young people -- in fact, one thing should be clear.  The young members of the MRND party in Ruhengeri préfecture, just like the young members of MRND throughout the 
	country -- Nzirorera as a member had something to do with them because he was a militant of the party which we joined.  That, for one.  So it should be clear.

Now, if what you mean is that these young people in Ruhengeri who said they were members of the Interahamwe za MRND youth wing had something to do with him, then that is different.  The young people who said they belonged to Interahamwe za MRND had nothing to do with Mr. Nzirorera because, Mr. President, Your Honours, Nzirorera was the vice-chairman of the Ruhengeri MRND préfectoral committee.  He was one of the decision-makers, and he was somebody whom we elected along with the president and the secretary of the party.  And he was assigned to implement the orders of the préfectoral committee.

Nzirorera, unless it is not the Nzirorera I know -- but the Nzirorera I know could not afford to implement that decision even in his native commune.  As a result, therefore, it is absolutely false to say that Nzirorera would have acted in favour of or animated or supported Interahamwe za MRND in his native commune.  That is impossible.

And furthermore -- I am a witness to this.  I was with Nzirorera at his home, especially during the weekends.  And I never saw Nzirorera with young people who claimed to be members of Interahamwe za MRND.  Never.  Never.  Mr. Nzirorera is a popular person.  He is a well-known name in our area.  And he had relations with elderly people, his age mates, and young people, but not with members of Interahamwe za MRND as such.   
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, thank you.  And that is what my question was eliciting because there has been a lot of confusion about that reality, and I wanted you to clarify that situation before the Chamber.
A.	I hope that I did so. 
Q.	I thank you.  Mr. Nahimana, as a member of the MRND at the préfectoral level, you were aware of a certain number of meetings or activities of the MRND.
A.	Yes, I was. 
Q.	Very well.  Let us now go through a number of these meetings and/or activities.  On the 
	15th of November 1992, there was a very important event in Ruhengeri.  Did you hear about it? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	And what was this all about? 
A.	This was a rally of the MRND party at the Ruhengeri préfecture level.  It was a very big rally. 
Q.	This rally -- did the president, Juvénal Habyarimana, attend that rally?
A.	Yes, he did.  On the 15th of November 1992. 
Q.	Were you yourself present? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I was not present at that rally.  I heard about it and subsequently read the speeches that were made there.

1030H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Was Mr. Nzirorera present? 
A.	No.  If anybody came here and said that Nzirorera was present at that huge rally in Ruhengeri, he would be lying to the Chamber, because, Mr. President, Your Honours, it would be tantamount to say that I myself, Ferdinand Nahimana, was present at the rally.  Why am I saying so?  Because on that day on the 15th in the evening, I was in Brussels in Belgium and I had a meal with Mr. Nzirorera. 

And, in fact, in this Tribunal that question was put to me by the Prosecutor at the Trial Chamber level of my own case.  And I exhibited pages of my passport proving that I was indeed in Brussels in Belgium.  So I was in Belgium with Nzirorera.  So Nzirorera could not be in Ruhengeri because he could not be in Ruhengeri and in Brussels at the same time. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, as regards the content of the messages which had been sent during that rally, do you know any -- do you know anything about them, that is, the contents? 
A.	As I said a while ago, I know about it from what I hear -- I heard -- rather -- rather than from what I read. 
Q.	What did you hear, Mr. Nahimana? 
A.	The key point on which people dwelt was the speech by the president of the republic, Juvénal Habyarimana.  Inside that speech what caught the attention of the public and which was 
	even -- which came up during my trial is the issue relating to the Arusha Peace Accords.  Some people distorted the meaning of the president's speech and purported that President Habyarimana had described the Arusha Accords as some rag, some rubbish to be thrown away.  

Now, if you read that speech and if your objective is to read the speech carefully -- if you read the document of the speech carefully, you cannot come to the conclusion that Habyarimana described the Arusha Peace Accords as rubbish.  It was -- it was, rather, in Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye's letter that one finds confusion, one finds the -- the tendency to describe the Arusha Peace Accords as rubbish, because the prime minister of the MDR party exploited or used that speech to denigrate President Habyarimana and lie to public opinion by saying that Habyarimana had disqualified the Arusha Peace Accords.  The prime minister himself in his letter used the word, quote/unquote, rubbish or chiffon de papier in French.  

When I read that document, I ask myself how a politician of that level could have used such language.  A politician of the level of the prime minister, how could he have said that the president of the republic had described the Arusha Peace Accords as rubbish?  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I think it is time for our morning break. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1033H to 1107H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Nimy, you can continue.  
MR. NIMY: 
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry.  Mr. Nimy, before you continue, the Chamber would like to deliver an oral decision, and Judge Joensen will deliver it on our behalf. 
JUDGE JOENSEN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

And the decision reads:  On 9 April 2010, Joseph Nzirorera filed his expected order of appearance for remaining witnesses and motion for leave to call rejected Rule 92 bis witnesses viva voce.  In the alternative Nzirorera moves the Chamber to reconsider its decision not to admit the written statements of the 20 witnesses in question.  The Prosecution has not responded to the motion.

The Chamber recalls that in its decision dated 24 October 2008 it ordered Joseph Nzirorera to limit his Defence case to approximately 55 witnesses in the equivalent of 45 full trial days.  The Chamber has subsequently granted Nzirorera additional time for the cross-examination of witnesses whose statements were found admissible pursuant to Rule 92 bis subject to the cross-examination of the witnesses.  The Chamber is still of the opinion that the allotted time is sufficient to allow Joseph Nzirorera a fair opportunity to present his case.  

The Chamber further finds it in the interest of justice to allow Nzirorera to call witnesses who are on his witness list with reference to Rule 92 bis to give live testimony to the extent possible without exceeding the set limits with respect to time and number of witnesses, not including witnesses to be cross-examined in relation to 92 bis statements.  

With respect to possible remaining witnesses on his witness list with reference to Rule 92 bis, Nzirorera has not provided any explanation of why reconsideration should be granted.  The Chamber will, therefore, not reconsider its decisions at this time.  

For these reasons the Chamber grants Joseph Nzirorera's motion in part and orders him to file a revised witness list with the expected order of appearance within seven days after the delivery of the Chamber's decisions on the pending motions concerning witnesses other than witnesses to be cross-examined in relation to Rule 92 bis statements.  

This was the decision.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Yes.  Mr. Nimy, you may continue now. 
MR. NIMY: 
I will proceed, Mr. President, subject to the reaction that my lead counsel may have following this decision because he is the one who filed the motion.  

But as far as I am concerned, I will proceed with the examination of Witness Nahimana. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, let us continue.  We were talking about the various meetings of the MRND party, and before our mid-morning break, we talked about the meeting of the 15th of November 1992.  Was there a meeting in January 1993 at Busengo?  Does that ring a bell? 
A.	Yes.  Busengo is the headquarters of my native sous-préfecture.  And if my memory serves me correctly, it was on the 23rd of January 1993.  And I was present at that meeting. 
Q.	And what was discussed during that meeting? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, on the 23rd of January 1993 -- should be linked to the events that just occurred in the country, that is, the signing here in Arusha of the so-called "power-sharing accord".  Unless the Chamber invites me to do so, I will leave aside the details.  

But this accord gave parties which were close to RPF and the RPF itself supremacy which was not given through elections.  And the effect could be felt in the portfolios in the ministries within the broad-based transitional government.  We should recall here that in June 1992 the MDR, the PL, the PSD parties had, as members of what they referred to as FDC, democratic forces for change -- had met in Brussels in early June, that is, with the RPF.  And together those three parties plus the RPF had reached an agreement, a political -- a political and military agreement.  On the one hand, the RPF was offering its military force to continue the war to purportedly weaken the Habyarimani --
Habyarimana regime under the Rwandan army.  And on the other hand, these three parties were offering the RPF the internal political force and destabilisation and information services.  

And there is a paragraph that states that they commit themselves to destabilising the administrative system.  And this was something that had been going on as from June.  So in January -- I believe it was on the 9th of January 1993 -- the...(microphones overlapping)...of foreign affairs, who was a member of the MDR party, and the prime minister, who was also a member of MDR, came to an agreement with the RPF to convince even the international community that this power-sharing agreement had to be signed.  

Now, what was noticeable was that out of 21 portfolios in the government the 
forces for democratic change, that is, RPF along with the other three parties, had 15 of the 21 portfolios.  Out of 70 seats of the assembly of -- the broad-based transitional assembly, this group had 84 (sic) out of 92 (sic) seats -- 64 (sic), rather, out of 92 (sic) seats.  And if you look at it quickly, you realise that such a -- an imbalance in a fragile situation was not normal.  

And it is within that context that on the 23rd of January 1993 we organised a rally to explain the political situation of the time and to draw the attention of militants to the prevailing situation.  However, in spite of the situation or the contest a few days before, I should point out that the president of the republic, in a bid to preserve peace, had stated that in spite of that imbalance it was necessary or it was better to have an agreement and especially peace.  And he had asked that people should not continue to challenge that agreement.  

So it was necessary, therefore, to explain this situation to the militants and to members of the population.  Because it needs to be said that, when there is a meeting of that nature, it is not only members of the MRND party who take part but members of the population in general.  

And as I said earlier on in the morning, our préfecture and even the sous-préfecture also was virtually in a war zone.  And near the place where the meeting was held, there were camps for displaced persons.  And these -- or the people in these camps needed to know what was happening at the time.  They needed to know the political situation.  Why was it, for example, that RPF, a rebellion which had caused such displacement of persons, should be given so many portfolios and so many seats in the assembly without asking members of the population through an election?  So in the rallies that we organised, those who took the floor based their statements on what I just described.  

And still in a -- in a bid to respect our ideals, everybody ended up saying that whatever the situation we should be united and priority should always be given to peace.  The RPF should never be allowed to get the country into a situation of chaos and disorder.  Mr. President, Your Honours, that was the thrust of that meeting of the 23rd of January in Busengo sous-préfecture, my native area. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
MR. NIMY:
My apologies. 

BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Nahimana.  Do you confirm that that meeting was political in nature? 
A.	Yes.  It was a political meeting.  Yes. 
Q.	Did any of the participants ask that people should disassociate themselves from the peace process? 
A.	As I just told the Chamber, we made it a point of duty to explain the process and position of the president of the republic.  During that meeting or that exchange, we wanted to ensure that people actually understood the negotiation process.  This was in January 1993.  And the process was ongoing.  A number of accords had been signed, and that one of power-sharing was the last.  But the process was ongoing, and the final accord was signed in August -- in the course of the year.  

So no -- there was no statement requesting the population -- or saying to the population that the negotiation process should not continue.  Quite on the contrary, the people were asked to be waiting for the outcome of that process and that under all circumstances priority should be given to peace. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, did one or -- one or more of the speakers of -- incite members of the population against the Tutsi ethnic group? 
A.	Never.  And that could not have been the case.  Why?  Because, as I have said under several occasions, our party had three main points at the heart of our political ideology.  That was -- or they were unity, peace, and development.  You cannot talk about peace while you are trying to exclude others.  You cannot talk about unity by excluding Tutsis.  

	So if anybody said so -- even if somebody had the idea of saying so, which never happened, the person would never have had any place there.  So in a word nobody said any such thing. 
Q.	Was Mr. Nzirorera present at that event? 
A.	Yes, he was there.  At the national level, the party chairman and important members of the party at the préfectoral and national levels were all there.  Nzirorera was there.  Mathieu, for example, was there and Karemera. 
Q.	Did he say anything? 
A.	Yes, he did. 
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber what he said.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Nzirorera is a very popular person in my native area, in the entire préfecture, Ruhengeri préfecture, and in the country.  And it was impossible for us of that area not to give the floor to Mr. Nzirorera, who was very well listened to.  And as a result of his popularity, we were sure that his message would be understood and complied with by the population.  

And the content of his message could be summarised by what I just said.  Using his intelligence and eloquence, he explained the entire process, the process for -- for -- the quest for peace, which was ongoing.  And then since we were in a war situation and in a war zone, he ensured that -- he reassured the members of the population of efforts being made to achieve peace, to put an end to the war so that people should return to their own properties.  

However, he insisted on the fact that it would not be easy, because we had as opponents the RPF which was determined to fight until the end, until the -- it took over power by force.  I remember that that important situation was not concealed from members of the population.  We had as our opponents the RPF which, in spite of the talks going on, was actually breaking the terms of the peace fire (sic).  

I remember that after the 8th of February, a few weeks after the Busengo meeting, I approached Mr. Nzirorera to tell him that, "You were in a way a prophet because you said that, if ever the war broke out again, it would not be because of us but because of the RPF which did not want to heed to the message of peace, which did not want the problems to be solved peacefully."  

I said 8th of February because on the 8th of February 1993 the RPF launched an attack which clearly caused thousands and thousands of people to be displaced.  And by the end of February, there were about one million war-displaced persons in Rwanda.  

So when he took the floor, he addressed all those issues.  But he always gave priority to peace.  And since we were in a Bukonya region, as it was said, which had the reputation of being a region of people who understood and supported calm amongst members of the population, he asked that those people should serve as an example, not only to other members of the population within Ruhengeri but to people of the entire country.  And he concluded by thanking members of the local population for having hosted the displaced persons and having shared with those people whatever little thing they had at the time.  In a word that was the message that Mr. Nzirorera put -- or gave during that meeting. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Nahimana.  But for matters of methodology, as far as I am concerned, Mr. Nahimana, you would allow me to conclude on two points relating to meetings in the -- in 1992.  In that way we would be able to continue on with the meetings of 1993, 1994.  Did you understand me clearly?  
A.	Yes.  Meetings of 1992 first.  I understood you. 
Q.	So I will now move on to the meetings of 1992.  On the 28th of May 1992, there was a meeting at the Kimihurura roundabout.  Does that ring a bell, Mr. Nahimana? 
A.	Yes.  It was the -- that -- that meeting rings a bell, because I was there personally. 
Q.	Can you explain to the Court what the meeting was about.  
A.	In fact, it was a demonstration, a demonstration which did not take place at the Kimihurura roundabout, as you just said, but which started downtown and people converged at the Kimihurura roundabout.  What was the purpose of the demonstration?  The MRND had invited democrats -- first of all, its militants and then democrats to demonstrate -- to demonstrate their disagreement with the manner in which Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye ruled the country.  It was a way of disagreeing with Nsengiyaremye's government.  In the main that was the purpose of the demonstration. 
Q.	And was Joseph Nzirorera present at that demonstration as well? 
A.	Yes, he was present. 
Q.	Did he take the floor? 
A.	Yes, he did. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court the substance of what he said.  
A.	Like the other activists or militants who took the floor -- in fact, the floor was given to the chairman or president of the party in Kigali town.  That was the constituency in which the demonstration was taking place.  The floor was also given to national leaders of the party, and Nzirorera was one of the national leaders.  He took the floor and illustrated what was wrong with the Nsengiyaremye government.  

Now, we shouldn't forget that we were in 1992.  The war was going on.  The management of the war was a daily concern of politicians as the -- as well as the general population.  At every meeting it was said that Nsengiyaremye was not able to manage the war properly.  So Nzirorera's speech focused on that theme, that is, the management of the war. 

I should also say that that demonstration was going to reveal its full weight later on in March 1993 when Mr. Nsengiyaremye signed with the RPF the agreement placing the -- the French intervention forces to leave Rwanda, thus allowing the RPF to take over power by force in Kigali.  As an activist of the MRND, I said we were right to decry, to denounce the policy of collusion between Dismas Nsengiyaremye with the RPF.  

The MDR policy -- the MDR party, of which he was a member -- that policy which consisted of 
approche -- rapprochement with the RPF -- in fact, events that happened after that demonstration vindicated our position.  They vindicated our position because the -- our -- what we denounce is precisely what led us into a disastrous situation. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, do you remember whether during the said meeting songs were sung, songs that were hostile to the Tutsi? 
A.	No, not at all. 
Q.	Participants at that meeting, didn't they sing the song entitled, quote/unquote, Tubatsembatsembe?  
A.	Counsel, Mr. President, Your Honours, I am often disturbed when I see the confusion that is being made in this trial -- or these trials.  Tubatsembatsembe, that song is attributed to the young militants of the CDR party.  I'm not saying that I never heard that song whilst I was in Rwanda, that I never heard it anywhere.  

But according to the information that the Prosecutor provides through its witnesses, it is said that Tubatsembatsembe was sung.  And now you are saying that perhaps that song was sung during the demonstration we are referring to.  No.  That was not possible.  That song could not be ascribed to the MRND and the CDR at the same time.  

In any case, I would like the Court to understand my feelings.  As -- MRND party members were very stable in our position.  And that position was one of peace, and we sung peace.  We always appealed to people to unite.  

But tubatsembatsembe -- I do not know whether that phrase has ever been translated, but it means "exterminate them" in the plural.  It is practically antagonistic.  It is the anti -- antithesis of our ideological position.  Therefore, it was not possible for us to sing that song.  I assert here that not only did we not sing that song but I did not hear it.  And furthermore, the party management, the management of our party, would not have accepted such a digression. 
Q.	Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Nahimana.  Are you in a position to talk to some extent about the events of Bugesera, the events of March 1992? 
A.	Yes.  I am in a position to talk about those events.  Yes. 
Q.	Please can you tell the Court what exactly happened.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, when reference is made to the events of Bugesera, the events of March 1992, what is meant by this is the indirectly -- confrontations that took place from the night 
	of -- in the night of 5 to 6 March 1992.  Perhaps you would be surprised as to why I am so precise on the dates.  At the time referred to, I was director of the Office rwandais d'information, 
	Rwandan information authority.  That authority was at the head of the public media.  And the authority also had relations with the private media.  So I was well informed of the events.  

What happened?  The events in question -- or, rather, these inter-ethnic conflicts followed or happened after a rally which took place at a place called Kanzenze -- K-A-N-Z-E-N-Z-E -- on the 1st of March 1992.  The rally was organised and supervised by the PL party management.  During the rally the chairman of the PL party, namely, Justin Mugenzi, thinking or believing in his own way that he was in an area where he had many supporters or members of his party -- and in particular Tutsi members, because that area is one of the areas of Rwanda where there are many Tutsis.  

So Justin Mugenzi called on the population to send away the sitting bourgmestre.  The name of that bourgmestre was Rwambuka, R-W-A-M-B-U-K -- like khaki -- and A.  Rwambuka.  That bourgmestre was a member of the MRND party.  Not only did Mugenzi ask the population to send him away, that is, send Rwambuka away, but he even suggested how he should be sent away.  If the population had suggested that the bourgmestre be sent away through the ballot box, that would be understandable because that would be democracy.  But Mugenzi asked the population to send away the bourgmestre by force.  Indeed, on the very evening of the day he said that, a group of people of the PL party attacked the bourgmestre.  The bourgmestre saved his life -- saved his life by running away.  

The following day, that is, on the 2nd or the 3rd, there were tracts.  And according to the prosecutor in office at the time, that is, Mr. François Nsanzuwera, who is certainly known in this Tribunal -- according to him tracts were distributed by the chairman of the PL party at the local level in Bugesera, namely, François Gahima.  Gahima is spelt as follows:  G -- like Gregory -- A-H-I-M-A.  

I say so because Mr. Nsanzuwera arrested him himself personally.  And later on, when 
Gahima's counsel or lawyer requested that he be released, Nsanzuwera requested that he could -- he should remain in detention because one, he was caught red-handed; and two, Nsanzuwera had information to the effect that Mr. Gahima was at the origin of the laying of anti-personnel mines which exploded here and there throughout the region or area.  Therefore, in that context -- precisely in that context or climate -- it is in that context that inter-ethnic conflicts broke out.  

A day before, that is, on the 5th, in the afternoon of the 3rd, and in the morning of the 4th, Radio Rwanda, following a report produced by journalists and the analysis of documents that were available at the time, the release of an organisation which was based in Nairobi and working on human rights but which had members inside Rwanda -- after, therefore, analysing all these documents and the information obtained on the ground, there was an editorial.  The editorial said that the population had to be vigilant and that the pop -- people should not give in to the temptations of inter-ethnic hatred.  Because, as a journalist said, the PL party showed itself as being the internal wing of the RPF party.  In fact, they said that the RPF used members of the PL party to destabilise the country.  

In general, this is how the message read:  After the inter-ethnic conflicts broke out on the 6th -- on the 6th fearing -- or, rather, fearing that Mr. Mugenzi and his party would be taken for being -- or be considered as being responsible for these bloody events in the area, there was a meeting, a consultation between members of the notorious FDC even before Brussels.  The MDR, the PSD, and the PL met, and Mugenzi convinced them to say that inter-ethnic hatred which occurred in Bugesera was the handiwork of the editorial of Radio Rwanda.  

And that is how the party, the MDR party, for example, signed a release, a communiqué, communiqué number 12.  In that communiqué they considered the editorial of Radio Rwanda responsible for what happened and requested that Ferdinand Nahimana should leave ORINFOR, that the minister of information should also leave, that the minister of interior should also leave.  This is what they requested.  
I had the opportunity of meeting the prime minister who had invited me in his office.  And he sought to know my position as well as the position of the journalists, our positions in relation to what the MDR, PL, and CDR were advancing or saying.  These parties had also influenced human rights associations to see to it that facts were presented as they wanted.  

And that is how Alison Des Forges came into the show.  Alison Des Forges has been an expert witness several times before this Tribunal.  What happened?  Mrs. Des Forges is not on the ground, but she is in contact with Mr. Justin Mugenzi.  Justin Mugenzi sends her fax messages, and Mrs. Des Forges, in return or, rather, directly, from the United States, appears before the media and declares that the events of Bugesera should be attributed to Radio Rwanda, Radio Rwanda which is part and parcel of ORINFOR, the Rwandan information authority. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, later on I was able to know or find out how matters were 
orche -- orches -- orchestrated -- sorry.  And I was able to know this through a co-detainee, Mr. Nzakerarena (sic).  He, as a member of the MDR party, signed the letter or, rather, the communiqué in which the editorial of Radio Rwanda was incriminated and in which I was asked to be dismissed from ORINFOR.  

In a nutshell, this is what he told me -- and I have even included this in my book, the last book I published.  And the book is entitled Rwanda, Les Virages Ratés, Rwanda:  Missed turning points, a loose translation in English.  This was published in June 2006 (sic).  I completed the -- writing this book in my cell at the detention facility of the ICTR.  

Now, he said that Mugenzi convinced them that it was necessary to act, as I've just told you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The secretary of the MDR party wrote a communiqué which espoused what -- the agreement between Mugenzi and the MDR party.  And over the telephone the 
secretary of -- the secretaries of the MDR called, one by one, the signatories of the letter.  

And that is how Mr. Éliezer Niyitegeka, who was in his oil business, was called.  He was told he had an urgent document to sign.  He showed up.  He was asked or made to read the document.  He refused to read it.  He said, "What is it about?  Give me a summary of what is in the document."  He was told, quote/unquote, "We are holding ORINFOR responsible for the effects -- events in Bugesera.  And since the MDR wanted to take the position of director in order to control information in the press or the 
media and the position of minister of information, according to Mr. Niyitegeka, this was a welcome opportunity." 

So he didn't even read the document.  He just signed it.  It is only later on that -- when even the members of the MDR reacted by saying, quote/unquote, it is not possible to hold editorial responsible.  This ed -- the editorial has never used the word "Tutsi".  We cannot make them responsible for the events which have broken out.
(Pages 13 to 23 by Tanya West)


































1200H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
And two, we cannot hold Nahimana responsible for those events.  

And thirdly, asking that Nahimana leave the information authority wasn't acceptable, especially as I was held in high esteem because of the manner in which I managed the information authority, ORINFOR.  And I was told that it was that -- at that moment that he read the document and he noticed that it was said in the document that the Bugesera events had broken out, because the editorial had been published.  I think I could stop here.  Well, in any case, I would like to, rather, conclude.  

Later on, the minister of justice -- there was a commission, a commission which included the members or representatives of various ministries and the préfet of Kigali town -- Kigali town in which Bugesera is originally found.  There was a committee that was set up to find those who were responsible and to prosecute the -- those responsible.  And --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I didn't follow the name the witness used, Nsanzuwera.  
THE WITNESS:
So the majority of the people arrested were not members of the MDR and PL parties.  But to the general surprise -- or to the surprise of everyone, later on, even the vice-chairman of the PL party, Mr. Landouald Ndasingwa, said it.  The troublemakers -- the perpetrators of those killings were released.  They were released when Mr. Nsanzuwera was prosecutor in Kigali.  Nobody understood this.  

In the meantime, of course, Mr. Landouald said, "Once more, Mr. Mugenzi, who is responsible" -- and, I say it because Mr. Landouald Ndasingwa made this declaration over the RTLM radio, and it is documented here in the Tribunal.  He said that he holds the chairman of the PL party, and Mr. Mugenzi at the national level and the chairman of the PL party at the local level, Mr. Gahima, François -- that he held them responsible for these events, the Bugesera events.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  Did the MRND organise a meeting on 23 October 1993? 
A.	On the 23rd of October 1993, no.  The party -- that party did not organise a meeting.  I know that there was a demonstration, a political demonstration on the 23rd of October 1993.  That was after the assassination of Melchoir Ndadaye, but that was not the initiative of the MRND as far as I know.  I must say that I followed that over the radio.  I was not present in the stadium where that meeting took place.  
Q.	In fact, you have just talked about the assassination of President Melchoir Ndadaye in October 1993.  What was the impact of that assassination on opposition political parties -- that is, parties that were opposed to the MRND party? 
A.	To put in context what I'm going to say, it is necessary to recall that Melchoir Ndadaye, the 
President of Burundi, was the first Hutu, because in Rwanda, like in Burundi, the reality -- there is a social reality -- a political and social reality which should not be overlooked, and this is the 
Hutu-Tutsi divide.  

From independence to 1993, Burundi was led by Tutsis.  From 1972, if my recollection is right or slightly before, it was Tutsi officers who led Burundi.  So Ndadaye was the first elected Hutu president.  
Hope was reborn in the area, hope from the standpoint of multiparty democracy.  It was thought that multiparty democracy was becoming a reality not only in the Great Lakes region, but across Africa as a whole.  But he was assassinated on the night of the 20, 21st October 1993 by the Burundian army.  

I would say that the army was either entirely a Tutsi army or most of its members were Tutsi.  What was the reaction at the -- what was the reaction of the political parties that were opposed to the MRND? 
I said it earlier on.  These parties in the main were PL, PSD and MDR.  These parties were together with the RPF.  Now, what did the supporters or the members of these parties notice?  The assassination of Ndadaye opened their eyes.  They realised that since 1990, all the agreements had been broken by the RPF.  They realised that the RPF was seeking power through force.  That is the first reaction.  

Secondly, they realised that within the RPF -- in the management of the RPF, in the army of the RPF, certainly there were some Hutus but that the rebellion -- the RPF movement was practically entirely Tutsi.  

So those who were critical within the party asked their management to break up their coalition with the RPF.  We are in the month of October -- October 1993.  They could already remember two events which had already caused a split amongst these parties:  The meeting of Brussels in June, in early June -- or end of May, early June 1992, that meeting had already created a split amongst these parties;  the second very serious event, which I also mentioned briefly, was the RPF attack of 8th of February 1993.  So the split was now very clear.  And the death of Ndadaye came to establish this split once and for all.  

And it was said that power should be accessed through the ballot box.  And that is how these parties organised the demonstration to support democracy; a demonstration also to reject the position taken by Burundian soldiers.  That demonstration -- as I told you I was not present, but according to what I heard over the radio -- moreover, this was arranged.  It was agreed that, on arrival at the stadium, the speeches would be broadcast live, especially over RTLM and Radio Rwanda.  The speeches were broadcast live because Muhabura radio did not broadcast the speeches live, but other radios broadcast them practically at the same moment, that is, live.  

So this meeting in Nyamirambo stadium was a meeting of all those who were advocates of democracy.  And in spite of the origin of the initiative, it was not only the activists of the MDR party who were present, but practically the entire population of Kigali town and its environs.  All these people met at Nyamirambo stadium to support democracy and to reject the taking over of power in Burundi by force.  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, was it on that occasion that MDR -- MDR Power was mentioned? 
A.	Yes.  It was on that occasion that the vice-chairman of MDR, Mr. Frodouald Karamira -- Karamira is spelt K-A-R-A-M-E-R-A (sic) -- the vice-chairperson of the MDR made a speech during which he said MDR Power, CDR Power, MRND Power, Hutu Power.  So that it was on that occasion.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Correction on Karamira from the booth:  K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, MDR Power, Hutu Power, were these slogans or was this a new ideology? 
A.	These were slogans.  He was just talking.  And, at one point in time, in order to mobilise those present in order to draw a particular attention to a point, he said, "Hutu Power".  Just like we at the level of MRND -- if there are any Kinyarwanda interpreters -- they will say, "Long live MRND.  Long live President Habyarimana."  So it was just a slogan that -- that Mr. Karamira was using.  
Q.	Was this a slogan as a result of the certainty of the situation?  Of -- of the RPF trying to take power by force or a slogan against the Tutsi ethnic group? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  I'm objecting to the leading nature of the question.  If Mr. Nimy can refrain from suggesting (inaudible) to the witness.  
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Prosecutor.  I could rephrase that.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	MDR Power, Hutu Power -- did these have any link with the extermination of Tutsis? 
A.	No, not at all.  This was a slogan which, if properly analysed using objective criteria -- it ties in with the situation that had just -- the situation in Burundi at the time.  Power is power and the MDR Power -- or the MDR party can achieve power through the ballot box.  

In his place I would have said, "People of Rwanda power" because it is the people who have the power.  I would have added, "People power", because the power is with the people.  So in the face of the situation of the RPF and with the opposition parties, in particular the MDR whose objective he knew, that is, the objective of taking over power by force, it was time for him to say, "No.  Power is achieved using means other than weapons or arms.  Power belongs to you, you the people.  Give power to the MDR."  
But since he knew very well that other party militants were present, he did not do it for -- to himself.  
He said, "Take the power from -- or to give the power to MDR, if you think that they deserve it.  Give it to PL, if you think that PL deserves power."
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  This leads me to talk about elections -- about the elections that were organised in November 1993 in the demilitarised zone which was under RPF control.  Did you hear about those elections? 
A.	Yes.  The elections were organised also in my préfecture in September, October 1993, because these were elections that were organised in the area referred to as the demilitarised zone between the Rwandan army and the RPF army.  And in the six -- this affected the six communes which were there, and that is my native préfecture.  That I was not only a member of -- I did not only hail from the Ruhengeri area, but I was a member of the préfectoral committee.  And these elections were organised under the aegis and control of UNAMIR, which was already in the country.  

And all political parties were called upon to present candidates, communal conseillers, and once they had been elected, they had to select amongst themselves the one who had to be the bourgmestre or mayor of the various communes of that area.  

The elections were organised and held.  And at the end of those elections, the MRND won the majority of seats in the various communes.  The RPF lost all the seats in that commune, and in reaction, the RPF organised the massacre of the elected members of the MRND.  

I think in those six communes -- Nyamugali, Butaro, Kidaho, and Nkumba -- I think four or five, there were 55 dead in the night of the 17th to the 18th of November 1993.  And amongst those 55, there were children and women no doubt, but amongst these people who were killed, there were 33 elected representatives of the MRND.  I am saying so, Mr. President, Your Honours, because I was a direct witness to this massacre.  

I left Kigali to lecture at the National University of Rwanda, the Ruhengeri campus.  And when I got to Ruhengeri, I was told about the massacre, and I joined the convoy that was led by UNAMIR and I saw with my own eyes the family -- the family of Kanyamibwa, who had been elected 
communal conseiller.  He himself, his wife and children were still in blood.  So I was a direct witness to it.  And the following day, when I returned to Kigali, I granted an interview in which I described what I had seen.  And this interview was aired on Radio RTLM on the 20th of November 1993.  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, why did the RPF kill people who had been democratically elected at the head of a democratic unit? 
A.	In my analysis, I decided to publicly say on the airwaves of Radio RTLM -- in fact, people who are not aware of the level of -- of democracy -- but the RPF rebellion did not work in that way.  And the RPF -- the RPF killed precisely because the fact that it had failed -- had shown that it was impossible for it to accede to power through the ballot box -- and that is why it killed.  

And if -- had -- if they had been put in power, they would not have any collaborators in that area.  
The RPF killed, and, from that point, influential people of the region fled and gave them a situation where they could act.  And as far as I am concerned, I say that contrary to this advance, the Prosecutor and, unfortunately, some Judges of this Tribunal are misled.  

That is a test of the genocide; that it was planned and tested.  And it was subsequently sparked off by the RPF because on the 2nd of April -- on the 2nd of April 1994, General Kagame himself told the military leader of UNAMIR that he was going to start a cataclysm which nobody could stop and -- and he, therefore, ordered the assassination of President Habyarimana and sparked off massacres.  

And as far I'm concerned, that cataclysm is genocide which was against the Hutus from the very beginning.  And unfortunately, that genocide -- that cataclysm against Hutus took with it hundreds of thousands of Tutsi lives.  They were victims.  And I say that that genocide -- that cataclysm which I've gone through of the Great Lakes areas, Africa, and humanity as a whole, nobody can deny it.  And the Prosecutor has no right to cover up these planners and perpetrators amongst whom Kagame figures tall.  And, as far as I'm concerned, this Kirambo massacre was a test so that when D-Day came, they would start to act.  

And Mr. Dallaire covered it because it was asked that there should be a commission.  And the 
Dallaire commission on the Kirambo massacres never published a report.  But then documents from the Prosecutor show that as early as the 19th, that is, the day after, Dallaire knew perfectly well that it was the RPF that had massacred all those people.  And on the strength of that report, Kagame went ahead and sparked off the final solution.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But let us continue to talk about these MRND meetings.  On the 
5th of January 1994, were you aware of the swearing-in ceremony of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes, because I was invited there and because, in December 1993, I had been designated as a person who was to become the minister of higher education and scientific research in the broad-based transitional government.  I was present.  
Q.	What about the other institutions that were supposed to be sworn in, if I can put it that way?  
A.	Well, in the -- what was released by the state protocol of the presidency of the republic -- as early as 
9 a.m., the head of state, President Habyarimana had to swear in -- or as part -- in the context of the Arusha Accords that were signed in August 1993.  In the afternoon at 3 p.m., the swearing-in of members of the broad-based transitional assembly of parliament had to be sworn in.  And it turned out that the then prime minister, Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana, did not follow this official programme given by the presidency and had asked that the entire swearing-in ceremony should be held in the morning.  

The president was sworn in in the morning.  After doing so before the constitutional court, he left and asked that people should return in the afternoon.  

In the afternoon, the president arrived.  Personally I was there, once again, but the prime minister, Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana; the prime minister designate, Faustin Twagiramungu; the members of parliament of the MDR were not present.  And -- but then the constitution and the Arusha Accords provided that members of the national assembly should be sworn in before the president of the republic and in front of members of the constitutional court, and these people were not present.  So the afternoon ceremony did not take place.  
Q.	But, Mr. Nahimana, the afternoon ceremony did not take place because there were troublemakers of the MRND and others who prevented people from coming to the place where the ceremony was taking place.  What do you think? 
A.	I say absolutely not.  It did not take place because of the RPF, the prime minister and the president of the constitutional court.  And I do not see how these troublemakers of the MRND could have prevented UNAMIR from bringing the -- those who had to be sworn in from their places of residence to the ceremonial grounds.  So that allegation is false, totally false.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, to the 16th of January 1994.  Do you remember an MRND meeting which was held on that date? 
A.	Absolutely.  On that date, the MRND held a big rally in the Nyamirambo stadium in Kigali.  
Q.	Were there other parties or representatives of other parties in that rally? 
A.	Yes.  I can give you a direct answer because I was personally present there.  
Q.	Was Mr. Mugenzi present? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did he speak? 
A.	Yes, he did.  
Q.	Can you briefly tell the Chamber what he said?  
A.	Mugenzi's speech was applauded because, by its content, it was unexpected.  Mugenzi spoke against taking over power by force.  So he spoke against the RPF.  Why was there surprise?  Because for the first time, Mugenzi was showing that he could denounce his friend, the RPF.  And in his speech he succeeded in saying war to those who betray the public, war to those who betray the peace process, 
to those who betray the people.  And each time he said those words, he was applauded.  

And if I may, I said to myself later that this is a man who has finally realised that he had a bond with the devil.  I am using the expression deliberately because Dallaire said that he shook hands with the devil.  But Dallaire shook hands with the devil, Kagame.  He shook hands with Kagame.  And there, you have Mugenzi who realises that he had betrayed the people by thinking that bonding with an armed group was going to make it possible for him to achieve power.  But he realised that the RPF had nothing to do with democracy.  And in his speech, in fact, he was calling on the other members to definitively break ranks with the RPF.  And for these democratic forces for change -- everybody started talking about the MDR that was pro-Faustin Twagirumungu or pro-RPF, because Twagirumungu remained with the RPF.  
The PL pro-RPF -- because there is, on the one hand, a wing which had separated from the RPF and another wing which remained with the RPF.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I believe it is 12:30.  I think we can take the break.  I could use the afternoon to proceed, and, perhaps, complete my examination-in-chief, but I would not swear anything.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You seemed to have already exceeded your projected time, but we'll take the luncheon break now and resume at 2 o'clock.  
(Court recessed from 1233H to 1410H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Mr. Nimy, you may continue.  

Yes, Mr. Witness.  You are trying to attract my attention? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  About the film of this meeting -- on the meeting -- of this morning about meetings, let me make a correction about the meetings.  

I want to correct something relating to two meetings, the first being the Busengo meeting.  
Mr. Karemera was not present at that meeting.  I just remembered that.  He was not present at the Busengo meeting.  I believe that I also testified that, during the demonstration in front of the 
préfectoral office, Mr. Nzirorera was present.  I want to correct that.  He was not present.  

Those are the corrections I wanted to bring to the attention of the Court, and I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  What you have just stated does, indeed, tally with what is in 
	evidence -- what is in the documents before the Court.  These are facts that have been recognised and not challenged.  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...this is not appropriate.  I'm sorry, Your Honours, I didn't realise that you were deliberating, but I find the last comment by Mr. Nimy entirely inappropriate.  

The witness testified about two meetings and placed Mr. Karemera at one and Mr. Nzirorera at the other.  And he came in after lunch, some two hours after he gave his evidence, and corrected what he saw as mistakes.  And now Mr. Nimy is congratulating him for bringing his testimony in light -- in line with what has been documented in our case, which is inappropriate.  It's not the place for counsel to comment to the witness that now he has gotten it correct because there's corroboration on the 
trial record.  
MR. NIMY:
No.  No.  Mr. President, no.  I'm -- I'm really sorry.  Maybe we're not speaking the same language.  I do not know what nuances were conveyed in the expressions that I used in French.  I don't know how the translation was.  I did not support the witness.  It is not my duty to support the witness.  I simply established a nexus in order to move on with my cross-examination.  

In French, when we reason, we try to make connections and linkages so that our questions flow from the one to the next and that those questions do not just drop from the sky -- from the blue sky.  So I was simply establishing this connection to the extent that what the witness has just said is already on the record.  And, in fact, I was inferring that what he was stating was not necessary because the Judges are already aware of it.  So that is the distinction.  And I believe we are facing a legal practice or culture here which differs from the Anglo-Saxon practice.  But, otherwise, he would have been right to say what he said, if I, indeed, behaved in the manner in which he infers I did.  But that was not what I did. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, unfortunately, I also have -- I'm reading the English transcript, and it's consistent with what Mr. Webster complained about.  And I think, as you've agreed, his complaint would have been justified in what was said.
MR. NIMY:
Well, Mr. President -- well, if such is the situation, then I withdraw what I said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can move on now.  Thank you very much.  We can move on.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, did you ever hear mention of the Zero Network or the Abakozi? 
A.	I have heard mention of the Zero Network, but not Abakozi. 
Q.	The Zero Network, what was that? 
A.	I heard mention of the Zero Network through a document that was published by one 
	Christophe Mfizi -- Christophe Mfizi.  Mfizi is spelt M-F-I-Z-I.  He is the one who published a document in the '90s, '91 -- or thereabouts -- I don't recall the date -- and that's the reference he used in his document.  
Q.	Now, Zero Network, Abakozi, "friends of the covenant" or "the alliance", as has been used by a number of witnesses, including a Prosecution witness, these -- these concepts relate to the same reality:  
A secret organisation involving some civilians and soldiers; a criminal organisation.  Did you ever belong to such an organisation? 
A.	We must make things very clear.  First of all, at the translation level, I don't think that the Zero Network is equal to Abakozi or to the other expressions which you have used.  That is the first point.  Secondly, I never belonged to any of those organisations if such an organisation or any such organisations that you have mentioned ever existed.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  Let us now address the issue of the RTLM.  Mr. Nahimana, please tell us how was the RTLM born? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The creation of RTLM was the brainchild of two persons who were employees of the Rwandan information office.  They contacted me in 1992, in September of that year.  Those two persons were Joseph Serugendo and Vénuste Nshimyimana.  Serugendo is spelt S-E-R-U-G-E-N-D-O, for Serugendo.  And Nshimyimana is spelt N-S-H-I-M-Y-I-M-A-N-A.  

Those two persons contacted me at my home to tell me that, within the framework of the liberalisation of information and the media, they had come up with the idea of creating an information -- an independent information unit.  I listened to them, and, at the end of the discussion, I found their idea to be a very good idea.  

They asked me if I could assist them and told me that they had contacted me because I had been their director and they were familiar with my ability to manage those types of institutions.  So I told them that I was not -- I didn't have money and that I could not raise or provide that kind of money.  So we continued the discussions until we ended up considering that I contact Félicien Kabuga on that matter.  

So the next day in the morning, I went to see him with Mr. Serugendo.  So we met Mr. Kabuga who agreed with the idea and also stated that it had occurred to him that a press organ would have been a good idea also, which would enable him to advertise his businesses easily.  

That morning, we ended up obtaining his commitment to contact other businessmen.  And he also asked us to contact other persons who may be interested in the project.  Then, we met again later on with Serugendo, Kabuga and myself to update ourselves.  
On that day, we identified about 15 persons, more or less, and then went on to decide to have Kabuga invite them to a discussion in order to ask them if they would be willing to join this business.  That was done.  And we held a meeting on the weekend towards the end of September.  And those 15 or so persons agreed to pull together the necessary financial resources so that, when the letters of incorporation would have been drafted, the financial resources would be converted into shares.  And in so doing, those initiators would be launching the initiative.  

In fact, that evening, we created what was referred to as the RTLM -- as the steering committee or the initiative committee, and it was chaired by Mr. Kabuga.  That initiative committee or steering committee included a president, a secretary, and I think that is as far as we went, if memory doesn't fail me.  

The other persons were all members, and these were six in number, including myself.  That is how we started off with that steering committee having the mandate to draft all necessary documents and instruments and to contact as many people as possible, and also to make the project as viable and as sustainable as possible.  
(Pages 24 to 33 by Jean Baigent)






















1425H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	You have referred to an initiative or steering committee.  Now, according to the indictment, the Prosecutor's indictment, it is stated that Mathieu Ngirumpatse and others were involved or participated in the creation and funding of Radio RTLM, which was used as an instrument for the expansion of their extremist ideologies.  What is your comment?  Could you make a brief comment on that allegation.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to assert before you that Ngirumpatse has never been part of the initiative group or the steering committee, and he was not part of those two journalists, myself and Mr. Kabuga.  He was never part of that group that was set up by those 15 members or so, and he was not even among those initial 15 persons.  So my answer on that point is no.  

Furthermore, it is true that, like other persons, Mr. Ngirumpatse subsequently -- and if memory doesn't fail me, I want to be very cautious on this point.  Mr. Ngirumpatse may have acquired shares.  And I want to be cautious on this point because I don't know.  I am not clear in my mind whether even to this date Mr. Ngirumpatse had any shares in RTLM.  What I'm saying is that I personally contacted people for that purpose, but Ngirumpatse never was one of those involved in that first group of persons who met in July or thereabouts in 1993.  And even after the first general assembly, he was not among those who acquired shares.  So the brief answer to your question is that the allegation is false. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, please, can you assist me by placing this document before the witness.  I believe it is document number 9 in my bundle.  Please show this to the Bench and then place it before the witness and show the parties as well.  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
I have the document before me.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Have you looked at it carefully?  Do you recognise that document? 
A.	Yes, I do.  This document was examined on the 25th of November 1993 -- or rather '92.  I'm sorry.  And it is on that occasion that we expanded the steering committee by the creation of a commission.  
Q.	Now, the names appearing on that document, are those the names of the founders of RTLM? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the people who are mentioned in this list, in this document, are certainly shareholders, but they are not the only ones who created the RTLM.  I would like to point out a detail.  The creators of RTLM are the secretaries of the statutes, and there were 50 in number.  Certainly amongst the people who are here you have some of those who signed the statute on the 
8th of April 1993. 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to tender into evidence this document produced by the so-called 
comité d'initiative, the committee that created or initiated the creation of RTLM under 
Exhibit number 744 -- D. 794.  D. 794. 

Mr. Issa, is that the good number for the exhibit, D. 794?  
MR. MJUI:
It's D. NZ784.  784.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The document is admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ784 admitted)
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	In the indictment it was also alleged that the RTLM radio station was created to serve as a vehicle for spreading an extremist ideology.
MR. NIMY:  
Mr. Issa, could you kindly give to the witness a document which is already under file.  That is D. NZ11.  D. NZ11, already in the file.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Counsel.  I have the document before me.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, in that document, which is an organic document of the RTLM, a document which defines the objectives of the RTLM, is there anywhere in it mention of the objectives relating to spreading an extremist ideology? 
A.	No.  I am familiar with this document, the statute of the RTLM.  The central idea of this document is found in the aim of the RTLM, which you would see in article 4.  And if you read that carefully, you would see the collection of information, education and informing the public through advertisement, information and debates, the contribution to strengthening multiparty democracy and strengthening of republican institutions in the country.  Nowhere do you see mention of spreading extremist ideas or an extremist ideology.  
Q.	I will go farther, Mr. Nahimana.  In this document setting up the RTLM, is there any expression whatsoever that it is anti-Tutsi from an ethnic standpoint?  
A.	No.  Nowhere is that mentioned.  This is the constitution of a corporation or an enterprise.  Shares were subscribed to, and everybody could subscribe to those shares -- Hutus, Tutsis and even foreigners.  And even if someone had an extremist idea, I do not see how that person would have sought to include such an idea in this statute.  And I do not see how anyone would accept to include that extremist idea in this document. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, until the 6th of April 1994, what was the content of RTLM programmes? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, this is a very broad question.  First of all, I would like to talk about my own limitations.  Of course, I know the RTLM, but I was not the author -- or, rather, I was neither a journalist nor director of RTLM, because to talk about RTLM programmes would amount to assuming the role of these two personalities, that is, a director or a journalist there.  Being a member of the initiating committee, you would understand that I understand in broad terms, in general terms, the content of what was said without going into details.  I would be familiar with the themes without going into details.  And I dare hope that that is where the questions are leading me to.  And if that is the case, I would say that the RTLM, the RTLM radio, focused its programmes around the following main themes:  The war.  We were a country at war.  Then multiparty politics.  And lastly, the living conditions of the population during that period of a crisis.  In the main, that was it. 

Discussions, debates were organised or articulated around that editorial policy.  There were invitees.  There were journalists.  There were journalists in the production centre.  And all of these amounted to what one may refer to as the skeleton of RTLM programmes.  
Q.	In those programmes or broadcasts were there any utterances that incited people to massacre or eliminate the Tutsi? 
A.	Never.  Talking about programmes, I limited the period to the 6th of April, and I'm saying never.  Never.  Moreover, if the Chamber would allow me, I would like to say that it is true that the RTLM talked a great deal about persons, about individuals, in particular politicians, the way they carried out politics, the way they did politics, the way they lived.  And sometimes these personalities did not like the comments or what was said about them.  

It is true that during the period referred to, the RTLM, better than Radio Rwanda, organised debates around the issue of Hutu-Tutsi.  This is a perfectly normal question, given the sociological or historical context of the time, but some people did not like this.  But it was a period of democracy, a period of democratic relations, new-found freedoms, apart from that some people viewed, in this manner of saying things, accusations.  

When I remember RTLM programmes and the analyses that were made here in Trial Chamber I from 2001 to 2003, when we analysed the programmes during that period, we did not find a single programme -- even on the Prosecutor's -- on the basis of the Prosecutor's theory, we didn't find a 
single programme that incited people to kill others.  And the Appeals Chamber -- I remember that the 
Appeals Chamber is categorical about that, because at the trial level I was convicted.  In the operative part of the judgement reference was made to incitement, incitement of the RTLM from its inception to 6 April 1994, and the Chamber of Appeal overturned that finding.  And the Appeals Chamber is right because it found that RTLM programmes did not reach the level of incitement which called for the extermination of the Tutsis.  I believe this is in paragraph 513 or something like that, if my recollection is right.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, can you please help me to show the witness a Prosecution document.  I believe that is 
P. 379B.  This is a document which has already been tendered into evidence.  The document 
exhibit number is, rather, 369.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, if you would allow me to add, regarding the creation of RTLM, I 
showed -- I demonstrated -- and this is true -- that in no case and at no point in time did the initiators, the shareholders of the RTLM, have the idea of making the RTLM, be it as a corporation or a radio station, a tool for killings, for massacres.  And once again the Appeals Chamber vindicated my position saying that the fact of having been a founder of the RTLM does not justify my being convicted for incitement or intent to commit genocide.  

In this respect as well, if my memory serves me right -- these are paragraphs one cannot forget -- this would be in paragraph 574 to 579 of the Appeals Chamber judgement of 28 November 2007.  
I thank you.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Nahimana.  Now I would go straight to the matter regarding the 
post-6 April period.  Where were you on the 6th of April? 
A.	On the 6th of April, I was at home in my house in Kacyiru.  This is a locality in the capital city of Kigali. 
Q.	How did you come to hear about the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I heard about the death of President Habyarimana through Radio RTLM.  This was between 8 p.m. -- in any case, it was after 8:30 p.m. but before 9:30 p.m., within that time frame. 
Q.	And what did you do as soon as you heard the news? 
A.	I was stupefied because the journalist, Valérie Bemeriki -- B-E-M-E-R-I-K -- sorry, K, like khaki, and I at the end -- said, "We have just heard --" or "-- learnt that President Habyarimana's plane has been shot at the time it was about to land and it caught fire."  She didn't say any more than that.  All she said was, "Stay tuned in.  If we have more information, we will bring it to you."  

Practically the whole evening it was that announcement that was made.  I was stupefied.  Unfortunately, I didn't have a phone in my house.  I didn't have a land line, and at the time there were no cell phones.  I stayed there until the morning.  

And on the morning of the 7th, there were -- there was shooting almost everywhere in the capital city and in particular on the heights of Kacyiru plateau where I lived.  I waited for the end of the afternoon period -- or early afternoon.  I waited until early afternoon to be able to leave, because in the meantime I thought that this is the resumption of the war.  Together with my family, I decided to flee from that hill, and I took refuge at the French embassy in Kigali.  I was welcomed there, and I would like to express my appreciation to the French embassy. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, what was the type of programmes?  What type of utterances were aired over RTLM from the 6th of April? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, after the 6th of April, as I just said, on the 7th I took refuge at the 
French embassy.  I stayed there until the morning of the 12th, save that on the 8th in the afternoon I went out.  I went to the business area because the embassy was asking us whether we could find something to eat, especially for children, and that is what I did -- and also for my wife.  

On the 12th I was evacuated.  I left for Bujumbura with a French military aircraft.  I stayed outside the country.  I stayed in Bujumbura I believe until the 18th of April.  Thereafter, I was transferred on this occasion by the Red Cross and the UNHCR.  I was evacuated from Bujumbura to Bukavu.  

I must point out that when the French embassy evacuated us outside Rwanda, French authorities told us that they were taking us to a place that was safe without war.  I thought we were being taken to France.  But on arrival in Bujumbura, there was a division.  People from western countries -- or people with passports from western countries were immediately put in aircrafts that took them to the 
western -- to western countries, and we Rwandans remained on the spot.  

In any case, around the 18th we were taken to Bukavu.  I stayed there until around the 23rd or perhaps the 24th of April.  In the meantime, Rwandan authorities at the border with Congo, at the time known as Zaire, and the governor of south Kivu had spoken to one another because the southwest of Rwanda was not at war.  So these authorities concluded that Rwandan refugees in Bukavu should be transferred to Rwandan territory in the southwest of Rwanda, and that was done.  

Until the month of May, therefore, I did not listen to RTLM radio, save for the short period when I was in Bukavu.  There I followed some of their broadcasts.  But on that basis, to tell you the content of the programmes I followed, I would not be in a position to do that.  Moreover, I must say that I learnt a lot from -- or learnt a lot from the RTLM, thanks to the audio recordings that the Prosecutor handed to me or gave me, which I analysed. 
Q.	To be more precise, when, in the final analysis, you heard from the tapes you received from the Prosecutor -- when you became aware of the content of RTLM broadcasts or messages, I would like to ask you the following question:  Radio Muhabura, does it mean anything to you?  
A.	Yes.  Certainly from 1991, especially when I was director of ORINFOR, the 
Rwandan information authority, I listened to the programmes of Radio Muhabura and analysed their broadcasts.  I'm familiar with that radio station. 
Q.	What was the impact of Radio Muhabura until the 6th of April in Rwanda? 
A.	The impact of Radio Muhabura on the population of Rwanda, that is, the population of Rwanda inside Rwanda, was very, very significant and, I would add, unfortunately negative.  Why negative?  Well, negative because, first of all, the editorial policy of this radio station was to praise the war, so to speak, the RPF war.  Their editorial policy was to present the RPF as a rebellion group which certainly has weapons and which is coming to liberate Rwanda.  When the people heard this, they were, of course, affected because the people inside the country were suffering all the consequences of the war, displacement and so on, deaths and so on.  

Secondly, and what was also very negative, is that Radio Muhabura called young Rwandans.  And at this juncture I must say perhaps you have not encountered this problem during any trial or any hearing in this matter, but I have come across this problem:  We asked the Prosecutor to give us recordings of Radio Muhabura from the period or during the period you have set.  But the responses have always been negative.  However, there is information to the effect that the Prosecutor has in its drawers, on its shelves tape recordings of broadcasts made by Radio Muhabura.  

Muhabura radio station called young Tutsis -- and I underscore young Tutsis -- to join the rebellion in order to wage war against the Habyarimana regime and thus put an end to dictatorship.  That is what was said. 
(Pages 34 to 39 by Claudette Ask).




















1500H
THE WITNESS (continued):  
Three, between in particular 1972 and the 6th of April, there were many assassinations, many assassinations.  And whenever the RPF carried out an attack, it killed.  I will take only the most significant cases, the most important personalities killed, the most important persons from a political standpoint.  The assassination of Emmanuel Gapyisi.  Radio Muhabura immediately broadcast the news, and according to its broadcast it was ascribing that assassination to President Habyarimana, his party, and the Rwandan army.  And it was immediately known that this was RPF.  This is the same thing I will say about the massacres of November 19 -- 1993.  

Radio Muhabura, knowing -- I said it this morning -- knowing that it was MRND militants who had been assassinated, they said, "The MRND has committed something irreparable."  The same thing happened when Félicien Gatabazi was assassinated in February 1994.  This is the type of programmes or 
news broadcasts by Radio Muhabura.  

I would like to draw the attention of the authorities of the Tribunal here, from January to December 1994, it happens that right up to date, as far as I know, no authority in charge of this radio has been arrested.  And it cannot be said that the ICTR, the Office of the Prosecutor, lacks resources to arrest the authorities of Radio Muhabura.  And this is what I was saying this morning, namely, that protection is given to criminals.  And if that be the case, what will be the legacy of this Tribunal to humanity?  We are not talking about Rwanda.  By keeping quiet over such crimes, what would be the legacy of this Tribunal to humanity?  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  After the 6th of April 1994, you just told this Court that you were not on the spot, you were not present, that it was through RTLM broadcasts, which we will listen to later on, that you knew of the (inaudible) -- or, rather -- sorry.  After the 6th of April, did you have any contact with Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse, or Karemera? 
A.	After the 6th of April, the first contact I had was with Nzirorera.  This was around the end of May,
	early June.  And that was in Gitarama, and later on in Gisenyi.  But regarding Ngirumpatse and even Karemera, I also met them during that period.  
Q.	Witness, did these people have the authority to close down Radio RTLM after the 6th of April or even before? 
A.	Thank you for that question.  I was going to complete my answer by saying that even before the
	6th of April they did not have such authority.  Moreover, they were never members of the organs of the RTLM enterprise.  

And, secondly, they were not part of the management of the RTM (sic) before the 6th of April.  It is true that after the 6th of April there was some kind of dysfunctioning as a result of the war.  But they didn't have an -- any authority to close down the RTLM.  On the contrary, in fact there is something which I cannot explain, but I can only ask questions, be it in my writings or in my mind.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, on the basis of the tapes that the Prosecutor gave me during my trial, I have been able to learn -- and this is even in the judgement, if my recollection serves me right.  I have tapes, and through these tapes I have been able to learn that on the 30th of May 1994, Mr. Dallaire, who was the military head of UNAMIR, was in regular contact with RTLM journalists.  He was talking with a Mr. Kantano of the RTLM.  And Mr. Kantano comes to the radio station.  That is a -- a broadcast I listened to.  Mr. Kantano goes on the air and says, "I have just met Mr. Dallaire.  He was accompanied by a Senegalese officer."  

Well, when I hear that, I tell myself in the final analysis a colleague Braeckman, the Belgian journalist, was somehow right when she said before this Chamber that right up to the month of November 1994, that radio, or -- was never considered an extremist -- an extremist radio by those who are experts in Rwandan matters.  

In any case, you are judges, you have knowledge of the law.  The whole question revolves around that.  How can it be said that Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Karemera or Mr. Nzirorera could close down RTLM if the military head of UNAMIR, who had soldiers, the army, armoured tanks, could not close down the radio?  On the contrary, he had acquaintances or contacts with journalists during the war.  If -- that exhibit exists and it is available to the Prosecutor and it was handed to me.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  Did Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Nzirorera have any control over the journalists of Radio RTLM? 
A.	Never.  Not before, and I believe not after.  Before the 6th of April they had no control, no authority over those journalists.  After, while I was in Gisenyi between the 1st of June and the 9th of June, I regularly saw my countrymen, Karemera, Nzirorera and Mathieu, in that area.  And the journalists at that time were in Kigali.  There was no access to them.  And then when I returned from Tunis around the
	18th or 20th of June, if memory serves me right, Mathieu at that time was in Tunis.  So none of those three fellow countrymen of mine had any link whatsoever with the RTLM at that time. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Nahimana.  My last question for you is the following:  After all what you have said to the Court since this morning, were you involved in a joint criminal enterprise with
	Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse and/or Karemera? 
A.	What kind of joint criminal enterprise, Counsel?  I have never been involved in any 
	joint criminal enterprise involving my three fellow countrymen.  Never.  And the evidence is that, once again, if you are referring to the RTLM or to our party, the MRND -- I hope that you are not referring to the MRND somewhat.  The evidence is that -- and as I stated this morning -- I was acquitted on all the grounds and allegations relating to those crimes as an author, or involvement in any manner whatsoever.  So maybe the RPF or those who are in prison were relying on something -- something.  And then it was alleged that you have been convicted (sic) to 30 years of imprisonment on the grounds of programmes that were broadcast by others.  The judge -- that judge, Mr. Meron, said that Nahimana never killed anybody, he never incited anyone to kill, so I have questions relating to that verdict.  He said so.  He was the only one to have that opinion and was opposed to that conviction.  What I'm saying, therefore, is that I was never involved and I am not aware of any joint criminal enterprise.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  
MR. NIMY:  
Mr. President, that will be all by way of examination-in-chief of this witness.  And as I told you this morning, I was not certain about the exact timing, and I thought that we may go into some extra time, and if that were the case I would ask for your forgiveness, Mr. President.  So I thank you very much, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  Forgiveness is not required.  

No other -- Mr. Sow, do you have any questions for this witness?  
MR. SOW:
No, Mr. President.  I think this would make up for any extra time that Mr. Nimy would have used.  
	Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I did not have any questions for this witness, because most of the questions I would have liked to raise with Mr. Nahimana have already been broached by my learned colleague Nimy.  But he has just provided an answer in which he mentioned his trip to Tunis.  And that leads me to ask one question of him. 
 CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Q.	When members of the interim government had to travel abroad during that time to make representations on the prevailing situation, they explained the nature of the killings that were taking place in Kigali.  My question is:  Was that the nature of your meeting and is that the nature of the representation you made to those you talked to in Tunis?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Thank you, Mr. President.  This is a baseless and erroneous allegation.  When I was in Tunis I was accompanying the president of the republic to the OAU summit.  At the time it was known as the AOU and not the AU.  

So briefly, madam, our entire delegation stood for peace.  We advocated peace.  And with the help of heads of state who were in Tunis we were able to secure a ceasefire agreement signed between our delegation and a delegation from the RPF.  Unfortunately, the RPF did not respect the 
ceasefire agreement.  In summary, therefore, it is exactly the opposite that happened.  While in Tunis we did our level best to seek assistance from the international community and from Africa in particular with a view to stopping the war and fostering negotiations between the belligerent parties for the ultimate implementation of the Arusha Accords.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
That will be all, Mr. President.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, could Mr. Issa tell us how much time the Defence used in examination-in-chief.
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Your Honours, the entire examination-in-chief lasted 3 hours, 34 minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Hometowu.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you are going to have to respond to the Prosecutor, who now has an opportunity to examine you -- cross-examine you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me begin by wishing everyone a good afternoon and expressing our satisfaction that the
	Presiding Judge has completely recovered.  

I will also mention that we have a bundle of exhibits that I'd like some assistance from the registry to distribute.  This is a rather large bundle and I don't want you all to get alarmed.  Since we've had a reordering of the testimony presented by the Defence, I have been accumulating the exhibits that -- respective exhibits that we distribute.  So actually with respect to this witness I will only be referring to documents 54 through 66.  But where the Defence is concerned, I see no reason to withhold these documents until the witness comes, so they can look through them.  

And with respect to the Court, I'd offer to assist by simply making the documents that were used with this witness available to the Court so that -- well, I see Mr. Issa is already giving you the entire bundle.  But I was going to offer just to hand up the exhibits for this witness so you wouldn't be encumbered by all of this documentation.  But we'll simply proceed as Mr. Issa has -- has done.  

If you could bear with us, my colleagues are assisting to assemble all of the documentation.  I don't think we'll need it right away.  

CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	With respect to you, Mr. Nahimana, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	We don't know each other.  My name is Don Webster and I'll be asking questions on behalf of the Prosecution today. 
A.	Thank you.
Q.	There are two introductory matters I want to address before we get into the substance of my cross-examination.  One is your complaint that there are documents that are being withheld from you.  You mentioned transcripts of Radio Muhabura broadcasts.  And what I would like to indicate to you is that the Defence for Mr. Édouard Karemera made a written request under Rule 66(B) for inspection of materials concerning Radio Muhabura.  And they listed those items and we complied with their request and gave them, on CD ROM I believe, a number of materials concerning Radio Muhabura, which to my understanding is everything that we have in the Office of the Prosecution concerning Radio Muhabura.  

And the same avenue is open to your defence.  If you have not done that as yet, I don't think it would be any problem for the Defence of Mr. Nzirorera or Karemera to share those materials with you, or you can make a written request and everything that we have in the OTP concerning Radio Muhabura will certainly be copied and made available to you.  

That is the first thing I wanted to indicate to you.  The OTP is not hiding information from you.  What we do have with respect to Radio Muhabura can be made available to you upon a written request.  

The second thing is I wanted to ask you about your correction to your testimony at the beginning of this afternoon's session.  

Now, while we took our luncheon break, did you discuss the substance of your evidence with anyone? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  

I will start, first of all, by dealing with the Radio Muhabura point.  I said that maybe during this trial things have evolved.  My position was that when my case was on, it happened that repeatedly and consistently I was not provided copies of the transcripts of those broadcasts.  I, therefore, want to thank the Prosecutor, and I avail myself of this opportunity to make an oral request for the entire broadcasts to be made available to me.  I will be able to use them, even in Mali.  

Now, secondly, as to the question as to any contact between myself and the Defence, the answer is no.  I did not have any discussions with anybody during the lunch break.  What I can say simply is that it came back to my memory.  I remembered what I had testified about before this Court and realised that I had made a mistake and that it was important to correct that mistake immediately.  

Thank you.  
Q.	All right.  We'll take you at your -- at your word.  But with respect to the meeting that you had initially placed -- where you had initially placed Édouard Karemera, I believe you were talking about a meeting in Busengo sous-préfecture in January of 1993.  Was there any meeting that you attended in
	Ruhengeri préfecture which included the participation of Édouard Karemera? 
A.	No.  No.  No.  The answer is no.  
Q.	Would you like to take another moment to think about the question or have me repeat the question?  Is the question clear to you? 
A.	The question is clear.  It's very clear. 
Q.	Because in that case, Mr. Nahimana, I direct you to the transcripts of your testimony on the 19th of September 2002 at pages 33 and 36 of the English text.  I didn't make a copy of -- of that portion of your transcript because it had absolutely no relevance to what I wish to raise with you.  It only came -- its importance has only come to light in -- in the context of your correction of your own testimony.  But as I recall your testimony on the 19th of September 2002, you were answering questions from your own -- your own attorney and you were giving a recitation of the MRND rallies that you attended and you specifically recurred -- you specifically made reference to a meeting at Gatonde commune in December of 1992 and you expressly mentioned the presence of the vice-president of the MRND, Édouard Karemera.  You identified him as the vice-president, even though this meeting took place in December of 1992.  Does that now ring a bell for you? 
A.	Yes.  That does ring a bell.  But let me say that following that very testimony at that time, in much the same manner as it happened this afternoon, I realised once again that I had felt that Mr. Karemera was present in that meeting in my area, whereas it was not true.  So in any event, what I am saying is that he was not in Gatonde and he was not in Busengo.  Thank you.  I do remember that I made such a statement previously.  However, following the testimony, quite some time after the testimony, I have had opportunity to talk about these things with my counsel.  And since the meeting was not mentioned in the judgement, we let go of that point. 
Q.	So in other words, you were mistaken.  Or is that your testimony today, you were mistaken back in September of 2002 when you described Mr. Karemera being present at the MRND rally in
	Gatonde commune?  That's your evidence.  
A.	Yes.  That is absolutely correct.  Yes.  
Q.	And concerning your evidence about Nzirorera's presence at the MRND rally on the 28th of May 1992 in Kimihurura in Kigali, what is it that led you to doubt the testimony you gave before this Chamber
	this morning? 
A.	This morning I said that there was a demonstration.  Now, the reason why I again wondered whether I was right or wrong is that I do not recall Nzirorera having taken the floor in Kimihurura.  Thinking through that, I came to the conclusion that Nzirorera was not present.  
Q.	And no one ever suggested to you that the Prosecution in this trial was able to obtain a video recording of the entirety of that demonstration, which would have documented every person that took the floor on that day.  That was not suggested to you before you changed your answer.  
A.	No.  No.  No one.  I am learning that from you now.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, as a senior MRND party member, you're well aware that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, on behalf of the MRND party, authorised the Interahamwe to be affiliated to the MRND party during the April 1992 party congress; right? 
A.	No.  No.  And I reject your assertion.  During that congress we had a lengthy discussion on that issue.  The conclusion to which the congress came was that the -- that youth organisation,
	Interahamwe za MRND, should continue to structure itself, and that on the basis of documents and positive achievements, the MRND's subsequent congress would then determine whether it is timely for the Interahamwe za MRND to be an integral part of the MRND party.  So your allegation is entirely false.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Nahimana, it's a matter of record in this trial, as established by an exhibit that was offered in evidence by the Defence, D. NZ00 -- 006, D. NZ6, which is a transcription of the resolutions of that congress.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, speaking at the end of the conference, read off a list of resolutions, which included resolution four, which suggested that the Interahamwe be affiliated to the party and be expanded nationwide.  Now, I can play that portion of the tape for you or I can ask that the particular page of the transcript be shown to you, but I don't think that should be necessary.  
A.	Mr. President, I prefer to work from a document, because when it is said that somebody said that the organisation should be affiliated to, or ought to have been affiliated to, that doesn't mean that the resolution of the congress at that time was to the effect that the organisation will become an integral part of the MRND at that congress.  

Yes, indeed, there was a recommendation from the MRND congress to the effect, as I have stated, that the youth wing, namely, the Interahamwe za MRND, should build itself up and that its admission or integration of that youth organisation into an integral part of -- of MRND would be dealt with at Butare.  

And by the way, Mr. President, Your Honours, an eminent member of the -- or distinguished member of the MRND, a former minister of defence, Mr. James Gasana, wrote a book, Rwanda:  From Nation State to a Barrack State, or something like that, in which he asserts that the Interahamwe za MRND were never an integral part of the MRND.  And he goes on to say -- mind you, at the time he was a minister and a very influential member of the MRND.  He went on to state in the book that the president of the Interahamwe za MRND was never appointed by the MRND congress.  And he was making those statements in reference to that particular congress.  So we need to be careful how we analyse various documents.  The truth of the matter lies in what I have said. 
MR. WEBSTER:
In any case, Your Honours, I see the time and we can begin with this topic tomorrow morning.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And for you, Mr. Nahimana, my understanding is that James Gasana wrote the book 
	Rwanda:  Du Parti-Etat à l'Etat Garnison.  And I'll have a look at what he said.  I've read the book already.  I don't recall him saying that -- making the submission that you just made.  But we can go over that tomorrow morning.  So thank you.  
A.	Tomorrow morning I will give you the exact page in -- on which he refers to that matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will take our adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, I neglected to remind you, as I do all witnesses, that during any adjournment when you are on the witness stand, you are not to discuss the case or the testimony with anybody.  But I expect that you would already be familiar with those rules governing our practice here.  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will take our adjournment now.  

I'm sorry for this, but there is just a housekeeping matter.  We thought we should give you notice that we intend to sit on Friday, Friday morning, until 12:30.
(Court adjourned at 1535H)
