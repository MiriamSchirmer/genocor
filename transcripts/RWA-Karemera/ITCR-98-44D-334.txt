P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.

Could we have the appearances of the parties before we resume the hearing of the testimony of the witness, starting with the Prosecution. 
MR. MAWERE:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution team is composed by 
	Mr. Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney, Memory Maposa, appeals counsel, Elvis Bazawule, legal officer, Diana Karanja, associate legal officer, Ephrem Mutashya, language assistant.  We also have three interns:  Jamet, Marion, Godwin Manyiga and Catherine Gibson, and then myself, Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  I am happy to report that the 
	whole battalion showed up for parade this morning.  

So on the Defence side you have Anja Kortenaar, Célestin Kagango, Justin Habineza, 
Judith Khelifa, Fernand Batard, Charles Brozille.  The interns -- sorry.  I should maybe mention 
their quality.  Judith Khelifa, Anja Kortenaar, and Charles Brozille are interns.  Célestin Kagango and 
Justin Habineza are investigators.  Fernand Batard is also an investigator.  Nathalie Leblanc is the 
legal assistant.  Callixte Nzabonimana is here.  Myself, Philippe Larochelle.  

I can report that our commanding officer, Maître Courcelle-Labrousse, is not in court with us this morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  Do you have orders to proceed from the commanding officer?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, we can proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, Counsel.  Thank you.

Witness, good morning. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
How are you feeling today?  
THE WITNESS:
I feel fine.  I think the medication that was given to me had a positive effect and I was asked to take some rest.  I think that did me some good, and so today I'm in good shape.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  We also notice that the medical officer has certified that you're fit to testify, so we will continue with your testimony.  And we'd like to remind you about the declaration you made to tell the truth and that you'll continue with your testimony bearing that declaration in mind.

We are in open session, Counsel. 
MR. MAWERE:
I think we should revert to closed session, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Just a small matter, because I know that they brought two witnesses this morning, if the Prosecution could indicate to us how long he's going to take with the cross-examination so as to assess whether it's necessary to keep the next witness here or if he can be sent back to the safe house. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution. 
MR. MAWERE:
Madam President, we are just starting.  I don't think I'm in a position to indicate how long it is going to take now.  Perhaps we will advise as we progress. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, maybe the witness should be taken back to the safe house.  And as soon as we have clear indications from the Prosecution, we will alert the witness protection unit to bring him back so that he doesn't spend a long time here waiting for no reason. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Maybe it is an intermediate solution to wait until the break, and if the Prosecutor indicates that he will not finish before the lunch break then -- rather than having him spend another four hours at the Tribunal, he could be sent at that time to the safe house or maybe in one hour.  Just to make sure that if in the end the Prosecutor's cross-examination does not last very long, we don't lose any time having to bring the witness back to court.  

This is just a suggestion, and the Chamber can rule as it sees fit.  

MR. MAWERE:
We are amenable to that suggestion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will then proceed with the testimony of this witness.  

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave at this moment as the matters we are going to discuss may reveal the identity of this witness who is a protected witness.

Registry, kindly arrange for a closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 12] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. MATEMANGA:
We are in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  And we have noted that on several occasions you have to go yourself to switch on and off the lights and the TV.  If somebody's not doing their job, we would like to know.  
MR. MATEMANGA:
(Microphone not activated)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  We are now in open session.  So be careful not to give information that may identify you.

Counsel for the Prosecution, should we release the witness and have him brought back after lunch?  
MR. MAWERE:
If the witness continues -- continues answering my questions in a straightforward manner, we will not go up to lunchtime, but we will definitely go after -- up to -- past break time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  In that case then he'll have to wait, and perhaps a message should be sent for him to be patient.

Yes, Prosecution, you may continue.
BY MR. MAWERE:  
Q.	Witness, yesterday you indicated that Tutsi from COFORWA were transferred to Kabgayi; correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	That transfer was meant to ensure their safety; correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Those Tutsis risked being attacked had they remained at COFORWA; correct? 
A.	That's correct again.  As a matter of fact, the assailants who were in the Satinskyi and Kibilira communes had always sought to attack these refugees.  They had an axe to grind with these refugees. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before you continue, Counsel -- sorry to interrupt you.  

The assailants were from which commune?  Witness, could you repeat your answer.  We see problems in the recording of the answer. 
THE WITNESS:
Kibilira and Satinskyi. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	And Kabgayi was considered safer than Nyakabanda; correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	By the time that the Ndiza battalion was created, there were no Tutsi refugees in Nyakabanda; correct? 
A.	Refugees -- these refugees had been moved, but the Tutsis who resided in the commune were still present. 
Q.	And, Witness, where were the refugees that told the Ndiza battalion about the menacing Interahamwe? 
A.	These were war-displaced persons who were leaving from the east of the country and they were fleeing the attacks.  These were not Tutsis that had come from the west and sought refuge in Nyakabanda.  These were war-displaced persons who were leaving the eastern part of the country as they feared the invasion of the RPF. 
Q.	And, Witness, were there any refugees who came from Gitarama to hide in Nyakabanda? 
A.	To begin with, I must make a distinction between the two groups of refugees.  There were people who were fleeing the clashes, and there were others who were fleeing the attackers.  That said, the first group comprised persons that were fleeing the clashes but who were not fleeing the Interahamwes or the killers or the attackers. 
Q.	The group of refugees from Gitarama who came to Nyabikenke -- sorry, to Nyakabanda, who were they?  Which group was that? 
A.	These were the displaced persons. 
Q.	You also stated that the bourgmestre evacuated two -- two Tutsis from Kabgayi and brought them to Nyakabanda communal office; correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, which bourgmestre?  
MR. MAWERE:
That was Bourgmestre Rukimaracumu.  This is the first time I've had difficulties in pronouncing Rwandan names.  I'm surprised.  Rukimaracumu.  Number 67 on the spelling list. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Is there any particular -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said yes. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Sorry.  Is there any particular incident that assists you in knowing when this particular event occurred? 
A.	Please, can you kindly take over your question, Mr. Prosecutor?  
Q.	Is there any particular incident that reminds you that towards 8 May 1994 Bourgmestre Rukimaracumu evacuated two Tutsi from Kabgayi? 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the date of 8th May, was it given by the witness?  
MR. MAWERE:
Yes, it appears in his will-say statement.  You notice he actually made a will-say statement correcting it from 15 to 8 May. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.

Is that so, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's true.  I do recall these dates for the simple reason that Mr. Clébert Zimulinda and 
Mr. Rwalinda, alias Maso, had killed people in Nyakabanda on the 5th, and that was a Thursday.  

On the following Sunday, that is, on the 8th at 9 a.m. on the morning, of course, after the first 
Mass celebration -- these persons were killed after the first Mass service was over.  And that is why I recall that date.  It was a Sunday.  It was a Sunday after the Mass service. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Did Callixte Nzabonimana pass through before or after these Tutsi were brought? 
A.	Nzabonimana arrived Nyakabanda on the day I already mentioned to you, at the beginning of the month of May.  I did not hear about him being present on other occasions there at Nyakabanda. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did -- when you say he came to Nyakabanda at the beginning of May, was it before or after the incident of the killing of the refugees talked about by learned Counsel?  You have not answered that question. 
THE WITNESS:
You're right. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So what was it, before or after?  
THE WITNESS:
Nzabonimana came to Nyakabanda before those killings took place. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	How many days before those two Tutsi were killed did he -- did Nzabonimana pass through? 
A.	Please, can you give me a few minutes so that I can think this over and get to figure out the dates?  Maybe it was one week or ten days after he went past. 
Q.	One week or ten -- if it was ten days, he would have passed in April; is that so? 
A.	I gave you a period, a time bracket, between a week and ten days.  Well, if you don't want that, I won't go into mathematical calculations here. 
Q.	I take it you're avoiding my question, Witness.  The two Tutsi were killed at the communal office; correct? 
A.	That's true. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the names of these Tutsi were not pointed out, were they, for the record?  The witness mentioned them but we would need to have their names spelled out. 
MR. MAWERE:
Considering we are in open session, I thought that might bring him too close. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  But as long as we remember to put them on record at the right time.
MR. MAWERE:
Yes.
(Pages 13 to 16 by Melissa Hook)

























1030H
MR. MAWERE:
Perhaps I could quickly ask him to write down the names of the two Tutsi.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will deal with them in a closed session because writing also is going to bring us problems on how to handle -- 
MR. MAWERE:
That's all right, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	And the people who killed these Tutsi then forced the bourgmestre to resign, as he had tried to protect them; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And in his place the crisis committee took over; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And the crisis committee made no attempt to rein in these killers; correct? 
A.	The murderers were not arrested, but the crisis committee, nevertheless, made it clear that whosoever killed anyone in Nyakabanda commune was going to be penalised publicly.  
Q.	In other words, what you're saying is, when the crisis committee came in, they said, "We'll be blind to all the deaths that occurred before we came in even if we know that the people who did it are amongst us"; correct? 
A.	That is how things unfolded. 
Q.	Had the reservists in Nyakabanda done anything particular before they were called up to be Ndiza battalion trainers? 
A.	Even before that, and specifically in 1993, the reservists played an important role to protect the Tutsis.  Whenever we were under attack by Interahamwes from Kibilira and from Satinskyi, these reserve soldiers warded off these attacks by the Interahamwes, and the Interahamwes attacked nobody. 
Q.	Between 6 April 1994 and the day that the -- they were called up to train recruits for the Ndiza battalion, did the reservists do anything to ward off attacks? 
A.	You speak of an attack.  Who would have been the target of such an attack?  
Q.	When the two Tutsi were killed at the communal office, did the reservists do anything to protect them? 
A.	No one assembled reservists.  The reservists did not act individually.  So they required some kind of coordination.  And someone in authority had to assemble them to avoid faults that may be committed if people acted individually.  Consequently, when the Ndiza battalion was set up, the reservists no longer came in to assist persons in danger. 
Q.	They were now the trainers of the Ndiza battalion; correct? 
A.	The Ndiza battalion was set up at the end of May.  And the events we are talking about occurred before the Ndiza battalion was set up. 
Q.	Witness, you personally did not attend crisis committee meetings; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Neither do you know whether there was someone or a group of persons who controlled that 
	crisis committee from outside; correct? 
A.	I am not aware of that. 
Q.	You do not know if they got authority directly or indirectly from someone outside for them to form the Ndiza battalion; correct? 
A.	I admit that I was not a member of the crisis committee.  The instructions that the crisis committee may have received were not made known to me.  All what I know is that we were given orders as to what to do. 
Q.	And, Witness, you did not have anything to do with the day-to-day administration of the communal office; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You also did not keep stock of the weapons stored at the *******************; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Further, you did not keep a record of the weapons delivered to the ********************; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MR. MAWERE:
Could we -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We'll go into a short closed session.  

Members of the public, we request you to leave at this moment.  We are going to discuss a matter that may concern the identity of the witness.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 19 to 24] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 17 to 18 by Tanya West)







MR. MATEMANGA:
          We are now in open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Witness, we have moved into an open session.  Be careful not to mention any names of places that may identify you.  And if you have any difficulty answering any question, don't hesitate to alert the Trial Chamber.  Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I've understood very well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel, you may continue. 
MR. MAWERE:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, we will now focus on the meeting which was presided over by Jean Kambanda, the prime minister.  You remember your evidence on that?  
A.	I remember the meeting. 
Q.	And members of the crisis committee also attended that meeting; correct? 
A.	Yes.  They were present. 
Q.	Straton Sibomana, who was a member of the crisis committee, also attended that meeting; correct? 
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	This was a big gathering which had more than 3,000 people -- correct? -- in attendance?
A.	Yes.  There were very many persons in attendance, but I am in no position to give you an estimate of the number. 
Q.	You are, however, certain that Callixte Nzabonimana was not one of those many persons, correct, according to your testimony yesterday?
A.	Let me repeat before the Chamber.  Callixte Nzabonimana was not present. 
Q.	When did you become certain that Callixte Nzabonimana was not present at this gathering? 
A.	After I was examined by counsel for the Defence, I went and looked at the pictures that are found in the records of the Rwandan government.  And I interviewed ******************************** of the ******************.  And they all confirmed to me that they had not seen Callixte Nzabonimana at that meeting.  

I conducted all that investigation to be certain as to the presence or not of Callixte Nzabonimana at that meeting.  And so now I confirm with certainty that Callixte Nzabonimana was not present in Nyakabanda on that day. 
Q.	Witness, you were prepped by counsel for Callixte Nzabonimana in preparation for your testimony over the weekend, this past weekend; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	By that time were you certain or not as to whether Callixte Nzabonimana was present at that gathering presided over by Jean Kambanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Why did you not see it fit to advise Defence counsel that your statement needed to be corrected to reflect that aspect? 
A.	For a very long time, I stated that after the signing of my statement I was not able to see members of the Defence team again.  And I only saw them again when I came here.  And in the interval I had no contact with members of that team. 
Q.	And when you saw them here, you made corrections to your statement; correct? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	And the fact that you were certain Callixte Nzabonimana did not attend the gathering presided over by Jean Kambanda is not one of the corrections you made to your statement; correct? 
A.	I don't think it is well put.  I -- I do not quite understand what you mean. 
Q.	When you made corrections to your statement over the weekend, you did not correct the fact that you were not certain that Nzabonimana attended the gathering presided over by Jean Kambanda; correct? 
A.	I believe that, if that does not appear clearly in the statement, then we can refer to the pictures that were taken on the day of the meeting.  If Callixte Nzabonimana had been present at that meeting, he should have been sitting and quite visible at the side of the prime minister.  

If it does not appear clearly enough in my written statement, then kindly consider my testimony in court.  It is more accurate and actually expresses the idea better. 
Q.	Would you like to look at paragraph 46 of your statement, Witness.  
MR. MAWERE:
The French version, please.  

Registry, if you could assist. 

Paragraph 46. 

Madam President, Your Honours, I seek direction here.  I propose to -- to read to him the French version from the last -- paragraph 46 is two -- two lines.  The first line, the last two words on that line after comma are "Je ne".  If my learned friend has no objection with us reading just from that portion, which I believe will not distort the whole sentence, then we won't need to go into closed session.  But if we have to read from the beginning of the sentence, we would be obliged to go into closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You -- you did talk about the last words of the sentence, and you spoke them in French, and there was no interpretation in English. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, it would -- I was waiting to hear the remainder of the sentence.  But actually, it means "I do not".  
MR. MAWERE:
Yes.  That's the -- the -- that's the only portion that I read. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps to be abundant with caution, we should have it read in closed session because of the beginning, which we can't -- we -- the beginning clearly indicates -- and it might reveal his identity -- where he was. 
MR. MAWERE:
And this is what I said that -- this is what I said, that if my learned friend does not object, because I don't think they -- there's any dispute on the beginning of that sentence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
There is indeed no dispute as to the beginning of the sentence.  And we can indeed read from the -- where my friend suggested we -- we start from.  

But what I have an issue with is the translation in English and a very strong issue about that.  Because in French -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps you shouldn't cite.  If you have an issue, the -- the matter can be read in French and we can get the interpretation from -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  I would insist that we -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We get the interpretation --
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- from the interpreter.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So we read from where, Counsel?
MR. MAWERE:
The -- the last two words on the first sentence of paragraph 46 after the comma.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
"And Kambanda inspected it"?  
MR. MAWERE:
No.  No.  The last two words, "I do not".  I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm using the French version because I -- I would like them to read the French version. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  If -- if proper directions can be given to the witness, maybe he can read the statement himself.  All right.
MR. MAWERE:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If you can caution him about where to start.  

When -- in that case we will not need a closed session. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, if you look at paragraph 46, the last two words on the first line of that paragraph which start with "I do not".  Do you see that? 
A.	"I do not remember whether Callixte participated at that ceremony." 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I -- my -- my -- well, it's definitely not "if", as suggested in the English translation that we received from the Prosecutor.  I think the -- the sentence would be more accurately translated as, "I do not remember that Callixte Nzabonimana participated in that meeting." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we -- we have now got the official interpretation, and it is what we will go by. 
MR. MAWERE:
And we always advise that these are unofficial OTP translations, and we welcome my learned colleague's assistance because he knows French far -- much better than us. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But the Trial Chamber will rely on the interpreters.  It will not rely on the Prosecution, and it will not rely on the Defence. 
MR. MAWERE:
Indeed, Your Honours.  Thank you. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	As at the weekend when you were prepped by Defence counsel, you were aware that that portion that you have read is not a true reflection of your knowledge; correct? 
A.	I explained things, and what I explained was recorded.  And this is a faithful reflection of what I said.  

But I'll have to say this:  If paragraph 46 of the statement is not clear, you can set aside the text and consider the other evidence that I may provide. 
Q.	I put it to you, Witness, that as of the weekend -- the -- at the weekend when you were prepped, you had not decided to change your mind and you only changed to say when you were in court that you were sure that Callixte Nzabonimana did not participate at this meeting.  Any comment?  This is a new invention you invented yesterday in the witness stand.  
A.	Are you saying that I also invented the video images that are in the records of the Rwandan government also?  
Q.	We are actually coming to the -- to -- to the pictures.  I -- I see you really want us to talk more about them.  We are getting there.  But for now just answer that question.  
A.	I preferred to leave my statement the way it was because I knew that I will have opportunity to properly explain things before the Chamber, before the Judges. 
Q.	So you actually misled counsel for Nzabonimana on that aspect when you knew you were going to say something different to the Judges; correct? 
A.	No.  Those members of the Defence team are quite intelligent.  If they had realised that there was a problem, they would have corrected me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, have you heard anyone say that Callixte Nzabonimana was at the meeting presided over by Jean Kambanda? 
A.	No one. 
Q.	Are you aware, Witness, that Straton Sibomana has heard that people mentioned Callixte Nzabonimana was present at that gathering? 
A.	I know nothing about it. 
Q.	Are you aware that Straton Sibomana has testified as a witness -- as a Defence witness for Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Each one is invited to come and testify here in secret.  I never met anyone after I was invited to come here by the Defence team.  Consequently, I know nothing about other Defence witnesses. 
Q.	Straton Sibomana is not a protected witness.  He actually testified in open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, the witness -- 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Any comment? 
A.	Well, I was not present during his testimony.  I do not know the contents or the thrust of his testimony.  And he's responsible for the statements he made.  And it is now left to the Judges to come up with a ruling as regards the truth from the various testimonies that have been given here. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  Take into account that the witness has said he's not -- he knows nothing about other Defence witnesses who may have testified in this case. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Would it surprise you to learn that he actually said he heard that Callixte Nzabonimana was present at that gathering? 
A.	The -- the -- the Court would have to rule regarding information given by anyone and the information that they got from someone who was a factual witness and who was right there at the location. 
Q.	Did you record the date of this meeting? 
A.	No.  No.  I did not take note of that date.  I just know that there are various documents mentioning the fact that that meeting took place.  And so I do not recall the date. 
Q.	Let us now come to the -- the videos you have been talking about.  In front of you there is a screen; correct?  You see that? 
A.	The screen is not lit.  I don't have the video pictures that you're talking about. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, would you look into correcting the screen of the witness. 

Yes.  Prosecution, you can proceed as the witness -- as the -- the registry attends to the matter. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	You agree with me, Witness, that if a camera does not specifically point at a person in a group, that person might be omitted in the picture; correct? 
A.	The answer is that Nzabonimana was an authority.  The prime minister had gone to his préfecture of origin.  And so I do not see how he wouldn't have been visible in the video pictures when guns were being distributed to us.  And so I confirm that Nzabonimana was not present at that meeting.  I reiterate that. 
Q.	You, however, accept you did not know some of the authorities that were there; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	If they were senior to Nzabonimana, they would be closer to the prime minister than Nzabonimana; correct? 
A.	But what authority would there be in between the minister and the prime minister?  
Q.	Other ministers who are senior to the other minister.  
A.	Can you give concrete examples?  I'm saying that between the prime minister and the minister -- or between the prime minister and the minister, is there any other authority between these two?  
Q.	Are you saying, Witness, that Callixte Nzabonimana was Jean -- Jean Kambanda's number 2? 
A.	I am saying this because it was him whom he should have met in his préfecture of origin.  The person he should have met should have been Nzabonimana. 
Q.	You actually confirm, Witness, that the prime minister could not come to Gitarama, which was Callixte's province -- prov -- area of jurisdiction, and Callixte Nzabonimana would be absent?  That's what you are saying.  
A.	Now, please don't prepare a snare -- or a trap for me to fall in.  There is an order by way of protocol.  When a president is visiting a given region, regardless of the presence of ministers or governors, it is the mayor of the region in question who stands by the president.  That is how protocol functions.  

If Nzabonimana had been present during the said meeting, he would have necessarily been standing by the prime minister. 
Q.	And yesterday you stated that Kambanda said in his statement that he dared any Tutsi present to look him in the eye; correct? 
A.	Exactly. 
Q.	And there was no Tutsi present to look Kambanda in the -- in the eye; correct? 
A.	Now, do you think that that is possible?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we want to ask -- understand your answer.  Was there any Tutsi present?  Is that what you are saying?  Or you are saying it was not possible?  It's not very clear to us. 
THE WITNESS:
Nobody will dare to stand before the prime minister.  Be he right or wrong, you cannot contradict that.  And somewhere -- you -- you cannot stand to contradict him or to challenge him.  You cannot do that. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Why would the prime minister single out Tutsis in that meeting, Witness? 
A.	I cannot read his mind.  That was his thoughts, and that commits him and him alone.  

Just as I cannot guess or speculate on what is going through your mind.  I can't. 
Q.	And the prime minister was wearing military uniform on that day; correct? 
A.	He was in military uniform.  And he was also carrying a pistol.  He was in military gear, white in colour. 
Q.	And you know very well that in terms of Rwandan -- Rwandan law a prime minister has no rank in the army.  
A.	Now, listen.  The military gear does not represent any rank or so in the army, does it?  
Q.	It -- it is you who is answering questions, Witness, not me.  Please answer my question.  
A.	You are talking about rank.  But you need to distinguish that from a uniform.  Kambanda was a civil -- civilian authority. 
Q.	Kambanda was a civilian authority in military clothing on that day; correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, that has been answered by the witness.  Move on. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	He was not the minister of defence; correct? 
A.	No, he wasn't the minister of defence. 
Q.	In Rwanda the authority over firearms vested in the minister of defence; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Yet here was Kambanda, a civilian, distributing weap -- weapons, guns; is that true? 
A.	That's correct.  But permit me to make this brief comment.  So I did not know that Kambanda at the time was representing the president of the republic.  

So far as I am concerned, I was a simple ordinary citizen.  And so please do not drag me into the debate on the differences between the military or the civilian authorities. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Witness, we would like to remind you that, if a question is not proper, the Trial Chamber will say so.  So if a question has been put and the -- the Trial Chamber has allowed it, try your best to answer it.  It may be important. 
THE WITNESS:
When questions are put to me concerning politics or regarding higher ranking officers in the army, what do I do?  Should I keep quiet?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Answer the best way you can.  And if you don't know, you can also say so, Witness.  

Counsel, you may continue. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, you remember yesterday you explained that Nzaboni -- Callixte Nzabonimana could not be involved in the Ndiza battalion because he was a civilian; correct?
A.	Yes.  I said so. 
Q.	And here we have a minister like Nzabonimana who was distributing firearms but was also a civilian; correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You said a minister like Nzabonimana who was distributing?  
MR. MAWERE:
Yes.  The -- the prime minister.  He -- he actually said there's no authority be -- no distinction between the prime minister and the minister.  That's why I'm putting it that way. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, the question has got to be clear to the Trial Chamber as well as the witness.  If you want to quote him, quote him.  But the way you have put the question does not appear to -- to make a lot of sense, Counsel. 
BY MR. MAWERE:
Q.	Witness, why does -- what -- why does it not apply to Jean Kambanda that as a civilian he should not have anything to do with military matters?  Like you said about Callixte Nzabonimana.
A.	I did not get your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, my question is, yesterday you said Callixte Nzabonimana could not be involved in the Ndiza battalion because he's a civilian.  Why doesn't that apply to Jean Kambanda distributing weapons? 
A.	I told you that maybe Prime Minister Kambanda was representing the supreme commander in chief 
	of the army.  That is a constitutional prerogative. 
MR. MAWERE:
Madam President, Your Honours, the -- the progress has actually been faster than I anticipated.  I have two issues that I'll need to survey in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, Counsel. 

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave at this moment because counsel is broaching subjects which may reveal the identity of the witness.  We regret that you have to leave now.
MR. DIALLO:
Madam President, we are in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, Counsel.  People are still moving out. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 34 to 50] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 25 to 33 by Tanya West) 










MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Defence Counsel, who is the next witness?  The pseudonym. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
T98.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you kindly administer the oath to the witness.  
(Declaration made by Witness T98 in French) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, the Trial Chamber would like to welcome you to the Tribunal, and, in particular, to these proceedings.  We would like to give you a few ground rules for the smooth hearing and recording of your evidence.  

Would you like to give your testimony in Kinyarwanda or French? 
THE WITNESS:
I prefer French.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, as you prefer.  We will then let you know of what the procedures are.  But before we do so, we would like to remind you to keep your microphone closed if you're not speaking and to open it before you begin to speak.  If you leave it open and another microphone is also open, it interrupts the proceedings and the recording of your testimony.  So remember that one.  

Now, with regard to the procedures, your evidence will be elicited through questions put to you by the parties.  The first party to put questions to you is the Defence, which is seated on your left.  After the Defence, the Prosecution, which is seated on your right below the translation booth, will also put questions to you.  

The Judges will, in turn, put questions to you at any time during the proceedings.  You are required to answer all questions put to you by either party or by the Judges.  

If you have not understood a question put to you, you may ask for it to be repeated or clarified.  

Be short -- or, rather, brief and precise in answering questions, and avoid long narrations as they are difficult to understand and interpret.  We would also like to remind you that your evidence is being recorded, and, therefore, you have to speak at a pace that allows both for translation and recording of your evidence.  

We require you to observe courtesy to all the parties and the officers in this Court.  We, in turn, require them and each one of us to extend to you the same courtesy.  

You are a protected witness and, therefore, it may be necessary to give part of your testimony in open session and any other part in closed session.  

In an open session, like the one we are in at the moment, the public is allowed to attend the proceedings and even to obtain a record of such proceedings.  Therefore, if -- if and when we are in open session, the Trial Chamber will advise you.  But be careful while we are there not to give any information that may identify you.  

If the Trial Chamber considers that the information you are about to give may lead to the disclosure of your identity, it will order a closed session.  And this is entirely within its discretion.  We will be advising you whenever we are entering any session so that you can testify accordingly.  

We would now like to get confirmation from you if you have understood the directions we have given you.  Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I understood very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  We'll now like to hand you over to Defence counsel, who is going to lead your evidence in chief. 
WITNESS T98,
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Good morning (sic), Witness.  
A.	Good morning (sic).  
Q.	Permit me to add to the ground rules that were just proffered to you by Madam President, the following: 

Now, since both of us will be speaking in French, it would be wise for you to mark a pause each time you speak so as to enable the interpreters to do their work as well as the record -- verbatim recorders to do theirs.  

I, for one, will mark a pause after you take the floor each time.  And so I exalt you to do the same.  And also to speak slowly, once again, in a bid to ensure that all these persons can do their work properly.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, Counsel.  

We would like to confirm what counsel has said.  It's absolutely necessarily for you to observe that pause.  

But we are coming in to say that we heard "Good morning, Witness."

We heard and see "Good morning."

The question is:  "Good morning, Witness." 

And the answer is:  "Good morning."

Interpreter, is that a mistake of the recorders or -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Good morning is bon -- good morning is bonjour.  So good afternoon is bon après-midi.  So we heard bonjour.  That was good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is asking what the interpreter said. 

Madam, I was trying to answer your question, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Witness, we were putting a query to the interpreters because of what we heard and saw in the CaseView.  It had nothing to do with you, but it has been clarified.  And now the 
Defence counsel is going to begin putting questions to you, so listen carefully.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, naturally you have before you a personal identification sheet carrying your personal -- your particulars.  And so I ask you to quietly cross-check that and make sure that the information on that sheet is accurate.  
A.	Well, the information I have on this sheet is accurate.  
Q.	Consequently, Mr. Witness, I will now ask you to append your signature on that document, as well as the date of today, which is the 13th of July 2010.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
With your leave, Madam President, I would request for that document to be tendered into an exhibit, under seal obviously, because it contains the particulars of the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution has no objection to the production of the PIS of the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The Trial Chamber welcomes you back to the proceedings.  You disappeared for some time.  

The personal identification sheet of this witness is tendered as a Prosecution exhibit, under seal.  

Registry.  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 45. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is tendered as Exhibit D. 45.  
(Exhibit No. D. 45 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
With your leave, Madam President, I would regrettably request that we move into a closed -- a short closed session just to establish the place of residence of the witness and the location of certain sites of that location.  I think it's a matter of maybe ten minutes, and then, if we refer to these sites as the area of residence of the witness, I think we could safely move back into an 
open session after that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Members of the public, we regret you have to leave now because the matters we are about to broach touch on the identity of the witness.  He is a protected witness, and we hope it will be for a short time.  We kindly request you to leave now.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 56 to 60] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. MATEMANGA: 
We are in open session now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry. 

Witness, we are now in open session.  Be careful not to mention any names or places that may identify you.  And if you have any difficulty answering any question do not hesitate to raise the matter with the Trial Chamber.  Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, I would like to know if, after the 6th of April 1994, if there were any disturbances in your place of residence? 
A.	I did not quite understand the question.  Are you referring to the area in which I lived, the zone in which I lived, the region in which I lived?  
Q.	Your place of residence; your locality. 
A.	Yes, after the 6th of April.  But it was sometime after that and I can estimate that to be between
	two and three weeks, yes, there were disturbances. 
Q.	Are you able to briefly describe what happened? 
A.	I do recall that on a Friday, which normally is a market day, during the night I heard a noise of
	roofing sheets in the house of somebody living -- who was living on the other side of the road.  It so happened that they were destroying his house, but the man himself was not there, his family was not there.  But I believe that up till now they are still alive, so he was not killed but his house was destroyed. 

Now, the following day, I heard that two elderly persons were killed -- two elderly men were killed.  So the killings had started and the disturbances had started. 
Q.	Do you know who -- who carried out these killings? 
A.	From what I saw and what I heard there was one Nzaramba, Emmanuel.  There was also another person called Michelin, and yet another one called Esron.  These two persons were in charge of the disturbances in the -- in the region. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Michelin is number 24 on the list.  Nzaramba is number 30.  Esron is not on the list and is spelt E-S-R-O-N.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you know which political party Michelin belonged to? 
A.	Michelin was a member of the MRND. 
Q.	And Nzaramba?  
A.	He was a member of the MDR. 
Q.	Esron? 
A.	I have no clear recollection of Esron's party. 
Q.	Do you know if he was a member of the MRND? 
A.	Esron was ETJ, meaning that he worked in the judiciary.  And at the time, those who work in the judiciary could not be members of political parties, so he did not indicate -- he did not indicate his political party.  But it's obvious that in -- he must have belonged to a party. 
Q.	Would you know if these three persons were Interahamwes? 
A.	Sometimes this word requires some explanation, because what I know is that where I lived there were very few MRND members; most of them had left.  However, some brave persons remained behind.  

Now, regarding the term "Interahamwe", at the outset the Interahamwe referred to a militia of some person who lived specifically in Kigali and who accompanied political leaders to attend political rallies.  It was a militia intended to fend off opposition from other parties.  But what I know is that in my locality there were a few brave members of the MRND, but at that time before the disturbances there was no reference to Interahamwe. 
Q.	Am I to understand you as saying that there were no Interahamwes? 
A.	There were no Interahamwes, but there were some members of the MRND party.  Just that -- that subsequently when the disturbances started everybody got involved, so the meaning of Interahamwe was extended to cover these people.  But prior to that there was no reference to Interahamwe. 
Q.	Who are the persons that you are referring to here? 
A.	I do not understand your question. 
Q.	You said that -- when you said the beginning of the disturbances, are you able to put a date on it? 
A.	I cannot give the exact date.  But what I know is that it was a Friday, because Fridays are market days, and the estimate I can make is that it -- it didn't happen within a week or immediately, but within two or three weeks after.  So that is my estimate.  I can't give you an exact date. 
Q.	Now, at the time that what you referred to as the disturbances started in your locality, who was the sous-préfet?  Was it the former sous-préfet or the new sous-préfet? 
A.	If I said it was between two and three weeks that the disturbances started, the -- this was in the month of April, so when the disturbances started it was the former sous-préfet who was still in office. 
Q.	While you were in your locality, between the 6th April and when you left, did you see 
	ministers of the interim government who came to that locality?  
A.	I did not see those ministers, neither did I hear about them.  And since these people are 
	important personalities, I would have known.  But I did not hear any such information. 
Q.	To your knowledge, were there public meetings involving administrative authorities, meetings which were held in your locality between the 6th of April 1994 and when you left that place? 
A.	I remember only one meeting, and I believe it is the only one that was held.  This is the meeting that was held -- that was held by the préfet.  And the purpose of that meeting was to restore peace and during the meeting a letter from the government calling the people to restore peace was read by the préfet himself. 
Q.	During that meeting, did other people take the floor? 
A.	What I remember is that there was no other person in authority who took the floor, but I remember that some individuals -- some ordinary citizens asked some questions. 
Q.	Do you have -- or do you recall approximately when this meeting was held? 
A.	It would be very difficult for me to give you the exact date.  However, I can situate that between the beginning -- beginning of the month of May and 15th May. 
Q.	How many people were present at that meeting? 
A.	On that compound there were a lot of people -- about 200. 
Q.	Where was that meeting held? 
A.	It was the open space in the commercial area. 
Q.	A little earlier you said that it was the only public meeting that was held by administrative authorities.  Are you able to confirm that? 
A.	According -- from what I know, what I saw, what I experienced, I confirm that is the only public meeting that took place. 
Q.	Now I would like to focus your mind on the evidence that was brought before this Chamber.  We have heard in this courtroom that there were several other meetings involving administrative authorities of a higher grade than the préfet.  Maybe you can tell the Court what was the préfecture that this préfet was in charge of? 
A.	This was the Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	So let me start with the first of those meetings.  Do you know one Marianne, who was a member of the MRND and who lived in your locality? 
A.	I know her. 
Q.	Were there many *************** who belonged to the MRND who were fairly well known in your locality? 
A.	I don't think there is another **************. 
Q.	Do you know where she lived? 
A.	Yes, I know where her house was located. 
Q.	What is the approximate distance between your house and that house? 
A.	I would estimate that to be between 500 and 800 metres. 
Q.	So, according to the evidence brought before this Court, there was a meeting in ************* house one, two or three weeks following the death of President Habyarimana. 
A.	I don't know nothing.  I was not told any such thing. 
Q.	So, for now, let's just keep in mind that, according to evidence, that meeting was held between the 
	14th and 28th April 1994.  

I'll proceed.  Still according to the evidence on this meeting, the following people were present:  Callixte Nzabonimana.  Do you know him? 
A.	I only know him by name.  I never saw him except in newspaper -- his photograph in newspapers. 
Q.	Do you know the position he occupied in April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I know that he was the minister of youth. 
Q.	Jerôme Bicamumpaka, do you know him? 
A.	I know he was appointed minister, but I cannot recall his portfolio. 
Q.	Do you know which political party he belonged to?  
A.	Who were you referring to?  
Q.	Jerôme Bicamumpaka. 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	*******************.  Do you know him? 
A.	Yes, I know him, because he is a native of the same commune -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, we didn't hear the last word.  The same commune, *************. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Do you know Dominique Makeli? 
A.	From time to time I heard people talk about Makeli, but I never really met him.
Q.	Let me come back a moment on ******************.  Do you know what his position was in April 1994?  
A.	***********************.  Initially at one time he was a member of parliament and, thereafter, he was appointed to the ministry of interior as an ************. 
Q.	And Nathan Mugaga, do you know him? 
A.	I know him because he was bourgmestre of the Tambwe commune. 
Q.	I am coming back to Dominique Makeli.  I'm sorry about that.  Can you tell us what he was doing in the month of April 1994? 
A.	I know he was a journalist at the radio -- at the national radio. 
Q.	And what do you mean when you say he was a journalist at the national radio?
A.	Well, that was the only radio station in the nation, in Rwanda at the time.  
Q.	Was it just known as the national radio or did it go by some other name? 
A.	Yes, it was known as the national radio and it was run by the -- by ORINFOR, the office for information. 
Q.	And Colonel Aloys Simba, do you know him? 
A.	By name.  Yes, I do, by name.  But I also could recognise him in a picture. 
Q.	And an individual who was director of *************** at your place of residence; do you know the guy? 
A.	I knew him.  But I really cannot recall his name. 
Q.	And lastly, as the last personality, the new sous-préfet -- well, I'm not asking you whether you knew him. 

Now, from the evidence that has been tendered before this Trial Chamber, during the meeting that took place at the home of *************, all these persons took the floor and they said that either all the Tutsis had to be killed and they promised to provide weapons to do that.  And so they said one of the two, one of these things or both.  

Did you hear any such -- or, rather, why don't you give us your comment on this.  Give us your comment on this evidence that was tendered before this Trial Chamber. 
A.	Please, can you take that over to refresh my memory about the names of those who were at the meeting. 
Q.	In summary, between the *********************************:  Nzabonimana, Bicamumpaka, ***********, Makeli, Mugaga, Simba, the new sous-préfet, the director of **********, all gathered at the home of ***********, particularly in her parlour, said either all Tutsis had to be killed, or, "We will provide you weapons to do that", or they said both statements.  

Now, can you comment on this.  Can you make a comment on the evidence that was given to this Trial Chamber. 
A.	As for me, on hearing this, I simply would say this is a lie, for the following reasons:  Firstly, the first -- the new sous-préfet, at the date you mentioned, was not yet there and he had not yet been appointed. 

Secondly, by looking at the house of *************, which was an ordinary -- a very ordinary -- a ramshackle home.  Now you tell me that two ministers came right there, and this is very, very close to the road and people were not even aware that ministers had come there.  No, when I hear this, immediately I can tell you we would have known about any arrivals of anybody coming into the region, and a minister coming there would have been accompanied by bodyguards.  And if by chance we did not see the ministers we would have at least seen the bodyguards with their weapons, their vehicles.  And then you tell me they met in the small house owned by *********8.  They certainly may have chosen to meet at ************ home, because he had a house which -- which was luxurious and comfortable.  Or, if not, why wouldn't they have chosen to meet at the commune which had a meeting place, a conference hall?  So I never heard that these ministers came there, and the new sous-préfet had not yet been appointed.  And by way of comment that is all I could say about this. 
Q.	Permit me to add the following:  So in addition to the personalities I just mentioned, and still in light of the evidence before this Trial Chamber, there were between 10 and 20 Interahamwe from your place of residence who were following this meeting from the window -- across the window -- through the window of the parlour in the home of ***********.  Do you have any additional comments to add to that? 
A.	Please, can you repeat what you've said about these Interahamwes that were looking through the window. 
Q.	So simply, in addition to the scene that I described a few minutes ago, in addition there were 
	10 to 20 Interahamwes attending that meeting, but who were doing so by observing its unfolding from outside and looking through the window of the house of ************? 
A.	Well, this is what I can say thereto.  Those were very, very trying moments.  Those were moments when the security of every individual was threatened.  So if there were people at the meeting which was attended by two ministers of government very close to the road, since the house was very close to the road, if ministers with bodyguards would allow people to come and surround a house like that just to look at what was happening -- I want to imagine this -- this would not be a meeting of respectable and high-ranking people.  Did these ministers not have bodyguards?  If people were invited they should have come back into the home for the meeting.  

And then, why was Nzabonimana not invited?  He was not invited because I don't sign his name there.  So, so far as I'm concerned, this again is a lie.  A lie that people came and attended the meeting by looking from -- through the window to listen to what the minister was saying and there was no bodyguard there to hinder them from doing that. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

So -- well, that is not all.  We heard about other meetings that took place *****************************.  The second meeting which I would like to discuss with you allegedly took place towards the end of the month of *****************************************.  And in attendance at that meeting this time were, again:  Callixte Nzabonimana, accompanied this time by **************************; Nathan Mugaga; a communal policeman known as François Karara.  By the way, do you know the person known as François Karara? 
A.	Yes, I do.  He was a policeman. 
Q.	And so this time this meeting took place at the communal office  -- well, I wouldn't give the name of the commune, but it is the commune that we have been referring to hitherto and it is the same 
	communal office which you can see from your residence. 

In addition to the persons that I just named, there were many members of the population present.  On that occasion, Mr. Nzabonimana said that the weapons were given to the people for them to be able to take care of their own security. 

Mr. Nzabonimana is said to have given those weapons to the bourgmestre of Mugaga and to 
Brigadier François Karara, who, in turn, distributed them to members of the population. Later on, or subsequently, the said weapons were allegedly used in attacks against Tutsis. 

Do you have comments to make regarding this new meeting that was talked about as evidence in this Trial Chamber?  
A.	Well, I would like to know if that is possible.  Where did this meeting take place?  
Q.	That meeting is supposed to have taken place at the communal office of the commune where you lived. 
A.	What I have to say is two pronged.  I wish to underline the fact that, firstly, if a personality of the rank of minister, and if -- if -- even if a personality from another region comes to one region, people would comment about it.  But I never heard that Minister Nzabonimana came into that commune. 

Secondly, what I would say is that I never heard about any public meeting concerning the préfet.  

And, furthermore, the weapons -- concerning the distribution of the weapons, I don't know many people who had weapons, apart from the people who I mentioned, such as, Nzaramba, Michelin and another person who -- who later on had a weapon.  But I don't know many people who had weapons.  

Talking about distribution, for example, on my hill I noticed one person who had a weapon.  And was it necessary for there to be a public meeting to get these weapons distributed?  I don't believe so, because someone could have come to give weapons to the bourgmestre and tell him, "Now, this is what you are going to do."  So I never heard about a minister who visited that commune.  And the distribution of weapons per se, I never heard anyone talk about it, apart from the fact that the commune had weapons in the manner in which communes were usually provided with weapons.  But I never heard that weapons were distributed by a minister who visited the commune. 
Q.	Your microphone, Witness. 

The third meeting I would like to talk to you about, once again, and very coincidentally, is about a visit by Callixte Nzabonimana.  And contrarily this time, this meeting took place at the office, or, more precisely, in the hall -- in the meeting hall of the sous-préfecture of ****************************.  And those attending that meeting this time were as follows:  Nzabonimana, as I said; ********************; people of the sous-préfecture of ************************, and this is likely to include you; Bourgmestre Mugaga;  the new sous-préfet; ****************; leaders of religious groups; directors of private and public companies;  business men and other influential personalities of the commune.  

In addition, you had youth wings of political parties.  Interahamwes.  GDIs -- GDRs, rather.  And this meeting allegedly took place in mid-May 1994.  Also, someone known as
**************************************.  By the way, do you know this person?
A.	Yes, I knew him.  But I also knew him just by name and I could recognise his picture. 
Q.	So on that occasion, Callixte Nzabonimana spoke to the crowd they gathered and explained that he and ************************** had come to put in place a crisis committee.  Mr. Nzabonimana went on to specify the fact that that committee was meant to ensure security among the Hutu population, which apparently was struggling within itself in the bid to share the property left by Tutsis that had been killed.  

A second role of this crisis committee that was being set up was to decide who were the Hutus that were accomplices of Tutsis and who deserved to be killed, and on that score get them killed at the communal office rather than on the road. 

Do you have any comments to make about that? 
A.	The first remark I would make -- and I'm very, very clear on this -- that such a meeting that could have brought together such a huge number of persons never took place.  No meeting took place at the sous-préfecture office of that commune. 

Secondly, I never heard anyone say that a minister visited that region during those days or at that time. 

Thirdly, that meeting, so far as I am concerned, and since it is true that at one time a crisis committee was put in place, but it was a committee of the commune and done by the sous-préfecture.  And so that meeting to put in place this crisis committee, for me, could have taken place at the commune office.  The commune office had a meeting hall that was appropriate for any such event.  

A further comment is this:  We are told that it was to put order among people of the same ethnic group that were struggling about distributing or sharing property of another ethnic group.  Contrary to that, this committee was put in place within the framework of restoring order, of installing peace.  And to bring in total peace it is true that a certain point in time some people lost their heads and were doing things that were not proper and carrying out revenge.  But this was mainly in a bid to restore order on the whole.  Thank you.

1630H
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Simply there was an ambiguity I would like to raise in the answer that you just gave.  

Can you tell us exactly what -- the role of the security committee that was put in place.  
A.	Well, to answer your question, I would not know exactly, but I'm looking at the role generally.  Because that committee, I believe, was put in place at the same time when the government had signed that letter addressed to the entire nation concerning things coming back to normalcy.  And so what I know is that the goal was to restore peace and order as on the whole.  And so, to put an end to the killings, to put an end to the lootings, that was it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the witness initially called this committee the "crisis committee" and you're calling it the "security committee".  Are we talking about the same thing?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
That can be clarified with the witness, Madam.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Now, the committee that we are talking about, what was it called?  
A.	Well, the right denomination or the authentic name is in the national language and people translated it by saying "security committee"; others called it "crisis committee".  So it is up to you.  But in the 
	national language, it corresponds more accurately with security council or security committee, if we were to go by a literal translation.  But others in their translation called it crisis committee.  But in the national language, the appellation is the same; it is security committee. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  One other thing, Learned Counsel, is that we would like to take a break.  And we propose to take the break up to 5 p.m. this afternoon.  

Is this a convenient point for you?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, that suits us perfectly.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  The proceedings are adjourned to 5 o'clock this evening. 
(Court recessed from 1633H to 1701H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed. 

Defence Counsel.  

MR. LAROCHELLE:
Most obliged, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, before the break we were talking about the committee.  We were talking about the 
	crisis committee.  Do you know approximately at what date this committee was established?  
A.	It would be difficult for me to give you a specific date after so many years.  However, I can give you an estimate.  It was between the beginning of May and the 15th of May.  
Q.	In **************, were there several ********************* or **********************?  
A.	The only committee is that one that was established within the commune.  It was only one ************.  
Q.	Do you know some of the people who were members of that *************?  
A.	Yes, I can remember some of them.  There was one Grégoire, who was a judge.  There was one Augustin Karama.  He was a -- he had a mechanic -- a mechanic shop.  There was one 
	Gaspard Hategekimana; and then Gasana, the pastor.  These are names that I can remember.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Augustin Karama is 19; Gaspard Hategekimana, 16; and Emmanuel Gasana, 15.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, do we have the name of Grégoire?  The first name, if the witness recalls.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Witness, maybe you can clarify this.  Was Grégoire the first name or surname of the person you mentioned?  
A.	That is his Christian name, so it is the first name.  But his surname, if I recollect, is Munyeshyaka. 
THE WITNESS:
Munyeshyaka:  M-U-N-Y-E-S-H-E-Y-E -- A-K-A.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
No.  M-U-N-Y-E-S-H-Y-A-K-A.  
THE WITNESS: 
As for the first name, you want me to spell the first name as well?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I believe it was well spelt in the records.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Now, to your knowledge, did this committee play any role in the killings that took place at your place of residence?  
A.	Well, all I do know is its official mission, which was to restore peace and order and to put an end to the massacres.  However, after the committee was put in place, that did not mean that the killings were stopped entirely.  And so in some place an individual could be killed, but I cannot say whether it was the authority -- the committee that authorised that or not.  
Q.	Can you tell us whether the new sous-préfet was part of this committee?  
A.	I do not know.  The members - or rather -- well, to my knowledge, the committee was put in place even before he came to assume duty.  Now, whether he joined the committee later on is what I cannot say.  
Q.	Now, referring to the last meeting which I wish to discuss with you, this meeting supposedly took place at the ELECTROGAZ station at your place of residence.  In attendance were the following:  The meeting was chaired by a certain George Masango; and others attending the meeting were Mugaga; Ugirashebuga, U-G-I-R-A-S-H-E-B-U-G-A, Kaloni; Théophile Munyangagu, M-U-N-Y-A-N-G-A-G-U; Naphtali, N-A-P-T-H-A-L-I; Kwipuru, K-W-I-P-U-R-U, Callixte Nzabonimana; Safari; Aloys Simba; G-A-S-A-S-I-R-A, Gasasira; and ************.  

And during this meeting it was announced that places for the training in the handling of weapons would be the commune, **************************, at the home of a certain *****************, and at the home of a certain ***************************************.  

Do you have any comments to make about that meeting?  
A.	Well, I would like to know when, on what date, or around what period this meeting is alleged to have taken place.  
Q.	Unfortunately, evidence was not given regarding the period during which this meeting took place.  
A.	Well, what I can say about that is this:  Once again, I -- I tried to follow information on what was happening, but I could not see everything.  I'm not God.  So if the minister or if someone with the rank of a minister ever came, we would have known.  I should have known.  I never got to know.  This was not reported to me and I did not see any -- see Minister Nzabonimana visit the region. 

In addition, what I would say is this:  The meeting that took place there at *******************-- well, this is what I think -- or, this is what I am saying:  There you had houses for staff.  There was also a structure that was host to machines since it is of processing units -- of course, with a little space where very few people could really sit down.  

I find it difficult -- I find it difficult to think that a meeting which brought together so many people could have taken place at that venue.  Furthermore -- but, again, I would like to know who this 
************* was.  Who was he?  No clarifications on **************?  
Q.	The only clarification I can give you is that he was an officer.  And I would advise you -- advise that maybe we should go into closed session for you to be able to answer a couple of questions which I would like to put to you concerning this person.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Members of the public, we regret you have to leave at this moment, as the questions that are going to be put to the witness may impinge upon his identity.  He is a protected witness.  We regret this. 

(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 73 to 75] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
