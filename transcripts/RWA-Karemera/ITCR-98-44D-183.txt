P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Prosecutor (sic), could you open the proceedings? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 9th of July 2008, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case number, ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The appearances are the same.  

Before we start this proceeding, the registrar would like to make a correction about an exhibit number that was wrongly recorded yesterday.

Mr. Registrar.
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Yesterday, I mentioned Exhibit -- two Defence exhibits tendered yesterday as DK. 81 and 82.  The number is wrong.  The correct number will be, D. K83 and D. K84.  

Thank you, and sorry for the inconvenience.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Good morning.  Are we connected with our sightseeing?  We understand that we have a new judge in session.  We would like to welcome you and we would be grateful, for the record, if you could identify yourself.  Thank you.  
JUDGE LEROUX:
My name is Olivier Leroux, examining magistrate at the court of first instance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, and welcome to our proceedings.  

Mr. Witness, you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began yesterday, and the Prosecutor will now continue his examination of you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Good morning, to everyone, to the parties and to the witness.  

Your Honour, could we have the appearances in Brussels, please, to know the names of everyone that's in the room there?  Is the investigating magistrate the only person -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your Worship, the Prosecutor has requested that I put on the record the identity of those who are in the room with you and the witness.  I will be grateful if you could assist in that regard.  
MR. TCHIDIMBO:
Yes, apart from the new judge, the appearances are the same, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  And I apologise to the gallery, but I am going to request that we go into closed session.  The bulk of my cross-examination may expose this witness's identity.  I think it will be much more expeditious if I just try to accomplish as much as possible in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the public, this witness has been the beneficiary of a protection order and one element of it is that his identity should be concealed from the public.  The Prosecutor has indicated that the questions that will be put to him may elicit answers that could reveal his identity, and for that reason, we go into closed session now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And as we do that, I would indicate, for the record, that this morning I gave the registry an additional 30 pages of documents that we may use.  I assure everyone that we probably will not use most of these documents.  But they are on hand.  They were distributed to the parties this morning in Arusha.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 39] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

(Court resumed at 1416H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody. 

Mr. Sow, we have a late start, and we are going to have to adjust -- adjust your time somewhat, as I think that our closing period of 5 o'clock is fixed. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MR. SOW:
Your Honour, the witness would like to continue to have protective measures. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  

But before we start, I would just like to enquire from His Worship, the investigating judge whether -- what procedure would be adopted for taking the -- administering an oath or declaration to the witness, whether he will do that.
JUDGE LEROUX:  
Yes, Mr. President, I would like the witness to take the following oath. 
THE WITNESS:
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the truth -- the truth, all the truth, nothing but the truth.  
JUDGE LEROUX:
I would like to tell you that you don't have to make any statements which you believe could be used against you during criminal charges against you, subsequently.  

Kindly state your name, age and place where you live. 
THE WITNESS:
(By order of the Court this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please.  

Mr. Sow, we have to redact those answers from the public record.  We have just been -- the witness has been the beneficiary of a protection order, which -- one element of which is that his identity should be concealed from the public.  I think we will go into a closed session now to permit those questions to be put to the witness.  

So we go into a closed session now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 42 to 46] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)

BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, in 1990 Rwanda was attacked.  That was in October 1990.  Can you tell us, what were the consequences of that attack? 
A.	The consequences of that attack are very difficult to assess.  The country was destroyed.  As far as I was concerned, in particular, my campus ceased to exist after that attack.  It disappeared from the academic map.  I would say that the serious consequences of the war was the -- the fact that it was a threat to the fabric of the Rwandan society, and the economy suffered considerably.  Many people died, many people went into exile, and it caused a lot of suffering.  That is why the consequences of that war were difficult to assess, not only for the country, but for the international community.  That war tarnished the image of Rwanda, and we lived with the spectre of the tragic consequences of that war since then.  That is why, Counsel, I would say that the consequences of that war were serious and difficult to assess. 
Q.	You talked about the university.  Can you tell us exactly what the situation was following that attack?  I mean, the university in which you were?  But avoid giving the name of the university in order to protect your identity.  
A.	First of all, that university lost a lot of its members.  Another consequence was the evacuation of the members of that university community.  That community suffered an internal exile on two occasions.  I repeat, on two occasions.  The buildings were destroyed, something we had never experienced.  Studying in a war zone is not at all congenial to the acquisition of knowledge.  The students were so demotivated, as well as staff members, that they could not do their work properly.  That is why I talk of two exiles within the country.  

	In 1991 and 1992 there were evacuations.  There were deaths.  There was looting and destruction.  Those are the consequences of that war.  And the campus, which no longer exists, it was erased from the map -- from the educational map. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us how students were organised in that university? 
A.	The students came together to form an association called AGUNR, general association of students of Rwandan universities.  There were assembled at all levels of the university, the departments, the student body.  And they were also present both in the coordination committee and in the senate.  They were present in the university council, as well.  So that is why I call it a general association.  I know that in the last years from 1992 a new association came into being, but it doesn't represent much.  So within the university community, it was the general association of Rwandan students that represented the student body.  It was the students who elected their delegates, who had to represent that body at the different organs of the university.  That is very important.  And, as you know, these are achievements that came into being from 1968, and the universities established associations of students in order to defend the interests of students. 
Q.	Witness, following the attack of October 1990 by the RPF, were there no conflicts within the university community between students? 
A.	To my knowledge, within the Ruhengeri university campus during the 1990 attack, there were no conflicts between the students.  The students all lived in harmony and in solidarity.  And from 1990, when the Ruhengeri campus was evacuated, everyone, without any distinction, left.  So from the years 1990 and 1991 there were no ethnic conflicts, or inter-ethnic conflicts between students on the university campus. 
Q.	Witness, did you know of any students who went to join the RPF?  
A.	It is true that some students left to go and swell the ranks of the RPF.  I believe that.  Since students were adults, they were free to choose wherever they wanted to go to pursue their studies, or after their studies, they were free to go wherever they went.  So, there were a few cases of students who left, but not many. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, the witness has just mentioned the location of the campus.  I think it is appropriate for us to expunge that passage from the record. 
MR. MORLEY:
And I would invite that it's left on the record.  The reference to the campus itself, I respectfully submit, doesn't reveal this witness's identity.  It's a university.  I would ask that it remains on the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, unless the witness's position was also revealed, we don't think the mention of the university is sufficient to identify him. 
MR. SOW:
Very well, Mr. President.  I just wanted to make sure that his identity would not be revealed. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, do you know Mr. Édouard Karemera? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How did you get to know him? 
A.	I knew him at the université catholique de Louvain where he was studying law.  When I knew him, he was a very brilliant student, with a very strong personality, very hardworking, a very warm-hearted man.  A man, I think I can say so, a man who had preferred to be housed in a wing of a monastery in order to devote himself entirely and perfectly to his studies which he pursued very successfully and brilliantly.  

I knew him in the first year, and this is something that is very characteristic of him.  At the end of the first session the jury had offered him a second session on the basis of his work.  He had brought his academic record.  He had protested, and the jury -- which is something really rare -- had reviewed its position and acknowledged that it had mixed up Karemera with another Rwandan bearing the same name, "Karemera".  So Édouard was allowed to be promoted to the second year without any problem.  

And in the 1950s to have the courage to oppose the decision of the jury wasn't something very easy.  He was a very hard-working man, a very warm-hearted man, and a very courageous man.  That is the picture of Karemera I had at the university of Louvain, and that picture was subsequently confirmed. 
Q.	Witness, since I have to press on, I will stop here as regards the person of Édouard Karemera. 

Now, did you once hear Mr. Édouard Karemera advocate discrimination against the Tutsi ethnic group?  
A.	Never.  I never heard him utter any such statements. 
Q.	I thank you.  

One Prosecution witness claimed that the MRND organised a rally at the Gatwaro stadium, G-A-T-W-A-R-O, in June 1993.  Were you aware of any such gathering during that period? 
A.	No, I was never aware of such a gathering.  I am hearing about it now. 
Q.	Did you have occasion to attend rallies of the MRND? 
A.	It is true that my duties at the university didn't give me many opportunities to attend rallies, the more so as I was the ***************** in a war zone.  And if I remember correctly, the rare occasion when I attended a rally was in Ruhengeri.  That was because Ruhengeri was nearby. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us about cohabitation between political parties in Kibuye préfecture?  Do you know anything about that? 
A.	I do not know very much, because I, indeed, lived at ************* and went about my duties as (By order of the Court this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover) 
	entirely.  However -- 
MR. MORLEY:
I see Your Honours' heads moving.  Reference to his office, Your Honours may feel should be expunged. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we agree.
MR. SOW:
That is correct, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We order the redaction of his office. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, you can answer my questions, but please be careful not to reveal your duties or the office you held?
A.	Could you please remind me of the question?  
Q.	Witness, can you hear me?

Witness, can you hear me? 
A.	Could you please repeat your last question?  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, it would appear there are communication problems. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, can you hear me? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the registrar is enquiring now. 
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you.  May I ask you to repeat your last question? 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, my question was whether you know anything about cohabitation between political parties in Kibuye préfecture? 
A.	What I was saying, therefore, was that I resided in ************.  I did not often go to Kibuye.  However, according to recent documents, particularly Kimonyo's book, on what he referred to as 
	genocide populaire, or popular genocide.  Regarding cohabitation between the political parties, it is quite normal in that context; thus, in the context of multiparty politics, each party in all democracies worldwide would try to position itself.  The MDR, MRND, PL and PSD cohabited, more or less, as you would see in all democracies. 
Q.	Witness, were you aware of any political or ethnic disturbances in 1992 in Gishyita and Rwamatamu communes?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Gishyita is spelt as follows:  G-I-S-H-Y-I-T-A.  Rwamatamu is spelt as follows:  R-W-A-M-A-T-A-M-U.
THE WITNESS:
I heard about that from afar, since I lived in the north of the country, at the time the national commission had gone down to the field to investigate the causes of the events and the consequences of what had happened there.  I believe I also read in the very well-researched book by Mr. Kimonyo, in which he said that those disturbances were related to economic problems.  And he also said that the unrest was caused by some youths.  So I heard about such unrest from afar.  But in the current literature there is enough written on it.  It is very documented. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, do you know the Bisesero region? 
A.	Yes, that zone is very close to **************.  That is a zone I knew about even from my youth.  I knew people there, and I even have members of my family living there.  So I know very important people from there; the former superior of the Josephite's Brothers.  I also know priests who hailed from there, including the late Ignace Munyashonganya.  So, it is, therefore, a zone that I know quite well.  Therefore, since I am not a geographer, I cannot give you any details on it, but I would say that I know that zone relatively well, and I love it very much.  Besides, because it is very close to ***********. 
Q.	Witness, since you have stated that you ****************************** can you tell us whether it can be considered that that zone is congenial to infiltrations, particularly by members of the RPF? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, before the witness answers, I have two thoughts to offer Your Honours.  First of all, any analysis of the Bisesero geography and its susceptibility to infiltration by the RPF, it is material that -- it would have been helpful for my learned friends to have disclosed a little bit more accurately and in greater detail than there has been disclosures so far in respect of this witness.  However, I am not asking him to stop the questioning.  I am just inviting Your Honours to reflect on the lack of the usual notice.  

Secondly, Your Honours are invited to distinguish between what the witness knows and any reference to books and readings and literature, et cetera, which can put some into the category of an expert.  Having said all of that, I will sit down. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We note your remarks, Mr. Morley.  I don't think we need to do -- or, ask anything else at this stage. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, let me rephrase my question.  Can you tell me whether Bisesero is a mountainous region? 
A.	Yes, it is a zone with hills and valleys.  It is a zone that is good for animal husbandry.  It is a very windy zone.  It is somewhat difficult to access it on the side.  But you can -- you can have access to it from Murwa, because it is a plateau which is quite high.  
Q.	Can you tell us whether in Bisesero there were mines that were laid and abandoned in possible hideouts? 
A.	Of course, in Bisesero cassiterite is exploited there, and it was possible for cattle rearers to go there and work in the mines, and in order to become good traders, in order to send their children to school.  So mines were exploited there.  There were galleries there.  But since I never had the opportunity to visit those galleries, I do not know much about that, apart from the fact that the exploitation of cassiterite lasted for a very long time.  And I would say, besides, that thanks to that, the status of women was very much enhanced in that zone.  For instance, it was the women who went to receive the salaries of their miner husbands and to manage them.  So I would say that the mines had a very positive impact on the development of that region.  So the mines were very fruitful for the people of the region. 
Q.	Witness, were you aware of the departure of youths from Kibuye going to swell the ranks of the RPF? 
A.	Initially, while I was living in ***************.  I know that in reading recent publications you would find that mention is made of the departure of youths.  But, ultimately, the youths were free to go and -- had the right to fend for themselves and provide for their future.  There were many poor people in the region, so I wouldn't be surprised if some of those youths left in search of a better future, and hoping that they would come back to the country and occupy important posts under the umbrella of the RPF.  So I see young Africans today leaving Africa for Europe in quest of a better future.  So I would say that it was probably same for those youths at the time. 
Q.	Witness, did you know Mr. Seth Sendashonga?  Spelling, S-E-T-H, S-E-N-D-A-S-H-O-N-G-A, 
	Seth Sendashonga.  
A.	No.  But let me say since we were peers, I heard some information about him with regard to the fact that he had left the university -- the Rwandan national university and that he had sought refugee status abroad.  And I knew that at the time there was a tendency for all Rwandan students in Belgium to contribute to ensure that he should complete his bachelor's degree at the university.  And I think that many people contributed money for that, but I didn't have any direct relationship with him at the time. But his fate interested me, especially since he was from ************ 
Q.	Witness, would you confirm that he lived in the Kibuye region? 
A.	He was a native of Gwatemataru.  I know members of his family.  I know his brothers.  So, yes, I do confirm that. 
Q.	Did you hear at any point in time -- or, you were informed at the place where he lived -- at the place where he lived that many young people left that area to go and join the RPF army? 
A.	I would like to state that I lived far away, and I was unable to closely monitor youth movements in the region.  But when I listened to Moldova Radio one day, I heard that there was a broadcast which stated that it was important -- that it was likely that many youths in the region had joined the RPF.  That is the only information I have.  But as for the other things, I have to say, frankly, I had no access to the RPF archives, and I find it difficult to answer the question.  But when you read publications, especially the book of Kimonyo, there are names of people who went secteur-by-secteur to join the RPF. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I am done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow. 

Any other Defence teams who wish to examine this witness? 
MR. NIMY:
No, Mr. President.  The question was covered by Counsel Sow, and that I am okay with that.  
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Same here, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  

Mr. Witness, you will now have to respond to the Prosecutor, who will begin his cross-examination of you now. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you see me, and can you hear me? 
A.	Yes, I see you.  And I greet you. 
Q.	Do you agree there was a genocide of the Tutsi civilians in Rwanda between April and July of 1994? 
A.	There was a decision, and I believe the United Nations made a decision on that, and it is not incumbent upon me, a simple (By order of the Court this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover) that I am to contradict -- pardon me.

Okay.  I was saying the United Nations took a decision on that.  And that I don't see why, personally, I should be coming back to something that has already being recognised by the international community.  I would simply like to add, as I said a while ago, that this war led to deaths, Hutu, Tutsi, Twas and even beyond those -- Congolese, and so on and so forth.  That is what I would like to say. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
One moment.  I think the witness's name is mentioned, and we would like to redact that from the record.

You may continue.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You saw the evidence of the slaughter of Tutsi civilians whilst you were in Rwanda between April and July of 1994.  That is right, isn't it? 
A.	The murder of Tutsis -- yes, indeed, I saw deaths.  I was unfortunately, since 1990, used to seeing it.  I had seen it in Ruhengeri, in the northern area, starting in 1994.  Unfortunately, I did see these.  And amongst these, I have my own who died. 
Q.	You saw bodies in Kigali and in Kibuye; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I saw them. 
Q.	You saw roadblocks in Kigali, and as you travelled between various locations in Rwanda, between April and July of 1994; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I did.  
Q.	Who was killing the Tutsi civilians? 
A.	The first word of -- we were maybe their neighbours, and it was total chaos.  We were their neighbours. 
(Pages 47 to 53 by Sithembiso Moyo)





1515H 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Who was killing the Tutsi civilians?  
A.	Who were killing Tutsi civilians?  I said maybe their neighbours, or the civilians, Hutu civilians, 
	Twa civilians.  That is how it happened.  That is what I saw.  
Q.	Maybe?  Is that your evidence?  You have no idea.  You lived through these events.  You travelled throughout the country.  Simply, "maybe" Hutu civilians, "maybe" Twas.  Can't you do better than that?  Who was killing the Tutsi civilians, please?  
A.	That type of question hurt me.  It hurts me when I know that during those events, both Hutus and Tutsis died unfairly.  I won't like, here, to be part of those people who turned away from the massacres and killings of all civilians without distinction.  

When you talk about moderate Hutus, who killed them?  When you're talking about Tutsi, who killed them?  Hutus killed; Tutsis killed.  You can't measure that.  
Q.	But you can.  You can give us some information from what you know of what you saw of bodies strewn around and of roadblocks that you passed through.  

Who was killing the Tutsi civilians?  It was Interahamwe youths, wasn't it?  
A.	Prosecutor, I believe you are better placed than I am to know who killed.  As far as I am concerned, I would say that during that period -- I can't say everybody killed, but many people did kill.  Maybe Interahamwe, maybe the other youth groups from other parties who killed.  But whatever the case, those killers, be they Hutu or Tutsi, are mere killers.  They are criminals.  And those who killed the Tutsi, quite frankly, have to be prosecuted and killed, as well as those who killed Hutus, be they moderate or not.  
Q.	You, yourself, were threatened by the Interahamwe on the 26th of April of 1994, and you were only saved by one of your former students; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	It is true I faced some difficulty in going across a certain area.  Yes, that happened.  And I would like to thank that student who enabled me to continue living.  
Q.	And so that the Judges understand, you, yourself, was subject to the belief you were going to be murdered by the Interahamwe at a roadblock; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	In any event, it is true, that incident which, indeed, I had forgotten happened.  I had nearly been killed.  Just as many people had come near to being killed.  But that was not the first time when I had nearly been killed.  But I had nearly been killed also in Ruhengeri in 1991 when I spent three days on bumps of the RPF and others.  And often I have narrowly escaped that, maybe by the grace of God, an invisible hand.  
Q.	Please stop ducking the issue.  I'm not talking about the RPF and artillery fire in 1991.  I'm asking about who was killing the Tutsi civilians during the genocide of April to July of 1994.  I've suggested to you, you know full well it was the Interahamwe.  You've told us you, yourself, were threatened with death by the Interahamwe.  

Do you seriously suggest you have no idea who was killing the Tutsi civilians?  You lived through it.  At one point, you faced it.  What do you say?  
A.	Prosecutor, in order not to drag too much, I would like to say that it is a well-known fact that Hutu civilians killed Tutsis, that unidentified militia killed Tutsis and moderate Hutus.  That's it, Prosecutor.  
Q.	Not unidentified militia, Interahamwe.  I suggest to you, you know full well Interahamwe were killing Tutsi civilians.  And you, yourself, were exposed to the threat of death by the Interahamwe, a word you, yourself, used in an interview with the Belgians in 2007.  Not malicious, indistinct civilians from here, there, and everywhere, Interahamwe.  Do you deny it?  
A.	At my age there are things that escape my memory far more than when I was 20.  I've never said that Interahamwes never killed.  But when you talk about "Interahamwe," it is too general.  Who is Interahamwe?  What are their names?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours, can I confess?  I was taken slightly by surprise with Mr. Sow finishing, and I failed to distribute all the paperwork.  I don't know if Your Honours already have it, as it was distributed on the 3rd of July.  I have hardcopies here to distribute, with the assistance of Mr. Issa.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, I'm sorry.  We didn't have it.  We haven't gotten access to it yet -- or, at the moment.  
MR. MORLEY: 
And while that's being done, if I may, I'll move on to another area of questioning.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were a member of the national committee of the MRND; is that correct, is it not? 
A.	Yes, I was a member of the national committee of the MRND.  
Q.	You were a member both prior to and during the multipartyism period; is that right? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness has not turned on his microphone.  
THE WITNESS: 
Before, no; but after multiparty politics, yes.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Is it right that you remained a member of the MRND central committee throughout the events of April to July of 1994?  
A.	It was a period during which everything had come to a halt.  I was on my own.  I attended no meeting which I, alone, had to protect mine in a context of chaos.  It was a period during which I was not part of any organ.  I was on my own, and I had to struggle to survive.  
Q.	Whether the committee met or not between April and July of 1994, is of no immediate enquiry.  What I am asking is:  Is it right that throughout the period of multipartyism up to July of 1994, with the collapse of the Rwandan government, you were a member of the MRND national committee?  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	As a member of the national committee, you would know Mr. Nzirorera; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Not much, as a matter of fact.  Not much.  
Q.	And you would know Mr. Ngirumpatse; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Not much either.  He was in the diplomacy, and I was in academics.  Quite frankly, I didn't know him that well.  
Q.	I'm not asking you how well you knew them.  You knew them.  They were senior figures in the party in which you were a member of the national committee.  You knew what they looked like.  You would have spoken to them from time to time at national committee meetings.  You knew them as people sharing a similar outlook politically; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	The only people I knew well were the people in the university.  There were occasions in which I attended meetings in Kigali.  I didn't have the time to get that close.  My main preoccupation was the university.  All else to me was secondary.  So, as far as I'm concerned, these people you are talking about were not among my circle of friends.
Q.	I'm not talking about friends.  You would have met those personalities one or two times a year when the national committee met whilst you were a member of the national committee; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	You know, the national committee is like a major mass.  When I go to church for mass on Sunday, I can't tell you who is there.  I was just one out of many, but I didn't focus on that much.  
Q.	You were a member of ************* préfecture committee; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, yes.  But from the periphery, my professional area and my area of action was the north.  It is true that I was a member of the ************* préfectoral committee, in which I didn't leave, by the way, and in which I would appear on rare occasions.  
Q.	You said that a meeting of the national committee would be like going to mass with lots and lots of people.  I suggest to you that a meeting of the MRND national committee comprised in the region of about 20 people.  Do you disagree with that?  
A.	Twenty people?  National committee of MRND?  No, I don't think so.  A lot more than that.  
Q.	I would ask you to be shown the bundle of material, which I hope has been made -- it's been copied so that you are able to look at the same material which we have here in this courtroom.  
MR. MORLEY: 
With the assistance of the registrar, there should be a 42-page bundle, please.  I would like, please, that that is put in front of the witness.  
MR. NIMY: 
Excuse me, Your Honour.  I have a problem understanding what Mr. Morley has just said.  

Are you talking about the national council at regional level?  It's something I don't understand.  Could you throw more light on that for us?  A national council at regional level?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Respectfully, no.  Let's see what the witness says.  

Do we have the bundle in front of the witness, please?  
Good.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I would like you, please, to turn to page 14 of this bundle.  If you look in the bottom right-hand corner, there are handwritten numbers, page 14.
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, this is a procès-verbal, recorded in the relevant country on the 28th of September 2007.  Your Honours will see reference to that date on page 12.  This is a statement from this witness.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Looking at page 14, in French, top of the page, three lines, two lines down, you refer as follows in French -- my apologies for my accent:  

As a member of the central committee of the *********, I did not have any particular responsibilities.  There were at least about 20 of us of Hutu and Tutsi ethnicity.  It was essentially the political bureau composed of the president, the vice president, and the secretary, who carried out the daily activities.  I had to attend national meetings one -- twice a year, or one to two times a year.  

"During those meetings, we reviewed all recommendations prepared by the central committee in all areas concerning the political life of the country.  My membership of the ******* central committee  was public knowledge."  

Now, that's what you said in September 2007.  You were a bigwig in the MRND; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	First of all, let me point out that a while ago there was a mix-up between national council and préfectoral committee.  I stated that I was a member of the *****************, which comprised at least 20 or so persons.  

And when you say "about 20," what is the range?  Could it go even as far as 100?  I didn't know that this document would be cited.  I said "about 20", which means that it was more than 20 -- could have been more than 20.  And when I say "it was public knowledge", since the multiparty politics -- and I said it was of considerable importance to people, because there was as many national committees as there were parties:  The MDR; the MRND had its national committee; the PSD had its national committee.  So being a member of a national committee at the time was not all that important.  

In the context of multiparty politics, there were tens -- I would even say hundreds of members of central committees, as many as there were political parties.  That is all what I meant in this document.  
Q.	So do I understand correctly that when you refer to there being 20 members of the national committee, you actually mean there were tens, if not hundreds, or are you simply making this up because you didn't realise this document would be put under your nose?  
A.	This document does not at all frighten me.  What I meant to say was that, at the time, I did not have in mind a number of members of the national committee.  When I said "at least about 20", I mean that there were more than 20.  There were people who hailed from all regions of the country.  With regard to this document, what is there is my work.  I am the one who wrote it.  And I am not ready to change even a comma in this document.  
Q.	But you are changing a lot of what you've been saying.  You are suggesting that 20 people means between tens and hundreds of people.  

And, Mr. Witness, I suggest to you the reason you're doing that is to hide away the fact that you were a political colleague of Nzirorera, Karemera, and Ngirumpatse, that you knew them, you knew them reasonably well, and now you don't want to suggest as much, because otherwise, it's easy enough to be accused of bias.  

What do you say about that? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, when you say that I knew them well, you have to prove that.  I am telling you that I did not know them closely, because we did not evolve in the same administrative forum.  I was a (By order of the Court, this name was extracted and kept under separate cover), and they were in the administration.  That is all I have to say.  Now, if you have evidence to the effect that I knew them, well you can provide such evidence.  
Q.	But we have evidence, because it's in your own document.  You refer to how the national committee convened with the president, the vice president, and the secretary, who were, after 1993, respectively:  Ngirumpatse, Karemera, and Nzirorera.  You, yourself, refer to the officers, that as a member of the national committee, you then met and worked with.  

So do you still suggest you don't really know the three men who are here on trial? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just to interrupt, before he answers the question, he referred to his position at the university, and I think I will order that that be redacted. 
MR. MORLEY: 
And for Your Honours' assistance, reference to president, de vice-président et de secrétaire, is on page 14, five lines down from the top.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So what do you say, Mr. Witness?  You asked me for evidence that you knew these people and I offered you what you said yourself in your own document.  It's not bad, is it?  It's evidence.  What do you say?  
A.	I wouldn't like us to mix things up.  Let me repeat what I have stated.  I did not have any particular knowledge -- and I'm speaking in French.  I did not know the persons you have referred to closely or in a particular way.  I have pointed out that they were not in my circle of friends; they were not members of my scientific research forum.  I quite simply bumped into them as I bumped into others in the national council.  

Contrary to what you think, I was not a bigwig.  A bigwig on the basis of what?  I was just an ordinary person.  A professor does not need to have particular acquaintances.  I was an ordinary person.  I was a free person, a person who liked to work with a free hand in an autonomous manner.  And that is why I chose the university, because I could work autonomously.  And even within this academia, I was always a free man, and I worked autonomously.  That is what I have to say, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Even in the party I was able to work autonomously.  
Q.	When you say you bumped into the three defendants, let's see who you bumped into in 1994.
MR. MORLEY:
Let me turn the page to page 16, for Your Honours' assistance.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	In the second paragraph of your own statement, which you told us you yourself wrote, you refer, 
	seven lines down from the beginning of the second paragraph -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel for the Prosecution, could you please indicate the page to the witness again so that we can find it?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Certainly.  Page 16, second paragraph, seven lines down from the beginning of the second paragraph.  

"In the night of the 26th to the 27th, that was in April, we were threatened by Interahamwe.  It was thanks to the sous-préfet's intervention, who was one of my former students, that we were rescued." 

Now, there you are referring to the Interahamwe, not to indistinct militia, not to some vagabond gathering of neighbours and civilians.  The word you used is "Interahamwe". 
MR. MORLEY: 
My microphone is no longer working in my ear.  I don't know if it's working in yours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We've lost also (inaudible).  
THE WITNESS: 
This is what I would like to say:  I have just learned of this document.  I have just seen this document.  In the society in which I live, when someone answers a question in a document, that document is shown to the person at least a few hours before.  So for you to fish, here and there, excerpts and place them out of the context, is not the proper manner to proceed.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
Is my microphone now working?  Am I working?  I think I am. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we have just heard you.
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you. 

I see Mr. Nimy is on his feet. 
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I would quite simply like to draw the Chamber's attention, as well as my 
learned friend, Morley's, attention to the fact that I have always been accustomed to, dealing with documents of this trial, when they talk of the Interahamwe in relation to the MRND, we always say "Interahamwe za MRND".  I do not see that here.  All I see here is "Interahamwe".  And as the 
witness --

Yes, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Please, that's really a matter of (inaudible). 
MR. MORLEY: 
May I say -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters cannot hear the Prosecutor's statements.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, do you mean I should repeat my submissions?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is my microphone working?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We are not on record now because the microphone is not working.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Yes and no.  Your Honour is coming on and going out.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we'll just wait on the (inaudible). 

I think we have to -- we have been advised that the problem would require a few minutes to be fixed.  And it is suggested that we rise now for about 15 minutes.  So we will take a 15-minute recess now and, hopefully, the problem will be fixed during our absence. 
(Court recessed from 1550H to 1612H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, the problem has been fixed on this end.  Are we in contact with our video-conference?  We are.  I can see them.  

Yes, Mr. Sow, you are on your feet?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Your Honour.  I would like, before making any further observations, to ask Mr. Morley to say when he disclosed to us the document he's using, because on the cover page, he has put 3 July 2008.  I would like him to firstly respond to this question prior to my observations.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Certainly.  If you look at the cover page, it refers to the material being filed with CMS on the 3rd of July of 2008.  And in the heading it refers to the material being served on the Defence when cross-examination begins.  I had thought that my learned -- members of the Bench would have this material to hand automatically, as it had been given to the CMS.  So I hope that answers the enquiry from my learned friend.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. Morley, for your answer. 

Your Honour, I would like you to take a look at the cover page, just above where he said "Prosecutor cross-examination material," you will see he has stated:  Confidential, not to be served on the Defence until Prosecution cross-examination commences.  

Of course, I'm killing the English.  But I believe, in other words, Your Honour, if I understand these words, firstly, we never received these documents, and it is stated that this document should not be disclosed -- should not be served prior to the cross-examination -- beginning of the cross-examination.  

Mr. President, you can see these are immigration documents, and these are legal documents of the witness.  And Mr. Morley has certainly, after having begun his cross-examination, made us to understand that he was surprised by Counsel Sow, that is why he didn't disclose.  

I believe, President, that, once more, the Prosecutor has demonstrated that he is -- has no probity in what he is doing, because I feel, Mr. President, that there are motions to obtain the immigration judicial documents of a witness.  And you can see that there are documents dating back to 2002, others from January 2008.  We received nothing, because when I looked at the cover page, I thought that, through internet, we would have the documents.  When we checked and we saw we had received nothing.  

Mr. President, we think this is a very serious matter.  It is a betrayal, it is ambush, and this deserves to be sanctioned, because as we speak, everybody is being misled, including the Chamber.  And, Mr. President, I would like to ask the Chamber to set aside these documents and rule that they cannot be used by Mr. Morley.  What he has done is extremely serious.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I would like, timidly (phonetic), to confirm that these documents are for identity -- that identification documents needed to know the witness were never disclosed.  And you reminded us, maybe today or yesterday, that the Prosecution's disclosures shall be used in this area.  My legal background teaches me something else.  I have to provide the exhibits of the witnesses that I am presenting and, therefore, have the mastery of the disclosures.  

That is my -- the background I know, but that -- in this Tribunal, that even if the Prosecution has the exhibits which I have to use, they are sent to me by the Prosecutor.  And when he behaves in this manner, clearly there is betrayal.  There is a rupture of the trust we have placed in him, and this is not serious (sic) at all.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like, with your permission, President, allow -- I would like to confirm that we found ourselves in a situation.  We didn't receive this important document, which Mr. Morley is using now.  As a matter of fact, generally speaking, of course, we agree to question the witness to proceed, but we would have liked to do this questioning at a time when we had these immigration documents in order for us to carry out proper exploitation.  I will just state, as a matter of conclusion that we are not happy at all, as well.  
MR. MORLEY: 
My learned friends are invited to calm themselves and to recall the distinction between disclosure and the service upon the Defence of the material which will be used in cross-examination.  It's a distinction I had understood was well-understood, but it appears it is not.  

The immigration files were disclosed, we have on record, on the 29th of April of 2008.  So, as I understand it, my learned friends have had a plethora of immigration material, which includes, within several hundred pages, the immigration documents which are part of, potentially, the cross-examination material served upon my learned friends at the commencement of Prosecution cross-examination.  

So the first point to make is that the immigration material was disclosed, as we have it on record on the 29th of April.  The second point to make is, my learned friends are reminded that the material to be used in cross-examination, of all the material previously disclosed or material in the hands of the Prosecution to be used, comes into their hands at the moment of cross-examination.  And unless my learned friends' memories have escaped them, that was the procedure whilst the Prosecution case was taking place with regard to their cross-examination material.  And it was also the procedure with regard to the cross-examination material to be used by the Prosecution during the previous session.

So having said all of that, I hope Your Honours will appreciate that, perhaps, some of the colour of the observations offered by my learned friends is entirely misplaced.  I hope that assists.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, during the last session, the legal documents of the witnesses appearing before the Chamber for the last session were disclosed to us.  The Prosecutor, who claims to have disclosed these documents to us, he has to prove to us that these documents were, indeed, disclosed to us.  There is no confusion between the fact of serving exhibits to be used as cross-examination material, and exhibits that were requested by the parties. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sow, I think that we should not pursue this discussion at this time.  We have a limited time to complete the examination of the witness.  On the face of it, what the Prosecutor has said seems to conform with the standards that we've established.  But I think that if we are going to pursue this discussion further, we should not do it at a time when it takes away from the video-link testimony.  So we have noted your objection, and you will be permitted to develop it when we have completed the video-link session. 

Mr. Morley, you may continue. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you. 

Are we online, please, to the location abroad?
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you hear me?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you.  If we look at page 16 of your very helpful statement of 2007, we can see in the 
	second paragraph -- no, I'll start that again.  

We can see, on the face of the page, that after the death of the president, you moved about the country in the following way:  You were in Butare on the night of the 22nd of April of 1994.  We see that at the top of page 16, first line.  In the second paragraph, we then go on to see that you progressed towards Kabuye from the 23rd of April; that on the 26th of April, you decided to go to Cyangugu; that on the 
19th of May, you went to Ruhengeri; and that after being in Ruhengeri, you -- there came a time when you were in Gisenyi.  
MR. MORLEY: 
And Your Honours will see reference to all those locations in that second paragraph, with Butare being referred to at the top of the page.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, during the course of the slaughter of the up to a million Tutsi civilians in the small country of Rwanda between April and July of 1994, you were respectively able to travel to Butare, Kabuye, Cyangugu, Ruhengeri and Gisenyi at different times. 

Can you explain to Their Honours how you were able to travel around a country at a time of war, a time of petrol shortage, or were you doing official work?  Were you acting in some official capacity so that you were able to pass through roadblocks and move about?  Explain to Their Honours your free movement.  
A.	To some of the question, it means:  How come I'm still alive?  Yes, I'm still alive.  I escaped lots of things in 1992 -- '91 and '92 in Ruhengeri.  I did what I did.  It may have been the hand of God.  But if you want me to tell you what I did, I left Kigali, because, at the time, I seized an opportunity that I could leave in a convoy of Kabuye people, that is, a family which was returning that had difficulty in going back -- in going through roadblocks.  

It wasn't an obvious thing to do; we had to struggle.  But when we left Kigali, in my mind, I was going towards peaceful regions, regions where there was peace.  I was unaware of what was going on.  What I was looking for, firstly, was to take my family and myself to a secure area.  It was something difficult to do, because, from Kigali to Nyanza, we spent about eight hours.  It was difficult to have to bribe and so on and so forth.  And even after Butare, and to be able to go to Kabuye, I don't know what happened.  It was difficult; the roadblocks -- the gates, it was not easy.  But, thank God, we went through them. 

Now, with regard to trips I made towards Ruhengeri, everybody knows that it was -- it was a -- it was a zone Turquoise you could go through, but it was at my own risk.  And I told myself I needed to know what was happening on my campus.  I mean, I was cut away from everything.  I needed to go there and see what was happening to pay the salaries of staff.  That's it.

And, Prosecutor, I would like to tell you that once I was there, when I learnt that people had died on the campus, I lodged a complaint on behalf of the campus.  I did that.  And I would like to know the amount of people who lodged a legal complaint during that time against what happened.  I did those at -- I took risks, and I did that because I needed to know what was happening on my campus, from which I was completely cut off.  Some may say it was madness, but it was my sense of duty that was guiding me.  
Q.	You went to Butare university on the 22nd of April.  That was at a time when the killings had started in Butare, four days after the infamous by President Sindikuwabo in which the president had said, "Let those who are not concerned with these events stand aside and let others work."

So what were you doing at the university of Butare, Mr. Witness, on the 22nd of April of 1994?  
A.	All I did in Butare on the 22nd of April was to try to look for petrol, to continue -- carry on my journey to Butare -- Kibuye. 
Q.	And you were given petrol, weren't you?  
A.	Sorry, I didn't get your question.  
Q.	You were given petrol, weren't you?  A very precious commodity at that time.  
A.	I was lent petrol.  I had -- I would like to tell you, Madam (sic), that at the time I had gone to ask for petrol and I didn't get it.  But, fortunately, I remembered that my campus -- our campuses had petrol stations.  I went and borrowed from the Butare campus petrol, which I had to refund later on, on behalf -- on the account of the university.  
Q.	They gave you free petrol, and the idea was you might pay them back later; is that it?  Is that what you mean by "borrow petrol," free petrol, pay later?  
A.	That was going to be paid back by the campus, yes, indeed. 
(Pages 54 to 65 by Lisa Smith)

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Not going to be paid back by you, but by the campus.  Free petrol for you because you are a bigwig, isn't that right?  
A.	Because I was the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) of the campus of Ruhengeri. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, redact his office once more.  

Please pay attention, if you can.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	With a war going on, the RPF having invaded from the north, Ruhengeri being in the north, off you went to Ruhengeri on the 19th of May to do ******************************************************************were you not, in an official capacity?  It's right, isn't it?  
A.	That was the first time I was taking risks on behalf of my campus that I had to evacuate twice.  And it is a campus that I loved; and the people there, I loved them.  I was ready to do everything to know what was going on on it.  I was doing my duty as the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript was extracted and kept under separate cover) of the campus -- sorry -- I was doing my duty.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I don't need to repeat this every time, but I think I make a standard order that his office should not be in the final record.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You, Mr. Witness, from 1996 have been on a list issued by the Rwandan government of suspected génocidaires.  You aware of that?  
A.	I am not aware of that.  I know that there have been so many lists in circulation, I am not aware of my name being on that list.  The only list I am aware of is the last one, which came out this year.  There have been so many lists, but I am not aware of that particular list you are referring to. 
Q.	All right.  That's helpful.  You're aware of a list which names you as a génocidaire which came out last year.  I suggest you were also on a list as early as 1996.  Which shows some consistency, 1996 to 2007, on the part of the Rwandan government in suggesting that you are a génocidaire.  If we look, please, at the bundle --
MR. MORLEY:
Page 3 for Your Honours' assistance, and page 4.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And for your assistance, Mr. Witness, pages 3 and 4.  I hope you will be helped there by reference to the publication of a list in the first category dated the 25th of November of 1996 in the hand of the prosecutor general of the supreme court of Rwanda.  And we see your name on that list on page 4.  And I'm going to count up from the bottom, so that I don't refer to your number, by which you would be identified, for it is a public document.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.  

Do we see your name, 1996, as a person listed in the first category, which is not a good thing?  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, let me inform you that I am innocent.  It is up to those who drew up that list to prove the accusations.  The phenomenon of lists is well known.  I do not think it facilitates, in any manner whatsoever, reconciliation among Rwandans. 
Q.	And if we have a look at your immigration file --
MR. MORLEY:
Page 34 of the bundle for Your Honours.  And Your Honours will be then sliding the page sideways.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And for the witness, page 34, and slide the page sideways.  As part of the examination of your status in the country where you presently reside, one of the documents that was under consideration was another list of suspected génocidaires, and you are named number three from the top on the left-hand side.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	Let me put a question to you, Prosecutor:  Am I on trial today, or am I here to testify?  
Q.	Do you consider it a matter of no importance whether you are on a list consistently between 1996 and 2007 from the Rwandan government as a suspected génocidaire? 
MR. NIMY:
(No interpretation)
THE WITNESS:
It is quite obvious that the Prosecutor wants me -- wants to lead me down a slippery path, but I will not fall in his trap.  

Let me just point out to him that I am innocent.  Those who drew up the lists are the ones concerned about it.  But I, for one, have a clear conscience.  
MR. NIMY: 
Court's indulgence, Mr. President.  I am concerned about a problem since my learned friend of the Prosecution is using this document to mislead the witness.  Mr. President, this is my problem -- and perhaps when we go to the merits we will raise this issue again, but I want to broach it now.  

I am still wondering whether from a legal standpoint, first of all, is the Prosecutor entitled to use a list drawn up by members of the RPF, the belligerents and the co-belligerents of yesterday?  They have drawn up a list against those who lost the war and who had been the adversaries of the RPF and which lost the war of 1994.  

From a legal standpoint, what credibility can we lend to a document established by those who won the war against the losers? 

Secondly, Mr. President, from a moral standpoint is it acceptable that the RPF, which today is referred to as the Rwandan government -- it doesn't matter, that is only a name.  But what matters is that the RPF was a belligerent, and they also killed people, and they have never been tried for this.  

Mr. President, I believe this Court is a respectable international judicial body.  We cannot treat these documents as if we were journalists.  We cannot confront the witness with a document drawn up by the co-belligerents.  Even if they have not been tried, for reasons of political expediency, I understand that Prosecutor has come up with a list drawn up by organisations or neutral persons who are neither members of the RPF nor of the MRND.  But for the Prosecutor to proceed in this manner poses both a moral and legal problem.  

I do not know whether Mr. Morley can answer this question, because I believe it is fundamental.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Short answer might be this:  Can I use the document?  Respectfully, yes.  What weight is attached to it is a matter for Your Honours.  

May I move on, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We accept Mr. Morley's response.  

Mr. Morley, I just draw your attention now to the time, as well. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	In your statement of 2007, on page 16 of the bundle, there is reference to your being made aware that six people had been killed at the Ruhengeri campus.  And we see that in the second paragraph, two-thirds of the way into the second paragraph, where it refers to how Alphonse Murego warned you that six people had been killed. 

So you're aware of six deaths, at least, at the Ruhengeri campus.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	I got to know about that when I arrived there.  And let me inform you, Counsel for the Prosecution, that among those killed was the wife of my cousin, which means that I also lost family members among those who died on the campus.  And these were members of my -- I also lost members of my family.  

So, Counsel for the Prosecution, this is something I am talking about with a lot of distress, because I lost family members on the campus.  And I got to know about that when I got to the campus.  And even till date I am not yet able to recover from that loss.  
Q.	Who was Alphonse Bankeka, B-A-N-K-E-K-A?  Was he the university administrator in Ruhengeri?  
A.	Alphonse Bankeka -- beg your pardon?  Could you please repeat the question?
Q.	Who was Alphonse Bankeka?  Was he the university administrator in Ruhengeri?  
A.	Bankeka was an administrator on the Ruhengeri university campus.  He was deputy administrator of the Ruhengeri university campus.  
Q.	Did you ever know a soldier by the name of Bivugabagabo?  B-I-V-U-G-A-B-A-G-A-B-O, Bivugabagabo.  
A.	I believe Bivugabagabo was the commander of the Ruhengeri soldiers, but that is someone I have not met since April 1994.  
Q.	Did you know a nightwatchman by the name of Mbonyimana, M-B-O-N-Y-I-M-A-N-A?  
A.	Absolutely not.  
Q.	Would you expect your nightwatchman at the university campus to know who you are?  
A.	It is to that person that you should put your question.  But whatever the case, I could not have known the over 200 persons working on the campus at the time.  
MR. MORLEY:
I would ask, please, for five minutes that we go into closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
For the benefit of the public, we've made a protection order for this witness for security reasons.  And one of the elements is that his identity should be concealed from the public.  The questions about to be put to him now may elicit answers which could reveal his identity, and we go into closed session for that reason now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 70 to 76] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
