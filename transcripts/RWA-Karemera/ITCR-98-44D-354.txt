MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
And Mr. Webster will continue his cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning to the Court, to the parties.
ANDRÉ NZABANTERURA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
Q.	And to you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday we left off talking about the Presidential Guards.  I'd still like to ask you questions about them, but I'm going move on to something else now, and then if we have time I'll come back to it towards the end of my examination.  

Now, recalling your testimony from yesterday, you told us a bit about an MRND rally in Gisenyi, and I believe you -- 
A.	I remember that, and I confirm that that rally took place. 
Q.	Yes.  And the rally came to mind for you because it occurred a few months after the MRND meeting in Kimihurura on democracy day, which I believe we agreed was on the 28th of January 1993.  That also is correct; right? 
A.	Yes, you're quite right, but I remember that rally very well, the one which took place in Gisenyi, because I myself attended it. 
Q.	And your estimation of it having occurred in March of 1993 is because you know it was after the RPF offensive of February 1993; is that so? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Did we get the translation? 
A.	I explained quite well that I attended that rally and I also explained that I was among those who attended that meeting and who had to find vehicles to take people there.  It is not -- that is because -- that is the reason why I remembered that meeting. 
Q.	All right, thank you for that clarification, Mr. Witness, I'm just trying to situate the event in time.  We can agree that you recall the period of March 1993, because you know it came after the RPF offensive of February 1993; can you agree with that much? 
A.	It's possible.  There was an attack launched in 1993.  I don't remember the exact month, but I know that that rally took place in March, just after that attack or offensive.  But let me inform you that the attack launched by the RPF did not take place in the same area or venue at which the MRND rally took place. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  So we can also agree that this rally in Gisenyi took place before the July 1993 MRND party congress? 
A.	I agree with you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  That rally took place before the MRND party congress and, at the time, Rusirare was still a member of the MRND. 
Q.	Would you characterise this rally as one of the larger -- or, amongst the largest of the MRND rallies that was held in 1993? 
A.	I wouldn't say that this rally had many attendees, because there had been many other rallies held before.  The largest of the rallies of the MRND is the one that took place at the Remera stadium.  The Gisenyi rally was a normal rally.  
Q.	But you would still agree that MRND party members travelled to this rally in Gisenyi from all across the country; right? 
A.	No, I don't agree with you there.  It was members of the MRND who were natives of Kigali decided to associate themselves with the MRND members in Gisenyi.  It was the youth of the MRND party which took that decision to go to Gisenyi to support the MRND members there.  So it's not all members of the MRND throughout the country who went to Gisenyi to attend that rally. 
Q.	This was a rally held at the Umuganda stadium in Gisenyi? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And do you recall if Banzi Wellars spoke at that rally?  You know who Banzi Wellars is, don't you? 
A.	I don't know Wellars, Banzi.  I just have heard mention made of him. 
Q.	Do you know if he addressed that rally in Gisenyi that you attended? 
A.	As I explained yesterday, I arrived late at that rally because I had initially passed by the ONATRACOM offices to pay for the fares of the MRND members who were travelling to Gisenyi.  When I arrived, most of the speakers had almost finished speaking, so I cannot tell you who spoke during that rally given the fact that I arrived there late. 
Q.	Even though you made arrangements for an ONATRACOM bus, one of the government buses to take people from Kigali, you yourself travelled in a separate vehicle; right? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  I went to Gisenyi in my own vehicle.  When I reached Gisenyi, the speakers had already done their part.  When I arrived in Gisenyi, I had to ensure that the MRND members from Kigali had reached Gisenyi safely, and after the rally I had to ensure that they had transport to take them back to Kigali. 
Q.	Can you describe the vehicle that you travelled in, please? 
A.	I left in my own vehicle, which was a double-cabin pickup truck.  It was not a vehicle that I had rented or borrowed from someone else.  It was my own vehicle.  
Q.	This would be a double-cabin Hilux vehicle?  H-I-L-U-X.  
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	There is testimony in this trial from another witness that is identified on our record as HH.  And according to that evidence, you travelled to the rally in Gisenyi in that double-cabin Hilux vehicle along with a certain Joseph Setiba; is that your recollection? 
A.	No, that's not true.  I wasn't with Joseph Setiba, Setiba left with a woman known as Bemeriki, together with other young Interahamwe from Kimihurura.  They were also going to attend that rally.  So, I'm confirming that I did not go together with Setiba. 
Q.	In any case, when you think back to 1993 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Microphone, please, Counsel. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	-- would you suggest that this was the only large MRND rally in Gisenyi or do you know of others that took place in 1993 at the Umuganda stadium in Gisenyi? 
A.	Truly speaking, this was the only rally that I attended and which took place in Gisenyi.  This rally brought together members of the MRND who hailed from Gisenyi and others from Kigali.  If there were other MRND members who hailed from other areas of the country who also attended that meeting, I wouldn't be able to tell you because I arrived there late. 
Q.	Okay, thank you, Mr. Witness.  What I'm trying to find out is if you know of any other MRND rallies that took place in Gisenyi that year or was this the only one? 
A.	I don't know anything about that.  Maybe there were other rallies that were held in Gisenyi but -- held at the préfecture level of Gisenyi alone.  But this is the only meeting or rally that I attended.  That's why I'm speaking about it alone. 
Q.	Was Joseph -- excuse me.  Was Mathieu Ngirumpatse the chairman or the master of ceremonies for this rally?  I know you told us that it was under way and almost finished by the time you got there, but do you know if Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Nzirorera were present? 
A.	I have just told you that I did not follow the line-up of speakers at that rally because I arrived late.  And I have repeated this many times.  
Q.	And I heard it many times, Mr. Witness.  But my question to you remains:  Do you know if Ngirumpatse was there or not? 
A.	I'm not sure since I arrived late and my only concern was to be sure that those who had left Kigali were all to return there safely after that rally because I was responsible for them.  So that was my only concern. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  

You know who Théoneste Bagosora is, don't you? 
A.	I have heard people talk about him.  It was said that he was a soldier.  I also heard it said that he has been accused by this Tribunal, but I don't know him personally. 
Q.	So you don't know whether or not he was present at that rally in Gisenyi? 
A.	I don't know and I didn't hear anyone say that he was present at that rally which was held in Gisenyi. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  

Now, you described this rally a few moments ago as gathering the young people, or the MRND youth together.  I believe you suggested it was the initiative of the young people or the youth wing to go to that rally.  Am I understanding you correctly or do you want to clarify that? 
A.	I wouldn't say that it was only the Interahamwe who had decided to attend that meeting.  There were all the youths belonging to the MRND party.  And when Rusira got to know about the initiative taken by the youths and all the other members of the MRND, he decided to rent an ONATRACOM bus in order to transport all those who had decided to go to Gisenyi to support members of the MRND who were natives of Gisenyi.  Those who went to Gisenyi were supposed to sing and dance as well.  Unfortunately, they arrived late so they were unable to make their presentation.  
Q.	To the best of your ability, can you give us an estimate of the number of Interahamwe that were present at the Umuganda -- Umuganda stadium for that rally?  To the best of your ability, just a rough number? 
A.	It's very difficult for me to distinguish the Interahamwe from the other members of the MRND.  All I would say to you is that there was a large member of participants who had agreed to attend that meeting.  
Q.	Well, based on your experience, how many Interahamwe do you think there were in Kigali by the time you were attending that meeting? 
A.	I don't have the figures in mind.  Some areas of Kigali did not have Interahamwe.  But, if you are talking about Kigali town, I would say there would be between 200 and 300 Interahamwe. 
Q.	And if you're able to, can you give us your sense of how many Interahamwe there were nationwide, just based on your attendance at the various MRND rallies, going to meetings, hearing discussions? 
A.	The national Interahamwe office had carried out statistics of the Interahamwe and had found out that some préfectures did not have Interahamwe.  In all, throughout the country there was a maximum of 750 Interahamwe. 
Q.	Why do you say a maximum of 750?  I'm not challenging you, I am just trying to understand why -- how you come to the figure of 750 nation wide? 
A.	I'm basing myself on the statistics from Gisenyi and Kigali towns because the authorities had -- the two places had produced figures.  In Kibuye, Gikongoro there were no Interahamwe, and in other areas of the country there were very few Interahamwe.  And the statistics that we had produced showed that there was a maximum of 750 Interahamwe nationwide. 
Q.	And this is as of when?  1992, 1993 or 1994?  Give us some sense of the time that you are referring to? 
A.	Yes.  That figure of 750 corresponds to the period from 1992 to 1994, but we reached that figure of 750 in 1994.  That was the official figure of the number of Interahamwe in existence. 
Q.	You told us yesterday that the meeting -- or, the first meetings you attended of the Interahamwe were chaired by Robert Kajuga, who I understand was the president of the Interahamwe at the national level; right? 
A.	Yes, it's true.  Kajuga was the chairman of the Interahamwe at national level. 
Q.	Do you think Kajuga would have a stronger basis to estimate the numbers of the Interahamwe than you do? 
A.	I don't think that Kajuga gave a different estimate than the one I gave.  And the estimate I gave you emanates from the presidency or the chairmanship of the Interahamwe, and it is the presidency or chairmanship of the Interahamwe which gave us that figure of the number of Interahamwe present throughout the country. 
Q.	So your suggestion is that your information was coming from Kajuga himself; is that what I should understand? 
A.	Yes, it was Kajuga, the national chairman of the Interahamwe, who told us we had reached that figure of 750. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, let me read something to you and get your reaction.  And here I am referring to a document that was circulated yesterday in my bundle.  It's not in the large stapled pack. 

It is one of the single documents and on the top it has a notation "D. NZ16D". It's actually A and D. It's already in evidence.  It was put in evidence by the Nzirorera team -- some years ago.  It is a memo dated the 17th of March 1994 from a member of UNAMIR who was in direct contact with Robert Kajuga.  And the relevant portion, for our purposes, are the very first few sentences of the first paragraph, where Marc Nees who was an intelligence officer with the Belgian contingent of UNAMIR says as follows: "Yesterday, I spoke to the leader of Interahamwe Robert Jerry Kajuga.  The president of the youth memberships is more powerful than a minister.  Supported by the president's regime, he can immediately mobilise 3,000 trained militants in Kigali, and throughout Rwanda he commands an estimated 10,000 military-style supporters."

He goes on.  It is a lengthy paragraph.  But that is the portion that concerns us, Mr. Witness.  

Do you have any reaction to what I've just read to you, which is purported to be information given to UNAMIR by Kajuga on the 17th of March 1994?  
A.	Thank you.  My reactions are as follows:  I will not accept these figures put forward by this officer of the UNAMIR.  I rely on figures that I received from the directorate of the Interahamwe.  And besides, it was during the rally that this kind of information was given to us.  And Kajuga gave us the figure of 750.

Now, regarding the information that you received, it is something that I cannot confirm because I was not present when that information was given.  If these were figures which are put out for political reasons, I wouldn't know.  And I cannot agree with those figures because I received different figures from somebody who was a leader of the Interahamwe at the national level. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  

Limiting yourself to your experience in Kigali after the 6th of April 1994, would you be able to estimate how many militiamen were characterised as Interahamwe, if you're able?  Yesterday, you told us that after April 1994 -- or, after the 6th of April, that anyone who was armed on the roadblocks was called an Interahamwe.  So, if you think in those terms, would you be able to suggest a global number for Kigali while you were present in Kigali between April and July 1994? 
A.	Thank you.  Yesterday, I explained this extensively.  I said that following the shooting down of the presidential plane, young persons from all parties were referred to as Interahamwe.  And all these young persons established roadblocks in their neighbourhoods.  I'm, therefore, not in a position to give you an estimate of the Interahamwe, because following the downing of the presidential plane all the young persons were regarded -- were considered as Interahamwe.  So, I cannot give you an estimate.  All the young persons were referred to as Interahamwe because they had a common objective.  All the youth groups became Interahamwes. 
Q.	All right, thank you for your response.  

Now, yesterday, you also told us about members of the Interahamwe group being criticised publicly at various rallies if they misbehaved.  Were you ever personally criticised or held to account by the MRND party or its leaders for any of your activities on behalf of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Listen, nobody is infallible.  When the young Interahamwe from Kimihurura were misbehaving, I was carrying out an investigation. 
Q.	Just stop one second.  Mr. Witness, my question is very specific:  I'm asking if you personally were ever criticised.  So, could you answer that question?  We'll get to your elaboration on the answer after you have answered the specific question that I've asked you.  Were you ever personally criticised for your activities on behalf of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No, nobody openly criticised me; nobody ever summoned me to explain any conduct of mine.  
Q.	And you had no direct contact with Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Joseph Nzirorera relating to your behaviour as an Interahamwe while they were the national secretaries of the party; is that your testimony?
A.	Be it the administrative bodies of the country or the leadership of the Interahamwe, nobody ever summoned me to talk to me about my conduct. 
Q.	And did you ever receive any information or message from the president of the republic, President Habyarimana, concerning your activities on behalf of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No, I did not receive a message from the president of the republic.  And no one -- no national authority -- ever sent me such a message. 
Q.	And when you say "national authority", would you include the prime minister or the minister of interior as well?  Is it your testimony that neither the prime minister nor the minister of the interior ever communicated to you directly or indirectly about your behaviour as an Interahamwe? 
A.	Some of these authorities you are referring to don't even know me.  Let me just say that the peace officers in my administrative region never summoned me to speak to me as an Interahamwe. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

I'd like us to have a look at another document that I described yesterday.  This also was not part of the largest group or bundle.  It is a separate document.  And it is already in evidence as D. NG5; D. NG005.  This is a report on the behaviour of youth groups of the political parties in Kacyiru, Kicukiro, Nyarugenge and Kanombe communes.  

And it was authored -- it was signed on 16th of December 1992 by three individuals.  And if we look at the first page of this report, and I have provided excerpts -- or, relevant excerpts in French and in English.  If you thumb through the document you will see a corresponding text in French.  The last three pages are French; and the first three are English.  But in paragraph 1, the authors of the document explain that the minister of interior and communal development set up a commission to conduct a study on the behaviour of youth groups of the political parties.  

If we move to paragraph 3, the aims of the -- of the mission were to note the acts of insecurity since the 1st November 1992 and to establish the part of those to be blamed.  

And if we move to paragraph 4, this commission indicates that on the 4th of December 1992, they conducted investigations in Kacyiru commune and Kicukiro communes.  And then they start to detail the results of their investigation.  

And if we follow through under paragraph -- under ii, subparagraph A, which is on the second page of the English text, and it is actually on page 2 of the French text as well, in relation to Rugando cellule, Kimihurura secteur, they report as follows: "In this area the conflicts were often between the Interahamwe led by Nzabanterura, a native of Byumba  préfecture, and the JDR led by Gatabazi.  

Moving on, the report details: "At the time of the conflicts, Gatabazi's group called on Cyimicanga's group as reinforcement while Nzabanterura's group gets support from the Nyakabanda group.  The Interahamwe had superiority over the other group and took advantage to organise night patrols which were accompanied by several abuses including in particular vandalism, demands for identity papers of the parties."  And it continues.  

In any case, this is a rather lengthy report but you are mentioned in at least three different portions of the report, Mr. Witness.  

When we get towards the end of the report there's a recapitulation and again you're mentioned on page 6 of the English text -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, the reporters are requiring you to slow -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Slow down? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
In any case, for the record I've been reading from D. NG5. 

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, these allegations were never brought to your attention? 
A.	Thank you.  Nobody informed me about what is contained in that report, but after hearing what you have just said, I must say that this is the first time I'm ever hearing it.  I think those who wrote this report they did that for political reasons.  Regarding the incident with the MDR youth wing, the JDR youth wing wanted to remove the MRND flag.  We did not fight them. 
Q.	I appreciate your concern, Mr. Witness.  I'm not trying to get into the substance of the allegations.  My concern is whether these allegations were brought to your attention.  And I think you've answered the question.  

You would agree with me that the minister of interior in 1992, when this report was written, was a member of the MRND; wasn't he? 
A.	Yes, the minister was a member of the MRND. 
Q.	Wouldn't it have been expected that the MRND minister of interior would bring allegations of this nature to the attention of the party? 
A.	I was never told.  And my superiors may not have heard that this report existed because they never mentioned it to me. 
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Joseph Kavaruganda? 
A.	I know him by name, but I've never met him. 
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse ever speak to you or indirectly communicate with you through other persons about complaints that Kavaruganda had made about you personally? 
A.	No.  
Q.	And you never received any information from anyone within the MRND party about complaints against you made by Kavaruganda? 
A.	No, I never got such information.  And if that incident had taken place they would have told me or I would have been charged; an action would have been brought against me in court. 
Q.	We can agree that Kavaruganda was a fairly important person in Rwanda in 1994, can't we? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	This was the president of the court of cassation? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And he was viewed with contempt by the MRND party, would you agree? 
A.	I wouldn't know that.  We, members of the MRND, considered him an ordinary neutral Rwandan.  He was just like anyone else. 
Q.	You didn't view him as an enemy of the party? 
A.	No. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, I'd like to share with you some comments that Mr. Kavaruganda put in writing and addressed to the president of the republic.  And here I'd refer us to a document in my bundle; it is document B in the stapled packet I provided yesterday.  And it is available to us in English and in French.  

This is a letter dated the 23rd March 1994, written to his excellency, the president of the republic, signed by Joseph Kavaruganda.  He identifies himself as the president of the court of cassation.  The paragraphs are numbered in his text and he starts off by telling the president that he has been receiving a number of incessant threats from members of the presidency staff.  

And at paragraph 1, he talks about an incident on the 19th March 1994, when Pascal Simbikangwa, who was close to the presidency -- or, working in the presidency, approached members of his staff and insulted them and told them that they were protecting an Inyenzi, and that Kavaruganda's days were numbered, and that the group that was to do the job had already been formed.

And then when we continue.  He enumerates several threats.  But at his paragraph 5, on the second page of this letter, he writes to the president as follows: "You will recall my complaint about the Interahamwe chief, for Rugendo, (inaudible) Nzabanterura.  I filed a complaint with both Mathieu Ngirumpatse, MRND chairman, and you, on the 15th of January 1994.  Since then, things have been calm.  I am grateful for what you have done in that regard."

So my question to you again, Mr. Witness, is:  Did you personally threaten Kavaruganda sometime in January 1994? 
A.	No, I never met him.  He held a very high position in relation to myself, and I have no opinion of him.  
Q.	Would you have any idea why he would single you out personally and mention you by name and identify you as the Interahamwe chief in Rugendo? 
A.	I'm not sure about what you are saying.  Maybe there's somebody who was a member of the opposition party, who wanted to attack me and I was an Interahamwe not living far from his house.  But I was never informed about his complaints about my activities.  

Nobody reprimanded me about this incident.  I'm hearing -- I'm getting to know about the existence of this document in this courtroom. 
Q.	How far away from you did he live?  You said he lived not far from you.  Give us some idea.  
A.	From my house to his house there is a military camp and his house is 300 metres away from the military camp.  If you take the width of the military camp and then you add the distance between his house and the military camp then you can say there are about 600 metres between our two houses.  So, there is the presidential -- the camp of the Presidential Guard between our two houses. 
Q.	In any case, he seems to think that his complaints to the president of the republic and to the chairman of the MRND party yielded results because the threats stopped after his complaints.  Is it still your position that no one in the MRND party reprimanded you or spoke to you about these allegations? 
A.	No authority from the MRND or from the -- or any other authority in charge of maintaining peace ever gave this information to me. 
Q.	Well, yesterday when you were telling us about Interahamwe who were criticised for their bad behaviour, what types of allegations were made against these Interahamwe who were criticised?  If you could give us an example, because the two examples that I've just given you seem fairly serious to me: The first from 1992, when a report was submitted to the minister of interior that specifically named you.  And here, a letter from the president of this court of cassation which specifically names you; give us an example of the type of behaviour that was criticised in the MRND, if not these two incidents? 
A.	I can mention the example of an Interahamwe from my Rugando group who had a violent exchange with members of the opposition.  And since this Interahamwe wanted to bring discord, we punished him and banished him from rallies for three months.  

If anyone conducted himself in a more serious manner, there were bodies in charge of order and who would punish him.  Each time there was a problem within the party we took measures, and when it was something more serious we would bring in the peace officers.  And we've never had any conflict with the peace officers regarding such incidents. 
Q.	And is it your suggestion that the -- in the example you just described of an Interahamwe arguing with a member of the opposition, was more deserving of criticism than these allegations against you personally for threatening the president of the court of cassation or for acts of vandalism in December of 1992? 
A.	I think you are referring to a document.  They must have conducted an investigation before writing that document.  But they never contacted me for my opinion before writing that document.  It means that a committee was set up to conduct investigations to verify these allegations.  And since that committee did not contact me, it means that information contained in the document is not valid.  Otherwise, they would have heard me personally.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response. 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Your Honour, I'd request that the letter from Kavaruganda be admitted in evidence, both the English and -- the French and the English translation.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Mr. President, I'm wondering about the relevance of this document which our learned colleague wants to have tendered into evidence.  It is indeed a letter that Mr. Kavaruganda is writing to the president of the republic, and the witness has explained that he was unaware of any such complaints.  And that at any rate, he was never punished or reprimanded for these allegations contained in this correspondence.  

So, I'm wondering what is the relevance, and I'm wondering whether this document should, in fact, be admitted given the answer the witness has just given.  It does not appear to me that this document is of relevance.  
(Pages 1 to 12 by Eleanor Bastian)
































1000H 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, just that its relevance is for the very reasons that Madam Hounkpatin thinks that it's not pertinent.  The witness is not only saying that he was not punished, the witness said he was not even approached with these allegations.  And the content of the letter suggests that Mr. Kavaruganda thought that his complaint yielded results.  So the letter does impeach this witness's credibility and if it doesn't do that or that's not sufficient, that certainly brings into question the internal means of governing the Interahamwe youth wing of the MRND party leaders.  On that basis it should be admitted and the Chamber can give it whatever weight it thinks is appropriate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we agree that it's relevant and we admit it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa, if you can collect my two copies then. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Now moving --  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 537.  Five-three-seven A for French, B for English.  Thank you, Your Honour.
(Exhibit P. 537A and P. 537B admitted)  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	I am moving on to something else now, Mr. Witness.  So actually, let me ask you one last question.  Did you learn what had happened -- what happened to Kavaruganda after the 6th of April?  
A. 	(No interpretation)
Q.	I did not hear the translation.  Is your microphone on, Mr. Witness?  I will repeat the question.  

Did you learn what happened to Kavaruganda after the 6th of April? 
A.	After the 6th of April I got to learn that Kavaruganda was killed during the massacres, following the downing of the plane belonging to the head of state.  After that, the United Nations qualified those killings as genocide. 
Q.	Kavaruganda was Hutu, wasn't he?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And he was killed by Presidential Guards?
A.	The information I have in my possession confirms that he was Hutu? 
Q.	And why was he killed on the morning of the 7th of April by Presidential Guards.  Didn't you come to learn of that as well? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	So he wasn't killed in the massacres that you characterised as genocide, he was assassinated as one of the political opponents to President Habyarimana -- like some of the other victims you described yesterday -- by Presidential Guards, FAR soldiers.  

Are you waiting for a question from me, Mr. Witness, or have you received the translation? 
A.	Yes, I did, indeed, understand your question.  Kavaruganda was, in fact, killed by members of the Presidential Guard as I indicated yesterday, during the killings that took place after the 
	president's plane was downed.  As I stated yesterday, members of the Presidential Guard killed local inhabitants for various reasons.  Some inhabitants were killed because they had differences with some members of the Presidential Guard.  And Kavaruganda was killed in that context of killings that took place after the president's plane was brought down.  And as I have just said, these killings were qualified by the 
	United Nations Organisation as genocide. 
Q.	All right. Thank you very much.  Moving on to something a bit different now.  The Interahamwe leadership in Kigali, the national leaders, did not abandon the capital, Kigali, in the same way that the political leaders did; would you agree? 
A.	They also left Kigali.  The young Interahamwe also left Kigali.  And I don't see who would come and confirm that this committee did not leave Kigali after President Habyarimana's plane was brought down.  Everyone was doing their best to leave Kigali after the departure of the government from Kigali for it to go to Gitarama.  The local inhabitants were leaving their areas of residence in order to go and seek refuge in areas where there was no fighting. 
Q.	But didn't these national Interahamwe leaders come back and forth?  My suggestion to you is that they didn't abandon the capital completely, the way that the government had left Kigali definitively. These national Interahamwe leaders travelled around the country but when they came back they would come back to Kigali and some of them remained in Kigali; would you accept that suggestion? 
A.	I can neither confirm nor deny your suggestion.  Personally, I was in an area where there was fighting and I do not know what was happening outside of my cellule, given that I was not an eyewitness to what was happening beyond my cellule.  I know that the Interahamwe officials, after having learnt that members of her family were killed -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I am sorry, Mr. President, I am afraid, I did not quite understand my colleague in the Kinyarwanda booth.  
THE WITNESS: 
-- I remained in my cellule where soldiers were present. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
I missed part of that answer, Mr. President, I may confirm.  Because I did not -- I failed to understand the particular sentence in the answer from Kigali -- Kinyarwanda booth. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe I can help out by simply repeating.  I believe the witness stated that he remained in his neighbourhood -- his secteur -- and he saw soldiers.  So he could neither deny nor confirm my suggestion.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And if so, that's inaccurate, Mr. Witness, you can tell us.  But I think that's the substance of what you just said.  Right? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  I remained in my cellule and in that area there were soldiers. 
Q.	Well, didn't these national Interahamwe leaders travel around, and speak to persons at your level, either by communicating with you directly, by coming to see you or by addressing you over the radio, addressing the nation, the population, by speaking to them directly over Radio Rwanda or RTLM? 
A.	I don't know anything about that.  And if the Interahamwe leaders at national level addressed some members of the population, I am unaware.  As far as I am concerned, no member of the Interahamwe at national level ever came to contact me in my own cellule. 
Q.	And you didn't listen to Radio Rwanda or RTLM during April, May or June 1994? 
A.	Since there was fighting in my area; one couldn't even turn on one's radio. And the soldiers had stopped us from turning on our radios because that might disturb their own security operations.  The soldiers in our area were at the front and they were fighting against the enemy.  And so when they issued instructions to us, we followed them to the letter. 
Q.	And your suggestion is that you were instructed not even to turn on your radio because that would interrupt their battle plan, that's your evidence? 
A.	I would like to tell you that we didn't even have electricity, and all the shops were closed.  One couldn't even buy batteries to use in our radios.  And as I have said, the soldiers prevented us from turning on our radios.  And they had asked the local inhabitants of our area not to light fires, so that people outside could see the smoke, so that they might become aware that there were people living there. 
Q.	All right, we have your response on record.  What contact did you have with Robert Kajuga, 
	Dieu Donné Niyitegeka, or Bernard Maniragaba in May or June of 1994? 
A.	I didn't have any contact with those you just mentioned.  I know that Kajuga was in Butare where he had gone to get treatment.  I can't tell you where Maniragaba was because I was living in Kimihurura and he lived in Gitega and I didn't have any particular relationship with these people. 
Q.	Well, I would like to direct your attention to another document in my bundle.  It's in the stapled package.  And I am referring to document J as I have numbered it or indicated in the lower right-hand corner.  It's towards the very end of the bundle.  It's probably two or three documents from the back.  And this is a document that's already in evidence as DNZ 39.  And it's a communiqué that was read over 
	Radio Rwanda around the 20th or shortly before the 20th June 1994.  We have it in the original Kinyarwanda, and in French translation.  We don't have an English translation but I would suggest that the Chamber is familiar with this document because we have referred to it several times before.  And for your benefit, Mr. Witness, I will hand up the Kinyarwanda text if that may assist you. 

MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could give this to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER.
Q.	I am going to summarise the contents.  You don't have to necessarily read it, but since we do have it in Kinyarwanda I think it's fair that you should be able to refer to it.  But reading from the French which is at the very bottom of the second page on this document, the journalist is talking about a meeting of Interahamwe leaders, and he goes on by saying as follows, and I will read the French text in French: "They decided that the Interahamwe of the Kigali-Ville préfecture and those of rural Kigali, who were in the other préfectures must go back to their secteurs of origin by the 20th of June 1994, at the latest, in order to receive new instructions.  They were requested to bring with them any equipment they had received.  

"The meeting noted that there were MRND Interahamwe who were honest, and who behaved very well at the front by supporting the Rwandan Armed Forces up until now, and have used the same occasion to thank them, particularly by asking them to remain courageous and full of zero as usual."  

	This communiqué was signed by the chairman of the Interahamwe at the national level, 
	Mr. Robert Kajuga, the first vice president of Kigali town; André Nzabaterura, the chairman of the Interahamwe in Kacyiru commune; Tharcisse Nzabandora, and national treasury; 
	Dieu Donné Niyitegeka; as well as, the chairman of the Interahamwe in Kigali-Rural, Joseph Setiba? 

.	So, Mr. Witness, you were named as a signatory on this communiqué that was read over RTLM some time before the 20th June 1994.  Is there anything you would like to tell us about it? 
A.	Thank you.  I have just seen this document and, in my view, this is propaganda material from a journalist.  I could not have attended any meetings since I was in a combat zone.  After the 6th of April 
I did not leave my cellule.  And what you have just read is mere propaganda by a journalist.  If such a meeting had taken place, maybe my name was included because I was responsible for the Interahamwe in my cellule.  However, I confirm that I never attended any such meeting. 
Q.	Well, are you suggesting that the journalists of RTLM were spreading propaganda against the Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't even know the name of that journalist.  Who is he?  
Q.	I don't think the name of a particular journalist is at issue.  I am asking if you think journalists, plural, generic, of the RTLM radio station were spreading propaganda that was critical of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I cannot tell you the objective of that journalist and he could carry out negative campaign against the Interahamwe because there were people who wanted to sally the image of the Interahamwe.  I have told you that I began to leave my cellule towards the end of April when I wanted to provide myself with foodstuffs, and I would return immediately back to my cellule in Kimihurura. 
Q.	Well, what about Joseph Setiba, is it your evidence that you had no contact with him in June of 1994? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, is this another issue (inaudible)?
MR. WEBSTER: 
I am just finishing up on the same exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Same matter.
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Setiba is the last name (microphone overlapping) 
A.	I met Setiba in June and even in July.  So I can confirm that towards the end of June and the beginning of July, I met Setiba.  In fact, we began to prepare our retreat from Kigali. 
Q.	And the other persons whose names appear on this communiqué, Kajuga and Niyitegeka, didn't you meet with them, in June or July or have any contact with them? 
A.	In June when I met Setiba who suggested that we go and visit Kajuga who was hospitalised in Butare, we went, therefore, to meet Kajuga only to visit him.  We spent the night in Butare and the following day we came back to Kigali. 
Q.	Well, why did you tell us five minutes ago that you didn't have any contact with these folks but now you are telling us the opposite?  You went with Setiba to visit Kajuga in Butare around the same time? 
A.	I told you that later that between the 6th of April and June I didn't meet any of the Interahamwe leaders.  It was in June when I was going to fetch foodstuffs at Gitikinyoni that Setiba asked me to accompany him to go and visit Kajuga.  When we reached Butare, Kajuga's (sic) vehicle broke down.  And Kajuga lent us his own vehicle so that we could go back to Kigali.  I had left my own vehicle in Gitikinyoni because I had not envisaged going to Butare.  It's Setiba who made that proposal to me.  He asked me to accompany him to Butare in order to go and visit Kajuga who was hospitalised. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I am beginning to move on to something else, if the Court wanted to intervene.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our morning recess now.  

How much long do you think you are likely to take? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think I have another 20 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, would it make sense to start the next witness this morning, Ms. Hounkpatin or it is just a rhetorical question? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I don't think that it would make any sense to hear the next witness because we would create a situation where we would be stuck here -or, this witness would be stuck here.  And it would not be advisable.  Therefore, I would suggest that she be heard in the next session.  That would be wiser, especially for her, and would be more efficient because she needs to go back to work. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you. 

Mr. Webster, we think we should have taken the morning recess now. We are not certain whether we should have used this opportunity to have our informal conference with you all or should we wait after you have completed your cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I prefer to complete first and then (microphones overlapping). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will have a short recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1050H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	I am now moving on to something slightly different, Mr. Witness.  You told us that these youths who became known as Interahamwe, after the 6th of April 1994, were manning roadblocks in Kigali, right? 
A.	I can't hear you very well.  I believe the language in which I was following the discussions has changed.  Now I can follow. 
Q.	Okay, I am going on to something different and then I am actually going back to a portion of your earlier testimony.  

	Now you told us that these youths, who everyone sought to refer to as Interahamwe after 
	the 6th of April, were manning roadblocks in Kigali, right? 
A.	It was not only in Kigali town, it's pretty much everywhere else in Rwanda. 
Q.	Okay.  But in any case, I was trying to concentrate in the area that you are familiar with in Kigali, but you can also tell us about what you saw them do in your travels.  In any case, they were responsible for killing Tutsi civilians at these roadblocks, right? 
A.	I cannot confirm that because I wasn't a witness to that.  When I left Kigali -- what I meant to say is that in my neighbourhood there were no roadblocks.  I explained to you how people were being killed.  But when I left Kigali I realised that there were people at roadblocks.  I didn't know those manning the roadblocks and I didn't see any bodies -- dead bodies at the roadblocks.  So I cannot tell you how the people were killed.  Quite simply I realised that the people who were manning the roadblocks took themselves for Interahamwe.  There were no political party members at the roadblocks. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, we all know that tens of thousand of civilians were killed in Kigali at these roadblocks.  Certainly you must have been aware of that back in April, May and June of 1994, even if you weren't an eyewitness to a specific killing, certainly it must have come to your attention in 1994 that civilians, in particular Tutsi civilians, were being killed at these roadblocks? 
A.	To tell you the truth, I explained to you that in my neighbourhood, after the president's plane was brought down, soldiers killed people.  Everyone knows that.  Subsequently, the Inkotanyi came out of their encampments and began to fight soldiers of the Presidential Guard.  I did not come out of my house again for me to be able to know what was happening outside.  And I didn't even receive any information concerning what was going on, except what I learned from the radio where I heard it said that people had exterminated others.  And that in fact, genocide was ongoing, was being perpetrated. Other than that, I wasn't an eyewitness to the killings.  But, however, I did hear mention being made of them. 
Q.	So you listened to the radio enough to hear that genocide was ongoing, I assume that that was before the soldiers told you not to turn on your radio? 
A.	In the middle of the war, in June, we could no longer listen to the radio because we no longer had batteries to run our radio sets.  But prior to that, we would listen to the radio broadcasts.  And it was before the power was cut and before our batteries ran out, we were able to listen to the radio. 
Q.	In any case prior to June, you knew that genocide was ongoing as reported to you over the radio. 
A.	Yes, we heard that.  Everybody talked about it everywhere in Rwanda.  Everyone knew that genocide was being committed and even those who were fleeing were able to see what was going on. 
Q.	And we are talking of genocide of the Tutsi, right? 
A.	Yes, Tutsis were killed but also numerous Hutus were killed.  I am going to give you examples of Hutus who were my neighbour's.  For instance, Gatabazi and Muterahejuru.   Even Hutus were victims. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And you would agree that it was not only soldiers that were killing the Tutsis.  Some of these armed militia who called themselves Interahamwe were also killing Tutsi, right? 
A.	That's obvious. 
Q.	Did you come -- did you become aware of these armed militiamen also raping Tutsi women, back in April, May and June of 1994? 
A.	No, I didn't know about that because not far from my neighbourhood these kinds of incidents were not noticed.  If rapes were being perpetrated elsewhere I wouldn't have known because I was not an eyewitness. 
Q.	Well, what about subsequent to the events?  As you testified before us today, don't you know that thousands of Tutsi women were raped by militiamen, openly raped and then killed by these militiamen? 
A.	One can only speak of events for which one was an eyewitness or something which has been reported to one.  I wouldn't be able to say that that was done, whereas I know none who was a victim.  Furthermore, I was not an eyewitness to any such event. 
MR. WEBSTER:
	I would like us to look at another radio broadcast.  I believe this is the last document in the stapled bundle that I distributed.  It's something that we have looked at before in this Chamber.  It's already in evidence as P. 253, and what I have duplicated and circulated is actually an excerpt of that exhibit. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q. 	And, Mr. Witness, I do have the original Kinyarwanda transcription which I had asked Mr. Issa to pass up to you, so you can follow us if you care to.  

Before, you were asked the name of a journalist, for this particular exhibit, I can tell you that it was Anani Nkuruzinza, who was the journalist with RTLM.  He was making this report.  And here in an extensive paragraph, he talks about the rapes that were being committed by Interahamwe in Kigali.  And if you look at the middle of the text that you have received in Kinyarwanda, I think you will find useful passages -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's in -- we have it both in the French and English translation for everyone else.  And I am only going to paraphrase what is transcribed here.  It says:

	"People are talking about youths who are committing various types of atrocious, killing, raping and looting.  I don't know whether most of our younger listeners know what rape is.  Rape is meaning, having girls by force.  People continued talking about the young people who are killing, raping and looting.  What is sad is that they call themselves Interahamwe.  What we, at the RTLM, a radio station which is loved by the Interahamwe and which supports them and the youths of all republican parties know is that those youths that are in the same group which is commonly known as Interahamwe, who, General Bizimungu said, are at the front.'"  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, according to this journalist, in any case, he knows that the people are talking about the rapes in the same breathe that they talk about the killings and the lootings.  And this is what is being spoken over the airwaves of the RTLM towards the end of June 1994.  You still maintain that you didn't know anything about this back in June 1994? 
A.	Thank you.  Even if that was reported on radio, it is quite likely that I wasn't able to follow that broadcast because of the war.  Journalists would make their reporting and if -- even if I had heard that, it wouldn't serve me as proof for me to be able to confirm it.  Journalists confirm or report events of which they were eyewitnesses.  You have seen this in this document but I, myself, was not an eyewitness.  

	Earlier on you gave me a letter which I read and I realised that the comments made by journalists do not force me to confirm them.  But what is written in that letter is different from what I know.  This is why I consider this as observations being made by a journalist.  I could only agree to it was something that came from me.  So I can just look at this document as an observation by a journalist who wants to make his reporting interesting, that is my opinion. 
Q.	All right.  We have your response, thank you.  I will move on to something different now.  Now you were telling Madam Hounkpatin about the fabrication of evidence in the prison in Kigali.  And I believe you said that you were a victim of that fabrication of evidence.  Did I get any of that wrong, Mr. Witness; you also were a victim of this fabrication campaign? 
A.	Yes, I explained this at length.  These people targeted me because I had refused to work with them, to cooperate with them.  I believe that what I said had been heard and written down and you can consult the record. 
Q.	Yes, that's my recollection on this and I am summarising it to you to make sure, and give you every opportunity to affirm or expand upon the evidence.  So that was my intent with that question.  

You told us in direct examination that this campaign of fabrication started in 2004.  Did I get that right? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  It was from that year that I was asked to work together with those people.  I don't know exactly whether it was at that time that the campaign began but, at least, it was from that time that I was asked to corroborate with those people and when I refused, these people began to attack me. 
Q.	So can we agree:  When was it that you first became aware of this campaign of fabrication?  You explained that you became a victim of it in 2004, were you aware of it existing prior to 2004? 
A.	No, I don't know.  It was, rather, in 2004 that these people approached me, asking me to cooperate with them, and they asked me questions.  These people attacked me.  And it was from that time that I began to be interested in that campaign.  Otherwise, prior to that I don't know how the campaign was operated. 
Q.	Now, you told us that you were convicted at trial, that conviction was affirmed on appeal, but you didn't tell us what the specific allegations against you were.  We know that it relates to the genocide, but can you be more specific; what exactly were you accused of -- convicted of doing? 
A.	In brief before the Gacaca court, I was accused of various offences and they were different from those in my case file at the Prosecutor's office.  In the Gacaca court I was accused of having distributed weapons; for having prepared the genocide; for having killed Tutsis; and for having supervised the implementation of the genocide.  Those were the allegations made against me and those were the counts which were retained by the court even without making investigations to find out whether the allegations were true or not. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, weren't you convicted of - or, weren't you held responsible for the killings of your neighbours in Rugando on the 7th of April? 
A.	No, generally speaking, I was accused of the counts I have just made.  Otherwise, nobody brought any specific charges that I killed X, Y or Z, just generally speaking that the Gacaca court found me guilty of the offences and the allegations made against me.  However, nobody came up to said that I killed X,
	Y or Z. 
Q.	Well, we will make a request, a follow-up request with the Rwandese authorities and get a copy of your conviction.  But as I understand it, you were held responsible for making lists of Tutsis, distributing weapons to militiamen and killing your neighbours in Rugando cellule during the 
	period, 6th to 7th of April, during the first few days following the crash of the presidential plane.  And I will give you one last opportunity to clarify that for us:  Wasn't that the nature of the accusations against you? 
A.	Generally speaking, I was accused of having directed the activities of the Interahamwe.  I was accused for planning the genocide, for having distributed firearms and I was also accused of having committed genocide, by encouraging, aiding and abetting the actions of others to commit genocide.  And since I was chairman of the Interahamwe, members of that Gacaca court found me guilty of those crimes. Otherwise, in respect of the death of Tutsis who were my neighbours, defence witnesses came to testify in my favour, and there was no evidence that I had killed such or such a person.  But since I was the chairman of the Interahamwe, members of the Gacaca court simply said that I was guilty of all the allegations made against me. 
Q.	Yes, but these were allegations in relation to Rugando cellule.  Maybe I was a bit too broad by specifying your neighbours.  What I am referring to is the location of your crimes:  Was it in your cellule of origin?  Maybe they wanted the neighbours that lived right next to you, but generally the charges against you had to do with what you did in your cellule of origin, right? 
A.	Yes, but the charges were formulated in a general manner.  There was no specificity as to the acts I allegedly committed.  So in brief, before the Gacaca court the judges found me guilty of having distributed weapons and the other offences even before ordering investigations into those allegations. 
Q.	And the persons whose false evidence was used to convict you are listed in the document that you wrote to Madam Hounkpatin; is that your evidence? 
A.	I don't quite understand your question.  Are you talking about people who testified against me in the Gacaca court?  No -- nobody came to testify against me in the Gacaca court.  There was only one witness.  And what that witness said was not returned by the court because the information that he was providing was confusing.  According to the list which I gave to the Defence counsel, that doesn't have anything to do with this issue. 
Q.	That's what I am trying to find out, Mr. Witness, because my understanding from your direct evidence, from you testimony with Madam Hounkpatin, is that there were groups of people in the prison who were giving false evidence.  And that this group of people wanted you to give false evidence with them in Arusha.  And when you wouldn't do that, they gave false evidence against you in relation to your 
	own case.  That was my understanding of your testimony in direct examination.  So, if that's not the case, you can correct my understanding.  
A.	You misunderstood me.  I said that that group of persons was trying to spread -- to give 
	wrong information to the prison authorities.  They wanted to create problems for me; otherwise, these people who do not know my dossier, they were not there during my trial.  
Q.	So how did they create problems for you if they didn't testify in your trial, where is the false evidence against you coming from? 
A.	I did not say that these people gave false testimony against me.  I said that they attempted to get me to help the government by accepting to testify against people who had killed and left the country.  They were attempting to get me on their side to prepare false testimony against those persons.  When I refused to corroborate with those people, they went and told -- spread false -- gave false information to the prison authorities.  And they wanted to transfer me to another prison, but when the director realised that the allegations by these persons was groundless he refused to transfer me to another prison.  Otherwise, this group of persons did not testify against me in my trial.  They were just claiming that I had killed people and that I refused to plead guilty and confess.  So they accused me to the 
	prison authorities.  They did not go out of the prison to testify against me in the Gacaca proceedings, they were just trying to force me to corroborate with them in prison. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  It's more clear now.  So in relation to your own case there was no false evidence, right?  
A.	Among this group in prison, apart from one, who was my neighbour and who tried to testify against me, his testimony was so confused that the Gacaca court did not accept him as a witness.  The 
	Gacaca court found me guilty on the basis of allegations by other persons.  And I was found guilty.  The Gacaca court found me guilty because I was chairman of the Interahamwe.  The local residents who came to testify stated that they knew that I was chairman of the Interahamwe, but they did not know what I did.  And the Gacaca court said that since I was president -- since I was chairman of the Interahamwe, I should be held accountable for acts carried out by the Interahamwe.  The appeals court confirmed the decision of the Gacaca -- first instance Gacaca court.  And I am waiting for the 
	national board of the Gacaca courts which has to review my judgment.  I am still awaiting that decision, that review. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, you made very specific allegations against a person you named as Nkubito, and that he had given false evidence against you.  That's in my recollection of what you told us.  If I am wrong, you can correct me again.
A.	During my trial, Nkubito was also being tried.  And since he that pleaded guilty, he mentioned the persons that he killed.  He was not able to prove that I was -- I was with him to kill these people.  He was not able to identify persons that I had killed.  He was not clear in his testimony and the court did not accept his allegations against me.  He came to testify against me, but the Gacaca court did not accept his testimony.  That is the explanation I can give you.

          1130H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Well, I'd like to go through some documents with you once again.  And here I'll refer to document C in the stapled bundle that I distributed yesterday.  This is a Rwandan PV, going all the way back to 1997.  This is dated the 14th of May 1997.  I have it in all three languages.  

And let me start by asking if you know these individuals:  You already told us that you know 
Félix Ntuyahaga.  Do you know Pierre Célestin Nkundabagenzi?
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Rusebeya? 
A.	Yes.  I know him as well. 
Q.	Emmanuel Gacamumakuba? 
A.	Yes.  I know Emmanuel Gacamumakuba. 
Q.	Damascène Twagirayezu? 
A.	No.  I don't think I know Twagirayezu. 
Q.	Évariste Habimana? 
A.	I know Évariste Habimana. 
Q.	In any case, when you look at this list, I think you will find that you know all of these individuals because you were all charged together.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could hand this document up to the witness, please.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And by the terms of this document, there was an investigation following your arrest along with these other individuals.  You were charged as part of a group of committing killings in Rugando cellule.  And this document is basically a summary of the preliminary investigations that were made.  

And if we look where I've highlighted or where I've made little indications on page 3 in the English text and page 4 in the French text, you can see that the killings that you're charged with were perpetrated on the 7th of April in Rugando cellule.  The victims were either shot dead or killed with machetes.  

And in the words of the prosecutor who's making this summary, in their defence the accused alleged that they did not play any role in the killings which they had been charged; that it was rather Nzabanterura and the soldiers of the Presidential Guard who were responsible for killing all those victims and that they were still in their homes on the 7th April.  However, they admitted that all of the members of the population in Rugando cellule participated in the night patrols together with the soldiers of the Presidential Guard.

So here we have an investigation into at least 15, if not more, individuals.  And all of them seem to be suggesting that it was you and your group of Interahamwe that did the killings along with the Presidential Guard who were involved in the night patrols in your cellule.

Isn't that the basis of your conviction when it was finally decided back in 2008?  
A.	Thank you.  I have just seen that document.  And as I said yesterday, when the Gacaca proceedings took place in the prison, that was when they prepared this document.  What brought us together in the prison was that we were saying that we would give a list of those that were carrying firearms on the 7th of April.  

And the list of persons that appear in this document is those who were carrying firearms on the 7th of April.  And as I've already said, this document was prepared within the prison.  Each person will speak about facts that he knows about, but at the end we did not agree because some persons wanted to clear themselves.  

And to say that I was the person -- the only person responsible because I was the chairman of the Interahamwe -- they ganged up against me to put all the accusations at my doorstep.  Finally, Nkubito, who was leading the group, said that I am the one who was leading that group of killers.  But before the Gacaca court, I was never accused of the allegations contained in the document that you have given me.

Besides, I think it's Nkubito who must have given you this document which we prepared when we were in prison to talk about the facts that we knew.  All the persons appearing in this document are my former co-detainees.  Most of them were released in 2005.  

Let me add that even Nkubito has been released.  But since he pleaded guilty of having killed people and mentioned names of person he killed, he was re-arrested and sent back to prison because the relatives of the victims brought fresh charges against Nkubito.  But I confirm that the allegations contained in this document were never brought before the Gacaca court that tried me. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, as I read this document, it's not something that you prepared or the prisoners prepared.  It's something that was prepared by the prosecutor.  And, in fact, it's a covering memorandum.  Because when you look at the last page, he lists the various interviews that he's had with the accused persons and other witnesses that leads him to make the conclusions that are contained in this covering memorandum.

So this isn't what you did.  This is the result of an investigation which also included interviews with persons charged and persons who were witnesses.  Isn't that so?  
A.	In my opinion, we prepared this document when we were in prison.  Possibly the prosecutor took over our document, or he may have contacted the people who appear in this document and interviewed them, or he adopted the content of our document, or he may have interviewed some of the co-detainees who appear in this document and then came out with a document you have given to me. 
Q.	All right.  Well, thank you for your response.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
In any case, I'd request that this document be moved into evidence, and the Chamber can look at it for itself and make an assessment for itself of whether it appears to be how I describe it or how you described it.  So I'd request that this be marked as an exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa can collect in all three languages the copy from the witness and the two that I'm handing up now.  
MR. ISSA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document will be P. 538A for French, B for English, and C for Kinyarwanda.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Exhibit No. P. 538A, P. 538B and P. 538C)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, you mentioned Nkubito in particular.  I have a PV that he signed in his individual capacity dated the 21st of May 1997 where he's being asked about the murders in the Rugando cellule, and he's asked, "Who are the perpetrators of the murders?"  

And his response -- and this is document E of that same bundle -- at question 8 is that people from the Nzabanterura group and some soldiers killed the victims, all in relation to the killings that took place in April in Rugando cellule, which is set forth in question 4.  

So if you suggest that Nkubito was giving false evidence in 2008 or 2006, at the very least it would be consistent with what he was saying all the way back in 1997.
A.	Everything is clear.  Since 2004, when I refused to collaborate with this group, members of the group started putting together a dossier to discredit me.  It all started in 2004. 
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, this statement was signed in 1997, on the 21st of May, containing the same information.  You can have a look for yourself.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa would hand up the Kinyarwanda text to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	It's dated the 21st of May 1997, signed by Nkubito at the bottom.  And you can see where your name is mentioned.  I've highlighted it in yellow for you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'd request that this be moved into evidence as the next Prosecution exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 539.  Thank you, Your Honour.
 (Exhibit No. P. 539A, P. 539B and P. 539C admitted)
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could collect the document I gave to the witness and take these two.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were telling us again about -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Just a moment, Counsel.  You don't want to hear his comment?  You just want him to look at it and then you move it into evidence?
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would invite you to respond.  
MR. WEBSTER:
But he was taking so long that I assumed that he had nothing to say.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, would you like to comment?
A.	First of all, allow me time to read the document so I can familiarise with the allegations brought against me. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the document is only two or three paragraphs.  I can walk you through it and summarise its contents if you think that would assist.  But surely you must have read it by now.
A.	Give me just a few more seconds.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, what I'd suggest is that I ask my next question, and perhaps Madam Hounkpatin can come back to this in redirect because I'd like to finish my -- 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  You're looking up.
A.	I have just glanced through the document, and I think they were interviewing Nkubito.  And he stated under what circumstances the Tutsis were killed.  He mentioned the Tutsis that were killed not far from my house.  And he indicated that when these Tutsis were killed, he was inside his house.  And as I've already stated, I showed the position of Nkubito's house and my house.  And I think the Judges can assess this document made by Nkubito.

Because if you take into account the location of his house -- and he himself states that he was inside his house -- how was he able to know what was happening in my house?  I think it will be for the Judges to examine this document and draw their conclusions. 
Q.	Anyway, I thank you for your response.  The only thing I would point out to you is that this is what Nkubito was saying in May 1997.  And I'd suggest to you that it's consistent with anything he has said after May -- after 2004 when you claim he was manufacturing evidence.

But on that point, you told us that Nkubito's testimony in your trial or his evidence in your trial was disregarded because it was not specific.  Is that your evidence?
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  That is what I said, and that is what happened. 
Q.	Well, I'd like us to have a look at another document.  This is document I in that same bundle.  We have the English and French translation and the original Kinyarwanda.  And I've made markings on the document so we can all follow the relevant paragraphs starting with page 2 on the English text and page 2 on the French text.

I'll just read through, Mr. Witness, which will make it easier for us.  If I'm reading anything incorrectly, Madam Hounkpatin or Mr. Ngirumpatse will correct me.

If we look at paragraph where I've numbered 1, Nkubito is talking about the night patrols.  And I don't even need -- well, "It was within this framework that the patrols were introduced, but the crimes hardly stopped.  Sometime afterwards, it was observed that it was the Interahamwe that was carrying out those criminal acts.  It appears that they were staying with André Nzabanterura who was responsible for recruiting the Interahamwe and who was leading this group."  "The members of this group got along with the Presidential Guard.  Some of them had relatives among the Presidential Guard."  

Towards the end of that paragraph:  Army officers were meeting at Nzabanterura's house, and an observant person could become suspicious because of the frequency of the meetings with those officers which went hand in hand with the escalation of crimes perpetrated by those young people.

Where I've marked number 2:  Sometime afterwards, we learned that those youths had undergone training in Mutara.  Later we got to know that the purpose of training this group was the massacre of Tutsis which started prior to April of 1994 and which later degenerated into the genocide which was perpetrated by those youths led by Nzabanterura and some members of the Presidential Guard led by Protais Mpiranya.

Then it goes on to paragraph where I've numbered 4:  Nzabanterura himself was arrested and detained in Kigali central prison for robbing handbags of ladies and that Nzabanterura was released two days later as a result of the intervention of a delegation that arrived in the vehicle of the presidency of the republic.  

You turn the page at paragraph where I've numbered 5.  "When he", Nkubito, "reported this to Mathieu Ngirumpatse, he was warned against disrupting the activities of the Interahamwe."  

Turn the page where I've numbered 6.  It talks about military training of the Interahamwe.  Where I've numbered 7, there's a list of the Interahamwe that gathered at Nzabanterura's house.  Where I've numbered 8, he talks about arms kept at Nzabanterura's residence that were distributed.  So all this seems like very specific information.

It surprises me that this information, which was provided on the 13th of March 2006 to the president of the Gacaca court in Rugando under the caption "Testimony", is what you would suggest is not specific.
A.	Thank you.  The information contained in this document is false because it was given after the period that I referred to.  When he refers to my detention, let me tell you this:  I was detained following a plot.  At that time some young persons of the MRND fought among themselves.  And when they fought, they plotted and contacted a lieutenant called Mugabo.  It was a plot against me, and on the 6th I was put in prison.  It was a Wednesday.  It was on Wednesday that I was released by the office of the prosecutor upon decision by the conseiller.

The conseiller released me because my dossier was empty, and it was a decision -- or they, rather, asked me to bring an action against that lieutenant because he falsely accused me.

A registrar who was -- a conseiller told me that they said that I had spent two days in detention.  Later on I asked for my dossier.  And when I wanted to bring action against that lieutenant who caused my detention, I was advised not to do so.  I, therefore, confirm that the information contained in this document is false because the allegations in there are groundless. 
Q.	And here you're referring to the allegations before 1994.  The information that you just gave us was in relation to your arrest before the 6th of April 1994; right?  When you were arrested and released.  That's what you're telling us about now.
A.	All the information contained in this document is false.  This is evidence that he fabricated since 2004 when I refused to collaborate with his group.  
Q.	Witness, I know you think it's false.  I'm not disputing your contention that it's false.  I'm simply trying to clarify for the record that you're telling us about an arrest that took place before 1994.  When you were giving us all this information about the person who arrested you, you're talking about your arrest in 1993; right?  Just answer yes or no.  If it's not correct, then I'll go on.
A.	That is correct.  I was detained in 1993. 
Q.	Thank you.
A.	But the circumstances under which I was detained are not -- do not tally with what Nkubito said.  

And I would like to request that the Chamber, if the Prosecutor is relying solely on statements made by Nkubito --
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I've come to the end of my examination.  I would simply like to admit this document, and then I'll conclude.  So I'd move this document of the 13th of March 2006 in evidence as the next exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 540, 5-4-0.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Exhibit No. P. 540A, P. 540B and P. 540C admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'd also request that the original signed document that has already been admitted in evidence as 
	D. NZ16 be admitted at this time.  And it's just for the completeness of the record.  I've handed it to Mr. Issa to show to the Chamber.  This is the memo that is actually signed by Marc Nees.  What we have in evidence is the French and the English translation.  But here we have the original text which is in a language we won't understand, but it has his signature.  So just for the completeness of the record, I'd like it to be admitted. 

Mr. Witness, I thank you for your responses.  I have no further questions for you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry to take the floor, but maybe I have one question for the Prosecution, which has kept to the timetable.  I would like him to tell us from when he had been in possession of the document of the 13th March 2006 and when was it first disclosed.  This is in reference to the document that he has used just a few minutes ago in his cross-examination.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't have documentation of that with me right now, but clearly it was disclosed some time ago.  And I can check the records and communicate with Mr. Weyl independently.  And if there is an issue, we can deal with it later.  But it shouldn't slow up the examination process at this stage.  All of these things were disclosed previously.   
MR. WEYL: 
I think it was said that we don't have the same information concerning the problem of the 13th March 2006, because it does not seem to be complying with the rules of disclosure.  I think if we had received it a moment earlier, we would have been able to discuss this document in another different way than we have done.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, there's even further confusion because Mr. Webster has just been working with a witness with a document on which Frédéric Weyl was making an objection.  And the document that he is circulating -- it's a matter of clarification for me.  I'm seeking clarification.  The document which he has shown us through Mr. Issa of the registry is a document which is in Flemish, it would seem to me, from Lieutenant Nees.

So I don't quite understand the exercise we're involved in.  Is he asking for two documents to be admitted, or is it in the same line of questioning that he is asking that these two documents be tendered into evidence at the same time?

I'm seeking clarification, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  I can provide it now.  With respect to the document dated the 13th of March 2006, it was disclosed on the 27th of March 2007 and re-disclosed on the 23rd of June 2007.  

So it was a document that was previously disclosed and then circulated with this bundle yesterday.  And with regard to the document in Flemish, I'm simply trying to make the trial record as complete and accurate as possible.  

And the two translations that Mr. Robinson admitted as D. NZ16 were translations; whereas, the original Flemish has the signature of the person who provided the information so that the translations don't appear to be papers coming from nowhere.  

We have a document with a signature.  It's not adding anything to the record except the signature of the declarant.  So it's two separate exhibits.  One was a D. NZ16, and the other is the letter that I've just clarified was disclosed in 2007. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will make the admissions as requested.  

Is there any redirect of this witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I have a few questions for him.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Nzabanterura.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	I have a few questions for you.  When you were sentenced by the Gacaca court in the year 2008, Nkubito was present to make the allegations against you.   
A.	He did not come to testify against me.  He himself was an accused person.  He was supposed to explain himself regarding the allegations against him, and he was unable to provide the document which was considered here in this Court a few moments ago. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What was the conclusion or the determination of the Gacaca court in respect of the allegations made against you by your co-accused?  I'm talking about the final determination by the Gacaca court.
A.	The Gacaca court did not take into consideration Nkubito's testimony.  The Gacaca court relied on the evidence it had obtained and on the testimonies provided by the local inhabitants present in court. 
Q.	Did Mr. Nkubito make a guilty plea? 
A.	Yes.  Nkubito had recoursed (sic) to the guilty plea procedure.  He recognised or admitted to having killed many people.  He agreed to having planned the genocide.  But he also mentioned the names of people with whom he worked, but he did not mention my name.  In fact, Nkubito was among those national witnesses who, before they testified against somebody, had to plead guilty.

So it is within that framework that the Gacaca court condemned him to 20 years imprisonment after having found grounds for his guilty plea.  So the witnesses always plead guilty in order to provide credibility to their testimony for the prosecution.

But the Gacaca court did not take into account any of the testimony Nkubito provided against me. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I'm going to move on to another document which was used by the Prosecutor together with you.  And this is -- they're transcripts of a radio broadcast.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I don't think the Prosecution tendered this document into evidence.  Maybe Mr. Issa can confirm this for me if I'm mistaken.  And I'm talking about document labelled J in the bundle of documents that was provided by Mr. Webster.  It's, again, document J.

Did the witness keep this document with him, or did you take it back from him, Mr. Issa?  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	In his cross-examination, the Prosecutor indicated that this communiqué arose from a meeting which allegedly was held by the Interahamwe leaders mentioning Robert Kajuga.  Your name also appears among the signatories, André Nzabanterura.  There is also Tharcisse Zabandura, Dieudonné Niyitegeka, Joseph Setiba.  

I want to take these names one by one, as well as the titles of these individuals, and I want you to tell me whether it was in fact the titles that they held.
Robert Kajuga is given here as the first vice-chairman of Kigali town.  Robert Kajuga.  What did he represent in the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could interrupt for one second.  I think counsel has to read the sentence right above the name Robert Kajuga.  Because I think you're suggesting that the name below his -- the title below his is what he's being attributed, but it's actually what precedes his name.  And for the record, this is D. NZ39.  
(Pages 24 to 33 by Kelly Surina)































1215H 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
	Very well.  I'm sorry, Mr. Webster.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I'm going to take it again Mr.  Nzabanterura.  Were you the chairman of the Interahamwe?  
A.	No.  I was responsible for the sensitisation of the Interahamwe in our cellule.  I was not the chairman of the Interahamwe, as the documents claim -- the document claims.  

I am under the impression that this is something that journalists do.  I was not the vice chairman of the Interahamwe.  
Q.	And who was the national treasurer of the national provisional committee?  
A.	The treasurer of the Interahamwe, I no longer recall that name.  It should be -- no, no.  I no longer remember.  If it's the same person as in the document, I no longer remember his name.  

At national level, it was too high up for people like us.  I did not work very closely with them so I cannot know their name.  And, therefore, I do not know the national treasurer of the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Very well.  In fact, my question was to deal more specifically with your designation, which does not correspond with what is mentioned in this document.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I'm done.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
And before I take my seat again, I would like to make the usual request to allow Mr.  Nzabanterura to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse, by your leave, Mr. President.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, this concludes your testimony before the Tribunal in this case.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us in our work.  But you are now excused and you're free to go.  The registrar will make arrangements to grant the request made by counsel.  

And I think this also brings this trial session to an end.  Is there any business that needs to be discussed before we adjourn?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think -- nothing from the Prosecution.  I assume that we'll be meeting informally afterwards, or is this the informal meeting?  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  We're meeting informally afterwards.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, nothing from the Prosecution.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I don't have very much to say except I want to observe that the cross-examination of Mr. Webster was not 40 per cent, but it was more or less a hundred per cent of the duration.  So you will see that at times projections of time can be changed and swayed by circumstances.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  That's noted.  

Well, we'd like to thank the registry and all supporting staff for the efficient -- usually -- as usual support for our trial session.  And we look forward to our resumption in approximately two weeks' time.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  At the time when this session -- this first session is coming to an end for the presentation of the Defence case for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, I, indeed, wish to especially thank the staff, the support staff.  And I wish to say something about the assistance which has been given to us by the witness's -- witness and victims support section in this difficult task of presenting our witnesses at the rhythm dictated by the proceedings.  They have really been of great help, the witness and victim's support section, apart from the small difficulties here and there.  But we wish specifically to thank them, and I wanted to mention this in particular so that it appears in the record, because they have enabled us to successfully conclude this difficult task.  

And I thank the Chamber for its particular indulgence in my regard, because sometimes it has considered me a lawyer who is not really taken away as such by emotions, but animated by my conviction.  

I thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  I'm sure everybody appreciates your remarks.  

We can take the adjournment now.
