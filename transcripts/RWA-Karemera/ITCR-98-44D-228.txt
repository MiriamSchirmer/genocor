P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Counsel, we are in open session, so you could advise us as to whether we should continue in 
open session.  Should we continue in the open session?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
We should continue like yesterday in closed session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, could we go in closed session.

(Page 1 by Sheriffo Jammeh)

























MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

Prosecution, this is witness?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Witness CNAK, Madam President, Your Honours.  Could the registry administer the oath to the witness.  
(Declaration made by witness CNAK in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, good afternoon 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, ma'am. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Remember to switch off your microphone when you are not speaking.  When you leave it on and there are other microphones as well, it interrupts with the interpretation.  Now we would like to give you some information regarding the proceedings in this Tribunal.  

The Prosecution seated on your right hand will lead you in your evidence.  It will ask you questions leading to the giving of your evidence.  The Defence on your left will also ask you questions when the Prosecution has finished its questions.  The Judges may also ask questions if they need clarifications from you.  

Listen carefully to the questions and answer them directly, and this will enable the Trial Chamber to quickly conclude your testimony.  

If you have not understood the question, you may ask for it to be repeated or clarified.  

We require courtesy from Counsel and witnesses and from everybody towards everybody.  Those are the few matters we wanted to bring to your attention before you start your testimony.  Are our instructions clear to you, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honour.  We have placed before the witness the PIS form and we would request a Kinyarwanda translator to go through the form with the witness. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would the Kinyarwanda interpret please come forward to assist the witness with the personal identification form, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President.  I am done reviewing the sheet with the witness.  He says there's an amendment or a correction that has to be made. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, maybe we will go into closed session because identifying the correction might identify the witness.  We regret to members of the public, you have to leave at this stage. 

Can we go into closed session, Registry. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 36 to 38] was extracted and filed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 34 to 35 by Judith Kapatamoyo)
























MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are now in open session.  Be careful not to mention names of people and places that might identify you because the proceedings are now open to the public.  

Yes, Prosecution, you may continue.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, do you know Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I know him. 
Q.	How did you know him, Witness? 
A.	I know that at some point he was minister -- minister of youth affairs in Rwanda. 
Q.	Do you know when he was minister, Witness? 
A.	Please could you repeat your question? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
	Says the witness.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Do you know when Callixte Nzabonimana was a minister in Rwanda? 
A.	I have known him since 1993. 
Q.	Did you know the political party to which he belonged, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court? 
A.	He was a member of the MRND. 
Q.	Witness, after the death of the president, did you ever meet Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How many times after the death of the president did you meet Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	After the death of the president, I saw Callixte Nzabonimana on three different occasions. 
Q.	When was the first occasion that you met him? 
A.	The first time I saw him after the death of the President Habyarimana was when he came to Ruhango. 
Q.	And the second time, Witness, where did you meet him? 
A.	When I saw him again for the second time he had again come to Ruhango in the Tambwe commune. 
Q.	And when was the third time that you met Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I saw him again in Ruhango in the Tambwe commune. 
Q.	Now, Witness, we want to go to the first meeting that you had with Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana in Ruhango.  When was this, Witness, when you met him for the first time in Ruhango? 
A.	Do you want me to tell you when I saw him in Ruhango before the death of the president or after the death of the president.  Please, specify the period to which you are referring. 
Q.	Witness, after the death of the president. 
A.	I thank you.  The first time I saw him was when he came to Ruhango alongside other national authorities. 
Q.	When was this, Witness? 
A.	It was in April 1994. 
Q.	Are you able to give a date, Witness? 
A.	I do not recall the date nor the day of the week.  However, I know it was in April 1994. 
Q.	Approximately how many days or weeks after the death of the president, Witness, did you see 
	Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I said that I saw him on three occasions after the death of the president.  And I was explaining to you the time I saw him for the first time after the death of the president. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, that's what I am asking you.  Would you recall how many days or weeks after the president died when you saw Callixte Nzabonimana for the first time in Ruhango? 
A.	I told you that I cannot remember the date nor the day of the week.  But it was about one week after the president of the republic died. 
Q.	Where particularly in Ruhango, Witness, did you see Mr. Nzabonimana? 
A.	I saw him in Ruhango at Marianne's.  They were holding a meeting to incite people to commit killings in Ruhango. 
Q.	Where is Marianne's place located, Witness, being the secteur, cellule and commune, if you can inform the Court? 
A.	Before that house was located in the Ruhango cellule.  The secteur was Nyamagana, the commune was Tambwe, but now the names have changed at the level of the local administration in Rwanda. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Your Honours, the names that have been referred to by the witness are on the spelling list.  No.33, Nyamagana, No. 36. Ruhango, No. 40. Tambwe. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, let the witness repeat, which is the cellule, the secteur and the commune, then?  
THE WITNESS:
The cellule is Ruhango, the secteur is Nyamagana and commune, is Tambwe. 
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Yes, Witness, you said Callixte was in the company of some other dignitaries.  Can you inform the Court the names of those dignitaries who were in the company of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Yes, I can do so. 
Q.	Go ahead, Witness.  
A.	There was Callixte Nzabonimana, himself; there was Shalom Bicamumpaka; there was 
	the member of parliament, Kayende; and the fourth person was a journalist called Makeri, Dominic.  Those are the persons I remember.  But there were others who came and joined them in 
	Ruhango from Kigali. 
(Pages 39 to 41 by Judith Kapatamoyo)




































1500H 
BY MS. MAPOSA:  
Q.	Can you also tell the Court the names of those other ones who joined them in Ruhango, Witness? 
A.	In Ruhango there was already Nathan Mugaga, the bourgmestre of the Tambwe commune.  There was Marianne, the chairperson of the MRND party at the Tambwe commune.  I am sorry.  She was, rather, the chairperson of the MRND at the Ruhango sub-préfecture.  There was Colonel Aloys Simba who had come before.  The new sous-préfet was also there.  The director of Electrogaz was also there.  And there was -- there were also members of the Interahamwe youth wing and the power wing, which had come before them to Ruhango.  Before I conclude, I do not know if I have mentioned Kayonde, who had arrived with the three other dignitaries from Kigali.  He is a native of Ruhango, but on that day he had come from Kigali.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we didn't get the name of the journalist, at least his surname and, of course, there are others.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Yes, Witness, what is the name of the journalist, again?  Can you say it out?  
A.	The journalist is called Dominic Makeri.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
M-A-K-E-R-I, number 20 on the spelling list.  
MS. MAPOSA:
And Nathan Mugaga is number 24, Your Honours, on the spelling list, and Kayonde is number 15. Bicamumpaka is number 1, and Simba is number 39 on the spelling list, Your Honours.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Now, Witness, you have told the Court that Marianne was the chairperson of MRND in Ruhango.  Did you know the political party that Nathan Mugaga belonged to? 
A.	Yes.  I knew Nathan Mugaga's political party.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court, Witness?
A.	He was a member of the MDR-Parmehutu. 
Q.	Did he hold any post in MDR-Parmehutu, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who was he in MDR? 
A.	Before his appointment as bourgmestre of the Tambwe commune, he was president or chairman of the MDR in that very commune, Tambwe commune.  
Q.	When was he appointed bourgmestre of Tambwe commune, Witness? 
A.	He was appointed bourgmestre of Tambwe commune at the time of multiparty politics.  At that time various candidates ran on the tickets of their political parties.  His party nominated him and he was elected during the multiparty era.  
Q.	And, Witness, did you know the political party that Jéromé Bicamumpaka belonged to? 
A.	Jéromé Bicamumpaka was of the MDR party.  
Q.	Now, Witness, are you in a position to inform the Court who had convened this meeting?  Was it convened under the auspices of the MRND, MDR or which party, if any, had convened this meeting? 
A.	Yes, I knew who had convened that meeting.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, who had convened it? 
A.	The meeting was convened by Marianne for the MDR.  
Q.	You have informed the Court that there were some youth from the power wings, Witness.  Are you in a position to inform the Court the power wings that were represented by the people who attended the meeting on the day in question? 
A.	All the political parties present on that day had gathered as power wings.  
Q.	Maybe, Witness, can you inform the Court all those political parties that had gathered on that day.  
A.	MRND, MDR, PSD, PL, PDI, and I do not recall the other political parties that were present, but those were the most dominant in attendance.  
Q.	Approximately, Witness, how many people attended this meeting?  
A.	Not very many people attended the meeting.  However, I can tell you -- or I will attempt to give you how many people were in the building, because at the time of the meeting there were some people within the building whilst others followed the meeting from outside.  
Q.	Maybe before we get to that, where particularly was this meeting held at Marianne's house, at Marianne's place? 
A.	The meeting took place at Marianne's house, in the living room of her house.  
Q.	So approximately how many people, Witness, were in the living room? 
A.	I may not be able to give you an exact figure, but I can suggest that there were about 15 persons in that living room, ****************.  
Q.	How about outside?  You have said some people were outside.  How many approximately were outside Marianne's living room following the proceedings from there? 
A.	I cannot give you an exact figure but there were inhabitants at the door and around the window, and I cannot give you a figure.  
Q.	What time was it, Witness, when this meeting was held? 
A.	The meeting, by my reckoning, took place before noon.  And although I didn't wear a wristwatch, I can only go by that approximation.  
Q.	Now, Witness, you have mentioned some power wings.  What were these power wings, if you can elaborate? 
A.	Political parties used to be autonomous previously, but then occurred some kind of assembling of forces under the caption Hutu Power.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, can you now inform the Court how the proceedings of the meeting started? 
A.	Marianne called the meeting to order. 
Q.	What did she say, Witness? 
A.	She extended welcome to the guests and then greeted the people who were in attendance and then went on to give the floor to the various speakers.  
Q.	Witness, did Marianne announce the agenda of the meeting to the people who had attended? 
A.	She started by welcoming the guests, but she did not give an agenda to those in attendance.  She simply introduced the guests and then gave the floor to the various speakers.  
Q.	Amongst the speakers, Witness, who spoke first? 
A.	Bicamumpaka, Jéromé, was the first to take the floor.  
Q.	Do you remember what Mr. Jéromé Bicamumpaka said when he took the floor? 
A.	Yes, I remember some of the things that he said.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court, Witness, what he said?  
A.	I remember that Jéromé Bicamumpaka explained to the meeting that he had come to Ruhango to explain to the inhabitants of Ruhango, particularly members of the power wing, about the details of the war that the enemy from Uganda had brought upon Rwanda.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, you can proceed.  Did he say anything else? 
A.	Yes.  He also said -- can I proceed?  
Q.	Yes, Witness, proceed.  
A.	After explaining to the meeting that the enemy had launched the attack from Uganda, he called on all
	the Hutu to rally together in order to fight the enemy.  He also said that he had come in the company of other persons who were going to explain to those in attendance that all Hutus, wherever they may be, must fight the enemy.  He said that he had come to introduce the new sous-préfet because the 
	former sous-préfet was obviously pro-Tutsi.  
Q.	Yes, Witness.  Is that all that Mr. Bicamumpaka said? 
A.	I have explained to you that he said many things but that I could not remember everything.  I remembered only a few.  But in broad strokes, his main point was that the Hutus should rally together to fight off the enemy who had attacked the country from Uganda.  And he said that the enemy was the Inyenzi, meaning Tutsis who had been in -- or who were in Rwanda.  I believe that those are the details that I can provide as far as the main items of his speech go and as far as I can remember.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You mentioned the introduction of a new sous-préfet.  Do you know the name of this sous-préfet, Witness? 
A.	No.  All I know is that he was referred to as the new sous-préfet.  I do not know his full names.  
Q.	And do you know the outgoing sous-préfet who was being replaced by this new sous-préfet? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	What was his name?  
A.	His name was Placide Koloni. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell the Court the ethnicity of this new sous-préfet who was being introduced at this meeting? 
A.	I did not know his ethnicity at the time.  You see, we only knew somebody's ethnicity by looking at their identity card, so I was not in a position to know his ethnicity.  However, it was obvious that he was in agreement with the killers because he had just been appointed to replace someone who did not agree with the killers.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And do you know what became of Koloni, Placide, the sous-préfet who was replaced by this new sous-préfet? 
A.	I do not know his entire story, but I know a few things about what happened to him.  
Q.	Is he still alive, Witness? 
A.	No, he died.  
Q.	When did he die? 
A.	He died in 1995 -- towards the end of 1995, maybe late 1995 or early 1996, if I am not mistaken.  
Q.	Yes.  Now, Witness, you have told us what Mr. Jéromé Bicamumpaka told the gathering.  Did Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana react in any manner or in any way to the speech of Mr. Bicamumpaka? 
A.	Callixte Nzabonimana spoke after Jéromé Bicamumpaka but did not react to Bicamumpaka's speech.  He went on to deliver his own speech.  
Q.	Yes.  What did Mr. Nzabonimana say to the gathering, Witness? 
A.	Callixte Nzabonimana told those who were gathered at that location that he had come from Kigali with his group to explain to the inhabitants of Ruhango the details pertaining to the war, a war which had been started by the enemy, the Tutsi, who had launched these attacks from Uganda.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, what explanation about the war did he give to the gathering? 
A.	He explained that the ongoing war did not concern only one particular political party, but it was one that called on all Hutus, irrespective of their political parties, to engage in fighting the enemy.  
Q.	Yes.  Other than Mr. Jéromé Bicamumpaka and Mr. Nzabonimana, is there any other person who spoke at this meeting, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, someone else spoke.  
Q.	Yes, who is he, and can you tell the Court what that speaker told the gathering? 
A.	After Callixte Nzabonimana, the member of parliament known as Kayonde took the floor, and he talked to the people who were gathered, saying that he was together with the people of Ruhango in their fight against the enemy and that he was going to be their spokesperson to hierarchy in order to seek to obtain for them all that they would need in order to engage in that war.  
Q.	And after Mr. Kayonde, did anyone take the floor, Mr. Witness?  
A.	Yes, someone else took the floor.  
Q.	Who took the floor next? 
A.	Nathan Mugaga, bourgmestre of Tambwe commune, was the next to speak.  
Q.	What did he say to the gathering? 
A.	He also said that he was in agreement with what had just been stated.  Then he promised that he would tour all the secteurs in his commune in order to disseminate the message that had just been given during that meeting.  
Q.	Now, Witness, did you manage to attend the meeting throughout from its beginning up to the end? 
A.	No, I did not stay to the end of the meeting.  I left at some point to go somewhere.  
Q.	At what stage did you leave, Witness? 
A.	Colonel Aloys Simba was speaking at the time I left.  
Q.	At what stage or after which speaker did Aloys Simba speak? 
A.	Nathan Mugaga had just finished his speech.  
Q.	Witness, can you inform the Trial Chamber as to how the security situation was like in Ruhango after the death of the president and before this meeting at Marianne's house.  
A.	Please kindly repeat your question.  I did not quite understand it.  
Q.	How was the security situation like in Ruhango before this meeting at Marianne's house? 
A.	The security situation was not very good since the president of the republic had died.  However, there were no killings of Tutsis, but night patrols had been organised and Tutsis were even involved in 
	those patrols.  So there was no problem against the Tutsis, as such, at the time.  
Q.	Now, Witness, can you describe to the Trial Chamber the security situation that prevailed after this meeting at Marianne's house? 
A.	After the meeting at Marianne's place roadblocks were set up and people began to arrest Tutsis, some of them at the roadblocks, whilst others were attacked and killed in their homes.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court the sites where roadblocks were set up in Ruhango after the meeting at Marianne's house? 
A.	I have just mentioned killings.  I would like you to allow me to revisit that point and provide a 
	few more details from Callixte Nzabonimana's speech. 
Q.	Yes, go ahead, Witness.  
A.	Callixte in his speech insisted on explaining to those in attendance how war was prosecuted against the Tutsis in former times.  He said that those who fought Tutsis would wear dry banana leaves and 
	other grass.  But he was concerned that people may seek to go out and kill Tutsis while wearing their uniforms and the attires of their various political parties.  
Q.	Yes, thank you, Witness.  

Now, can we go back to my question.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber where the roadblocks were located in Ruhango commune? 
A.	Yes, Madam.  
Q.	Yes, go ahead, Witness.  
A.	The first roadblock was at a location known as Gatengezi.  There was another one at Gataka, and the third roadblock was at the REP (sic) filling station.  The fourth roadblock was at Trafipro.  Those are the most significant roadblocks but that does not mean that there were no other roadblocks within Ruhango.  

MS. MAPOSA:  
Yes, Your Honours, Gataka is number 6.  Trafipro is number 41.  ERP is just an acronym, and Gatengezi is not on our spelling list, if the Kinyarwanda interpreter can assist with the spelling.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Gatengezi is spelt G-A-T-E-N-G-E-Z-I.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you inform the Court as to what was happening at these roadblocks which were set up after Marianne's meeting? 
A.	I can tell you.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, go ahead.  
A.	People were being arrested at those roadblocks.  And when it was realised that the people arrested or stopped were Tutsi, they were killed.  If the passersby were Hutu, they were allowed to go their way.  
Q.	Are you able to inform the Trial Chamber of any particular or specific instance of people who were killed at the roadblocks, Witness? 
A.	I can cite one case, a case of a Hutu who was killed at the ERP roadblock because this person had not wanted to collaborate with the other Hutus in the massacres of Tutsis.  This person was called Mutabazi, nicknamed Rwamudanga, and he was a member of the PSD party.  
MS. MAPOSA:  
Mutabazi is number 28, Your Honours.  
(By order of the Court, the question and the answer portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under separate cover)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rwamudanga is spelt R-W-A-M-U-D-A-N-G-A.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Now, Witness, we want to move on to the second time that you saw Callixte Nzabonimana after the death of the president.  Can you inform the Trial Chamber as to when you saw Callixte Nzabonimana for the second time after the president died in 1994?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, before the witness responds, there is a small matter we want to discuss in closed session with you, to address you on in closed session.  
MS. MAPOSA:  
I am obliged, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Members of the public, we regret you must leave now because the matter we are going to address may identify the witness.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are we there?  Registry?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
Yes, yes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, we are now in open session.  The public is free to attend these sessions, so be careful not to reveal information which may identify you.  

Counsel, you may proceed.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Before embarking on your cross-examination, I just want to get an overview of the various statements that you have provided here at this Tribunal.  You first gave a statement on 18th January 2000 at the ICTR office in Kigali; is that correct, Mr. Witness?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Thank you.  You then testified on ******************************************************** in the case of ***************************************************.  Yes?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	A few days later -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Sorry, I will slow down, I apologise to the translators.
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	A few days later while you were still in a safe house in Arusha, on 10th March 2004, you gave a second statement to the investigators of the Prosecutor; is that correct?  
A.	Counsel, could you please repeat your question?  
Q.	I said you testified on 4th/5th March 2004, and a few days later while you were still in Arusha in a safe house, on 10th March 2004, you gave a further statement to the investigators of the Prosecutor of this Tribunal.  Is that correct?  
A.	Correct.  
Q.	And recently, on 12th November 2008, you gave a third statement, this time in Gitarama at motel Élégance, again to two investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  The first topic I want to discuss with you is this meeting at Marianne's place, which you have talked about during your examination-in-chief.  And the first thing I would like to know is how you came to know about this meeting.  
A.	That is a question I can easily answer.  I explained on several occasions that I had a friend who was influential and he was the one who would give me information about meetings that were going to take place.  *******************************************.  
Q.	So in that case, in the case of the meeting at Marianne, when did he tell you about it?  
A.	You know, people who sleep on the same bed would talk during the night, and he told me that there was going to be a big meeting in Ruhango.  
Q.	In other words, your testimony is that you learned that there would be a meeting the night before.  
A.	Yes, I learned about that meeting before it was held.  
Q.	Then, Mr. Witness, can you explain why, in your 18th January 2000 statement, what you stated was that you were at Hotel Umuco on the date which you cannot state, but where that meeting happened.  You saw these people arrive there, they were surrounded by GDR (sic) people, and that:  "Like many other people, I followed these personalities out of curiosity.  Although we were not invited, we managed to attend the meeting through the complicity of some JDR member."  

So, basically, in your statement of 2000 you don't learn it the day before, you learn it the day where it is happening.  What is the correct version?  
A.	What I said here during this testimony of -- during my testimony in the Nzabonimana trial is no different from what I said during my testimony in the ***********************.  If questions had been put to me on this matter I would have provided explanations.  
(Pages 58 to 59 by Kirstin McLean)



















1700H 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	I was not asking questions about your ********************************.  I was referring to your statement of 2000.  I am not yet with your **************************************, with which we'll deal later.

So why in your statement of 2000 you state that you fall on that meeting by chance and today you are saying you learnt of it the night before? 
A.	I thank you.  If you follow my previous statements closely, you will see that I give all the explanations concerning this important meeting.  I even talked about the arrival of these personalities in Ruhango.  But the Prosecutor did not ask me where I was when I saw those people.  If that question had been put to me, of course, I would have given an answer. 
Q.	I will ask the question one more time, the last time.  Why in your statement of 2000 you say that you fall on the meeting by chance and in your testimony today you say you learn of it the night before? 
A.	I thank you.  You are saying that I said I knew about the meeting the day before and that I also said that I learnt about the meeting on the same day, but that is no different because in any case I was informed about the meeting by my friend.  And even if I forgot about some details I am still saying -- I'm still giving the name of the person who informed me of the meeting. 
Q.	Is your friend still alive?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Sorry, sorry.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  We would like to know exactly at what part of the statement you're pointing --  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, Your Honour --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- and where the contradiction is. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
-- in the second paragraph around the middle the witness states:  "Like many other people I followed these personalities out of curiosity.  Although we were not invited, we managed to attend the meeting through the complicity of some JDR members."  

Whereas in the testimony we have, we have this friend, which I don't want to provide the name, which according to the witness informed them the day before that the meeting would happen and let him know of what would be discussed.  

So the contradiction I'm putting to the witness is that in his testimony today he's saying that his friend informed him the day before about the meeting.  And in the first statement he gave about it, he said that he just learnt of it.  He never mentions the fact that his friend told him prior to that.  

And the way I read it is that -- it's almost by chance, like I'm putting to the witness, that he eventually ended up in that meeting. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  Our concern is that the statement refers to "information", and not "invitation". 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I will move on, Your Honour.  I will leave it for this Court's appreciation.  

I will move on to the next issue.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Q.	And what I would like to know now, Witness, is I would like to get a clear date from you on which that meeting at Marianne's happened.  I'd like you to provide the most accurate date possible.  
A.	I thank you for that question.  I tried to make you understand, I do not know the date or the day, but I know the month and the year when that meeting took place. 
Q.	So -- so you said earlier during your testimony that it was one week after the president died.  Are you retracting from that or are you maintaining that? 
A.	Because you just said I should be precise, I stand by my previous testimony. 
Q.	So today it is one week.  On 18th January 2000, nine years ago, almost 10 years ago, it was two weeks after Habyarimana's death.  You are sure it's in April anyhow? 
A.	Thank you.  The person who recorded my statement may have been mistaken.  I provided an approximation to the effect that it must have been one week following the death of
	President Habyarimana.  If you take the week in which the president died and the week thereafter, you have a total of two weeks.  And I would wish you came to that very understanding as I did. 
Q.	I'm not sure I'm following you on that.  Is it one week or two weeks after the president's death? 
A.	It was during the week that followed the week in which the president died.  In any event, it was between one or two weeks. 
Q.	And the hour of the day?  You stated earlier that the meeting started before noon, are you maintaining that? 
A.	Yes, the meeting -- held before afternoon. 
Q.	So can you tell us precisely at what time it started and what time it finished? 
A.	Thank you.  I wasn't wearing a watch to be able to give you an exact time.  But I can confirm that it started at about 10 or 11 a.m. and ended in the afternoon. 
Q.	At what time in the afternoon?  Did you have lunch there? 
A.	Lunch was not served at the meeting place.  But I'm telling you that it ended in the afternoon because I left the meeting at some point before it came to an end.  And I left because I went to pray, to have my afternoon prayer. 
Q.	So in January 2000 you will probably tell me that the person who recorded your statement and said that, "The meeting started at 6 p.m. and ended around 10 p.m." committed a mistake? 
A.	I have already provided clear enough explanations to that point.  I made the explanations to the President of the Chamber, when I said that the meeting had started in the evening, because I had left at 3:30 to pray, and then I returned thereafter.  

So if any reference is being made to late in the evening, it must have been around 6 p.m.  I started the meeting.  Then I went out to pray at 3:30.  And I have already explained that those who drafted my statement did not follow properly, and I have insisted that those time frames be corrected. 
Q.	Indeed, when you testified in *******************, you said you were in that meeting up to 3:30.  Do you remember stating that in ***********************? 
A.	Yes, what you say is correct. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
If the registry could assist, I have copies of the testimony of the witness in Bicamumpaka.  I will be referring to that.  So I think it would be useful for the -- I have copies that were circulated to the translators already.  And I have here -- so these are -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, organise your work in such a way that we stop exactly at 5:30 because we have other commitments after that. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I will take that into account, Your Honour.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the interpreters, the French and English booth, do not have copies of the transcript. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, are you going to serve the interpreters with copies?  Because they don't have any. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I provided the copies to the interpreters' booths this morning in provision of what was going to happen.  And my understanding -- I had one extra copy which I circulated, and was supposed to be copied and provided to all the interpreters' booths.  But I can have some ready for tomorrow morning in any case. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Interpreters, have you found the copies?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We do not have copies in the booth, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can avail them this copy.  I will share with the Judges so that we can make progress.  That is English. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So, indeed, in your testimony in ********************* you said that you left for prayers around 3:30.  You remember that?
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That has been asked and answered, Counsel. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, can we also have copies of the transcript that counsel is using. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And, Counsel, as you have decided to use the transcript, perhaps you could point to the pages where you are reading so that everybody can follow. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, if the witness acknowledged the content of the testimony, then I will leave it at that.  If there are contradictions or things that should be outlined in those transcripts, I will definitely bring the attention of the Court to those relevant extracts. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Fair enough.  But the Prosecution doesn't have copies. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
It was disclosed to us by the Prosecutor, so I'm surprised that they do not have copies of the transcripts for the witness they put on the stand. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
That is most unfair, what counsel has just said.  We have disclosed many things to him.  But it would have been courteous for him to point out that he's going to use this document.  We would have brought it.  

In any event, we just to need to see his copy so that we can compare it again to whatever else we have for ease of reference.  So to dismiss that matter in the way that he has done is most discourteous and I'm surprised.  It is standard practice that he should point those things to us.  And especially the 
page number that he needs to -- to refer to.  As the Court pleases. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Madam President, I -- we never provided copies of the statements we are using during the cross-examination of the witnesses.  Those statements were all disclosed by the Prosecutor.  I think there's a fair expectation that they will be used during the cross-examinations.  If the practice now tends to be that we have to make copies of the prior statements as well, then we will abide by that.  But we don't think we've been unfair or that we're trying to ambush or -- or -- I think the objectives used by the Prosecutor were unfair themselves. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the point that is being made is that when you are going to cross-examine a witness, it is always proper for you to indicate the documents on which you are going to rely in your cross-examination.  

It may be that the Prosecution has those documents.  But if you don't indicate that you're going to use them, then they will not bring them.  So we did point to this matter in the beginning and we expect Defence counsel, or any other counsel, indeed, before cross-examination, to avail the other party with a list of documents, and better still with copies where they don't have those documents, so that we don't waste time in arguing about these matters.  

So, with all the other witnesses kindly arrange a list and kindly arrange copies of documents.  If you are aware that the Prosecution has those documents, just point out that you are going to use those documents so that the Prosecution can carry them along with them for the cross-examination.

Yes, Prosecution -- 

And we need to know the pages as well.  It's not only the Prosecution.  So, Counsel, bear that in mind as we proceed with the cross-examination. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, in 2000 you said you went to a meeting between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.  On 
	4/5th March 2004, when you testified before this Court, you stated that you were in a meeting up to 3:30.  And the reference for that is on 4th March 2004 at pages 32, 33 and 35.  

At the bottom of page 32, the last line:  "I attended that meeting during the morning hours and when it was around 3 p.m. I went to pray because the place of the meeting of the rally was close to the mosque where I used to pray.  When I came back from the prayers I found that there was some entertainment.  The meeting had been closed.  It means that the meeting had lasted up to around 3:30 after which time people started socialising, but they might have gone home much later.  But the meeting had ended around 3:30."  

So your current version is that which you provided in *********************, the meeting was held from before lunch till around 3.30, is that your testimony? 
A.	I would be happy if you accepted that this was my version.  I explained in the ********************* and I retain -- I maintain my position, even today.

Madam President, I would like to ask for permission to give a more exhaustive answer on this 
particular question on this specific issue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Defence.  Have you got the answer you wanted?  The witness would like to give us an explanation and I think we need to have the explanation. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Of course, Your Honour.  He's welcome to do so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, give the explanation but be brief. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  This is what I would like to say.  When reference is made to the end of the meeting, it was the end of the meeting as far as I was concerned because I left to go and pray.  And by the time I returned, the meeting was already over and people were chatting among themselves and socialising and sharing a drink.  So I did not leave at the end of the meeting.  But I considered that to be the end, since I had left by that time because on my return the meeting was already over. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	So when you returned from your prayers to the meeting where people were socialising, did you remain there? 
A.	No, did I not remain at that location.  You see, when I returned people were drinking and I do not drink, so I went back home. 
Q.	And at what time did you get back home? 
A.	Thank you.  Please do not ask me too many questions on time or about time.  I did not have a wristwatch.  And it was late afternoon, and it was beginning to get dark. 
Q.	So did you leave the meeting to go to bed? 
A.	No, I did not go to bed immediately.  I had to look for some food because I had not eaten all day long. 
Q.	Where did you go?  Where -- what did you do?  Where did you buy food?  Just give us the precise details of what you did when you left that meeting.  
A.	I was single.  I did not cook, so I went to eat at a restaurant. 
Q.	Alone or with some friends?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, is this relevant to the issue you went to demonstrate. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next question will show what I want to demonstrate, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
We want you to quickly get to the issue you want to demonstrate because of constraints of time. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I will finish by 5:30 today on that issue. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Sorry. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are in open session so you need to be careful.
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.      (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) 

I'm jumping now to page 35.  "Now, after your roommate" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, if counsel would slow down for the benefit of the interpreters. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I apologise. 
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	Answer from you:  "I asked him how the meeting had ended and he told me that no other person had taken the floor since I left, apart from socialising while taking -- while drinking.  And, as I said, I found them taking alcohol when I came back."  

I now jump, on page 3 at line 6:  "You then left for your home" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, Counsel, for the interpreters, please.  Madam President. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
So I'm going to start from line 6 at page 3. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you are giving the interpreters a hard time because they can't catch up with you.  
Slow down.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I apologise, Your Honour.  I will slow down.  
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Q.	I am on page 3 of 5th March.  You then left for your home on that particular day.  "It was actually time to go to bed.  It was already at night.  Although the day had not ended, it was already nighttime and it was time to go to bed."  

So did you go to the restaurant or did you go to your bed? 
A.	Thank you for your question.  I have explained a number of things to you, but you skipped some of the explanations that I provided.  Yes, indeed, I said that I did not remain at that location where people were drinking alcohol.  I said that I went to my home.  I also said that later on I went to get some food and then later on I saw my friend.  We had a chat.  And he told me that after I had left, no one else spoke at the meeting.  That, I believe, is coherent and does not contradict my previous testimony on this matter.  

Counsel, please, I beg you to understand that I too am a human being and it is not easy to repeat 
word for word everything that I said in another trial.  You also may want to remember that the 
Presiding Judge in the Trial Chamber in which I am testifying now has asked me to be brief and concise in my explanations. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will go into short closed session.  

Registry.
