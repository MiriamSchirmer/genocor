 2                          [Open session]
 3                          [Status Conference]
 4                          [The accused entered court]
 5                          --- Upon commencing at 2.15 p.m.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Call the case, please.
 7            THE REGISTRAR:  Case number IT-98-32-T, the Prosecutor versus
 8    Mitar Vasiljevic.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  For the Prosecution, Mr. Groome?
10            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, Dermot Groome and Sabine Bauer.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you, for the accused?
12            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Vladimir Domazet for the accused.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.  This Status Conference has been
14    called because the Rules of Procedure and Evidence require it to be called
15    within 120 days of the last time the accused was in court.  Is there
16    anything either party wishes to raise in accordance with the rule?
17            MR. GROOME:  Not from the Prosecution, Your Honour.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, Mr. Domazet?
19            MR. DOMAZET:  No, Your Honour, we have no -- we have nothing to --
20            JUDGE HUNT:  I rather suspected that would be the case.  However,
21    it is always a good idea, even if it's inconvenient to you, Mr. Domazet,
22    to bring you here for the conference so that your client will feel he's
23    still being looked after by somebody.  You're both no doubt wondering when
24    the judgement is going to be delivered.  I will not give you any promises
25    but I hope it will not be very much longer but you should not expect it

 1    before the vacation.
 2            With that, we will adjourn.
 3                          --- Whereupon the Status Conference
 4                          adjourned at 2.17 p.m.
