          2                 [Status Conference]
          3                 [Open session]
          4                 [The accused entered court]
          5                 --- Upon commencing at 9.59 a.m.
          6            JUDGE HUNT:  Call the case, please.
          7            THE REGISTRAR:  Good morning, Your Honour.
          8  The case number, IT-98-32-PT, the Prosecutor versus
          9  Mitar Vasiljevic.
         10            JUDGE HUNT:  Appearances, please.
         11            MS. KORNER:  Joanna Korner representing the
         12  Prosecution together with Ann Sutherland.
         13            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you, Ms. Korner.
         14            For the accused.
         15            MR. DOMAZET:  Vladimir Domazet, counsel of
         16  Mitar Vasiljevic.
         17            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Mr. Vasiljevic, are
         18  you able to hear the proceedings in a language which
         19  you understand?
         20            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.
         21            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.  You may
         22  sit down.
         23            This is a Status Conference held in
         24  accordance with the provisions of Rule 65 and within
         25  the time limit imposed by that Rule.

          1            Ms. Korner, what is happening about the
          2  disclosure of the supporting material?
          3            MS. KORNER:  Well, Your Honour, the
          4  supporting material was disclosed to Mr. Domazet some
          5  time ago when he came onto the case.
          6            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  I remember you were
          7  waiting until counsel was appointed.
          8            MS. KORNER:  That's right.
          9            JUDGE HUNT:  Do you remember what date it
         10  was?
         11            MS. KORNER:  Off the top of my head I can't,
         12  no.  I'm sure Ms. Sutherland will be able to assist me.
         13            JUDGE HUNT:  Was it in a language the accused
         14  understands?
         15            MS. KORNER:  Yes.  Can I mention on that
         16  topic, Your Honour, this:  The disclosure took place
         17  with the name and any information which might identify
         18  the witnesses redacted.  However, that is how it went
         19  before the Confirming Judge.  So in this case, as
         20  opposed to another case which Your Honour is seized of,
         21  the supporting material is in identical form.
         22            JUDGE HUNT:  Good.  Thank you very much.  I
         23  rather suspected that might be the case.
         24            MS. KORNER:  But, Your Honour, could I say
         25  this:  We served upon the Court, if that's the right

          1  word, lodged with the Court a motion for protective
          2  measures in identical terms to the one which has been
          3  put in place in the case of Brdjanin and Talic.  That
          4  was given to counsel who originally represented
          5  Mr. Vasiljevic, but I understand from speaking to
          6  Mr. Domazet very briefly this morning that he never
          7  received it, and Your Honour will have seen there's
          8  been no response lodged to that motion within the time
          9  period, but I think that's because Mr. Domazet's never
         10  had it.
         11            JUDGE HUNT:  Right.  What about the -- any
         12  additional statements from -- what is it? -- Rule
         13  66(A)(ii)?
         14            MS. KORNER:  Can I put Your Honour in the
         15  picture straight away?  Some further statements have
         16  been taken.  They're in the process of being
         17  translated.  They will be disclosed to the Defence as
         18  soon as that is done, and effective, Your Honour, this
         19  case is ready to go any time that this Trial Chamber
         20  orders it, so far as the Prosecution is concerned.
         21            JUDGE HUNT:  When do you expect to serve
         22  these further statements.
         23            MS. KORNER:  It will be a question of the
         24  translation department.  As Your Honour may know, it's
         25  very overburdened in the moment.  We would hope within

          1  the next two to three weeks.
          2            JUDGE HUNT:  Right.  Thank you very much.
          3            Well, Mr. Domazet, when were you served with
          4  the supporting material, do you remember?
          5            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.  I think, Your Honour, it
          6  was about 15 February, I think, 15 or 16.  I was here.
          7            JUDGE HUNT:  Does that mean, from your
          8  silence, that we are not going to have an application
          9  under Rule 72 in relation to the form of the
         10  indictment?
         11            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honour.
         12            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  That means we're not
         13  going to get any application.  Thank you very much.
         14            Now, is there any matter which you wish to
         15  raise within the terms of Rule 65 in relation to your
         16  client?
         17            MR. DOMAZET:  No, Your Honour.  I'm awaiting
         18  additional materials and we are preparing our witnesses
         19  and the others.
         20            JUDGE HUNT:  But you are familiar, are you,
         21  with the terms of Rule 65 bis as to the matters which
         22  you are entitled to raise on behalf of your client?
         23            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes, Your Honour.
         24            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.  And
         25  there's nothing further you want to raise?

          1            MR. DOMAZET:  No.
          2            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Well, is there
          3  anything that either party wishes to raise at this
          4  stage?
          5            MS. KORNER:  Only this, Your Honour, and it
          6  doesn't really particularly apply, but the question of
          7  protective measures does apply to a number of cases,
          8  and I think it would assist if we were to have some
          9  idea of when we were likely to get a ruling.
         10            JUDGE HUNT:  Hopefully soon.  The draft is
         11  well under way.
         12            MS. KORNER:  Thank you.
         13            JUDGE HUNT:  If I may remind you -- probably
         14  you do not need reminding, Ms. Korner, but there is the
         15  continuing obligation which the Prosecution has under
         16  Rule 66, 67, and 68, and no doubt you'll keep it in
         17  mind should anything further arise.
         18            Nothing further you wish to raise,
         19  Mr. Domazet?
         20            MR. DOMAZET:  No, Your Honour.  About this 65
         21  bis, no.
         22            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.  That so --
         23            MS. KORNER:  I'm so sorry.  May I just
         24  mention one other matter.  I think it may assist the
         25  Court to know that not only do we anticipate being in a

          1  position to go; Pre-Trial brief will be begun and
          2  lodged quite soon.  But it's a very short case.  We
          3  anticipate that the Prosecution case will take no more
          4  than about 14 days in all.
          5            JUDGE HUNT:  So that if we have a slot for a
          6  short case, this is a good candidate.
          7            MS. KORNER:  Absolutely.  Yes.
          8            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much for that.
          9  I'm not holding out any promises, I should say, but
         10  it's a very good idea to have a case ready to run at
         11  short notice, hopefully.
         12            MS. KORNER:  Yes.  Ms. Sutherland reminds me,
         13  correctly, that perhaps if the Registry were to provide
         14  Mr. Domazet with a copy of the motion, because he
         15  hasn't had it, would Your Honour say that he could then
         16  have 14 days from today to respond if he so wishes?
         17            JUDGE HUNT:  That depends on whether he will
         18  be served with it today.
         19            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, I merely raised it
         20  to assist Mr. Domazet.
         21            JUDGE HUNT:  Oh, yes.  I understand that.
         22  Well, just one moment.
         23                 [Trial Chamber and legal officer confer]
         24            JUDGE HUNT:  We'll seek to ensure that
         25  Mr. Domazet gets a copy of that motion today, and we'll

          1  extend the time for 14 days from today in which to
          2  respond to that motion for protective measures.  That's
          3  all.  Thank you very much for attending, and we'll
          4  adjourn.
          5                 --- Whereupon the Status Conference
          6                 adjourned at 10.08 a.m.
