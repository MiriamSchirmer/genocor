18            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Sit down, please.
19            Trial Chamber II is sitting today to deliver judgement in the
20    trial of Mitar Vasiljevic.  For the purposes of this hearing I propose to
21    summarise briefly the issues which arose during the trial and the findings
22    of the Trial Chamber in relation to those issues.  I emphasise that this
23    is a summary only and that it forms no part of the judgement which is
24    delivered.  The only authoritative account of the Trial Chamber's findings
25    and of its reasons for those findings is to be found in the written

 1    judgement, copies of which will be made available to the parties and to
 2    the public at the conclusion of this hearing.
 3            The trial arose out of events which took place in 1992 in the town
 4    of Visegrad located on the bank of the Drina River in the Visegrad
 5    Municipality in south-eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina close to the border with
 6    the Republic of Serbia.  Prior to the armed conflict the majority of the
 7    people who lived in the municipality were of Muslim ethnicity which
 8    outnumbered the Serb minority by almost two to one.  Ethnic tensions
 9    flared up after the multi-party elections in November of 1990 returned a
10    municipal council which closely matched the ethnic composition of the
11    municipality.
12            Members of the Serb and Muslim ethnicities armed themselves and
13    early in 1992, violence between them followed.  The attack upon the
14    non-Serb civilian population took many forms, starting with the Serb
15    takeover of the town and the systematic and large-scale criminal campaign
16    of murders, rapes, and mistreatment of the non-Serb population of the
17    municipality, particularly the Muslims, which eventually culminated in one
18    of the most comprehensive and ruthless campaigns of ethnic cleansing in
19    the Bosnian conflict.  Hundreds of mostly Muslim men and women, children
20    and elderly people were killed.  One of the most violent of the
21    paramilitary groups operating in the area was led by Milan Lukic, a former
22    resident of Visegrad.  This paramilitary group entered the town of
23    Visegrad and committed many very serious crimes there with the complicity
24    or at least with the acquiescence, of the Serb authorities who had taken
25    control of the area.

 1            The trial was principally -- was concerned principally with two
 2    incidents which took place in Visegrad between the month of June, 1992.
 3            The first took place on the 7th of June.  Milan Lukic and a number
 4    of other men led seven Bosnian Muslim men to the bank of the Drina River
 5    where they forced the Muslim men to line up on the bank of the river and
 6    to face the river.  Despite pleas by the Muslims for their lives they were
 7    shot from behind.  When it appeared that someone was still alive, the men
 8    lying in the water were shot at again at close range.  Five of the Muslim
 9    men were killed but the other two men escaped by pretending to be dead as
10    they lay in the water.  This has been referred to as the Drina River
11    incident.
12            The second incident took place on the 14th of June, 1992.  About
13    70 Bosnian Muslim women, children, and elderly men were directed to enter
14    a house in Pionirska Street in the Mahala neighbourhood of the Visegrad
15    municipality.  An inflammable substance had been spread in the area in
16    which the Muslims were locked before land.  When this large group had been
17    forced inside that house it was set on fire with an incendiary device.
18    Most of the group died in the fire.  Some escaped before the fire and
19    others were successful in escaping during the fire.  This has been
20    referred to as the Pionirska Street incident.
21            The accused, Mitar Vasiljevic, was charged separately in relation
22    to each of the two incidents with a number of crimes, alleging that he
23    acted in concert with Milan Lukic and others to commit murder, both as a
24    crime against humanity and as a violation of the laws or customs of war,
25    inhumane acts as a crime against humanity and violence to life and person,

 1    as a violation of the laws or customs of war.  In relation to the
 2    Pionirska Street incident, the accused was also charged with extermination
 3    in concert with Milan Lukic and others, as a crime against humanity.
 4            Finally, in relation to both incidents, taken cumulatively the
 5    accused has been charged with persecution on political racial or religious
 6    grounds as a crime against humanity by participating in the murder of
 7    Bosnian Muslim and other non-Serb civilians, the harassment, terrorisation
 8    and psychological abuse of such civilians and the theft and destruction of
 9    personal property of such civilians.
10            Mitar Vasiljevic was a member of the Serb minority in Visegrad.
11    He had worked as a waiter in various establishments around town.  The
12    Prosecution claimed that he was also a member of or was associated with
13    the Serb paramilitary group led by Milan Lukic.  Such an association was
14    put forward by the Prosecution as establishing that the accused shared the
15    homicidal intent of that paramilitary group.  There was a close family
16    relationship between the two men.  Evidence was also led from a number of
17    witnesses that they had seen the accused with Milan Lukic and others when
18    serious crimes were committed by them.  In almost every case, evidence of
19    the participation of the accused in the activities of the paramilitary
20    group was given by one witness only and the evidence of identification by
21    that witness was poor.
22            The Trial Chamber has concluded that the only association of the
23    accused with the Milan Lukic group, which was established, other than in
24    relation to the two incidents with which the trial was concerned, was that
25    he participated in the search of a Muslim family's home in the village of

 1    Musici and that he was a ready source of local information for the group
 2    about the location of Muslims in the area.  The Trial Chamber is satisfied
 3    that he gave that information to the group with the full realisation that
 4    it would be used by the group to persecute Muslims.
 5            In relation to the first incident, the accused admitted that he
 6    had been present at the shooting of the men on the bank of the Drina
 7    River.  He claimed that his presence there was accidental and that he had
 8    not realised that the men were to be killed until they were approaching
 9    the river, when he tried to persuade Milan Lukic to spare the lives of
10    these men.  The Trial Chamber is satisfied that the accused did not try to
11    persuade Milan Lukic to spare their lives, that he willingly accompanied
12    Milan Lukic and his group with the seven Muslim men to the Drina River,
13    and that he was participating with that group in a joint criminal
14    enterprise that all seven of the men be killed.  As only five died he has
15    been found to have incurred individual criminal responsibility for the
16    murder of those five men, both as a crime against humanity and as a
17    violation of the laws or customs of war.  In relation to the two men who
18    escaped being killed in that shooting, the Trial Chamber is satisfied that
19    the attempted killing amounted to a serious attack on the human dignity of
20    these two men and that it caused them immeasurable mental suffering.  The
21    accused has thus been found to have incurred individual criminal
22    responsibility for inhumane acts as a crime against humanity.
23            The Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the charge of a violation
24    to life and person as a violation of the laws or customs of war
25    constitutes an offence under customary law giving rise to individual

 1    criminal responsibility, and the accused has been acquitted of this
 2    charge.
 3            In relation to the second incident, the accused admitted that he
 4    had been present in Pionirska Street during the course of the afternoon of
 5    the 14th of June, 1992, but he denied participating in any way in relation
 6    to the Pionirska Street incident.  The Prosecution alleged that the
 7    accused took part in looting from the Muslim group late in the afternoon
 8    but the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the evidence of identification
 9    is sufficiently reliable as to warrant the conclusion that the accused was
10    present at that time.
11            The Trial Chamber is satisfied that the forcing of the Muslims
12    into the house which was then burnt down did not take place before 9.30
13    p.m. that day.  The accused accepts that earlier that day he did speak
14    with a group of people there, but he says that after he had done so, and
15    well before the Muslims were forced to enter that house, he was riding a
16    horse bareback through Visegrad when the horse slipped.  He fell to the
17    ground and the horse fell on top of him breaking his leg.  He was taken
18    first to the Visegrad health centre and then to the Uzice hospital, a trip
19    which would have taken at least an hour.  In other words, the accused
20    relies upon an alibi.  There was a considerable amount of evidence led in
21    relation to this alibi.
22            It should be clearly understood that when an issue of alibi arises
23    upon the evidence, the accused bears no onus of proof in relation to it.
24    An alibi means only that the accused denies being where the Prosecution
25    alleges he was at the time the crime was committed.  As part of its case

 1    of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was at Pionirska
 2    Street when the Muslims were forced into the house which was then burnt
 3    down, the Prosecution must eliminate any reasonable possibility that the
 4    alibi upon which the accused relies is true.  In this case, the
 5    Prosecution had to eliminate any reasonable possibility that the accused
 6    was in or on the way to the Uzice hospital at 9.30 p.m., the earliest time
 7    when the Muslims were forced into that house.
 8            The Trial Chamber does not accept a great deal of the evidence
 9    which was led on behalf of the accused in support of the alibi.  There
10    were, however, some pivotal pieces of evidence tendered, the admission
11    ledgers of the Uzice hospital and the case history of a man by the name of
12    Mitar Vasiljevic, who was admitted to that hospital on the 14th of June,
13    1992, at 9.35 p.m.  These records were subjected by the Prosecution to
14    extensive and repeated forensic analysis, and was conceded by the
15    Prosecution that they showed no sign of forgery.  The Prosecution
16    therefore had to eliminate any reasonable possibility that the accused was
17    the man who was admitted under the name of Mitar Vasiljevic to the Uzice
18    hospital on the date and at the time recorded in those hospital records.
19            Dr. Moljevic was a doctor at the orthopaedic ward of the hospital
20    and a member of the triage team at its admission centre at the relevant
21    time.  He knew the accused well and he was notified of the imminent
22    arrival of the accused because of his friendship with him.  He had a clear
23    recollection of the events of that day although he did rely upon the
24    admission ledgers, the authenticity of which the Prosecution was unable to
25    challenge for the date and precise time of admission.  The Trial Chamber

 1    accepts the evidence of Dr. Moljevic that the accused was in Uzice
 2    hospital by 9.35 p.m. on the day of the fire as corroboration of the
 3    admission ledgers.  The Prosecution has thus failed to establish beyond
 4    reasonable doubt that the accused was in Pionirska Street at the time the
 5    Muslims were forced into the house and when it was burnt down.
 6            This places a substantial degree of importance upon the activities
 7    of the accused at the time when he admits he was in Pionirska Street
 8    earlier in the afternoon.  The Prosecution argued that the accused had
 9    sought to persuade the group of Muslims in Pionirska Street to stay
10    together so that he could inform Milan Lukic of their whereabouts, who
11    would then commit the crimes which were in fact subsequently committed,
12    including looting.  The Trial Chamber is satisfied that the accused did
13    seek to ensure that the group stayed together because he knew that some
14    evil was to befall them.  This would have made him a participant in a
15    joint criminal enterprise to commit whatever crime he knew was to
16    befall them, or at least to have incurred an individual criminal
17    responsibility by aiding and abetting in that crime.  The Prosecution,
18    however, failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt just what the evil
19    was which the accused knew was to befall the group of Muslims in Pionirska
20    Street.
21            In those circumstances, the Prosecution failed to establish any
22    of the three crimes charged separately in relation to the Pionirska Street
23    incident, murder, as both a crime against humanity and as a violation of
24    the laws or customs of war, and inhumane acts as a crime against humanity.
25    The Trial Chamber is therefore acquitted the accused of those charges.

 1    The charge of violence to life and person has failed for the same reason
 2    as it failed in relation to the Drina River incident.  The additional
 3    charge in relation to the Pionirska Street incident, that of
 4    extermination, has also failed because of the failure of the Prosecution
 5    to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in Pionirska
 6    Street at the relevant time or that he was aware that these people were to
 7    be killed.
 8            This leaves the charge of persecution on political, racial, or
 9    religious grounds as a crime against humanity, which has to be considered
10    in relation to all of the relevant acts of the accused in their context
11    and their cumulative effect.  As a result of the findings already made,
12    these acts were effectively only those giving rise to the accused's
13    individual criminal responsibility for murder as both a crime against
14    humanity and as a violation of the laws or customs of war and inhumane
15    acts as a crime against humanity in relation to the Drina River incident.
16    The Trial Chamber is satisfied that the five Muslim men were killed and
17    that the inhumane acts were committed against the other two Muslim men
18    only because they were Muslims and that they had been singled out for
19    religious or political reasons.  The acts were thus discriminatory
20    both in fact and in intent.  The accused is therefore been found to have
21    incurred individual criminal responsibility for the crime of persecution
22    as a crime against humanity in relation to the five men and the inhumane
23    acts committed against the two survivors.
24            The question of cumulative convictions then arises.  It is
25    permissible to record a conviction for the crime of murder as a violation

 1    of the laws or customs of war pursuant to Article 5 of the Tribunal's
 2    statute.  Together with a crime -- together with a conviction for a crime
 3    against humanity pursuant to Article 3, despite the fact that both
 4    convictions arise out of the same set of facts.  The real issue in
 5    relation to cumulative convictions in the present case arises in relation
 6    to the three crimes against humanity in relation to which the accused has
 7    been found to have incurred individual criminal responsibility.  As
 8    persecution incorporates the ingredients of both murder as a crime against
 9    humanity and inhumane acts, and it is -- and as it is more specific than
10    either of those crimes, a conviction for persecution must be entered in
11    lieu of convictions for murder and inhumane acts.
12            Accordingly, the accused has been convicted for the crimes of
13    persecution, that is as a crime against humanity under count 3, which
14    conviction incorporates his individual criminal responsibility for the
15    murder of the five men and the inhumane acts in relation to the two
16    survivors, and of murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war in
17    relation to the five men charged in count 5.  He has been acquitted in
18    relation to counts 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 13.
19            In sentencing the accused for these two convictions, it is
20    important to emphasise that the accused is to be punished for the totality
21    of his criminal conduct and of his -- and his overall culpability and that
22    any prejudice which he will or may suffer because of cumulative
23    convictions have been based upon the same criminal conduct must be taken
24    into account.  He is not to be punished for either the number of crimes
25    for which he has incurred individual criminal responsibility or the number

 1    of convictions entered in relation to his conduct.
 2            The principal issue raised in relation to sentencing is the claim
 3    by the accused that at the time of the Drina River incident, his mental
 4    responsibility for his actions was diminished.  Considerable psychiatric
 5    evidence was given by both parties on this issue but the Trial Chamber is
 6    not satisfied that the accused claim has been made out.  The Trial Chamber
 7    has, however, taken into account in mitigation the general spirit of
 8    cooperation, very properly shown by lead counsel for the accused, who trod
 9    a careful path in assisting the Trial Chamber without in any way
10    compromising his obligations to the accused, conduct for which the accused
11    himself should be given credit.  The personal circumstances of the
12    accused, in particular the fact that he's married and has two children
13    have also been taken into account by the Trial Chamber as a mitigating
14    factor.
15            The Trial Chamber accepts that the accused was not a commander,
16    that his crimes were geographically very limited and that there is no
17    evidence that his acts encouraged other offenders other than as found in
18    relation to the Drina River incident, or affected other victims of such
19    crimes within the broader context of the conflict.  The Trial Chamber has
20    taken into account the fact that the position of the accused in the
21    hierarchy was a low one.  It does not accept that the accused played any
22    particularly significant role in the broader context of this conflict but
23    it notes that an accused's level in the overall hierarchy in the conflict
24    is not ultimately decisive of the sentence given.  The fact that he was a
25    low level offender in terms of the overall conflict in the former

 1    Yugoslavia cannot alter the seriousness of the offences for which he has
 2    been convicted or the circumstances in which he committed them.  His
 3    crimes were particularly serious in terms of the protected interests which
 4    he violated.  The life as well as the physical and mental integrity of the
 5    victims, the consequences for the victims, death for five of them and
 6    great suffering for the other two, and the reasons for which these crimes
 7    were committed, that is no reason other than sheer ethnic hatred.
 8            Relevant to sentencing is the discriminatory intent with which the
 9    crimes were carried out.  Such an intent is an ingredient of the crime of
10    persecution and it is relevant as such to the seriousness of that crime.
11    It may also be an aggravating feature in relation to the crime of murder
12    as a violation of the laws or customs of war.  It is an aggravating
13    feature of that crime in this case. During the Bosnian conflict, ethnicity
14    was exploited variously to gain political prominence or to retain power,
15    to justify criminal deeds or for the purpose of obtaining moral absolution
16    for any act coloured by the ethnic cause.  No such absolution is to be
17    expected from this Tribunal.  The Trial Chamber considers that crimes
18    based upon ethnic grounds are particularly reprehensible.  The Trial
19    Chamber also considers as aggravation the fact that the pleas by the men
20    for their lives were completely ignored by the accused, the cold-blooded
21    nature of the execution, and to perhaps a lesser extent the fact that one
22    of the victims was well known to the accused.
23            Mr. Vasiljevic, would you stand up, please?
24            Mitar Vasiljevic, you are sentenced to a single sentence of
25    imprisonment for 20 years.  You are entitled to credit for the period of

 1    two years, ten months and four days you have been in custody towards
 2    service of the sentence imposed, together with a period you will serve in
 3    custody pending a determination by the President of the Tribunal as to the
 4    state where the sentence is to be served.  You are to remain in custody
 5    until such determination is made.
 6            The Trial Chamber will now adjourn.
