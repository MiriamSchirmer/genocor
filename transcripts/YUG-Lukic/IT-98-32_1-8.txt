 2              [Open session]
 3              [The accused entered court]
 4              --- Upon commencing at 9.30 a.m.
 5      JUDGE HUNT:  Call the case, please.
 6     THE REGISTRAR:  Case number IT-98-32-T the Prosecutor versus Mitar
 7  Vasiljevic.
 8      JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, Mr. Groome?
 9      MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour before I call the next witness --
 10      THE INTERPRETER: Microphone, please.
 11      JUDGE HUNT:  Microphone, please.
 12      MR. GROOME:  -- I would like to inform the Court of the
 13   following:  In light of the Registry's change in the court's schedule and
 14  some of the discussion yesterday, we've relooked at the schedule of
 15  witnesses and I would anticipate, Your Honour, that we will endeavour to
 16   close or rest the Prosecution case on Friday, the 28th of September, that
 17  is a fair bit ahead of schedule but given our discussion yesterday, I
 18  think that is possible, and that is what we are attempting to do.
 19      JUDGE HUNT:  Well, you won't be punished if you don't succeed but
 20  we are very grateful to you for trying, Mr. Groome.
 21      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour the Prosecution calls its next witness
 22  who has a pseudonym number 32.
 23      JUDGE HUNT:  VG32?
 24      MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
25	JUDGE HUNT:  As a matter of interest I now see that the Court

 1 clock is slow.  We've been in here three months and it's been fast all the
 2 time.  We'll try to keep to this clock.  Unfortunately, none of the clocks
 3 on our side of the building work so there may be a few problems from time
 4 to time but we'll try to stick to this clock for the time.
  5              [The witness entered court]
  6      JUDGE HUNT:  Sir, would you please make the solemn declaration in
  7  the document that you are being handed by the usher?
  8      THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly declare that I will speak
  9  the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
10              WITNESS:  WITNESS VG32
11              [Witness answered through interpreter]
12      JUDGE HUNT:  Sit down, please, sir.
13              Examined by Mr. Groome:
14     Q.   I'll just ask the usher to move the ELMO?
15      THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.
16      JUDGE HUNT:  You really must leave your microphone on.  It's
17  really only when we have voice distortion or do we have voice distortion?
18      THE REGISTRAR:  No.
19     JUDGE HUNT:  It's only when we have voice distortion that you need
20  to turn it off.
21      MR. GROOME:
22     Q.   Good morning.
23      THE WITNESS: Good morning.
24      MR. GROOME:  Ready to proceed?
25      JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, just go on with it.  I've said, Mr. Groome, that

 1  means you get on with it, please.
 2      MR. GROOME:  Yes.  I've handed up that paper that you requested
 3  yesterday.  Are there any formalities we need to enter it into evidence?
 4      JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, you do.  It's the only record we've got.
 5      MR. GROOME:  I now offer Exhibit 71.
 6     Q.   I'd ask the witness:  Is your name contained on that piece of
 7  paper?
 8     A.   Yes.
 9     Q.   And you realise that you have been assigned a number 32 for the
10  purposes of concealing your identity?
11     A.   Yes.
12      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour would I now move that into evidence under
13  seal as Exhibit number 71 for the Prosecution.
14     JUDGE HUNT:  We have not been given copies.  Have you given a copy
15  to the Defence?
16      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I have -- one second.
17      JUDGE HUNT:  Perhaps if you could give all of that to the Court
18  deputy before the witness arrives, we would save an immense amount of
19  time.  One copy for the Defence.  That will be Exhibit 71 and it is under
20  seal.  Pseudonym document.
21      MR. GROOME:
22     Q.   Sir, I'd ask you to begin by describing briefly your educational
23  and professional background?
24   [redacted] 
25   [redacted]

 1  [redacted]
 2  [redacted]
 3  [redacted]
 4  [redacted]
 5  [redacted]
 6  [redacted]
 7  [redacted]
 8  [redacted]
 9  [redacted]
10  [redacted]
11  [redacted]
12     Q.   Okay.  And are you married?
13     A.   Yes, I am married.  I got married in 1989, and in 1990, I got a
14  daughter.  I have another child, a four-year-old son.
15     Q.   I want to draw your attention now to spring of 1992, in the town
16  of Visegrad.  Did there come a time when you left Visegrad?
17   A.   Yes.  In fact, I left Visegrad on two occasions, the first time in
18  early April 1992, and the second time in early June, again 1992, but the
19  second time I left Visegrad it was under completely different
20  circumstances.
21     Q.   I'd like to talk about the first time you left Visegrad.  Can you
22  explain where you went and why you left Visegrad?
23     A.   I left Visegrad sometime between the 10th and the 12th of April
24  1992 when the conflict broke out in Visegrad.  I think the conflict broke
25   out sometime around the 5th or 6th of April.  As the conflicts first broke

 1   out in the outskirts of the town of Visegrad and as they got nearer to the
 2  town centre, I did not want to take any part in the conflict.  I would
 3   also like to note that I have never been politically active.  I have never
 4  been a member of any political party.  Since I was totally opposed to the
 5  war and because of concerns for the safety of my family, I decided to
 6  leave Visegrad.
 7     Q.   Where did you go?
 8     A.   At first, I thought that I should go to Prijepolje and then on to
 9  Macedonia but it was quite risky to undertake such a journey and that's
10  why I decided to go to the town of Gorazde.
11     Q.   Did there come a time when you returned to Visegrad from Gorazde?
12     A.   Yes.
13     Q.   Can you describe for us the circumstances or the reasons why you
14  returned to Visegrad?
15     A.   In the media, I saw and I heard that the Uzice Corps had entered
16  the town of Visegrad and that the then authorities in Visegrad guaranteed
17  safety to all those who returned to Visegrad regardless of their ethnic
18  background.  And that work obligation has been put into place in the town
19  of Visegrad.
20     Q.   Let me first ask you about these guarantees that were made
21  regarding safety.  How did you learn about these guarantees?
22   A.   The guarantees were made publicly and broadcast over the media, TV
23  and radio.  They were issued by the official military and civilian
24  authorities in the town of Visegrad and by the official police authorities
25  or the police force in the town of Visegrad.

 1     Q.   Had many people from Visegrad fled like yourself to Gorazde?
 2     A.   Yes.
 3     Q.   Now, you also described you returned because of a work
 4  obligation.  Would you please explain what that was?
 5   A.   Work obligation is an obligation imposed on everybody to report to
 6  his post of employment in a certain period of time, within a certain
 7  period of time.  If they fail to do so, they lose their job and once you
 8  lose your job, of course, you lose any remuneration that you would be
 9  otherwise entitled to.  You are just no longer able to support yourself.
10     Q.   Can you approximate for us when you entered Visegrad again?  When
11  did you return?
12     A.   Approximately two weeks later, sometime between the 25th and the
13  1st of May, 25th April, 1st of May.
14   Q.   When you returned to Visegrad, did anything occur on your way back
15  to the town that made you feel unsafe?
16     A.   Yes.
17     Q.   Could you describe what happened?
18     A.   As we returned -- as I returned to Visegrad, I was stopped five
19  times on five different checkpoints and every time I felt uncomfortable.
20  I also have to note that my family was in the car, my wife, my
21  two-year-old daughter and every time I was stopped, I felt very
22  uncomfortable and it wasn't very pleasant.
23     Q.   Who was manning these checkpoints?
24     A.   These were the members of the army.
25     Q.   That is the Yugoslav People's Army?

 1     A.   Yes.
 2   Q.   When you finally arrived back in Visegrad, were there other -- did
 3  you feel safe when you returned to Visegrad?
 4     A.   No.
 5     Q.   I'd ask you to describe for the Chamber some of the reasons why
 6  you did not feel safe when you returned to Visegrad.
 7     A.   The first reason why I felt unsafe in Visegrad was the frequent
 8  shooting in the town.  Furthermore, quite a few people of Muslim ethnic
 9  background were obliged to report to the police station regularly, and as
10  time went by, my feeling of insecurity and my concern grew.
11     Q.   The people of Muslim background that were required to go to the
12  police station, do you know what happened to them at the police station?
13     A.   Most of them never returned.
14   Q.   Do you know of people that were interrogated at the police station
15  during this time?
16     A.   Yes.
17     Q.   You mentioned shooting.  Did you ever see incendiary rounds being
18  fired at night?
19     A.   Yes.
20     Q.   How frequently did you see that?
21     A.   Virtually every evening.
22     Q.   Did you ever see a soldier from the Uzice Corps firing his
23  automatic weapon outside your place of employment?
24     A.   Yes.
25     Q.   Would you explain the circumstances for that?

 1   A.   I remember it very well because one day when I came to work, since
 2  the hospital and the health care centre are located on the high ground in
 3  the town, and I was on my way to the hospital, I saw a soldier standing in
 4  front of the hospital building.  He took his rifle, pointed it at the sky
 5  and fired a whole burst, a whole clip.  He changed the clip and then fired
 6  it again, emptied it again.  I was quite scared at the time.  I did not
 7  know what was going on and when I arrived at -- in front of the hospital,
 8  I was told that the doctors from the Uzice Corps had delivered a woman of
 9  a baby in the hospital at that time.
10  Q.   I'd ask you just to take the pointer to your right, remain in your
11  seat, and would you just indicate generally where the hospital is in
12  Visegrad?  And that pointer extends.
13     A.   Indicates.
14     Q.   That is on the left bank of the Drina?
15     A.   Yes.
16     Q.   You can resume your seat, thank you.
17     JUDGE HUNT:  Is that the only purpose you need that up there?  You
18  do block the whole of the view of the interpreters.  They do like to see the
19  witness.
20      MR. GROOME:  Perhaps, Your Honour, I'll have him indicate for a
21  few minutes the different areas of the map and then we can take it away.
22      JUDGE HUNT:  Indeed.  Never put it up until it is needed because
23  the interpreters do have an awful lot of trouble.
24      MR. GROOME:  I didn't realise that, Your Honour.
25     Q.   Mr. 32, I'm going to ask you to just indicate general areas that

 1  you will be referring to in your testimony here today and then we can
 2  remove the photograph.  So I'd ask you to take the pointer again.  I'd ask
 3  you to indicate, where is the general area where your home was?
 4     A.   I lived in this house here.
 5   Q.   I'd ask you now to indicate the house where you were hiding at the
 6  time that you were captured.
 7     A.   [indicates].
 8     Q.   And what is the name of that settlement?
 9     A.   This is the settlement of Bikavac.
10      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, that can be removed now.
11      JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
12      MR. GROOME:
13     Q.   Sir, just to be clear, these events that you're talking about,
14  these occurred while the Uzice Corps was still in the town of Visegrad?
15     A.   Yes.
16     Q.   During this time, were you aware of any houses being burned down?
17     A.   Yes.  I actually saw some of it.
18     Q.   Could you please describe what you know about the houses burning
19  down?
20     A.   I know that these houses belonged to the Muslims from Visegrad.
21  Q.   And approximately how many houses are you aware of that burnt down
22  after you returned?
23     A.   I can't tell you the exact number of the houses that had been
24  burned down but I saw a couple of houses on fire, but I don't recall the
25  exact -- I can't give you the exact number for houses in and around

 1  Visegrad.
 2     Q.   So there are houses burnt both inside the town and around the
 3  town; is that correct?
 4     A.   Yes, in the very centre of the town.
 5     Q.   While the Uzice Corps was still present, did you observe any
 6  paramilitary gangs in the town?
 7     A.   Yes.
 8   Q.   And did you become aware of the names of these paramilitary gangs?
 9   A.   At that time, all paramilitary formations present in Visegrad were
10  called by the one name.  Muslims called them Beli Orlovi, White Eagles,
11  although later I learned that there were some other groups, Seselj's men,
12  Arkan's men, but the general term what was used was the White Eagles.
13     Q.   And do you know where these -- did any of these gangs have a
14  headquarters in town?
15     A.   I'm not quite sure, but I do know that one of the paramilitary
16  formations was located in the Visegrad hotel.
17     Q.   And would you see them on a daily basis after you returned to
18  town?
19   A.   I couldn't say that I saw them every day but every -- but whenever
20  I went to work, I saw them.
21     Q.   Did there come a time when you were stopped by some of these
22  paramilitaries?
23     A.   Yes.
24     Q.   And would you describe when that was and what happened?
25   A.   It happened on two occasions:  the first time when the Uzice Corps

 1  was still in the town, and the second time, after their departure, after
 2  the departure of the Uzice Corps, a week after they left.
 3     Q.   Would you please describe the first incident?
 4     A.   One day, as I returned from work, my car was stopped in front of
 5  the Visegrad Hotel.  I was stopped by two armed persons wearing camouflage
 6  uniforms.  They asked me to step out of the car, and asked me to produce
 7  my ID card.  One of the members took my ID card and went towards the
 8  hotel, while the other one asked me to open the boot of my car and also
 9  the bonnet, so he inspected virtually the entire car.  A few minutes
10  later, the person who had taken my ID card to the hotel came back bearing
11  this card, handed it to the other soldier, and told him, "He's not
12  there."  This other man returned my ID card to me and told me that I was
13  free to go.
14     Q.   Could you describe in greater detail how these people were
15  dressed, in particular, any head gear they had on and any insignias they
16  had on their uniforms?
17   A.   They wore camouflage uniforms.  The insignia were in the form of a
18  two-headed eagle.  On their heads they wore different kinds of head gear.
19  Some wore typical Serbian hats, hats typical of people from Serbia.
20  Others had camouflage hats, some had berets, so they had different types
21  of head gear, but they all wore the same insignia, with the two-headed
22  eagle, and they all wore camouflage uniforms.
23     Q.   The two men that stopped you, what were they wearing on their
24  heads?
25     A.   They also had the two-headed eagle insignia.

 1     Q.   How about were they wearing hats?
 2     A.   Yes.  They had hats.  One of them had a camouflage hat and the
 3  other one wore this typical Serbian cap.
 4     Q.   What is the name of that hat?
 5     A.   I think it is called the sajkaca.
 6     Q.   And does that have any significance to Muslims?
 7   A.   Well, the very two-head -- the insignia with the two-headed eagle,
 8  which is called the kokardea, is very significant for Muslims, has a great
 9  deal of significance for Muslims.
10     Q.   Now, you said that you gave your identification papers to one of
11  the --
12      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, can we find out what the significance
13  is?  Having raised it, it might be just as well if we found out.
14      MR. GROOME:
15     Q.   Please tell us the significance of that patch.  What did it mean
16  to Muslims?
17     A.   For the Muslims, it's the same as the Nazi swastika for the Jews,
18  this is the insignia worn by the Chetniks of in the Second World War.
19  They collaborated with the German occupational forces.
20     Q.   When you gave -- you said you gave your identification papers to
21  one of the men.  Where did he go after he took these papers?
22     A.   He went into the hotel building, and then five minutes later, he
23  returned and gave me back my ID card.  Actually, he gave it to the other
24  soldier and -- who in turn gave it to me, and his comment was, "He's not
25  there."

 1     Q.   And what did you understand that to mean?
 2     A.   At that time, I thought that there was probably a list in the
 3  hotel, a list of persons of Muslim ethnicity, and that the person who had
 4  taken my ID card there probably checked whether my name was on this list.
 5     Q.   After this event, did you ever drive your car again?
 6     A.   No.
 7   Q.   Now, you mentioned that some people went to the police station and
 8  did not return.  Were there other people that you were aware of that
 9  disappeared during this time that the Uzice Corps was in town?
10     A.   Yes.
11     Q.   And was one of these people that disappeared a personal friend of
12  yours?
13     A.   Yes.
14     Q.   I'd ask you to describe for the Court the circumstances
15  surrounding the disappearance of that person.
16     A.   It is a Dr. Safet Zojhilovic, who was employed as a gynaecologist
17  in the Visegrad hospital.  He was a very good friend of mine.  I have to
18  note that he also was the obstetrician for my wife when my wife gave birth
19  to my daughter.  Immediately before the Uzice Corps entered Visegrad,
20  together with Svetozar, Dr. Svetozar, Dr. Svetozar Uljarevic the then
21  director of the health care centre, he went to Gorazde, and then through
22  Cajnice and Pljevlja, he went to his home town, Bijelo Polje in
23  Montenegro.
24      When we returned to Visegrad, at the insistence of the military
25  command in the hospital, and the authorities that guaranteed full safety

1  to Dr. Safet Zojhilovic, they asked his wife, a doctor, a paediatrician,
 2  Suhura [phoen] to go and pick him up in an official ambulance, in an
 3  ambulance, to Prijepolje and to ask him -- to Bijelo Polje and to ask him
 4  to come back.
 5     Q.   And did he come back?
 6   A.   Yes.  He came back but, unfortunately, I did not have the occasion
 7  to meet him.  Two or three hours after his return, some armed people came
 8  to his house and took him away.  His wife told me that they treated him
 9  very roughly, and then two or three days later, they set his house on
10  fire.
11     Q.   Who made these guarantees to him that he would be safe if he
12  returned to take care of patients?
13     A.   The then acting director of the health care centre, who was
14  military -- active military person from the Uzice Corps and the then
15  authorities.
16     Q.   And as best as you know, who was it that took him away?
17   A.   I cannot say with any certainty who took him away but I think that
18  it was one of the paramilitary formations.
19     Q.   Now, up until now we've been talking about things that occurred
20  while the Uzice Corps was still in Visegrad.  I'd now ask you to describe
21  for us the day that Uzice Corps left Visegrad.
22   A.   I think it was the 18th of May, 1992.  I was awakened by some kind
23  of unusual gunfire in town and around town.  It was time for me to go to
24  work.  I was very distressed, concerned.  When I went out into the main
25  street that goes through the entire town, I saw a very long column of

 1  military vehicles that were moving in the direction of Uzice.  I realised
 2  at that moment that the Uzice Corps is leaving the town of Visegrad.
 3  Since my family was also upset, I returned home and I told them what all
 4  of this was about.
 5     Q.   Did you see houses burning during this time?
 6     A.   As soon as I got out of the house, I had a pretty good view of
 7  most of Visegrad, and I saw that on the outskirts of Visegrad there were a
 8  few houses on fire.  On the outskirts of the town itself.  That's what I
 9  meant.
10     Q.   And these paramilitaries that you mentioned, did they also leave
11  with the Uzice Corps?
12     A.   No.
13     Q.   You spoke earlier about having two incidents, personally, with
14  these paramilitary gangs.  Would you describe the second incident now for
15  us?
16     A.   I cannot recall the exact date.  This happened after a Red Cross
17  convoy left, and after a group of men were taken at Jagodinja.  I think
18  that this was sometime after the 25th of May.  I was [redacted]
19  [redacted] which I pointed out.  The owner of the house where
20  I lived phoned me and told me that some persons entered my apartment and
21  that they took something.  However, the door had remained open.  She asked
22  me whether I could come and close my apartment.
23     Q.   What happened?
24   A.   I was busy repairing the lock.  A car then stopped in front of the
25  house and two men in uniform got out of it.  I remember very well that one

 1  of them had a red beret and the other one had an ordinary beret.  I think
 2  it was blue.
 3     Q.   What happened?
 4     A.   Well, they simply came up and asked my landlady for the keys to
 5  the Mercedes car that was parked in the garage.  Since the owner of the
 6  car had been in the convoy that I had mentioned, and that he was taken out
 7  of the bus belonging to the convoy in this place called Jagodinja, she did
 8  not have the keys.  I think that he had the keys.  Later on, they brought
 9  a man to break the lock on the Mercedes so that they could turn it on.
10  While they were busy doing that, one of these two men walked up to me and
11  said, "Could you please come in with me into this apartment?"  I walked
12  in, and we sat at the dining-room table.  He asked me then, "Do you want
13  to buy your life?"  I was very surprised.  At one moment I didn't even
14  understand what he meant.  How could I buy a life?  I even asked him,
15  "Well, how do I do that?"  And he said, "Don't pretend not to
16  understand.  Give me some gold, some foreign currency.  Otherwise, I'll
17  hand you over to the guys from Obrenovac.  "I'm not a Chetnik."  That's
18  literally what he said, "I'm not a Chetnik, a killer.  I am a Chetnik
19  robber."
20     Q.   Had you ever heard somebody refer to a group of people from
21  Obrenovac before?
22     A.   I think that once I heard this but this was the first time I
23  actually heard this in public from a member of a Serb paramilitary
24  formation, that such a group exists.
25     Q.   Was there a time that the rest of your family, your wife and your

 1  child at that time, left Visegrad?
 2     A.   Yes.
 3     Q.   And when was that?
 4   A.   I said already that on the 18th of May, when I saw the Uzice Corps
 5  leaving, I came back home and I told my family about this.  At the
 6  insistence of my mother-in-law, that is to say my wife's mother, on that
 7  day, my wife, our daughter, her sister, her two children and her mother
 8  left town.  They took a bus, a regular bus, to Uzice.  I think it was at
 9  10.00 in the morning.  At 11.00, my brother-in-law phoned me and told me,
10  while I was at work, that they had left town at the insistence of my
11  mother-in-law.
12     Q.   And where did they go?
13     A.   At first they went to Uzice and then from Uzice they went to my
14  friend's in Prijepolje and then further on to Skopje.
15     Q.   Now, I want to draw your attention to a cherry red Passat
16  Volkswagen car.  Are you aware of such a car in Visegrad?
17     A.   Yes.
18     Q.   Was it an unusual car in Visegrad?
19     A.   Yes.
20     Q.   And do you know who was the owner of that car?
21     A.   Yes.
22     Q.   Who was the owner of that car?
23     A.   Excuse me, the owner of the car was Behija Zukic and her husband.
24  I can't remember her husband's name right now.
25     Q.   And were these the owner of a grocery store that you used to go

 1  to?
 2     A.   Yes, yes.  Very often, I went to the grocery that they owned.  I
 3  was even in the grocery on the day when Madam Behija's husband drove the
 4  car up, and that's when I first saw it, and I congratulated him on the
 5  purchase of that car.
 6     Q.   Did there come a time when you learned of Ms. Zukic's death?
 7     A.   Yes.
 8     Q.   And would you tell us how you learned of her death?
 9     A.   I'm not sure whether this was a day or two after the Uzice Corps
10  left.  When I came to work, I found out that that night or that morning
11  Madam Behija was brought to the morgue.
12     Q.   Is that the morgue [redacted]
13     A.   Yes, yes.  It is.  It is right above the first aid station.
14     Q.   And were you working the day that her body was brought to the
15  morgue?
16     A.   I was not working at that moment, but that day, when her body was
17  in the morgue, I was at work.
18     Q.   And did you see this cherry red Passat after you learnt of her
19  death?
20     A.   Yes.
21     Q.   And would you describe for the Chamber the circumstances under
22  which you saw this car again?
23     A.   I already said that that day, around 9.30 when we usually had a
24  break for breakfast at the medical centre, I was at the administration
25  building where we usually took breakfast, and through the office window,

 1  Pajdo Hajrudin's office, I saw when the cherry red Passat stopped in
 2  front, or rather at the parking lot in front of the hospital.
 3     Q.   Did you see who got out of that car?
 4     A.   Milan Lukic got out of this vehicle.
 5     Q.   And did you know this person?
 6     A.   Yes.
 7     Q.   How did you know him?
 8     A.   Well, I did not know him in the sense that we were friends or
 9  acquaintances but I knew him from town.
10     Q.   And can you describe for the Court how he was dressed at that
11  time?
12   A.   At that time, he was wearing a camouflage uniform.  He was wearing
13  trainers on his feet, and he had a blue beret.  I also saw that at that
14  moment, he had a rifle, a sniper, and there was a silencer on it.
15     Q.   Earlier in your testimony you referred to an insignia of a
16  double-headed eagle.  Did you see that on his camouflage uniform?
17     A.   He did have one on his beret.
18     Q.   Was there another person in the car?
19     A.   Yes.
20     Q.   Were you able to recognise that second person?
21     A.   No.
22     Q.   Now, up until this point would it be fair to say that you were
23  living in your own apartment in the centre of Visegrad?
24     A.   Yes.
25     Q.   And when you would go to work, would you describe for us the --

 1  how you would get to your place of employment on the other side of the
 2  river?
 3     A.   Every time I would go to work, it would be very difficult and
 4  painstaking because I would have to pass through the entire town, along
 5  the main street.  I also had to pass in front of the Visegrad Hotel.  I
 6  already mentioned that the paramilitary forces were stationed there.  I
 7  note that every day when I would pass by the Visegrad Hotel, I would see
 8  every day a few cars from town who -- that I knew very well and that were
 9  owned by some Muslims from Visegrad.
10     Q.   These cars that were stolen?
11     A.   I am referring to cars that were in front of the Visegrad Hotel.
12  They were probably stolen.
13     Q.   Did you recognise these cars as belonging to friends of yours?
14     A.   Yes.  I even know the names.  I even know a few names.
15     Q.   Did there come a time that you made a decision to move from your
16  apartment in the centre of Visegrad?
17     A.   Yes.
18     Q.   Approximately when did you move and why did you move?
19   A.   I moved approximately around the 20th, the 25th of May to [redacted],
20  to the house that I showed the Court.  I moved for security reasons.
21  That's how I viewed it then, because I thought it would be much easier to
22 get to work from [redacted] because I would only have to pass through a 
23 small part of the centre of town, cross the bridge and practically I'd be at
24  work.
25     Q.   Could you -- well let me ask you:  Whose house did you move to in

 1  [redacted]?
 2   A.   I moved to my wife's parents' house, or rather her father's house.
 3     Q.   And by moving to this house, were you able to get to your job
 4  without having to walk in front of the Hotel Visegrad?
 5     A.   Unfortunately, no, but I could avoid an enormous part of the
 6  centre of town and the main street.
 7     Q.   Did there come a time when you stopped working?
 8     A.   Yes.
 9     Q.   Would you describe for the Chamber why it was you stopped
10  working?
11     A.   The last day I went to work, as I was coming back, somewhere
12  between the railway bridge and the Bikavac Hotel, I met an acquaintance of
13  mine.  He was an ethnic Serb.  He was very surprised when he saw me, and
14  he said to me, verbatim, "Friend, what are you still doing here?"  I told
15  him that I was working and that I was just coming back from work, and he
16  said, "You must be insane."  And I said, "Why?"  And he said, "Well, if
17  they see you in the street, and if they catch you in the street, they will
18  kill you without a second thought.  Hide wherever you can."
19     Q.   Did he tell you who he meant by "they"?
20     A.   Yes, yes.  He said, "If the guys from Obrenovac catch you."
21   Q.   And this acquaintance, Serb acquaintance of yours, was he involved
22  in the military in any way?
23     A.   Yes.  He was in uniform and he was armed.  He had a weapon.
24     Q.   And what part of the military did he belong to?
25   A.   I think he belonged to part of the Serb army, the local Serb army,

 1  the Territorial Defence, or whatever it was called then.  I don't know
 2  what it was called then.  But later, it was called the Serb army.
 3     Q.   Now, Bikavac, that's a hill on the outskirts of Visegrad; is that
 4  correct?
 5     A.   Well, I think that it would be more correct to say that it is in
 6  the vicinity of Visegrad, part of Visegrad.
 7     Q.   But it is a hill?
 8     A.   Yes.
 9     Q.   From where you were -- the house that you were staying in, were
10  you able to see over parts of the town itself?
11     A.   From the attic of the house where I was staying, I could see a
12  pretty large part of town.
13     Q.   And did you ever see houses or buildings burning in the town?
14     A.   Yes.
15     Q.   And would you describe your observations for the Chamber?
16   A.   A few times, I saw houses burning in a place called Crnca, because
17  Crnca could be seen quite well from that house.  Also, in the early
18  evening hours, I can't remember the exact date, there was a great deal of
19  smoke that could be seen from town itself.  I did not know exactly what
20  was on fire in town but smoke was coming from two directions.  I shall
21  tell the honourable Trial Chamber about this.  Later on, I saw that both
22  mosques in the town of Visegrad had burned down.
23     Q.   So is it your testimony that you saw the two mosques burning but
24  it wasn't until later that you realised that it was the mosques?
25   A.   I only saw smoke but later on, I realised that it was the mosques.

 1     Q.   Did you also see Muslim houses burning in another village?
 2     A.   No.  I just saw them burning in Crnca.
 3     Q.   Now, after you stopped going to work, what did you do?
 4     A.   I did not do anything.  Actually I was hiding in my
 5  father-in-law's house.
 6     Q.   And where precisely did you hide?
 7     A.   We were hiding -- I have to mention that I was not in my
 8  father-in-law's house by myself.  My brother-in-law was also there, that
 9  is to say my father-in-law's other son-in-law.  And we were hiding in a
10  basement of that house, behind a big cupboard because the basement of the
11  house was pretty dark.  We thought that it would be safe there and that if
12  somebody even came in to the basement, he would not be able to see us.
13     Q.   Was your father-in-law in the house while you were staying there?
14  A.   Yes, he was also in the house but he was not hiding.  He explained
15  it by the fact that he was an elderly man and that he never did anything
16  bad to anyone and that he had no reason to hide from anyone.
17   Q.   The rest of his family, were they present in the house or had they
18  fled?
19     A.   No, no.  I already said that his wife had left, together with my
20  family, and his son had also left Visegrad.  He did not come back to
21  Visegrad after everybody had left.
22     Q.   The other person that you've mentioned, would you tell us his
23  name?
24     A.   His name is [redacted]
25     Q.   So just to clarify things, there were only three of you in the

 1  house at this time?
 2     A.   Yes.
 3      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, if that is the brother-in-law's name, we
 4  will have to take some action to redact it.
 5      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour he is one of the victims in the case.
 6      JUDGE HUNT:  Oh, right.  Except that it will identify this man.
 7      MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 8      JUDGE HUNT:  If it was his brother-in-law.
 9      MR. GROOME:  That's correct, Your Honour.
10      JUDGE HUNT:  All right.  It can be redacted but I just think that
11  when you're preparing these pseudonym sheets you should take this sort of
12  thing into account.
13      MR. GROOME:
14     Q.   Did you ever try to leave Visegrad?
15     A.   Yes.
16     Q.   Could you describe for the Court what happened when you tried to
17  leave Visegrad?
18     A.   I tried to leave Visegrad.  I can't remember the exact date.  But
19  I think it was after the 25th of May.  The bus was stopped at the Dobrun
20  checkpoint.  I was returned from there because I did not have a document,
21  papers, from the police station.  I did not have a permit to leave town.
22  So the police at the checkpoint sent me back.
23     Q.   Were you on just an ordinary bus that was leaving town?
24     A.   Yes, a regular bus.
25     Q.   And who told you that you did not have the necessary permission?

 1     A.   The policeman at the checkpoint said that to me.
 2     Q.   And did he tell you what you needed to do to get the necessary
 3  permission?
 4   A.   He told me that I had to go to the police station and to ask for a
 5  permit to leave town.
 6     Q.   Did you do that?
 7     A.   Yes.
 8     Q.   Would you describe for us what happened when you went to the
 9  police station?
10   A.   I went to the police station, I think it was around 10.00, I'm not
11  sure about the exact time and in front of the police station there were
12  quite a few people, most of them were women.  It was quite hard actually
13  to get through to the entrance to the police station, and then an
14  acquaintance of mine left the police station.  He also worked there in the
15  police.  He asked me why I was there.  I told him that I had come to seek
16  permission to leave the town, and he told me that he would assist me in
17  that.  He actually helped me to get into the police station, and he did
18  give me the permit, so that in the end, I did have such a permit.  And
19  when I left the police station building, I saw that the persons waiting in
20  front of it were quite upset.  I saw a girl I knew quite well.  I saw her
21  cry.  I asked her what the matter was, and she told me they took away my
22  brother.  I asked her then, "How, who did it?"  And she said, "They took
23  him away in a cherry red Passat."  Her brother's name was Safet Avdagic.
24  He was a taxi driver in Visegrad.
25     Q.   Did you take this to mean the same cherry red Passat that you saw

 1  Milan Lukic in several days earlier?
 2     A.   Yes.
 3   Q.   Did you ever try once again to board a regularly scheduled bus and
 4  leave the town?
 5     A.   No.  I didn't dare to do so.
 6     Q.   What did you do from this day on?
 7     A.   After that, I remained in Bikavac the whole time.
 8     Q.   I want to draw your attention now to the 7th of June, 1992.  Do
 9  you recall that day?
10     A.   Yes.
11     Q.   I want you to describe to the court the circumstances leading up
12  to your capture by some of these Serb paramilitaries.
13    A.   On the 7th of June, in the afternoon of the 7th of June, as I have
14  already said, we were hiding in the basement, and from time to time, we
15   would go out into a small hall or corridor from which one entered into the
16  basement, and there was a door leading to the part of the ground floor.
17  And we would get out and sit on the small bench.  At one point, I heard a
18  car, and I looked towards Bikavac, towards the street leading into
19  Bikavac, and I saw a yellow car, a yellow Zastava car.  It was a Zastava
20   101.  I saw this car approach the house.  So I ran into the basement.  The
21  person who was with me took position behind the cupboard.  I looked
22  through a small window looking out onto the intersection in front of the
23  house.  I was -- I wanted to see where the car would go.  The car headed
24  towards Banpolje [phoen].  After a certain period of time, I don't know
25  how long it was, I continued looking to see whether the car would come

 1  back and then suddenly I saw the car, and the engine was turned off since
 2  it was a sloping road, it stopped in front of the intersection which was
 3  right in front of the house.
 4     Q.   Witness 32, let me just ask you a few specific questions.  This
 5  car, did you recognise this car that you saw?
 6     A.   I recognised the car that stopped.
 7     Q.   And what -- whose car did you recognise it to be?
 8     A.   It was my own car.
 9     Q.   Where had you left your car?
10     A.   I had left my car in front of the apartment where I -- or the
11  house that I pointed out earlier, that's where I lived.
12     Q.   Now, this wasn't the first time a car had passed the house, was
13  it?
14     A.   No.
15   Q.   What would you and your brother-in-law do when a car or cars would
16  pass in front of the house?
17     A.   As I have already said, we would run into the basement and hide.
18  The person who was with me would be the first to hide behind the cupboard
19  and I would be on the lookout at the small window waiting to see what the
20  car would do, whether the car would stop at an intersection or continue.
21  If the car stopped at the intersection, I still had enough time to hide
22  behind the cupboard, but if the car just went away, my father-in-law would
23  come and tell us that it was safe, that the car had gone.
24     Q.   Approximately how many times did you have to hide like this?
25     A.   Daily, dozens of times.

 1     Q.   Now, I want to bring you back to the point in time where you're
 2  describing seeing this car a second time.  Would you please tell us what
 3  you observed then?
 4   A.   I saw a person get out of the car and an elderly woman was passing
 5  through the intersection, and I heard that this person ask her something,
 6  and I heard the woman answer, "No," by moving her head, and this person
 7  said, "But he has to be somewhere around."  He said it in a very
 8  impertinent and loud voice.  He went back into the car, sat down, and then
 9  let the car roll downhill with the engine off towards the entrance to the
10  Bikavac.
11     Q.   Did you think that these people were looking for you?
12     A.   Yes.
13     Q.   What happened after the car rolled down the hill?
14     A.   I again left the basement and stood in front of the entrance in
15  order to be able to see whether the car had gone away towards the town.
16  And I saw that the car had stopped in front of the first house in the
17  direction of the town.  I saw them leave the car, and they started beating
18  on the garage doors of a house there.  Nobody opened the door.  They
19   weren't able to open the door themselves.  And then they got back into the
20  car and went towards the town.  Then I sat down on the bench, I guess in
21  order to relax a bit.  I took out a cigarette and I lit it.
22     Q.   Is this -- where you're sitting at this point, is it at the front
23  of the house or the rear of the house?
24     A.   It was in front of the entrance to the house.  If you -- looking
25  from the intersection, it is on the other side of the house, in the

 1  direction of the hill and slightly to the right, there is this area called
 2  Megdan.
 3     Q.   At the time you're sitting down and you're having this cigarette,
 4  where is your father-in-law?
 5   A.   As I sat down and had my cigarette, my father-in-law was in front,
 6  right there, and we commented on the car, having left.  The other person
 7  was still in the basement at the time.  And at one point, my father-in-law
 8  went towards a nearby house, in fact it was a barn, and en route to the
 9  barn I saw that his hands were behind his back and at one point he
10  indicated to me that I should hide.
11   Q.   Now, you've just made a waving motion with your right hand to your
12  side.  Is that the motion that your father-in-law did to you?
13   A.   Yes, but his hand was right behind his back, and he just signalled
14  to me that I should hide.
15     Q.   Did you understand what the signal was?
16     A.   I knew very well what the signal meant, and I tried to get back
17  into the basement, but in order to get back into the basement, I had to
18  pass through the whole opening that was facing my father-in-law and the
19  town, and as I tried to cross, I saw that from the direction of Megdan and
20  through his garden, a group of armed soldiers was approaching, and I
21  realised that they had seen me.
22     Q.   From what direction were they coming from?
23     A.   They were coming from the direction of the town and from the
24  direction of Megdan.
25     Q.   Best you're able today, would you describe what they were

 1  wearing?
 2     A.   They wore camouflage uniforms, all of them.  Some of them had
 3  balaclavas camouflage balaclavas on their heads, while most of them had
 4  just ordinary berets on their heads.  One of them had a hat, just an
 5  ordinary hat.
 6   Q.   Did any of them have this double-sided or double-headed eagle that
 7  you referred to earlier in your testimony?
 8     A.   Yes.
 9     Q.   How many of them?
10     A.   The persons that were closest to me, I don't know how many there
11  were, but the persons who were the closest to me, who communicated with
12  me, did wear these insignia.
13     Q.   You mentioned at least one of these people having a balaclava.
14  Was that a piece of cloth that covered the front of that person's face or
15  persons'?
16     A.   Yes, yes.
17     Q.   And was it -- sorry, the people who were not wearing anything
18  obstructing their face, did you recognise any of them?
19     A.   Yes.
20     Q.   Who did you recognise some of those to be?
21     A.   I recognised Milan Lukic.
22     Q.   What happened next?
23   A.   At that moment, when I tried to enter the basement of the house, I
24  realised that I had been seen, and in order to avoid the risk to the
25  person who was already in the basement, in order to avoid that person

 1  being noticed too, I tried to whisper to him that these people were here,
 2  but my father-in-law, who was visibly scared, came back to me.  I don't
 3  know for what reason the person that was already in the basement got out
 4  too.  I guess he just didn't realise what was happening in front of the
 5  house, or perhaps in -- because he wanted to avoid causing any trouble to
 6  our father-in-law, which may have happened if he had been caught in the
 7  basement.  Two of the soldiers approached us.  One of them stood next to
 8  us and the other one entered the part of the ground floor where people
 9   lived.  He searched the area while the others searched the upper floors of
10  the house.  A few minutes later, Milan Lukic, whom I had already -- have
11  already mentioned, came to us and asked us for IDs.
12     Q.   I'd like to just stop you there.  Just to clear up a point.  The
13  first paramilitaries that saw you, was Milan Lukic among that initial
14  group of paramilitaries?
15     A.   Let me clarify.  They were coming from the direction of the town.
16   They came in single file so that when I tried to get into the basement, at
17  least four of them were able to spot me, because they were very close to
18  each other.  There was perhaps two metres between them.  So they had a
19  pretty good view of me.
20     Q.   Of those initial four, was Milan Lukic among those four?
21     A.   Yes.  But he did not approach me directly.  He passed by the
22  stream that is close to the river, and went up to the upper floor.
23     Q.   Of the other men that were there, did you recognise any of the
24  other men?  Can you please describe for us what happened after these
25  people apprehended you?

 1     A.   After taking our IDs, I produced my permit to leave the town, but
 2  Milan put the permit and took it by his teeth, tore it in two, and then
 3  stamped on it.  He asked me, "Why are you hiding?"  I said I was not
 4  hiding at all.  And I told him, "Didn't you see where I was standing?  I
 5  wasn't hiding."  He said, after he put our IDs into his shirt pocket, he
 6  told us to go with him.  And our father-in-law also started with us, and
 7   he told him, "No.  You'll stay here."  We got out into the street, leading
 8  towards the town, and let me tell you that the town I'm referring to is
 9  not in fact the town.  It's not the town but it's a hill that is called
10  Grad, or which means town.  So it's a hill that is called Grad or town.
11     Q.   Could you describe for the Court or give the Court some sense of
12  what was this area like at this time?  Were people on the streets or were
13  the streets empty?
14     A.   It looked quite empty.  If there were any people, they did not
15  dare get out of the house.  They all hid deep inside their houses, so the
16  whole area looked spooky.  It was completely empty.
17     Q.   And is Bikavac a predominantly Muslim area in town?
18     A.   Not the whole area but this part of the wider area of Bikavac was
19  Muslim.
20     Q.   I want to draw your attention back to the time now where you are
21  leaving your father-in-law's house with these men.  Would you please
22  describe where they take you?
23     A.   They first took us down the road towards the Grad hill, Milan
24  Lukic was the first.  I followed him and the person who was with me was
25  behind us, and then behind us there was a soldier with an automatic

 1  rifle.  He wore a camouflage hat with the double-headed eagle insignia.
 2  As we walked, the 200 metres stretch of road towards the hill, the Grad
 3  hill, I was able to see quite clearly Milan Lukic with his sniper rifle,
 4  which was fitted with a silencer.  I also noticed that he held the rifle
 5  by the trigger guard and that one of his fingers was constantly on the
 6  trigger, and since this sniper rifle is quite long, and if you also fit a
 7  silencer on to it, it is really quite long.  So as he walked, he held it
 8  off like this, in order to prevent the rifle from bumping on the ground.
 9     Q.   If I may --
10     A.   Also --
11     Q.   You're describing -- you're holding your right arm out.  Was he
12  holding it in his right arm and extending the rifle outward from his right
13  side as you've just indicated with your arm?
14     A.   Yes, that's right.
15     Q.   Did you notice anything on his uniform that indicated that he was
16  working with the police?
17     A.   Yes, I failed to mention that he wore a camouflage uniform that
18  was purple-blue in colour, and on his sleeve there was a patch which said,
19  "Police" in Cyrillic.
20     Q.   And what did he have on his head, if you remember?
21     A.   On his head, he wore a beret.  It was a blue beret, also with a
22  double-headed eagle insignia.  And on his shirt pockets, he also had such
23  insignia, on each of his pockets.
24     Q.   Are you able to approximate for the Court when he was born?  Or
25  his age at the time?

 1     A.   He might have been about 22 or 23, 23, 24.
 2     Q.   Could you tell us as best as you can remember, how tall he was?
 3     A.   He was about as tall as I am, about 185 centimetres.
 4     Q.   And what colour was his hair?
 5     A.   Lighter hair.
 6     Q.   Do you know where he was born?
 7     A.   I think he was born in Rujiste, in the Visegrad municipality.
 8     Q.   At the time that you see him this time that you're describing for
 9  us, did he appear to you as if he were on any kind of drugs?
10     A.   At one point, it did appear to me that way because when he
11  questioned us in front of the house, I saw a small band-aid on his arm.
12  It may have meant that he had visited the doctor and been given a shot but
13  at that time I thought that he was on drugs, but I'm not quite sure.
14     Q.   Was there -- other than that bandage was there anything about the
15  way he was acting that made you think he was possibly on drugs?
16     A.   No.
17     Q.   Where were you taken?
18    A.   Some 150 or 200 metres down the road we took a right turn and went
19   towards Megdan over, through a meadow.  I wish to note that other soldiers
20  searched other houses as we passed by.  After that, we reached the houses
21  that are roughly in the direction of the Bikavac Hotel, and I remember
22  that in the last house in the row, we were stopped.
23     Q.   These other soldiers or people you're referring to as soldiers,
24  can you describe in greater detail, if you can, what military unit they
25  belonged to or were they paramilitaries?

 1     A.   I don't know exactly what military units they belonged to but I
 2  believe they were members of the paramilitary forces.  I did not see any
 3  official insignia.  The insignia they had did not appear to be the
 4  official police or regular army insignia of the units that were in the
 5  town at the time.
 6     Q.   Now, you've described being brought to a -- the street on which
 7  the hotel Bikavac is located; is that correct?
 8     A.   I wouldn't call it a street in which the Bikavac Hotel is, but
 9  when you get to the end of that street, and when you cross it, when you
10  cross the street that goes downhill, you will get to a flat area in front
11  of the Bikavac Hotel and another building which was a large shop.
12     Q.   Is that a dead-end street?
13     A.   Yes, it's a dead-end street.
14     Q.   Were you brought to a particular house on that street?
15     A.   Yes.  As I have already said, we stopped in front of the last
16  house in the row.
17     Q.   And what occurred --
18     A.   On to the left.  On the left side of the street, looking towards
19  the Bikavac Hotel.
20     Q.   And would you describe for the Court what you observed when you
21  were at that house?
22     A.   Milan was the first to enter the house, Milan Lukic, that is, and
23  he searched the house.  He went upstairs because there was a staircase
24  leading upstairs from the hall.  Then he came back and searched, inspected
25  all the other rooms in the ground floor.  An elderly man, probably the

 1  owner of the house, left one of the rooms, got out of one of the rooms on
 2  the ground floor.  When he made sure everything was safe, he told us to
 3  get in and then he left.  As we stood there in the hall, a soldier stood
 4  on the door, that was the person who walked behind us all the way from the
 5  house to this location.  This person that stood on the door, I remember
 6  very well, wore a camouflage hat, pointed slightly upwards.  It looked a
 7  bit like a cowboy hat but it was camouflage.  I can say that he was quite
 8  nice.  As I sat on the staircase leading upstairs, he even talked to me.
 9  I managed to talk to him, to this person who was with me.
10     Q.   Was he one of the paramilitaries that originally apprehended you?
11     A.   Yes.  He went behind us all the way from the house there.  Milan
12  was the first, then me, then the person who was with me, and then he was
13  behind us all the way.
14     Q.   Did you recognise this person from the Visegrad area?
15   A.   No.  I did not recognise that person.  I do not know where he came
16  from.
17     Q.   And was this person armed?
18     A.   Yes.  He was armed with a Kalashnikov rifle.
19     Q.   This soldier did he also have a conversation with your
20  brother-in-law?
21     A.   Yes.
22     Q.   Could you describe the contents of that conversation?
23     A.   As I sat on the staircase and as I thought about what was
24  happening and what might happen, I was actually going through my whole
25  life up to that time, had I done anything wrong?  And did somebody --

 1  anybody grudge me anything?  I could not find anything, any single thing
 2  that I may have done that might have harmed anyone or been in quarrel with
 3  anyone.  And while I was thinking about all this, the person who was with
 4  me asked the -- or rather the soldier standing at the door asked the
 5  person who was with me, verbatim, "Do you have children?"
 6      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome perhaps the witness can at last start to
 7  answer your question after the morning adjournment.
 8      MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 9      JUDGE HUNT:  We will resume at 11.30.
10              --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.
11              --- On resuming at 11.30 a.m.
12      JUDGE HUNT:  You should ask the question again, Mr. Groome.
13      MR. GROOME:  Thank you, Your Honour.
14     Q.   Witness number 32, we left off with you telling us that this
15  soldier asked your brother-in-law whether or not he had any children; is
16  that correct?
17     A.   Yes.
18     Q.   What did your brother-in-law respond?
19     A.   He responded, "I do.  I have two sons."
20     Q.   Did the soldier say anything then to your brother-in-law?
21     A.   Yes.
22     Q.   Can you tell us what he said.
23     A.   He said literally the following.  I remember every word. He said,
24  "Tsk, tsk, tsk, what have you been waiting for until now?  Why didn't you
25  escape?"

 1     Q.   Was there any other conversation?
 2     A.   Yes.
 3     Q.   What else was said?
 4     A.   He asked him whether he could talk to Branimir Savovic.
 5     Q.   And who was Mr. Savovic?
 6     A.   Mr. Savovic?  I think he was President of the Serb Democratic
 7  Party in the municipality of Visegrad.  Otherwise, he was a very, very
 8  good friend of this person.  I think that at that time he held the post of
 9  President of the municipality.
10     Q.   And you say he was a good friend of your brother-in-law's?
11     A.   A very, very good friend.  They travelled together a countless
12  number of times, a countless number of times they sat together.  They
13  visited each other at home as well.  It's not only that they would meet up
14  in town, but they would visit each other's homes as well.
15     Q.   And what did this soldier respond?
16     A.   He responded, "I don't know.  I'll have to ask Milan when he comes
17  back."
18     Q.   Did there come a time when Milan Lukic did come back?
19     A.   I cannot say exactly how much time went by.  I have to point out
20  that then, at that moment, time did not mean a thing to me.  Every minute
21  was an eternity for me, so I cannot say with any certitude right now how
22  much time had elapsed between various events.  However, perhaps ten or 15
23  minutes later, Hasan Mutapcic was brought to the same house.  A bit after
24  that -- I'm sorry, Hasan Mutapcic and his son were brought to that house.
25  At that time, he could have been 12 or 13.  I remember very well that this

 1  young boy was wearing a pair of sports shorts, blue-coloured, and also a
 2  sports T-shirt, yellow.  The young boy, the child, looked very, very
 3  frightened.
 4     Q.   Who brought --
 5     A.   Practically his entire body was shaking.
 6     Q.   Who brought Hasan Mutapcic to this house?
 7     A.   Since I was sitting on the stairs that lead upstairs, I could not
 8  see who brought Hasan to the entrance of the house.  I only saw him enter
 9  the house.
10     Q.   Were there other people brought to that house as well?
11     A.   Yes.
12     Q.   Would you describe those people for us.   And I would just refresh
13  your memory that one of the witnesses is protected, Witness number 14.
14  Please continue.
15      JUDGE HUNT:  You better point out it's on the document that he has
16  in front of him.  At least, I hope he has it in front of him.
17      MR. GROOME:  No, Your Honour.
18      JUDGE HUNT:  Well, that's the whole point of this.
19      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I put one there earlier today. I'm not
20  sure where it is now.
21      JUDGE HUNT:  Have you got a spare copy there?
22      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I'm quite certain this witness remembers
23  the number.
24      JUDGE HUNT:  Still, put it in front of him so that he has it there
25  to remind him.

1     A.   Yes, I've seen it.
 2      MR. GROOME:
 3     Q.   Would you tell us about these other men being brought to the
 4  house.
 5     A.   A few minutes later, after Hasan Mutapcic, Ekrem Dzafic was
 6  brought into the house, as well as his father, Meho Dzafic.  I knew both
 7  of them very well.  Afterwards, other people were brought as well.
 8  Approximately, there was about ten to 13 of us there.  However, at that
 9  moment, the least important thing for me was to count the number of people
10  who were in that room.  However, I can certainly say that there was more
11  than ten of us.
12     Q.   And the -- of these people that were brought to the house, did you
13  recognise any of them?
14     A.   I've already said that I knew Hasan Mutapcic and his son, as well
15  as Meho and Ekrem.  I did not know the other people since I did not live
16  in that part of town, so these people probably either lived there or were
17  from the neighbouring villages and were staying in town as refugees.
18  However, I do not know exactly who these people are.
19     Q.   Meho and Ekrem, were they related?
20     A.   Ekrem was Meho's son.  That is to say, that there was the father,
21  Meho, and the son, Ekrem.
22     Q.   And do you know where they lived?
23     A.   They lived nearby, near that house where we were staying at that
24  moment.  I'm not sure whether that is the second or the third house in
25  that row.

 1     Q.   What happened next?
 2     A.   Milan Lukic returned to the house once again, and he ordered us to
 3  stand in a semicircle.  At that moment, he said that all the valuables
 4  that we have on us; gold, money, watches, personal documents, that we
 5  should put all of that into the middle of that room.  Also, he ordered us
 6  to take off our shoes and socks.  When we did all of that, as he had
 7  ordered, he also said the following:  "If I find anything on any one of
 8  you that you did not put in the middle of the room, I'll kill that
 9  person."
10     Q.   Why were you made to take off your shoes and your socks?
11      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, how can he answer that?  You can ask him
12  were they told why they were taking them off.
13      MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
14      JUDGE HUNT:  You do this quite often and I'm not sure whether it's
15  going to be important but if it's going to be important let's get it in
16  properly.
17      MR. GROOME:  Thank you, Your Honour.
18     Q.   Were you told why you were told to take off your shoes and your
19  socks?
20     A.   No.
21     Q.   What happened after the people that were detained put their
22  valuables on the floor?
23     A.   Milan Lukic walked up, squatted, and started looking at all of
24  it.  One wallet after the other, one thing after the other.  I remember
25  very well when my wallet was next.  He opened the wallet, he looked

 1  inside.  I had a few addresses in there of my relatives in Sarajevo.  He
 2  asked me, "Who are these guys?"  And I said that these were my relatives
 3  who lived in Sarajevo.  And he said, "All right."  In the wallet, I also
 4  had one dollar.  I carried it around all the time because I thought that
 5  that dollar bill brought me good luck.  When he found that dollar bill, he
 6  said, "You said that you didn't have any foreign currency, and what is
 7  this?"  And he laughed cynically.  And he put this dollar together with
 8  all the other bank notes that were there at the time, and that was just
 9  domestic currency then.  When he finished this examination of all the
10  documents, he got up and he pushed all these documents behind the door
11  with his foot.
12     Q.   What did he do with the money?
13     A.   I remember very well that he folded all of this, together with my
14  dollar bill, and he put that in his shirt pocket.
15     Q.   What happened then?
16     A.   After that, he ordered us to put our shoes and socks on.  He asked
17  at one moment whose car was the olive-green Yugo that was in the nearby
18  garage?  Meho Dzafic said that it was his older son's car, his older son
19  being Osman, and that he had left it to him to take care of it.  Then he
20  asked him, "Do you have the keys?"  He said, "Yes, I do, but they are in
21  the house."  And then he said, "Come with me," and the two of them walked
22  out.
23     Q.   I'm going to ask you a question about Meho Dzafic.  Do you know
24  where he worked or used to work?
25     A.   Meho Dzafic was a waiter, and he worked at the Panos catering and

 1  tourism establishment.  While I was in town, he worked in the Panos
 2  restaurant in the centre of town most of the time.  I think he worked
 3  elsewhere too because this particular catering company had a few
 4  restaurants but I think that most of the time he worked in this restaurant
 5  in the centre of town near the municipality building and the courthouse.
 6     Q.   Did there come a time when Milan Lukic returned with these two
 7  men?
 8     A.   I wish to note that he left only with Meho Dzafic.  After a while,
 9  he came back by himself, and at the entrance into this hallway, the
10  soldier who was standing at the door asked him, "Milan, this man wants to
11  talk to Branimir Savovic."
12     Q.   What did Milan Lukic say?
13     A.   Milan Lukic said, literally, "Fuck him."
14     Q.   What happened then?
15     A.   After that, he pointed with his finger, saying, "You, you, you,
16  you, come with me."
17     Q.   Are you indicating four people were selected?
18     A.   Yes.
19     Q.   Which four, if you know?
20     A.   Yes:  Me, Ekrem Dzafic, Hasan Mutapcic, and the person who was
21  with me all the time.
22     Q.   Your brother-in-law?
23     A.   Yes.
24     Q.   And after he indicated you, or selected, you four what did he do?
25     A.   He was the first to go out.  We followed him, and we went to the

 1  front side of the house, that is to say where the end of this dead-end
 2  street was.
 3     Q.   And what happened there?
 4     A.   I remember very well that when we went to the very end of the
 5  street, that I saw two parked cars.  The first car in relation to where I
 6  was at that moment, was a Yugo, olive-green, owned by Osman Dzafic, the
 7  son of Meho.  That is to say that that was the car that he went to get the
 8  keys of, together with Meho.  And about ten metres ahead - I'm not sure
 9  about the distance, but quite nearby - there was the Passat, the cherry
10  green Passat, the same car that we have already been mentioning today.
11      JUDGE HUNT:  You mean cherry red?
12      THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's mistake, slip of the tongue, I'm
13  sorry.
14      MR. GROOME:
15     Q.   Is this the same car that you've referred to earlier in your
16  testimony?
17     A.   Yes, yes.  It was a cherry red vehicle.  That's what we called
18  that colour.
19     Q.   Please continue.
20     A.   Next to the Passat, I saw two other persons.  I did not know them
21  then.  And next to the Yugo was Meho Dzafic.  When we got close to the
22  car, Milan asked, "Who has a driver's licence?"  I answered, "I do."  I
23  instinctively started going to the driver's seat of the car, and he said,
24  "No, no.  Stand here."  After that, Ekrem said that he had a driver's
25  licence too.  However, Ekrem was visibly frightened and he said, "You're

 1  going to drive."  After that, he said to me that I should enter the car.
 2  I walked in and I sat in the seat behind the driver's seat.  I would like
 3  to note that this car, the Yugo, had only two doors; for the driver and
 4  for the person sitting next to the driver.  I got in through the driver's
 5  door.  That is to say that the driver's seat collapses and then you walk
 6  into the back.  After that, he told Meho to get in.  Meho entered through
 7  the other door, and he also sat in the back, next to me.  Since the Yugo
 8  car is not a very comfortable car, it's a pretty small car, he said to
 9  Meho, "Move, move, move, move a bit more," and at one moment, Meho, who is
10  a pretty big man, sat literally in my lap.
11     Q.   And who else got into that back seat?
12     A.   After that, one of the soldiers walked in, the same one who was
13  standing at that moment where they found us in front of the house.  The
14  others were searching the house and he stood with us, that is.
15     Q.   Could you tell us who, besides Meho or Ekrem, was in the front
16  seat?
17     A.   In the front seat was Ekrem - in the driver's seat, that is - and
18  next to him was my brother-in-law.
19     Q.   Okay.  And what happened then?
20     A.   At one moment, that is to say before the car was started up, Milan
21  opened the door, that is, the door on the other side of the driver, and he
22  said to Ekrem, "Straight to Banja."  And this guy said okay.  And then he
23  walked away and sat in the driver's seat of the Passat.
24     Q.   Are you familiar with a place called Banja?
25     A.   Yes.

 1     Q.   Would you please describe for the Court where it is in relation to
 2  the centre of the town of Visegrad.
 3     A.   As related to the centre of Visegrad, it is to the north.  That is
 4  to say in the direction in which the Drina flows.  If you follow the Drina
 5  for about five kilometres, there is a place called Crnca, and then there
 6  is a road that goes to the right and then perhaps three or four kilometres
 7  after that, you get to a hotel called Vilina Vlas, and that is where
 8  Visegradska Banja is.
 9     Q.   Did anything else happen at this street before you began to drive
10  in this direction?
11     A.   Yes.
12     Q.   Would you please just tell us what happened next?
13     A.   I said that next to the Passat, I saw two persons.  These two
14  persons sat in the car, they got into the car.  I don't know exactly how
15  they sat.  Hasan Mutapcic also got into the car, the Passat car that is.
16  When we left, on our way out of that street, the Passat stopped so we
17  passed by it and we continued towards town.  At the very entrance into
18  town, that is to say, below the railway bridge, one has to go right.  When
19  the car turned right, I could see quite clearly that the old mosque that
20  was in the centre of town had burned down.
21     Q.   Please continue.
22     A.   We continued our journey towards Visegradska Banja and when we
23  were crossing the bridge on the Rvez River in the centre of town, I saw
24  that the new mosque, which was near that bridge, had also burned down. We
25  continued our journey towards Visegradska Banja.  Somewhere between Kalate

 1  and Sase as we were driving, I was doing a lot of thinking, you know.  At
 2  that moment, your entire life runs before your own eyes as if it were a
 3  film.  At one moment, I thought perhaps we could stand up to them, you
 4  know.  I told you where I was sitting, and I had Meho Dzaferic, who is a
 5  pretty big man, in my lap, and I practically could not move.  I glanced
 6  surreptitiously at the soldier who was sitting with us.  He was holding
 7  his rifle in this position, towards Ekrem, the driver.  I looked at the
 8  weapon again.  I saw that the safety pin was off, and I saw that the
 9  trigger was at the lowest possible point.  Since I did my military service
10  in the Yugoslav People's Army and since I was in a unit that had exactly
11  the same type of weapon, I was very familiar with this type of weapon.  I
12  knew that this particular position of the safety meant that it was set for
13  a burst of gunfire.  At one moment, my brother-in-law tried to turn
14  around.  However, the soldier who was sitting there and holding the rifle
15  hit him with the rifle butt.  I have to admit that it wasn't a severe
16  blow, but he did hit him and say, "Look ahead."  A few minutes after that,
17  we hadn't even arrived at the place called Sase yet, this soldier asked,
18   "Do you have a mother?"  We said, "Yes, we do."  And he said, "It's a
19  nice thing to have a mother.  I used to have a mother, too.  But the
20  Ustashas killed her."
21     Q.   I'd like to just clear up something that you -- you mentioned your
22  brother-in-law being hit, and you motioned the back of your head.  Is that
23  where he was hit?
24     A.   In the nape of -- here, in the nape of his head.  This is where he
25  hit him and told him to look ahead.  And he turned back and looked

 1  straight ahead.
 2     Q.   Please continue.  I'm sorry.  On the way to the hotel, did the
 3  vehicle ever stop?
 4     A.   Yes.
 5     Q.   Can you tell us where it stopped?
 6     A.   We stopped at the crossroads in the village of Sase, at a police
 7  checkpoint.  I think it was a police checkpoint there.
 8     Q.   And what happened there?
 9     A.   We stayed there for a very short time.  One of the police officers
10  at the checkpoint opened the door of the car, that is the door, the
11  driver's side door, looked in, and closed the door.  He made no comments.
12     Q.   Did there come a time when you arrived at the Vilina Vlas Hotel?
13     A.   Yes.  We drove on towards the Vilina Vlas Hotel, and in front of
14  the Vilina Vlas Hotel, we stopped.
15     Q.   Can I ask you to tell the Court what kind of hotel?  Was there
16  anything special about the Vilina Vlas Hotel?
17     A.   The hotel is located in a valley.  It was a very popular place
18  before the war.  Many people stayed in that hotel before the war.  It is
19  also well known for having a swimming pool, and there was also a health
20  care section or it had health care facilities there.
21     Q.   Had you ever been to this facility before?
22     A.   Yes, I stayed there many, many times.  I stayed there the last
23  time on the 8th of March 1992, less than a month before the conflict broke
24  out, and there was a function there at the hotel, just like there was a
25  function every year before that, in honour of the 8th of March, which is

 1  the Women's Day.
 2     Q.   On the 7th of June when you were there, could you tell whether
 3  this hotel was open or not?
 4     A.   The first thing as I got out of the car that I noticed was the
 5  silence around the hotel, the fact that it was so empty.  Because I had
 6  been to this hotel so many times before, I was shocked by the silence and
 7  emptiness there.  I think that there was just one car parked in front of
 8  the hotel at that time.
 9     Q.   Would it be fair to say that this hotel is located in a remote
10  area, with no other buildings in the area?
11     A.   Yes, yes.  In the immediate vicinity.
12     Q.   Did somebody tell you to get out of the car?
13     A.   As soon as we stopped, the soldier that sat next to us told us to
14  get out.
15     Q.   And at the time that you were at the Vilina Vlas hotel, were you
16  able to see this red Passat?
17     A.   During my stay in the hotel itself, I was unable to see the red
18  Passat.
19     Q.   Was your car the first car to arrive at the hotel?
20     A.   Yes.  We were the first to arrive and the Passat arrived later.
21     Q.   When you got out of the car, did you immediately go into the
22  hotel?
23     A.   When we got out of the car, we were told to head up the stairs and
24  into the hotel.
25     Q.   And can you describe for the Court what is inside or just inside

 1  the front door of that hotel?
 2     A.   As you get in through the entrance of the hotel, to your left,
 3  there is a corridor leading towards the swimming pool or towards the
 4  health care facilities in the hotel.  Straight ahead, there is the
 5  reception desk of the hotel, and to your right, to the right of the
 6  entrance, there is the entrance into the restaurant of the hotel.  And
 7  this is where the function was held less than a month before the outbreak
 8  of the hostilities.  This was the room in this restaurant where I sat with
 9  my friends.  To the left, next to the reception, there is another door
10  leading to an area behind the reception, and since I was not a hotel
11  employee, I assumed that this was meant for the hotel personnel.  I don't
12  know what was there behind this door.
13     Q.   At the very front door of the hotel, was there anybody there that
14  you saw as you walked in the door?
15     A.   Yes.
16     Q.   Could you describe that person?
17     A.   Yes.  The person standing at the very entrance to the hotel was
18  the person who was employed as a porter in the hotel, actually as a
19  doorman.  I think his last name is Susnjar.  I don't know his first name.
20  He was a dark person, elderly, perhaps 45 to 50 years of age, but I'm not
21  sure.  But there was another very important thing that I heard as I
22  climbed up towards the hotel on the staircase.  There was a person
23  standing there.  You have a couple of steps and then a flat area and then
24  again a few steps.  On the left-hand side, there was a soldier in a
25  camouflage uniform, with a hat on his head.  He was quite dark complected.

 1    I just glanced at him as much as I dared at the moment, but I
 2  felt that I knew him.  But I was not sure who he was, but I do remember
 3  clearly, as we passed him by - Lukic had already reached him - I remember
 4  very well that this man told Lukic the following:  "This fool let your
 5  people go, "Indicating the guard that was standing in front of the hotel.
 6  And then Lukic, who was in front of us, reached this person who stood in
 7  front of the door, and asked, "What?"  And the man said, "Well, there were
 8  people here, two or three days, they did not have anything to eat.  I
 9  didn't know what to do with them.  I just let them go."  And Lukic said,
10  "Okay, we will deal with that later."  He got into the hotel and we
11  followed him.
12     Q.   Once you enter the lobby of the hotel, can you describe whether or
13  not you see any people inside the lobby itself?
14     A.   Yes.
15     Q.   Tell us who you saw.
16     A.   As I entered the hotel, to my right, next to the door, next to the
17  entrance, to the outside area, to the pool, there was a little desk, I
18  don't know what it was for.  I don't know whether it was a flower stand or
19  to hide the radiators, but anyway, Mitar Vasiljevic was leaning against
20  this little desk.  His hands were crossed.  His arms were crossed, and he
21  was leaning against this little desk.
22     Q.   Did you know Mitar Vasiljevic from before this day?
23     A.   Yes.
24     Q.   Could you describe what he was wearing?
25     A.   At that time, he was wearing an olive drab uniform and had a black

 1  cowboy-type hat on his head, with a very, very conspicuous two-headed
 2  eagle on the front of the hat.  It was quite large, unlike the two
 3  smaller insignia that were on his shirt pockets.
 4     Q.   At this first time that you see Mitar Vasiljevic, do you see
 5  whether or not he has a weapon with him?
 6     A.   At that time, when I saw him the first time, no.
 7     Q.   I'd ask you to describe Mitar Vasiljevic.  What is his approximate
 8  age or what was his age at that time?
 9     A.   Approximately 35, 30 to 35.  He was dark.  He worked in the Panos
10  restaurant in the town centre, or in some other restaurants, but mostly in
11  the Panos restaurant, as far as I know.  He liked to drink and did it
12  quite often.  He was a person with whom I had never had any conflicts.
13  Up until that time we were not close friends but I did know him because I
14  used to sit down in that restaurant often, and we used to have the town
15  Bingo in that restaurant and my friends and myself took part in it before
16  the war.
17     Q.   Aside from Mitar Vasiljevic, did you see anybody else in that
18  reception area --
19      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, before you depart from his description of
20  Mr. Vasiljevic, wouldn't it be important for us to know just precisely the
21  circumstances, the full circumstances in which he knew him?
22      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I was going to deal with at the end of
23  his testimony but I can certainly do it now, if you prefer.
24      JUDGE HUNT:  It seems more logical.  You've asked him, "Did you
25  know him from before?"  He said, "Yes."  He's given you some description

 1  of how, because he saw him at the restaurant, but this is a very important
 2  issue --
 3      MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 4      JUDGE HUNT:  -- as I understand from your opening address, as to
 5  whether they've got their identification correct, so we should really know
 6  about the circumstances, all of the circumstances in which he says he knew
 7  him.
 8      MR. GROOME:  I will deal with that now, then, Your Honour.  Thank
 9  you.
10     Q.   You mentioned that Mitar Vasiljevic worked in a restaurant in the
11  centre of town; is that correct?
12     A.   Yes.
13     Q.   And is that a restaurant that you had ever gone to?
14     A.   Yes.
15     Q.   And how frequently would you go to that restaurant?
16     A.   Quite often.  Every time there was a Bingo session there in the
17  restaurant, I'd go there.  Before I got married, I would quite often go
18  there and have something to eat because at that time I lived on my own in
19  Visegrad, and I'd go there and have lunch in that restaurant, and very
20  often, I would leave a tip for Mitar, this very same Mitar.  And if you go
21  to a restaurant very often, if you eat in a restaurant very often, it's
22  quite logical that you're going to know the personnel serving you in the
23  restaurant.  There are also quite a few people in the town who know me
24  because of my job, even if I do not know them personally.  Likewise,
25  everybody in the town of Visegrad knows who Mitar Vasiljevic is.  I mean

 1  the people in the very centre of the town.
 2     Q.   Can you estimate for the Court over what period of time you knew
 3  Mitar Vasiljevic?  Perhaps the number of years or months.
 4     A.   As I have already said, between 1983 and the year when the
 5  conflict broke out, (redacted).  That would be six, seven years.
 6     Q.   And over the course of this six or seven year period, are you able
 7  to estimate approximately the total number of times you would have been in
 8  the company of Mitar Vasiljevic?
 9     A.   I saw him once a week, so in over a six year period, that would be
10  about 300 times.
11     Q.   When you entered into the lobby of the hotel or the reception area
12  of the hotel, did you recognise him immediately?
13     A.   It took me two seconds.  As soon as I looked at him.
14     Q.   And when is the last time before the 7th of June that you saw
15  Mitar Vasiljevic?
16     A.   Before the 7th of June I saw him, as I have already said, that I
17  tried -- that I had tried to leave Visegrad, and on the bus where I was,
18  Mitar Vasiljevic boarded that bus in the village of Jagodinja, and he
19  sat in the front of the bus.  Since I was sitting in the back, in the back
20  half of the bus.  He sat behind the driver, and he spoke to a woman
21  sitting there.  Since there weren't that many passengers on the bus, I was
22  able to hear him talk to the woman quite clearly.  I could hear what they
23  were talking about, and since I have already explained how difficult it
24  was to leave the town, I tried to make myself as inconspicuous as possible
25  because I was afraid.  I was simply afraid.

 1     Q.   You just slid down into your seat.  Is that how you tried to make
 2  yourself inconspicuous?
 3     A.   Yes.
 4     Q.   Can you describe how Mitar Vasiljevic was dressed on this day that
 5  you saw him on the bus?
 6     A.   The same as on the 7th of June, but he did not have a hat on his
 7  head.
 8     Q.   Could you tell at that time whether or not he had a weapon with
 9  him?
10     A.   Yes.
11     Q.   And what was that weapon?
12     A.   He had a Schmeisser type weapon.
13      THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note, a submachine-gun.
14     A.   I think it was used in the Second World War.  It's an automatic
15  weapon.  I think that the same type of weapon was produced in Yugoslavia,
16  too.
17     Q.   Now, more recently, did there come a time when an investigator
18  from the Office of the Prosecutor ask you to view some pictures of
19  different people?
20     A.   Yes.
21     Q.   Can you approximate for us around when was that?
22     A.   In February this year, there, somewhere around February.  I don't
23  know the exact date but I do know that it was in February.
24     Q.   And do you recall the name of the investigator who asked you to
25  look at some pictures?

 1     A.   Yes.  It was Mr. Hansen.
 2     Q.   I'm going to ask that the witness be shown Prosecution Exhibit
 3  number 101 [Realtime transcript read in error"1001"].  I would just note
 4  for the record it has two temporary pieces of paper covering up some
 5  information which is protected information.  Your Honour.  That is not in
 6  the binder, Your Honour.  That's a new exhibit today, or newly numbered.
 7  We ask it be put on the ELMO.  Before it's put on the ELMO, I would ask
 8  that the witness view -- look underneath the two white note -- the two
 9  pieces of paper that have been temporarily affixed to that.
10      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, is this the one that you put on the ELMO
11  during the course of your opening address, which revealed a signature?
12      MR. GROOME:  I have covered up the pertinent information.  I'm
13  just asking him, before it's put on the ELMO, to look under it and see if
14  that is his name underneath the disguising device.
15      JUDGE HUNT:  Oh, right.
16     A.   Yes.
17      MR. GROOME:
18     Q.   Do you recognize what this is?
19     A.   Yes.
20     Q.   What do you recognize it to be?
21     A.   This is the same piece of paper that Mr. Hansen showed me in
22  February of this year.
23     Q.   And how do you recognize it to be that same piece of paper?
24     A.   Very simply, I recognise my handwriting and my signature.  I
25  signed it that day.

 1     Q.   I'd ask that it now be placed on the ELMO.  I note that there is
 2  some writing on this piece of paper now.  Was there any writing on the
 3  piece of paper when it was initially shown to you?
 4     A.   No.
 5     Q.   And at the time it was shown to you, what question were you
 6  asked?
 7     A.   I was asked whether I can recognise anyone on those photographs.
 8     Q.   And did you recognise anyone on those photographs?
 9     A.   After three or five seconds, I was able to recognise the first
10  picture in the upper row on the left.
11     Q.   And who did you recognise that to be?
12     A.   I recognised Mitar Vasiljevic.
13     Q.   Was there any doubt in your mind?
14     A.   No.  I signed it.  I was 100 per cent sure that this is indeed
15  Mitar Vasiljevic.
16      MR. GROOME:  Thank you, I'm finished with that exhibit.
17      JUDGE HUNT:  You are recorded as having said that that was the
18  Prosecution Exhibit 1001.  I thought you said 101.
19      MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour 101.
20      JUDGE HUNT:  Are you tendering it now.
21      MR. GROOME:  No, Your Honour, through the investigator.
22      JUDGE HUNT:  All right.
23      MR. GROOME:
24     Q.   I'd ask you to look around this courtroom here today and tell us
25  whether you recognise anybody in this courtroom here today.

 1     A.   Yes.
 2     Q.   Who do you recognize?
 3     A.   The person sitting next to the gentleman in a blue shirt in the
 4  last row there.
 5     Q.   Who do you recognize that to be?
 6     A.   That is Mitar Vasiljevic.
 7     Q.   Now, we want to bring you back to -- you began to describe another
 8  person who was in the lobby at the time you first entered it.  Would you
 9  describe that person for us?
10     A.   The person who was also in the lobby of the hotel was the same
11  person that was in the car, in the Passat car all the time, which means
12  that he got out of the car, out of the Passat car.  He was armed with an
13  automatic rifle.  He stood next to the door to the entrance to the
14  restaurant, and with his rifle pointed at the seven of us.  We were
15  standing in a sort of a semi-circle leaning against the reception desk
16  facing the entrance to the hotel.  I was able to see quite clearly that
17  this person holding this rifle at the ready, pointed at us, that the
18  safety on his weapon was off too which means that it was ready to fire at
19  any time.  I also noticed another thing, that at that time I really -- I
20  really remember it quite well.  One of the persons there asked, what is
21  going to happen with us?"  And this person said that we would probably be
22  exchanged but the very tone of voice led us to believe that this person
23  was not from the area where we lived.
24     Q.   Did you think this person was from another part of Yugoslavia or
25  from some place outside of Yugoslavia?

 1     A.   The voice and the accent reminded me of a person born abroad, and
 2  a person who learnt the -- his own language with another language.  He
 3  spoke a broken Serbo-Croatian.
 4     Q.   Was there anybody else in the lobby, in particular any people that
 5  appeared to be working there or people who appeared to be guests there?
 6     A.   The first thing as we entered the hotel that struck me, and
 7  actually the thing that really scared me, was this spooky silence and
 8  darkness and emptiness in the hotel.  It was in the afternoon.  I often
 9  stayed in that hotel.  And I know that during the day, the lights were on
10  behind the reception desk and on the sides of the corridor, also towards
11  the restaurant, that the lights were on all the time.  But at that time,
12  everything was spookily empty in a kind of a semi-darkness.  There was
13  nobody there except for us and all the other persons who were there, and
14  behind the reception desk, in the place where the keys used to be, there
15  were no keys left.  And in the corridor off the reception, leading towards
16  this area that I mentioned, there was a sheet, a large sheet, and some
17  items were wrapped up in it.  It was all quite dirty.  And this was just
18  lying there on the floor next to the entrance.  Not a single detail
19  indicated that the hotel was open at the time, open for business at the
20  time.
21     Q.   What happened after you went into the reception area?
22     A.   I said that we stood in a semi-circle in front of the reception
23  desk.  Milan Lukic passed by us and went behind the reception desk
24  itself.  He was looking for the keys in the shelves where the keys usually
25  were.  Since he could not find the keys that he was looking for in that

 1  area, then he went to the area behind.  I could no longer see him then.
 2  He came back after a while, quite nervous, and I remember very well that
 3  he kicked this pile of things that was wrapped in a sheet and he kept
 4  saying, "Where are the keys?  The keys aren't there."  And an at one
 5  moment, he said, "Oh, well, the keys aren't there, so we are going back."
 6     Q.   At that time, you say you were at the reception desk, which way
 7  are you facing?
 8     A.   I already said that we were facing the entrance into the hotel,
 9  that is to say the door that led into the hotel.  And we were leaning
10  against the reception desk with our backs.
11     Q.   Could you see Mitar Vasiljevic at this time?
12     A.   Yes, yes.  That is to say that he stood on my right-hand side, as
13  I said, leaning against this right-hand desk, much closer than where this
14  gentleman is now to my right.
15     Q.   Approximately how far away was he from you?
16     A.   Four or five metres maximum.
17     Q.   At this time, did he have anything obstructing his face?
18     A.   No.
19     Q.   You mentioned earlier that the lights were not on in this
20  reception area.  Was there sufficient light for you to be able to see his
21  face?
22     A.   Yes.  The area was sufficiently lit, but, you know, when there is
23  a room that has an enormous door, that is to say this reception area had
24  quite a bit of light.  However, the light is usually striking, like here,
25  but then when we entered that time, there was quite a difference.

 1     Q.   The other man who you described as having a foreign sounding
 2  accent, could you see him at this time?
 3     A.   Yes.
 4     Q.   After Milan Lukic said that you would go back, what happened?
 5     A.   After we got out of the hotel, as we were walking down the steps
 6  to the cars, I heard him say, "Sit the same way you sat on our way
 7  here."  When I got to the Yugo car, I had to pass on the other side, to
 8  the driver's door, in order to enter the same place where I had sat
 9  before.  When we got to the hotel, we made a circle and we stood -- we
10  stopped in front of the hotel.  We made a circle and stopped in front of
11  the hotel.  At that moment, when I walked on the left-hand side to the
12  driver's door, at that moment, the steps leading to the entrance of the
13  hotel were just ahead of me.  I saw quite clearly then Mitar Vasiljevic
14  walking downstairs and joining the rest who were with us.  Then I saw that
15  he was armed.
16     Q.   And what was he armed with?
17     A.   He had an automatic rifle, Kalashnikov type.
18     Q.   When you came out of the hotel, did you see any other car there
19  besides the Yugo?
20     A.   Yes, the Passat was there too.
21     Q.   And were people told to get into the Passat as well?
22     A.   Yes.
23     Q.   Did there come a time when the Yugo drove away again?
24     A.   Yes.
25     Q.   And were the same people in the Yugo at this time as were in it

 1  when you drove to the hotel?
 2     A.   Yes.
 3     Q.   Can you describe for us what happened as the Yugo drove from the
 4  hotel?
 5     A.   When we left the hotel, that is to say the place in front of the
 6  hotel, I'm not quite sure now after how much time, the Yugo went to the
 7  right a bit and let the Passat overtake us.  This part of the road leading
 8  to the hotel was pretty narrow, you know, so then there was this one place
 9  that was a bit wider and then we managed to slow down and the Passat
10  passed on my left-hand side.  It overtook us.  It could not pass very
11  quickly, and then I saw quite clearly that Mitar was sitting in the car
12  and that the car was driven by Milan Lukic and that the rest were inside
13  too but I could see quite clearly when they were passing by us that Passat
14  continued straight ahead and we were following it.  While we were going
15  towards Sase, the person, the soldier who sat next to us, also held the
16  same position that he held before that.  Again he was sitting with his gun
17  pointed at Ekrem.
18     Q.   Did he say anything during the course of this second trip in the
19  Yugo?
20     A.   First we asked him what would happen to us.  And he said, "Do not
21  be scared.  We are going to Uzamnica [phoen] and you will probably be
22  exchanged."
23     Q.   Did he offer anybody cigarettes?
24     A.   Yes.
25     Q.   Did the car go to Uzamnica?

 1     A.   No.
 2     Q.   Where did the car go?
 3     A.   When we reached Sase, that is to say the intersection where the
 4  checkpoint was, where we had stopped before that, instead of going in the
 5  direction of Visegrad to the left, the Passat turned to the right, in the
 6  direction of Visegradska Zupa.
 7     Q.   And how far along that road did the cars travel?
 8     A.   Not that far along.  Five hundred to 700 metres.  I couldn't say
 9  accurately, but I'm sure that we stopped before the warehouse, the storage
10  area that was on the right-hand side of that road.  I think that Purisa
11  Markovic was the owner of this warehouse.
12      We stopped before that particular place.  I think that the few
13  houses that are there before the warehouse are called Jasarevic.  At any
14  rate, it's less than one kilometre, I cannot say exactly how many metres.
15     Q.   Aside from the few houses that are there, can you describe what
16  the area is like for the Court?
17     A.   This area is pretty flat, from the road to the Drina River.  There
18  is a gentle slope, very gentle.  You could even say that it was flat.  On
19  the right-hand side, a hill begins and there are a few houses there.  This
20  is on the right -- on the right bank of the Drina river, that is to
21  say, in the direction of Visegradska Zupa.
22     Q.   Did both cars stop at the same location?
23     A.   Yes.
24     Q.   And tell us what happened after the two cars stopped?
25     A.   Since the Passat reached that spot a bit before us, they had

 1  already stopped and people were already getting out of the Passat.  We
 2  stopped behind them and we were ordered to go out.  The moment we got
 3  out -- at the moment we got out and stood in the road, on the left-hand
 4  side, the behaviour of the soldier changed drastically.
 5     Q.   When you say "changed drastically," would you describe his
 6  demeanour or behaviour now at this stage?
 7     A.   I'm sorry, I don't know who you are referring to.  Are you
 8  referring to everyone or to individuals?
 9     Q.   You just referred to a soldier whose behaviour changed
10  drastically.  Which soldier were you referring to?
11     A.   I meant everybody.  I meant all four of them, actually, who were
12  present there.
13     Q.   Would you please describe how their behaviour changed?
14     A.   I said that the soldier who was sitting in the car as we were
15  driving back from the hotel offered us cigarettes.  He talked to us very
16  nicely.  But the moment we got out of the car, they stepped back.  They
17  moved a few metres to the side, and their weapons were on the ready, and
18  they spoke to us very harshly.  They used very harsh words to order us to
19  walk in the direction of the river.
20     Q.   I want to ask you -- you said they had their weapons "on the
21  ready."  What exactly do you mean by that?
22     A.   I mean that the weapons were pointed at us, and of course the
23  rifles had their safeties off.
24     Q.   I want to ask you specifically about Mitar Vasiljevic.  Did he
25  have his rifle or did he still have a weapon at this time?

 1     A.   Yes.
 2     Q.   And did he too have his weapon pointed at the detained men?
 3     A.   Yes.
 4     Q.   You stated a moment ago that somebody told the men to head towards
 5  the river or go down towards the river.  Who was that person?
 6     A.   That was Milan Lukic.
 7     Q.   At this time, when you're at the car, did you hear Mitar
 8  Vasiljevic say anything?
 9     A.   No.
10     Q.   Did you walk down towards the river?
11     A.   Yes.
12     Q.   Could you please describe that for us?
13     A.   When we set out towards the river, until that moment, I had some
14  hope that after all there would be a happy end, as far as I was
15  concerned.  However, when I got off the asphalt road to the meadow, and
16  when I saw the river ahead of me, this hope started to fade.  After 10 or
17  15 metres, since we were walking in a group -- not all of us together.  we
18  were almost one next to the other.  I was towards the right, more or less
19  on the right-hand side compared to the middle of that group.  I remember
20  well that on my left was Witness number 14.
21      However, at one moment, I
22  tried slowly -- as I was walking towards the river, I tried to move to the
23  left side of that group.  Why?  Because my brother-in-law was on the
24  extreme left.  I was aware of what was going to happen, and I wanted to
25  get as close to him as possible in order to say goodbye.  However, I

 1  didn't manage.  As I tried to go to that side, I was stopped harshly with
 2  the following words:  "Walk straight ahead.  If I see someone moving to
 3  the side, I shall shoot."  This was said very roughly in a commanding
 4  voice.  So I did not dare take a single step to the side.  I just walked
 5  straight ahead.
 6      I don't know exactly how long this meadow is.  I can't exactly
 7  tell whether it's about 100 metres perhaps,  But I had the feeling that it
 8  was kilometres.  It was so long to me.  At one moment, I even wished that
 9  we reach the river as soon as possible.
10      Perhaps three or four minutes were required - I don't know - then
11  we got to the willows that were just by the Drina River.  When we passed
12  these willows, I saw that there is a small kind of plateau covered by
13  grass, and that after that was sand because the level of the lake had gone
14  down.  So there were about seven or eight or ten metres of this sand and
15  then came the water.
16      However, we stopped there at that patch of grass underneath the
17  willows.  At one moment, Lukic asked, "Which one of you knows how to
18  swim?"  I don't know why.  But I said that I knew how to swim.  I was
19  convinced that the others, most of them, knew how to swim, and it wasn't
20  clear to me why they didn't speak up.  But I did say that I could swim.
21  At one moment, I said, "If I have to get killed, I don't have to watch.
22  Let me be the first one.  Let me not watch what is happening to the
23  others."
24      After that, he said, "Come on, go towards the water."  I started
25  walking very, very slowly.  Do you understand this?  Probably like any

 1  person in this world who is aware that he is walking his last ten metres
 2  in his life, it was slow, very slow.  When I took the first two or three
 3  steps, it was probably clear to the others too what would happen.  They
 4  started pleading.  First I heard Meho on my right pleading, "Mitar, please
 5  don't."  Then I heard my brother-in-law on the other side, because this is
 6  a person I liked very much.  I heard him on the other side saying,
 7  "People, don't kill us.  What are we to be blamed for?"  However, all of
 8  this just withered away in me.  These last ten metres of my life, I just
 9  wanted to -- I just wanted to spend them with my two-year-old daughter.
10      While I was crossing these ten metres, I didn't see a thing.
11  You're walking and you can't see a thing.  There is a river in front of
12  you, there is a hill in front of you, but you can't see it.  I just saw
13  the image of my daughter running across a room, running into my arms.
14      At one moment, I reached the very edge of the river.  I don't know
15  how much time it took for me to cross these ten metres.  Probably not very
16  long, although I was walking slowly, very, very slowly.  When I got to the
17  very edge of the river, I heard a voice saying, "Stop there."
18  Automatically, I stopped.  Then I heard the others.  I mean, I heard the
19  others being forced to walk up and stand next to me.  They behaved very,
20  very roughly then.  They were cussing, swearing, cussing our balija
21  mothers, saying, "Walk up there, you balija," and all the other swear
22  words.
23      At one moment, when everybody walked up there and stopped on my
24  right-hand side and on my left-hand side, I was still with my daughter,
25  actually.  I did not register things.  And at one moment, I heard a voice

 1  asking, "Are we going to shoot individually or in bursts of gunfire?"  I
 2  heard the answer, Individually."  At that moment, there was a ray of hope
 3  in me.  I was thinking very fast and there was this film that was
 4  unwinding in my head very, very fast.  I thought, if there is four of
 5  them, if they are going to shoot individually, if I am lucky enough not to
 6  be the first to be hit, I'll try to jump into the water and dive
 7  underneath the surface.  That was the first thing that occurred to me.  As
 8  I was thinking about this - this is just a few seconds, this is just three
 9  or four seconds - I heard the automatic weapons being adjusted for bursts
10  of gunfire.  That is a sound that can be heard quite clearly on an
11  automatic rifle.  I heard very well these three clicks coming from three
12  different sides behind me.
13      Believe me, until the present day, I am often awakened from my
14  sleep by these three clicks.  These three clicks had not even stopped when
15  I heard, on my right-hand side, a scream, a scream that stopped halfway.
16  That was the scream of Meho Dzafic, who was standing on my right-hand
17  side.  There was only one person between us.  At that moment, I did not
18  hear a gunshot.
19      But when I heard this scream, I instinctively jumped into the
20  river.  I fell into the river.  As I was falling into the water, I
21  remember very well that I saw blood, blood between the water and the sand,
22  a bit on the sand, a bit on the water.  I remember, very, very, very well
23  that I saw this red smear.  When I fell into the water, I told you that my
24  first idea was that I should dive underneath the surface.  However, I
25  decided not to do that.  Since I had not been hit, I decided to pretend

 1  that I was dead.  As I was falling into the water, I heard gunshots.  I
 2  heard screams to my left and right.
 3      These were horrible screams.  These were howls, almost.  When I
 4  got into the water, I was lying on my stomach and I realised that I could
 5  not remain in that position for long because my face was in the water.
 6  There was a small part of the bank that was on my right, about 1 metre
 7  high, that was like a part of the sand that was there.  I decided to turn
 8  around and try to put my head into the sand, and then pretend to be dead.
 9  Since at that moment, there was chaos around me - all of those who had
10  been hit were not dead straightaway - I used that moment to do that, to
11  turn around towards the bank, and I remember well that I put my head --
12  you know, when there are waves in the water, then they make this little
13  step, or whatever you choose to call it, in the sand.  I put my head on
14  this little step and, unconsciously, my hands and arms were underneath the
15  water, but I stuck my hands into the sand, into the river bank.
16      I think that I did that out of fear.  But later on, it turned out
17  that I was very lucky to have done that.  As I was lying in that position,
18  I was wondering whether a dead man's eyes are open or closed, whether his
19  eyes are open or closed.  I decided to close my eyes nevertheless, one eye
20  actually, because I was in this position:  this half of my head, half of
21  my mouth, half of my nose, and this other half was outside the sand, so I
22  was in this position.
23      Also, before I decided to close my eyes, from that position that I
24  was in, I saw Hasan, who was standing on the left, on my left, on the
25  bank, who had been standing there.  He was wounded and he was trying to

 1  hide behind this small part of the river bank, doing this with his hands,
 2  struggling, and as he was doing that, this mud and sand was falling on my
 3  head.  A bit further off, I saw my brother-in-law like a wounded animal,
 4  struggling with the water.  Then I closed my eyes.  I couldn't watch any
 5  more.
 6      At one moment, I heard steps.  I heard the sound of steps up there
 7  and I heard gunshots again.  In the position that I was in then, Ekrem
 8  Dzafic was on my left.  He was quiet.  I no longer heard him.  After that,
 9  I heard a gunshot on my right, and at that moment, as if somebody had
10  brought a man and dropped him on me, it's as if somebody had dropped him
11  on me, I felt that that man's head was behind my neck and that the body
12  was over me.  It was the weight of the body that was pushing me deeper
13  into the water.  However, I was really lucky because, before that, out of
14  fear or whatever, I was holding on to the sand underneath.  So when the
15  body fell on me, I sank a bit but I managed to keep my head up on the
16  sand.
17      At that moment, I heard a gunshot, that is to say, on my right
18  where my brother-in-law was.  Again, everything went silent.  I heard a
19  voice saying, "Here's one who is alive."  At that moment, I thought it was
20  me.  I'm the only one who is alive, you know.  And again, I went back to
21  my daughter.  I thought I'm dying now and I want to be with her.  However,
22  I heard two gunshots and I heard two blunt blows and one gunshot, which
23  resounded.  A bullet hit the surface of the water, and then I heard steps
24  going away from that place.
25      I don't know how long I lay there like that.  At one moment, I

 1  decided to open my right eye.  The first thing I saw when I opened my
 2  right eye was, 10 or 15 centimetres away from my eye, on that sand, there
 3  was a tooth, not an entire tooth but a tooth.  Since this is my
 4  profession, I knew exactly which tooth this was.  I looked a bit further
 5  away and I saw a man lying there who had also been with us.  I had not
 6  known him.
 7      A bit further off, I saw Witness number 14.  A bit further
 8  off, but more into the water, I saw my brother-in-law lying with his head
 9  down.  I closed my eye again and I was thinking, "Now what?"  I don't know
10  how long I spent that way.  And then I opened my eye again and I saw one
11  of those over there lifting his head and looking around terrified, and I
12  just said, "Psst" to him, nothing else.  He looked at me and he asked me,
13  "Are you wounded?"  And I said, "No."  And he said, "I'm not either."
14       He said, "What do we do now?"  I asked him -- actually, I said,
15  "Wait a minute.  We heard the cars driving off.  I said, "Let's just wait
16  a bit more and then we are going to take a peek above to see whether they
17  have actually left."
18      However, the question was how to take this peek.
19      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, I think we will have to stop now.  It
20  seems to be a natural place.  We will resume again at 2.40.
21      MR. GROOME:  Thank you, Your Honour.

 1      MR. GROOME:
 2     Q.   Witness 32, before the break, we finished when you were describing
 3  that you realised that you had not been wounded and that perhaps another
 4  person had not been wounded as well.  I would ask you to continue from
 5  there, please.
 6     A.   After I had ascertained 100 per cent that I was not wounded, and
 7  when I opened an eye, I was able to see that another person was lifting
 8  his head from the sand, and was looking around, bewildered.  I just
 9  managed to say "psst," and he asked me, "Are you wounded?   I said, "No,
10  are you wounded?"  And he also said that he wasn't.
11      Then I was thinking what do we do next?  And I decided that we
12  should stay there at the spot for some -- sometime because I did not hear
13  the cars leave.  I don't know how long I stayed there, but I felt the body
14  on my back, and I felt this warmth of this corpse that actually warmed me
15  up.  The body itself did not cool down, although the water in the Drina
16  River is quite cold at the time of year.  Then I asked Witness 14, what do
17  we do?  What should I do with the person lying on me back?  And he said,
18  "Well, just roll him over so that he falls off your back and into the
19  water."  When I did that, when I rolled him over, I saw that this was, in,
20  fact, Hasan Mutapcic.  I also saw this horrifying picture.  The bullet had
21  hit him from behind and the exit wound was huge, so that the front part,
22  the right side, was totally destroyed.
23      I slowly stood up, and I was wondering how I could take a peek
24  over the edge to make sure that the -- those persons had left so I raised
25  myself inch by inch and I thought, well, if I lift my head just straight

 1  up, and I have -- if I lift it up, as high as to be able to see something,
 2  a large part of my head will be visible over the edge of the sand, and I
 3  decided to do it in such a way that, the least, the smallest part of my
 4  head is visible.  When I did that, I realised that there was nobody
 5  there.  And then I told Witness 14 that it was safe and that we can get
 6  out of the water and on to the sand.
 7      I remember that when we got out of the water and on to the sand,
 8  he still had his watch on his wrist.  I think it was around 7.00 p.m.  I
 9  asked him, "What do we do now?"  And he told me that he was -- he had been
10  born in the village just across, but I just wanted to be able to see my
11  friend for the very last time.  So I went back to the very edge, but I
12  couldn't reach him as he was three or four metres away, lying in the
13  water, all curled up, with his head facing downwards.  I also looked at
14  the other people lying around and I will never, ever forget this image for
15  as long as I live.
16      Then I decided that we should leave this place, and at my
17  proposal, we went downstream from this place, going slowly, using the
18  willows as shelter and moving along the edge of the sand.  And we were
19  able to go a distance of about a kilometre.  And near this stream in
20  Musicy, I see -- I saw quite a lot of smoke.  I decided that we should
21  reconnoitre the situation, see what's going on, and I saw that there was
22  some kind of a checkpoint there and that there were some soldiers.  So we
23  -- I decided that we should go back, back-track a bit, and wait under a
24  willow for the night fall.
25      Witness 14 insisted the whole time that we should swim across the

 1  Drina River, but some instinct or I don't know what made me do this or
 2  decide this, whether it was just my luck, I decided not to listen to him
 3  and not to do it at that time.  I said, "We should wait until the night
 4  falls," although we were afraid that these people would come back to the
 5  same place because another group had remained, stayed behind, in the house
 6  in Bikavac where we were -- we had been at first.
 7      But then again, I was thinking -- I didn't really think that they
 8  would come back on the very same spot and in -- I decided that if we saw
 9  them, we would swim across and I thought that we would be able to make --
10  to reach it, to reach the other, almost the other bank by the time it
11  would take them to reach that spot.  So on my initiative, I actually -- I
12  suggested to Witness 14 that -- I suggested that we should find a piece of
13  wood which should assist us to cross to the other side.
14      At first, I thought that I should swim in fully clothed but
15  because the river is quite wide there, about 200 metres, it was a long way
16  for me.  I was quite exhausted.  I didn't have a proper meal, I hadn't had
17  a proper meal in maybe seven days.  I thought that perhaps I wouldn't be
18  able to take it, this physical effort.  I knew that I should take off my
19  clothes, and I didn't know what to do naked on the other bank.  So I
20  decided that we should find something that would assist us to cross the
21  river.  And it seemed that somebody had left a large piece of dry -- dried
22  poplar that was just lying there.  We tried to take it to the river but it
23  was quite heavy.  Because this is very shallow and I sank into the sand
24  knee deep, so we tried to find a place where the river was deeper, and we
25  were quite lucky because 20 or 30 metres away, there was a spot where the

 1  river was quite deep, right at the bank.  We threw the piece of wood into
 2  the river.  I saw that it floated.  I jumped, again tried whether it was
 3  safe, and then I told Witness 14 to jump.
 4     Q.   Did you eventually reach that village you were trying to reach?
 5     A.   Yes.
 6     Q.   Was it there that you then again felt safe?
 7     A.   It was only when I entered Witness 14's house was I able to relax
 8  and to feel safe.
 9     Q.   I want to return you to the portion in time when you're first
10  walking into the field towards the river.  And I want to ask you where was
11  Mitar Vasiljevic at the time that you were walking towards the river?
12     A.   When I was ordered to go towards the river, he was to my right.
13     Q.   Was he close enough to you that, if he spoke, you would have been
14  in a position to hear him?
15     A.   Yes.
16     Q.   Did you hear him say anything?
17     A.   No.  I did not hear a single word.  I didn't hear him utter a
18  single word.
19     Q.   Did you hear or see him do anything to attempt to dissuade Milan
20  Lukic from carrying out this execution?
21     A.   The only -- I did not see a single gesture or a word.  I did not
22  hear a single word.
23     Q.   You mentioned before in your testimony that you heard the click of
24  three automatic weapons.  Which of these four men had the three automatic
25  weapons?

 1     A.   Yes.  Mitar Vasiljevic, the person that was sitting with us in the
 2  car, and the person from the Passat.  So the person to our left while we
 3  were in the hotel lobby looking towards the entrance of the hotel.
 4     Q.   In light of your military experience, were you familiar with the
 5  type of gun that Milan Lukic was carrying?
 6     A.   Yes.
 7     Q.   And did that have an automatic device to switch on?
 8     A.   No.
 9     Q.   I just want to ask you one question which I just need to ask you.
10  The five men who you left on the river bank that day, are you sure they
11  were dead?
12     A.   Yes.
13      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I'm going to ask that the witness be
14  shown --
15      JUDGE HUNT:  You wanted to add something?
16     A.   Since I stayed for the next seven days in Witness 14's house, I
17  went to a rock every day and I watched the spot where it happened through
18  binoculars.  Throughout the period of the seven days, the five men who
19  were killed on -- who had been killed on that occasion remained there on
20  the same spot.
21      MR. GROOME:  Thank you.  Your Honour, I'd ask that Prosecution
22  Exhibit number 131 be placed on the ELMO in a position that the witness
23  can see it.
24     Q.   Witness number 32, there is a photograph on the table in front of
25  you.  I'd ask you, do you recognize what is depicted in that photograph?

 1     A.   Yes.
 2     Q.   What is depicted in that photograph?
 3     A.   This is the photograph of the lobby of the Vilina Vlas hotel.
 4     Q.   And does it fairly and accurately represent the lobby and the
 5  positions of the different features of the lobby that you described in
 6  your testimony here today?
 7     A.   Yes.
 8      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, at that time I would move Prosecution
 9  Exhibit number 131 into evidence.
10      JUDGE HUNT:  You may remember that when the witness was describing
11  what was happening there, he spoke about movements that were up high, he
12  said.  It may be as well if we understood he was referring to the veranda
13  at the top there, or whatever it is.  This is when Lukic was looking for
14  keys, I think.
15      MR. GROOME:  Yes.  I'll clear that up, thank you, Your Honour.
16      JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.
17      MR. GROOME:
18     Q.   I would ask you to take the pen that is in front of you, or the
19  pen -- I'll ask him actually to mark the exhibit.  I'll ask you to draw a
20  circle and put the initials MV to indicate where Mitar Vasiljevic was when
21  you saw him in the lobby.
22     A.   [Marks].
23     Q.   I'll ask you to put a circle with a letter P in it to indicate the
24  other paramilitary person whom you described but did not know his name.
25  Where was he?

 1     A.   [Marks].
 2     Q.   Now, you mentioned a balcony in which you described, I think, a
 3  restaurant or some other feature of the lobby.  Could you please tell us
 4  again where that was and label it on the diagram or on the photograph in
 5  front of you?
 6     A.   I think I was actually misunderstood.  I did not mention a
 7  balcony.  I talked about a place behind the reception desk where, as is
 8  usual in any reception, the keys are located.  This area is where in every
 9  hotel there are little nooks where the keys are.  Perhaps my words have
10  been misinterpreted.
11     Q.   Could you please show us where you and the other men were --
12      JUDGE HUNT:  Just one moment.  I don't remember him using the word
13  balcony, either, but my reference was to his hand moving above his head.
14  That's all I wanted to do, was to make sure that we understood he was or
15  was not referring to what appears to be a balcony there.  The witness says
16  no, and that he did not suggest that the other person was up there.  So
17  we've got that clear.  But you've tendered this.  Is it just this one
18  sheet?  Because we've been handed three sheets.
19      MR. GROOME:  There will be two other exhibits that I'll discuss
20  with the witness, Your Honour.
21      JUDGE HUNT:  Do you want him to mark anything else?
22      MR. GROOME:  I just want him to point out a couple of other
23  things.
24     Q.   You spoke about Milan Lukic going behind the reception desk,
25  looking for keys.  You've just indicated that.  You then said that he went

1  into a door.  Would you please indicate on that picture where that door is
 2  located?
 3     A.   Here.
 4     Q.   Thank you.
 5      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, is there any objection to the admission
 6  of this exhibit?
 7      MR. DOMAZET:  [English] No, Your Honour, no objection.
 8      JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  It will be Exhibit P131.
 9      MR. GROOME:
10     Q.   Witness 32, over the last several days, did I ask you to draw two
11  diagrams to help the Court understand the positions of the different
12  people you've referred to in your testimony?
13     A.   Yes.
14     Q.   I'd ask that Exhibit number 132 be placed on the ELMO for the
15  witness.  I'd ask you just to describe some of the features in the -- in
16  this diagram.  In your testimony you mentioned a door way to the pool.
17  Would you please point that out to the Court at this time?
18     A.   [Indicates]
19     Q.   Right next to that doorway is a circle with a MV.  What does that
20  indicate?
21     A.   This indicates the spot where Mitar Vasiljevic was standing.
22     Q.   There are seven blank circles up against the -- what's labelled
23  reception.  What do they indicate?
24     A.   The seven circles show where the seven of us standing at the
25  reception actually were.

 1     Q.   What does the circle with ML in it indicate?
 2     A.   The circle with letters ML indicates the spot where Milan Lukic
 3  was and the arrow indicates the direction in which he was going through
 4  the door, and the arrow going right indicates that he went behind the
 5  reception.
 6     Q.   And can you indicate where the entrance to the restaurant was?
 7     A.   [indicates]
 8     Q.   The circle that is just next to the restaurant, what does that
 9  indicate?
10     A.   This indicates the soldier that stood here and whom I marked with
11  a letter P, a little while ago.
12     Q.   And finally, could you show us the entrance into this reception
13  area?
14     A.   [Indicates]
15     Q.   Okay.
16      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I formally now at this time tender
17  Prosecution Exhibit number 132 into evidence.
18      JUDGE HUNT:  Any objection, Mr. Domazet?
19      MR. DOMAZET:  [Interpretation] No, Your Honour, I have no
20  objections.  I just fail to understand whether this sketch was done by the
21  witness himself or whether he merely indicated those locations on the
22  drawing and the actual drawing was done by somebody else.
23      JUDGE HUNT:  Well, you did ask him whether he would do it but you
24  haven't asked him whether this is what he did.  So perhaps you better do
25  it.

 1      MR. GROOME:
 2     Q.   Is it the diagram that you yourself did?
 3     A.   Yes.
 4     Q.   Did you receive any assistance in doing it from anyone?
 5     A.   No.  I used the -- a little coin to draw those circles.
 6      JUDGE HUNT:  That will be Exhibit P132.
 7      MR. GROOME:  Finally, Your Honour, I would ask the Prosecution
 8  Exhibit number 133 be placed on the ELMO.
 9      JUDGE HUNT:  It's not an exhibit yet, Mr. Groome.
10      MR. GROOME:  Marked for identification.
11      JUDGE HUNT:  It's not even that.  It's a document marked 133 and
12  then when you want it to go into evidence, may I suggest you say you
13  tender the document rather than the exhibit.
14      Yes.
15      MR. GROOME:
16     Q.   Do you recognize what Prosecution document number 133 is?
17     A.   Yes.
18     Q.   And what is that?
19     A.   This is a schematic presentation of the location by the river
20  where this event took place.
21     Q.   Would you please indicate where the water is?
22     A.   [Indicates]
23     Q.   Would you please indicate --
24     A.   The arrow indicates the direction in which the river flows.
25     Q.   Would you please indicate where the sand is?

 1      JUDGE HUNT:  Perhaps if he could just agree with the descriptions
 2  given in the document, it would be quicker.
 3      MR. GROOME:
 4     Q.   Did you label the different items that you referred to in your
 5  testimony on this document?
 6     A.   Yes.
 7     Q.   Were you present when a translator translated your words into
 8  English next to the words that you wrote?
 9     A.   Yes.
10      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, the document on the ELMO has one of the
11  identifying initials blacked out.  Is that meant to be on ours as well or
12  is it just for the purposes of avoiding identification?
13      MR. GROOME:  Purposes are avoiding identification, Your Honour.
14      JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
15      MR. GROOME:
16     Q.   I'd ask you to indicate -- the seven circles on the top of the
17  diagram, what do they indicate?
18     A.   The seven circles indicate the seven of us and the order in which
19  we stood.
20     Q.   I'd ask you to indicate where you were.
21     A.   [Indicates]
22     Q.   To the right of that, you have 5-10 M.  What does that indicate?
23     A.   This indicates that the width of the sand was five to ten metres,
24  from the beginning -- from the place where the sand begin to the bank,
25  the distance is between five and ten metres.
 1     Q.   Can I take it, then, that 2-4 M indicates two to four metres?
 2     A.   Yes.  This is the grassy area where we first came.  That's what I
 3  was talking about earlier.
 4     Q.   The four blank circles towards the bottom of the diagram, what do
 5  they represent?
 6     A.   These are the four soldiers.
 7     Q.   I'm Going to ask you to take the black pen that you have on your
 8  table and put the initials MV to indicate, the black one -- okay, the
 9  orange one, the orange marker, and indicate in the circle that represents
10  where Mitar Vasiljevic was, the last time you saw him and know his
11  position.
12     A.   [Marks]
13     Q.   Going to ask you to -- well let me ask you this:  Do you know --
14  can you identify where Milan Lukic was the last time that you saw him?
15     A.   Yes.  The last time I saw Milan Lukic, that was the time when he
16  ordered me to start walking towards the river, and after the first two
17  metres, he was already behind my back.  But as I walked the first two
18  metres, one or two metres, I'm not sure, he stood here.
19     Q.   And that's to Mitar Vasiljevic's left?
20     A.   Yes.
21      MR. GROOME:  Thank you.  Your Honour I have no further questions.
22      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet?
23              Cross-examined by Mr. Domazet:
24     Q.   [Interpretation] Sir, at the beginning of your testimony today,
25  you spoke about the situation in town at the time when the Uzice Corps

 1  came.  Do you remember those days before the Uzice Corps came, what the
 2  situation was like in town, and do you know why the Uzice Corps came to
 3  town?
 4     A.   I have said in my statement that just before the Uzice Corps
 5  entered town, I had not been in Visegrad.  Five or six days after the
 6  conflict broke out, I left the territory of the town of Visegrad.
 7     Q.   You returned to town after the Uzice Corps came?
 8     A.   Yes.
 9     Q.   As for the conflict, as for the conflict that you have been
10  speaking about, that is a conflict before the Uzice Corps came.  Can you
11  explain what kind of conflict this was?
12     A.   I simply heard information that there were clashes and that the
13  village of Dobrun was being shot at.  That is the first information I
14  received about the outbreak of the conflict in the territory of the
15  municipality of Visegrad.
16     Q.   And after that, you left the town?
17     A.   I said that as the shooting and clashes were getting closer to the
18  centre of town, I decided to leave town not wishing to take part in any
19  conflicts.
20     Q.   Did many people leave the town at that time?
21     A.   Practically the entire town left.  Oh, I'm sorry, yes.  When I
22  left, yes, quite a few people left town, yes.
23     Q.   Were these Muslims and Serbs?
24     A.   Yes.
25     Q.   Were you perhaps at the stadium when the speech was made to the

 1  persons who were citizens of Visegrad and who had returned to Visegrad,
 2  and was this done by a JNA officer?
 3     A.   I was not there.
 4     Q.   Do you know anything more about that?
 5     A.   No.
 6     Q.   I would like to ask you about what you know about the
 7  paramilitaries, that is to say illegitimate military forces that appeared
 8  in Visegrad itself.  You said today that for the most part, everybody
 9  called them the White Eagles, Beli Orlovi, but in a previous statement you
10  gave, if you remember, you mentioned a group called Garavi Sokak precisely
11  referring to the group from Obrenovac; is that correct?
12     A.   Yes.
13     Q.   The group that came from Obrenovac was called Garavi Sokak;
14  correct?
15     A.   I just heard that, I have to say that I just heard that they were
16  called Garavi Sokak.  It's not that I know precisely that that was their
17  name.  I said in my statement that I heard that this group was called
18  Garavi Sokak.
19      JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, I'm sorry to remind you that you must
20  pause.  You must pause, both you and the witness.  Because you are both
21  speaking the same language, the interpreters don't get the benefit of a
22  pause while the translation is being made.  So please pause before you
23  answer the question, and Mr. Domazet, you know to pause before you ask the
24  question.
25      MR. DOMAZET:  Okay.

 1     Q.   [Interpretation] Do you know who the leader of that group was,
 2  this group from Obrenovac, as they were called?
 3     A.   I heard that Milan Lukic was the leader of that group.
 4     Q.   Did you hear about the name of any other paramilitary group except
 5  those that we referred to today?
 6     A.   I said already today that there were Seselj's men, that there were
 7  Arkan's men.
 8     Q.   Did you hear about a group called Osvetnik, the avenger, or
 9  something like that?
10     A.   No.
11     Q.   Do you know that after the Uzice Corps left, sometime around the
12  1st of June, there were orders to expel all paramilitary forces from
13  Visegrad?
14     A.   No.
15     Q.   You did not hear of something like that or you did not see them?
16     A.   No.
17     Q.   You said that you saw quite a few of these paramilitaries and that
18  some of them even stopped you.  Did you notice that they spoke in a
19  dialect that differed from that that the people from your immediate
20  surroundings used?
21     A.   Yes, yes.  Especially when I refer to that other instance when
22  they asked me to buy my life.  Then I had the opportunity of having this
23  longer contact with these persons.  Perhaps about half an hour I spent
24  with them.  I even asked one of them, "Where are you from?"  And he
25  said -- he actually spoke to a colleague of his.  He said, "Lucky, if I

 1  tell him where we are from, I'll have to kill him; right?"  And then I
 2  said, "No, no, no, no, no, sir, no way.  I'm really not interested in
 3  where you're from."
 4     Q.   Did you notice by his speech that he was not from Visegrad or the
 5  surroundings of Visegrad?
 6     A.   No, they spoke in the Ekavian dialect.
 7     Q.   When you spoke about the two-headed eagle insignia, you said that
 8  this caused fear or at least suspicion among you and the other Muslims, as
 9  it reminded you of the Second World War?
10     A.   Yes.
11     Q.   And the Chetniks from the Second World War.  Did I understand you
12  correctly?
13     A.   Yes.
14     Q.   However, do you know that there is a difference between what is
15  called a cockade, which does include a two-headed eagle, and on the other
16  hand, the symbol of the two-headed eagle on the insignia itself?
17     A.   Yes.
18     Q.   Do you know that the Army of Yugoslavia and the Army of Republika
19  Srpska and also the coat of arms of the present day Federal Republic of
20  Yugoslavia include this two-headed eagle?
21     A.   Yes.
22     Q.   The soldiers of the Uzice Corps who came to Visegrad, did they
23  have the same insignia?
24     A.   No.
25     Q.   You mentioned Milan Lukic several times today and you talked about

 1  him.  You even know where he was born.  Since when have you known him
 2  personally?  When did you first see him?
 3     A.   I first saw him during the stay of the Uzice Corps in the town of
 4  Visegrad.
 5     Q.   He wore a uniform then and was armed; right?
 6     A.   Yes, he wore a uniform but not the same one he wore when I was
 7  taken away.  At that time he wore an ordinary camouflage uniform but the
 8  same sneakers, and also he had the same weapons.
 9     Q.   When you say an ordinary camouflage uniform, are you referring to
10  a military camouflage uniform or, rather, that brown and olive-green
11  uniform as opposed to police uniforms that are camouflage uniforms but
12  predominantly blue?
13     A.   Yes, precisely.
14     Q.   So when you first saw him, he had a camouflage uniform that was a
15  military uniform and on this other occasion, he had a police camouflage
16  uniform; right?
17     A.   Yes.
18     Q.   Although you described the behaviour of Milan Lukic and his
19  demeanour in quite a bit of detail, I would still have a question for
20  you.  Did you notice someone around Milan Lukic who issued orders to him
21  or someone that he had obeyed?
22     A.   No.
23     Q.   In all the situations that you were with him, he was the one who
24  was giving the orders; is my understanding of your answer correct?
25     A.   Yes.

 1     Q.   Since you had quite a bit of time to perceive him, you were around
 2  him for quite a while and you managed to see him and also the people
 3  around him, do you think that anyone around him could actually affect him
 4  or his decisions and orders in any meaningful way?
 5     A.   As for the people who were around him then, no.
 6     Q.   In view of your profession, I have a specific question.  Do you
 7  remember the names of persons -- the name of a person, rather, who worked
 8  as a medical technician, a nurse, on blood tests, who took people's blood
 9  at the medical centre Visegrad at that time?
10     A.   I don't know which period you're referring to.
11     Q.   I'm referring to the period when the Uzice Corps was there and the
12  immediate aftermath?
13      JUDGE HUNT:  Just remember, please, to pause, all of you.
14     A.   I know one man who worked at the lab then but I don't know if he's
15  the one who took blood personally, because I simply had no need to be at
16  the lab.
17      MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation]
18     Q.   Was that Slavko Tomic perhaps?
19     A.   Yes, I know him.
20     Q.   Thank you.  You knew Meho Dzafic well.  That's what you said
21  today, right, and his family?
22     A.   Yes.
23     Q.   You know that for many years, he worked with Mitar Vasiljevic and
24  that he retired from that company.  Was Meho Dzafic ever Mitar
25  Vasiljevic's boss or not?

 1     A.   I don't know.  I really don't know whether he was ever his boss.
 2  However, as a long-term employee, they probably -- I don't know.  I don't
 3  know whether he was his boss.
 4     Q.   Do you know anything about their relationship at the time, or
 5  rather was there anything bad between them or did they have a fairly good
 6  relationship, or do you know anything about this at all?
 7     A.   No, I don't know anything about it.
 8     Q.   When you went to Vilina Vlas in that car, you were stopped at a
 9  checkpoint, if I understood you correctly, at the intersection Sase-Vilina
10  Vlas.  As you were returning, did you pass by that checkpoint again?
11      JUDGE HUNT:  I'm sorry, but I thought I heard the witness say
12  something.  It's because neither of you are complying with this
13  requirement to pause.  Was there any answer to that last question, when
14  you went to Vilina Vlas in that car you were stopped at a checkpoint, if I
15  understood you correctly, at the intersection.  Now, I don't know whether
16  that was your question and then the next piece of it was the answer.
17      THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note that that was the first part
18  of the question.  There was no audible answer in the booth.  So the
19  remainder of the text refers to the other question put by the Defence
20  counsel.
21      JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.  If you need an answer to that,
22  Mr. Domazet, you better ask it again.
23      MR. DOMAZET:  Yes.  [Interpretation] Yes, thank you, Your Honour.
24     Q.   Yes, my question was whether the checkpoint where they were
25  stopped was at the Vilina Vlas intersection by Sase?

 1     A.   Yes.
 2     Q.   My next question:  Did you -- on your way back from Vilina Vlas,
 3  were you again stopped or not?
 4     A.   No.
 5     Q.   You described the way in which Mitar Vasiljevic was dressed when
 6  you saw him at the Vilina Vlas hotel.  In addition to what you have
 7  described to us, the olive drab uniform, the hat and the insignia, did you
 8  notice anything else that would be peculiar?
 9     A.   No, not at that time.
10     Q.   Did he have a strip around his sleeve, a band?
11     A.   No.
12     Q.   Did you notice, as you left the hotel in Vilina Vlas, any
13  discussion between Mitar Vasiljevic and Meho Dzafic?
14     A.   No.
15     Q.   Let me rephrase the question.  Were there any attempts on the part
16  of Mitar to pass a cigarette to Meho and upon which Milan intervened
17  and prevented it?
18     A.   No, I did not see that.
19     Q.   So you did not see any conversation between the two or any attempt
20  to this effect?
21     A.   I did not hear Mitar Vasiljevic utter a single word.
22     Q.   I suppose that you're talking about this whole period in Vilina
23  Vlas?
24     A.   Yes, in the whole period.
25     Q.   And up until the very end, so just to make sure, you did not hear

1  Mitar Vasiljevic utter a single word, neither in the Vilina Vlas hotel nor
 2  on the road from the intersection to the river bank, to the bank of the
 3  river Drina?
 4     A.   That is correct.
 5     Q.   When you arrived at the Vilina Vlas hotel, you saw a uniformed
 6  person at the entrance.  You mentioned him again today but you did not
 7  mention him by name.  In your previous statements, you said that you knew
 8  this person very well and that it was Momir Savic.  Is that correct or
 9  not?
10     A.   I said today that I had just glanced at the person standing in the
11  lobby and that it had seemed to me that I had known that person.  I said
12  that it had seemed to me that this was Momir Savic, Momir Savic, but
13  since I am not absolutely sure about that, and I want to talk only about
14  the persons that I'm absolutely sure, I said today that I wasn't 100 per
15  cent sure that this was indeed that person.  That's why I said that it
16  seemed to me that I knew him.
17     Q.   This is what you said in your last interview sometime earlier this
18  year with an investigator of the Tribunal?
19     A.   Yes.
20     Q.   Do you remember that in your previous statements to the Ministry
21  of the Interior and in your first interview with the investigators in
22  1998, that you said, among other things, that this was Momir Savic and
23  that you knew him very well?
24     A.   Yes.
25     Q.   Today, you told us about the things that happened on the banks of

 1  the Drina River and that despite the very difficult psychological
 2  situation you were in, that you were able to discern very clearly the
 3  three clicks of the automatic rifle?
 4     A.   Yes.
 5     Q.   However, the statement you gave to the investigator in 1998 and in
 6  your previous statements, you did not mention this.  Is it possible that
 7  you did not remember that at the time or is it something else?  Can you
 8  give us an explanation, why is it that this is the first time that you
 9  present these facts?
10     A.   In my statement given to an investigator in 1998, when I wanted to
11  describe some things in great detail, the investigator told me that this
12  was not so important.  So if you read my statement, you will see, and if
13  you compare it to what I have been saying today, you will see that that
14  statement is much broader.  The statement that I gave earlier this year to
15  Mr. Ib Yul Hansen was more focused on the event itself, and Mr. Ib Yul
16  Hansen wanted me to pay as much attention as possible to the events on the
17  bank of the river Drina itself, and if you read my statement, you will see
18  that this is in fact what the statement is geared to.
19     Q.   I agree that this is what the statement is geared towards, but it
20  is precisely this detail which is very characteristic and important, yet
21  you present it right now.  This is the first time that you come up with
22  this fact.
23     A.   If I may.
24     Q.   Please, go ahead.
25     A.   When Mr. Ib Yul Hansen asked me a question regarding what I had

  1  heard as I headed towards Drina, the Drina River, I told him that I had
  2  heard, after somebody saying whether we should we fire single shots or
  3  bursts, I told him that I had heard the click of the device, and Mr. Ib
  4  Yul Hansen asked me, "Sir, please think hard, and how -- tell me how many
  5  clicks did you hear?"  So I rewound the tape, and I was sure that I heard
  6  three clicks.  He asked me again, "Did you hear three clicks?"  I said,
  7   "Yes."  And then he entered this for the record.
  8     Q.   Does that mean that all those rifles were cocked one after
  9  another, since it was probably impossible to discern three clicks in any
 10  other way at the same time?
 11     A.   If you hear three clicks from three different sides coming very
 12  closely one after another, then regardless of how fast they were actually
 13  done, you can still hear it, particularly if you're in the situation in
 14  which I found myself, where even the smallest thing that happened is
 15  really etched so deeply in my memory.
 16     Q.   If I understood you correctly, you say that three clicks could be
 17  heard despite the fact that they were executed at the same time, in light
 18  of the fact that they were -- they reached you from different directions?
 19     A.   I said that they were very close, close to each other.
 20     Q.   Even though you were in a very difficult situation at the time and
 21  you say yourself that you concentrated really hard to be able to remember
 22  as much as possible, did you remember the number of shots fired either at
 23  first or later or are you unable to tell us this?
 24     A.   Well, this was the last thing I wanted to do at the time, to count
 25  the shots.  I don't remember.
 1     Q.
 2      MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.  I have no other questions.
 3      JUDGE HUNT:  Re-examination, Mr. Groome?
 4      MR. GROOME:  Just one or two questions, Your Honour.
 5              Re-examined by Mr. Groome:
 6     Q.   You mentioned -- you described this person's accent, this soldier,
 7  as an Ekavian dialect; is that correct?
 8     A.   Yes.
 9     Q.   Where would you expect a person with that dialect to have come
10  from?
11     A.   Usually from Serbia.  Not from the whole of Serbia but from Serbia
12  proper.
13     Q.   Now, Momir Savic, did you see him as frequently as you would have
14  seen Mitar Vasiljevic?
15     A.   No.
16      MR. GROOME:  Nothing further, Your Honour.
17      JUDGE HUNT:  One thing that isn't clear to me:  Is it being
18  suggested that the reference to the three clicks is not or is in the
19  statement taken by the OTP investigator earlier this year?
20      MR. GROOME:  I have elicited no testimony about that statement.
21      JUDGE HUNT:  No.  It's really from you, Mr. Domazet.  You were
22  saying why have you said this for the first time and the witness then said
23  I told the investigator about it earlier this year.  Now, are you
24  suggesting that it's not in the statement that was taken earlier this
25  year?
 1      MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honour, no.  It is found in the
 2  statement given in February this year, the supplementary statement given
 3  to the investigator, but it is not contained in the statement given to
 4  investigators in 1998.
 5      JUDGE HUNT:  I understand that.
 6      MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] And also, in the earlier statements
 7  or earlier police reports.
 8      JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Now, Mr. Groome, did you want to tender
 9  the document which is marked 133?
10      MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour, I'm sorry if I did not do that.  I
11  tender that now into evidence.
12      JUDGE HUNT:  Any objection to that, Mr. Domazet?  That's the map
13  or the diagram that this witness has drafted of what happened at the east
14  side of the Drina.
15      MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] No, I have no objection to it being
16  tendered into evidence.
17      JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  That will be Exhibit P133.
18      Thank you, sir, for coming here to give your evidence -- oh, I'm
19  sorry, Judge Taya wants to ask a question.
20              Questioned by the Court:
21      JUDGE TAYA:  When you left Vilina Vlas hotel in the direction of
22  Sase, getting in the grey Yugo together with Mitar Vasiljevic, he had a
23  Kalashnikov-type automatic rifle; is that correct?
24     A.   I did not say that I entered the car with Mitar Vasiljevic.  I
25  said, as I entered into the Yugo car I saw Mitar Vasiljevic climb down the

 1  stairs from the hotel, and I saw that he had an automatic rifle with him.
 2  I explained how it came about, the car was turned towards Visegrad and in
 3  order to be able to get into the car, I faced for a while, I faced the
 4  Vilina Vlas hotel.
 5      JUDGE TAYA:  What was the posture of Mitar Vasiljevic at that
 6  time?  He took the position to point that automatic rifle at someone?
 7     A.   As he went down the stairs in front of the hotel, he held the
 8  rifle by the handle.
 9      JUDGE TAYA:  Can you remember the exact words which Meho Dzafic and
10  Ekrem Dzafic pronounced when they begged to spare them?
11     A.   As far as I can remember -- let me repeat what I have already
12  said.  When I was ordered to head towards the river, I said that I had
13  walked very slowly and as I started, I heard Meho say to my right, "Come
14  on, Mitar ..." and then from my left, I heard [redacted]-- I'm sorry, I
15  apologise, I -- I heard my friend beg, "Don't kill us, guys.  What did we
16  do to you?"  This voice, this voice was etched in my memory much better so
17  it kind much erased what Meho said, because I concentrated on what this
18  voice that was so much closer to me, and that I was so much more familiar
19  with, so this is why this voice was etched much more into my memory so I
20  heard just a few words that I was able to hear.
21      JUDGE TAYA:  What was the exact words of the accused in responding
22  to them?
23     A.   I did not hear it.  I said that I did not hear him utter a single
24  word.
25      JUDGE TAYA:  Thank you.

 1      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour?
 2      JUDGE HUNT:  Does either counsel want to ask any questions about
 3  that?  Mr. Domazet, you should do so first if you want to.
 4      MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] No, thank you.
 5      JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Mr. Groome?
 6      MR. GROOME:  No, Your Honour but I would just ask for a redaction
 7  on page 96.
 8      JUDGE HUNT:  Don't worry, it's coming.
 9      MR. GROOME:  Thank you.
10      JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much, sir, for coming to give
11  your evidence.  We are very grateful to you for your evidence and you are
12  now free to leave.
13      THE WITNESS:  [Interpretation] Thank you very much for making it
14  possible for me to testify.
15              [The witness withdrew]
16      JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, Mr. Groome, your next witness?
17      MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, Ms. Bauer will take the next witness,
18  just a second to switch seats.

 4  doubt.
 5      MS. BAUER:  VG79.
 6      JUDGE HUNT:  79?  Thank you.
 7      There is a small delay, Ms. Bauer.  You may as well sit down while
 8  we wait.
 9      MS. BAUER:  Thank you.
10      JUDGE HUNT:  The pseudonym document in relation to the next
11  witness will be Exhibit 72 -- P72, and is under seal.
12              [The witness entered court]
13      JUDGE HUNT:  Would you please make the solemn declaration in the
14  document which the usher is showing you?
15      THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly declare that I will speak
16  the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
17              WITNESS:  WITNESS VG79
18              [Witness answered through interpreter]
19      JUDGE HUNT:   You may sit down, sir.
20      JUDGE HUNT:  Ms. Bauer?
21              Examined by Ms. Bauer:
22     Q.   Witness, can you hear me?
23     A.   Yes, I can.
24     Q.   You have been assigned a pseudonym VG79 throughout these
25  proceedings.  Do you had understand that?

 1     A.   Yes, I do.
 2     Q.   Can you take a look at the sheet of paper the usher is going to
 3  hand you and say, just yes or no, whether it contains your name?
 4     A.   Yes.
 5     Q.   Thank you very much.  And I formally tender the document.
 6      JUDGE HUNT:  It's already in evidence.

12     Q.   Did you have children?
13     A.   Yes, four children.
14     Q.   And what's your ethnicity?
15     A.   Bosniak.
16     Q.   I want to talk to you about when in mid-April the Uzice Corps took
17  over the town of Visegrad.  Where were you at that time?
18     A.   I was in Rogatica.  I had fled to Rogatica and then, on the fourth
19  day, I returned to Visegrad.
20     Q.   Why did you return to Visegrad?
21     A.   I went back to my home town, to the place where I was born.
22      THE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness please speak closer to the
23  microphones, please?
24      JUDGE HUNT:  Sir, would you move your chair just a little
25  closer to the table there?  The interpreters are having some difficulty

 1  hearing you speak.  Thank you.
 2      MS. BAUER:
 3     Q.   Do you remember about what time did you return to Visegrad?
 4     A.   I returned on the 17th of April 1992.
 5     Q.   What occurred to you upon your arrival in Visegrad?
 6     A.   When I returned to Visegrad, I was immediately taken to the SUP,
 7  the Secretariat of the Interior, to the Uzice Corps.
 8     Q.   Who took you to the SUP?
 9     A.   The Uzice Corps, the former JNA.
10     Q.   What did you -- what did they do with you in the SUP?
11     A.   They interrogated me.  I wasn't quite clear as to why they had
12  taken me there.
13     Q.   About what kind of issues did they interrogate you upon?
14     A.   They questioned me about what kind of an army there was in
15  Visegrad.  I did not know anything about any army.
16     Q.   Were you a member of any army?
17     A.   No.
18     Q.   Were you a member of any political organisation?
19     A.   No.
20     Q.   Did they ask you anything about weapons?
21     A.   Yes.  They asked me whether I had any weapons.  I did not.
22     Q.   Were you restrained in any way?
23     A.   No.  I sat down as I was questioned.  They maltreated me a bit.
24     Q.   How did they maltreat you?
25     A.   They searched me, and a police officer beat me on the thighs with

 1  a baton.
 2     Q.   Did they take anything away from you during this time?
 3     A.   Yes.  They took away my wallet.  I had some money with me.  And
 4  then, after a while, they gave it back to me, but a man came and said that
 5  this was a commander, and that when he came in, everybody should stand
 6  up, as I was sitting at the time, and this man was Dusko Kornjaca, the
 7  infamous Dusko Kornjaca, who was the President of the SDS from Cajnice.
 8     Q.   Thank you.  When you were released, did you go home?
 9     A.   When I was released, I went home.  A soldier was waiting for me
10  there and he was searching my house, looking for weapons.
11     Q.   Did you continue to work during that time?
12     A.   After two or three days, I went -- I reported in my firm, and
13  thereafter I went to work as usual.
14     Q.   Did all your Muslim colleagues continue to work?
15     A.   We all reported, and they immediately said that the 38 persons of
16  Muslim ethnic background should not go back to work but that they should
17  report to the SUP where the police station was.
18     Q.   Did they come back to work at one point in time?
19     A.   No.  They did not go back to work.  They -- some people never
20  returned from that place and some did not survive.
21     Q.   When approximately did the Uzice Corps withdraw from town?
22     A.   On the 18th and 19th of May 1992.
23     Q.   Who took over the town?
24     A.   I continued working until the 27th of May, and my boss in the
25  company told me that he was going away for two or three days, and told us

 1  not to go to work during that period because there were some other unknown
 2  army present in the town.
 3     Q.   Did you hear anything, what unknown army was present at that
 4  time?  Have you heard any references to this unknown army?
 5     A.   Arkan's men, Seselj's men.  I don't really know about that.
 6     Q.   You said your supervisor said you ought not come to work.  What
 7  nationality was your supervisor?
 8     A.   Serb.
 9     Q.   Was there a time when you did not go to work at all any more?
10     A.   Yes.  I did not go there because they came looking for me in the
11  house, and I went with some of my colleagues.  I took shelter in a
12  basement.
13     Q.   So you stopped working because you didn't feel safe?
14     A.   Yes.
15     Q.   You said you were hiding in your house.  Who did come and search
16  for you?
17     A.   Some army, I did not know, some soldiers.
18     Q.   Did somebody from your family see those soldiers?
19     A.   Yes.  My wife.  She told them that I wasn't home, that I was at
20  work, and they asked where, and she told him the company that I worked in,
21  and they went there to check but some of my colleagues told them that I
22  was absent.
