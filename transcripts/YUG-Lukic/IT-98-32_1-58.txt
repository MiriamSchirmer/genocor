 2                          [Prosecution Closing Statement]
 3                          [Open session]
 4                          [The accused entered court]
 5                          --- Upon commencing at 2.41 p.m.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Call the case, please.
 7            THE REGISTRAR:  Case number IT-98-32-T, the Prosecutor versus
 8    Mitar Vasiljevic.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm sorry for the late beginning.  There was a slight
10    misunderstanding about the time.
11            In relation to having lost yesterday, we have been desperately
12    trying to find some other time when there is both a court available and my
13    two colleagues are not sitting in another case.  That hasn't yet been
14    resolved, but it looks like the possibility of the first time being
15    available being Monday afternoon.  So we'll see how we're going later on
16    this afternoon.  If there isn't very much to be done, we might be able to
17    persuade our support staff to sit on for a few moments, but I don't think
18    that we would be fair to ask them to sit on too long.
19            Now, we've received a letter from the CLSS about the
20    translation - I'm sorry - the transcript and the translation of the audio
21    recording.  Mr. Domazet, did you get that letter?  They have accepted your
22    suggestions as to the corrections to be made in the transcript.
23            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes, Your Honour, I received it.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  How about you, Mr. Groome?
25            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour, I've received it as well.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, I think the best thing to do is perhaps attach
 2    that letter to the exhibit.  I've forgotten the exhibit number.
 3            MR. GROOME:  190.1, Your Honour.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  190.1.  It will be 190 and 190.1.
 5                          [Trial Chamber confers with legal officer]
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  119, yes.  I'll get it straight in a moment.  109 and
 7    109.1.  And we'll physically make an alteration to both documents so that
 8    nobody will read the one without the other.  Are you happy with that,
 9    Mr. Groome?
10            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  Are you happy with that, Mr. Domazet?
12            MR. DOMAZET:  Yes, Your Honour.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
14            Mr. Groome, you first.  Thank you.  You may take it we've read
15    your written submissions, so please proceed upon that assumption.
16            MR. GROOME:  Thank you, Your Honour.
17            Today is my second and final opportunity to address you directly
18    regarding the evidence of this case.  Before I begin, I would like to tell
19    you a little bit about the structure of my closing remarks to you.  I will
20    not reiterate all of the points raised in the Prosecution final trial
21    brief.  That was a public document and contains most of the relevant
22    points the Prosecution requests that you consider.  I will touch upon the
23    most important ones and go into greater detail about some points not
24    directly dealt with in that brief.  Before I finish my concluding remarks,
25    I will pause, and if the Court has any questions for the Prosecution, I

 1    would be happy to attempt to answer them at that point in time, and I will
 2    then make some brief closing remarks before finishing.
 3            At the outset, I'd like to thank my colleagues, Frederic Ossogo,
 4    Sabine Bauer, Yves Roy, Ib Jul Hansen, and David Bruff for their hard work
 5    and contribution.
 6            My remarks concern both the killing of the five men by the Drina
 7    on the 7th of June, which I will refer to as "the Drina River killings."
 8    I will also be talking about the over 66 people who died in the Omeragic
 9    house on Pionirska Street on the 14th of June.  I will refer to that case
10    as "the Pionirska Street fire."
11            Now, there has been a great deal of evidence adduced during the
12    course of this trial, both by the Prosecution and the Defence.  I will be
13    offering commentary on some of that evidence and, in some cases,
14    suggesting different ways for the Chamber to evaluate it.  I want to
15    preface my remarks by saying that nothing is meant to cross over into the
16    task that is properly yours.  Your recollection of the evidence prevails,
17    not mine, and your impression of the witnesses controls, not mine.
18            There are a number of facts that are not in issue in this case,
19    and it may be helpful to take stock of them at the beginning.  It is not
20    in issue that the accused was present when five men were murdered in cold
21    blood along the bank of the Drina River.  That is not in issue.  It is not
22    in issue that the accused was present on Pionirska Street hours before a
23    large group of over 70 Muslims were locked into a house and burned alive.
24    That is not in issue.  And it is not in issue that, on at least one other
25    occasion, the accused was present with Milan Lukic and his men when they

 1    committed crimes against some of the Muslims of Visegrad.  That is not in
 2    issue.
 3            What is in issue is whether the accused's presence during each of
 4    these events was innocent and just a matter of him being in the wrong
 5    place at the wrong time, as he has asserted over the course of this trial,
 6    or whether, as the Prosecution contends, he was a member of Milan Lukic's
 7    gang of paramilitaries and present at each of these scenes, wilfully
 8    participating in the crimes that were committed there.
 9            Before discussing his involvement in the crimes for which he is
10    charged, I will begin by reviewing the evidence regarding his relationship
11    with Milan Lukic and Milan Lukic's group.
12            The Prosecution submits that there is now proof beyond a
13    reasonable doubt from credible and reliable evidence that establishes that
14    Mitar Vasiljevic was associated and a member of Milan Lukic's group of
15    paramilitaries.  Was Mitar Vasiljevic a White Eagle?  That is more
16    difficult to say and not determinative of his guilt or innocence in this
17    case.  There was no public registry of the White Eagles that we could
18    bring before you.  There were no identification cards that we could have
19    brought into the Chamber and displayed to you.  The inquiry that we must
20    therefore engage in is one in which we examine the conduct of the accused
21    and how it related to Milan Lukic's activities and how it related to what
22    happened in Visegrad during the spring and summer of 1992.
23            Let us begin this inquiry by examining what Mitar Vasiljevic
24    himself says regarding paramilitaries.  Although he denies being a member
25    of the group, he was able to tell the Chamber in great detail information

 1    about the group, such as the identities of these men, many of which were
 2    from Obrenovac and not from Visegrad.  How was it that he was able to
 3    describe these men who composed Milan Lukic's group, especially when
 4    others were not?  The accused, in his own hand, wrote a list of the names
 5    of the people in Visegrad whom he feared.  On it, he included the names of
 6    several other members of Milan Lukic's group.
 7            Recall the several defence witnesses who I put the question to
 8    regarding whether they recognised names on that list.  Not one recognised
 9    the names of any of the paramilitaries the accused had said were
10    associated with Milan Lukic.  He and he alone was able to identify them to
11    the Court.
12            There was no other way for him to gain this knowledge unless he
13    had been closely associated with them.  Not only did he know their names,
14    but he was able to tell the Chamber that they worked with the Visegrad
15    police.  He was able to tell us in detail the clothes that they wore, the
16    insignias that they had on their uniforms.  His intimate knowledge of them
17    leads to the inescapable inference that if he wasn't a full-fledged
18    member, he was so closely associated with them to know details few others
19    could have known.
20            But why?  Why would this band of paramilitaries from Serbia, led
21    by Milan Lukic, have the likes of Mitar Vasiljevic as a member of their
22    group?  Well, undoubtedly his close relationship with Milan Lukic was a
23    factor, but equally important was what he could contribute to the group's
24    work of persecuting and killing the Muslim population of Visegrad.  Mitar
25    Vasiljevic could help them identify the Muslims, the houses that belonged

 1    to Muslims.  It was his function in the group to help them select their
 2    targets, and he did this on several occasions.
 3            He did it in Musici when he brought Milan Lukic to the house of
 4    VG55 and 59, people he knew to be Muslims, people he knew well.
 5            He did it with VG115, when he, Milan Lukic, and another member of
 6    the group who was not from Visegrad stopped her in the street to inquire
 7    about her Muslim husband.  No one else in the red Passat that they were in
 8    that day knew that she was a Serb or knew that she was married to a
 9    Muslim.
10            He did it after leaving VG115, when Milan Lukic, Mitar Vasiljevic,
11    and this other man went around the street to the house of an elderly
12    Muslim couple by the name of Kurpashic.  She could hear their screams as
13    they fled for their lives before being executed by the three and left in
14    the doorway of their home.
15            He did it on the 7th of June when he told Milan Lukic where a
16    Muslim family lived as they pulled over the car in Sase, on the way to
17    execute their captives by the Drina River.  He did it again on the 9th of
18    June when, again in the company of Milan Lukic and a man from outside
19    Visegrad, riding in the red Passat, they stopped along the road and
20    accosted Rasim Torohan, a Muslim teacher, and forced him into the red
21    Passat, and he has never been seen again.
22            It is also important to consider his disposition toward what was
23    happening to the Muslim population of Visegrad during this period.  There
24    is additional evidence that the accused was not indifferent to what was
25    occurring in Visegrad.  He, with or without Milan Lukic, was an active

 1    participant in the campaign of persecution that was being waged against
 2    the Muslim population.
 3            The Chamber heard evidence of the accused taking the
 4    identification card from a Muslim woman who was simply walking past his
 5    house.  As she left him in the company of three armed men, he called out
 6    to her, "Don't let me look for you."
 7            There were other occasions in which Mitar Vasiljevic was seen
 8    acting suspiciously, even when Milan Lukic was not present.  VG80 told the
 9    Chamber how, during the month of June, she saw Mitar Vasiljevic on two
10    occasions from her apartment window in Visegrad.  He was armed and in the
11    company of several other armed men, in the vicinity of a garage outside
12    her window.  It appeared to her that they were looking either for people
13    or property in the garage.
14            Another witness described seeing him in a car on the road to his
15    house, holding a black flag with a skull and crossbones on it, taunting
16    Muslims in the area with insults, the same black flag, the Prosecution
17    submits, that was seen by VG59 in the Vilina Vlas Hotel, the headquarters
18    of Milan Lukic's group.
19            What has emerged from the evidence of this trial is a clear
20    picture of the accused and his involvement with perhaps the most notorious
21    and brutal paramilitary gang that perpetrated crimes against the Muslim
22    population of Visegrad.
23            In many criminal cases, it often comes to pass that evidence of
24    conduct which is not in itself criminal tells us a great deal about the
25    issues in the trial, and so the same has happened in this case.

 1            The accused was standing in the lobby of the Vilina Vlas Hotel on
 2    the 7th of June.  Under most circumstances, there is nothing inculpatory
 3    or even unusual about somebody standing in a hotel lobby, and under
 4    different circumstances, there would be nothing about Mitar Vasiljevic
 5    standing in the lobby of the Vilina Vlas Hotel, but it is tremendously
 6    important in this case.  Why?  Well, what do we know about the Vilina Vlas
 7    Hotel at this point in time?  The hotel is closed.  It no longer functions
 8    as a hotel or a restaurant.  It now functions as the headquarters or home
 9    base of Milan Lukic and his group.
10            We know that Muslims are being held there.  The accused gives us
11    that, but we also have VG59, who was taken there and held.  The bodies of
12    young women wrapped in hotel blankets are floating down the Drina River to
13    be pulled out of the river at Slap.  It is unquestionably the headquarters
14    of Milan Lukic's group.  The only people there in the hotel at that time
15    are either members of his group or their victims, no one else.
16            Now, Mr. Vasiljevic had no obligation to explain his presence to
17    us, to the investigators of the OTP or to the Court.  He had no such
18    obligation.  But fully aware of his rights, he did explain his presence in
19    the hotel, and now what he has said must be evaluated.
20            One of the reasons he has given is that he was there to pick up
21    his waiter's uniform.  I submit that that is clearly just not true.  It is
22    not true because his explanation of this so clearly contradicts common
23    sense.  He testified that after going to the Vilina Vlas Hotel, he decided
24    not to try and recover the uniform because he considered it improper for a
25    waiter to go into that area of the kitchen where it was without one of the

 1    cooks or the kitchen staff.  That makes no sense.  According to him, the
 2    janitor of the hotel is there with keys and access to every area of the
 3    hotel.  The fact that he decided it would have been improper to get his
 4    waiter's uniform out of the kitchen is simply not credible.
 5            Now, the Chamber is at liberty to find his explanation regarding
 6    the uniform either credible or not.  I submit that if you find that it is
 7    not credible, you must ask yourselves why he has attempted to mislead
 8    you.  What is the true reason for his presence there that he is attempting
 9    to hide?
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, I'm sorry to interrupt, but sometimes I
11    think it's best to ask you the questions when they are relevant to what
12    you're saying.  Did you ever ask the accused what his uniform was doing
13    there if he says, as I think he said at that stage, he didn't work there?
14            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour, I did.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  You did, did you?
16            MR. GROOME:  I did.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Okay.
18            MR. GROOME:  And his answer was that his work obligation for when
19    the JNA came to Visegrad was to go up there and serve them their food, and
20    that is why his waiter uniform was there.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
22            MR. GROOME:  His second reason for recovering the uniform is
23    equally implausible.  I'm sorry.  His second reason for being in the hotel
24    at that time is equally implausible.  He testified that Stanko
25    Pecikoza - who incidentally is now dead and cannot deny what the accused

 1    has told us - he testified that Stanko Pecikoza stopped him on the side of
 2    the road and asked him to accompany him up to the Vilina Vlas Hotel to
 3    help him find Milan Lukic.  The accused testified that Mr. Pecikoza asked
 4    him where he thought he could find Milan Lukic, and he responded that he
 5    was staying up in the Vilina Vlas Hotel.
 6            It is not a matter of the accused saying, "He might be at the
 7    Vilina Vlas Hotel, and if he isn't, I have some other ideas where he might
 8    be."  The accused essentially says:  The only possibility I can think of
 9    is the Vilina Vlas Hotel.
10            Well, in that case, why does Stanko Pecikoza need Mitar Vasiljevic
11    to take him to one of the more prominent hotels in Visegrad?  He can drive
12    there himself, and if Milan Lukic is there, he is there.  If he is not
13    there, Mr. Vasiljevic, there is nothing more that he can do to help him.
14            It is important to recognise who Stanko Pecikoza was.  He was a
15    high-ranking member of the SDS party, and as such, must have had close
16    contact with Dragan Tomic, the police commander.  Certainly if Stanko
17    Pecikoza wanted to contact Milan Lukic, common sense would dictate that he
18    would contact him through the police, and after all, the accused says that
19    Milan Lukic were wearing police insignias on their uniforms [sic] and
20    working with the police of Visegrad.
21            The accused goes on to say that it was his understanding that he
22    was to wait for a while at the Vilina Vlas Hotel and to contact Stanko
23    Pecikoza when Milan Lukic arrived.  But certainly the janitor could have
24    done this without Mitar Vasiljevic, and it is certainly clear that no
25    reasonable provision was made for how Mitar Vasiljevic was to recontact

 1    Stanko Pecikoza and let him know that Milan Lukic had now arrived at the
 2    hotel.
 3            We must also remember that, according to the accused, this
 4    interaction with Stanko Pecikoza occurs the day before he is to begin
 5    cleaning the town.  So according to him, he is just released from gaol, is
 6    desperately afraid of going back to gaol, he begs and pleads for an
 7    alternative punishment.  He tells us that the commander of the Territorial
 8    Defence agrees and assigns him to clean the streets as an alternative to
 9    being incarcerated.  And then he would have us believe that he agreed, on
10    the day before this most important assignment, he agreed to wait around
11    the Vilina Vlas Hotel for Milan Lukic with no reasonable prospect of
12    getting a ride home that evening.
13            I also submit that it is unreasonable that the first thing he does
14    when he is released from gaol is not to return home to change his clothes,
15    to see his family, but is to take the ride up to the Vilina Vlas Hotel to
16    recover his uniform and assist Milan Lukic -- or assist Mr. Pecikoza in
17    locating Milan Lukic.
18            I submit that his entire story in this regard is completely
19    implausible and it is the Prosecution's case that what the accused has
20    said about Stanko Pecikoza never happened.  It just didn't happen.  It is
21    a fabrication calculated to mislead the Chamber from the truth.  The truth
22    being the only plausible explanation for his presence in the Vilina Vlas
23    Hotel; that he was a member of Milan Lukic's group and spent his time at
24    the hotel when he was not actively engaged in committing crimes with
25    them.

 1            If you are inclined to accept the medical case history in this
 2    case, and I'm not saying that you should find the document reliable, but
 3    if it is your determination that it is a reliable document, then I submit
 4    that you must consider the note made by the doctor of the interview of the
 5    patient's wife.  If you recall, it says that the wife was concerned that
 6    during this very period, she was concerned that her husband was staying on
 7    with his unit after his shift was over.  Now, when the accused's wife
 8    testified she denies having said such a thing, but if you accept that
 9    document, then I submit that the unit the patient's wife was referring to
10    was not the cleaning unit that worked for one hour every morning, it was
11    Milan Lukic's paramilitary unit, the unit stationed at the Vilina Vlas
12    Hotel.
13            There is no other reasonable inference to draw from his presence
14    there than he was a member of the group, a vital, essential, and active
15    member of that group.  His relationship with Milan Lukic was so close that
16    he was Milan Lukic's essential contact in Visegrad, helping him to select
17    targets and helping him to commit crimes.  So essential that he attempted
18    to mislead the Chamber and have you believe that he avoided contact with
19    Milan Lukic after the Drina River killings when evidence has now proven
20    that quite the opposite is true.
21            We have all heard in great detail how his cleaning duties were
22    limited to approximately one hour a day.  It hardly seems logical that the
23    commander of the Territorial Defence thought that one hour was -- of
24    cleaning was the equivalent of 24 hours in gaol.  It is also improbable
25    that much cleaning could have been accomplished in only an hour.  What is

 1    plausible is VG89's conclusion regarding his observations of the accused
 2    in his cleaning efforts earlier in the day of the 14th as he saw him walk
 3    up and down the street with the megaphone without any cleaning implements
 4    in a Muslim neighbourhood.  There Mitar Vasiljevic called out for
 5    volunteers to come down to the street and to clean their gardens.  Isn't
 6    the truth that one of his functions in Milan Lukic's group was the
 7    location of victims through this ruse, through this ploy to trick Muslims
 8    who were hiding to come out from hiding and make themselves known to him?
 9            I want to return for a few minutes to the incident in the village
10    of Musici because it occurs before any of the crimes charged in the
11    indictment and gives a clear picture of how Mitar Vasiljevic was a member
12    of the group participating in and assisting them in their crimes.
13            Mitar Vasiljevic went along and fully participated in the first
14    night of crimes committed against the people of Musici, and on that night
15    it consisted of home invasions.  The home that he went to was that of VG55
16    and 59.  He stood by the door of the house fully armed, guarding it and
17    preventing its occupants from leaving while Milan Lukic searched through
18    it.  He even asked somebody if there was somebody hiding in the attic.
19            The Prosecution submits that what the accused claims happened
20    there that night and his view that his presence there was purely
21    coincidental and his conduct purely innocent is simply not believable.  It
22    is incredible but for one small detail.  He told you that a blonde Serbian
23    woman was in the car him and Milan Lukic that night.  The Prosecution
24    submits that this is the same blonde woman whom witnesses saw the
25    following night in Musici when Milan Lukic and his men returned and took

 1    nine of the men from the village away, that this blonde woman is the same
 2    woman who VG79 saw the accused with as he took a neighbour of VG79's away
 3    in the direction of Visegradska Banja, the area in which the Vilina Vlas
 4    Hotel is located, Milan Lukic's headquarters.
 5            I want to now turn to the evidence of the Drina River killings.
 6    Credible and reliable evidence has shown that the accused participated in
 7    the summary execution of five men along the Drina River on the 7th of
 8    June, 1992.  His participation involved assisting Milan Lukic and his
 9    other accomplices in guarding the men as well as actually firing into the
10    men's backs and heads until he, like his accomplices, believed that they
11    had killed them all.
12            As the persecution of Muslims grew more and more severe, it caused
13    VG32, as well as other Muslim men, to go into hiding, many in the woods
14    and some in abandoned houses in Muslim areas of the town itself.  VG32
15    took to hiding in his father-in-law's house in the Bikavac area of town.
16    Drawn from his hiding place by the sight of his own car rolling down the
17    street in front of him with its engine turned off, he went outside to
18    watch it as it moved silently down the hill.  While outside, he decided to
19    smoke a cigarette.  His father-in-law caught his eye with a prearranged
20    signal to hide, but it was too late.  He and another family member were
21    caught by Milan Lukic and his men as they came up from behind the house.
22            Milan Lukic, like Mitar Vasiljevic had done several days before to
23    VG81, took the identification cards from the men.  He also knew that
24    without these vital documents, these men would be unable to escape the
25    town through its several checkpoints.  He was making them prisoners in the

 1    town.
 2            The men were brought to a house across from the Territorial
 3    Defence headquarters, at that time located in the Bikavac Hotel.  When
 4    Milan Lukic went to find additional Muslims, one of the captors remarked,
 5    "Tsk, tsk.  What have you been waiting for until now?  Why didn't you
 6    escape?"
 7            Milan Lukic did not have far to go to find additional Muslims.  He
 8    found VG14 and Amir Kurtalic a few streets away.  He brought them back to
 9    the house near the Bikavac Hotel.
10            In all, Milan Lukic and his men had gathered nine to 12 Muslim
11    men.  Milan Lukic gathered the men around him and made those who still had
12    personal documents on them throw them to the floor as well as their
13    valuables and their money.  Milan Lukic made Meho Dzafic go and get his
14    son's car and bring it near the red Passat and forced the men into the two
15    cars.  Milan Lukic told Meho's son Ekrem to follow him to Banja, the place
16    where the Vilina Vlas is located.  As they drove through the town, the two
17    mosques could be seen destroyed.  Milan Lukic told the police or soldiers
18    manning the checkpoint that he had captured some Muslims and travelled
19    through the checkpoint unaccosted.
20            As the captives entered the hotel, they could see Mitar Vasiljevic
21    dressed in a military uniform with a black cowboy hat on.  He had a red
22    armband on, and according to one of the captives, had an automatic rifle
23    in his possession from the very first moment that he saw him.  He was not
24    the only paramilitary in the lobby at the time, as there were at least two
25    other armed paramilitaries there with them.

 1            After a futile attempt to find some keys behind the reception
 2    desk, Milan Lukic ordered the captives back out into the cars.  Mitar
 3    Vasiljevic, armed with his automatic rifle, accompanied them outside,
 4    guarding these men who were not bound or tied in any way to prevent them
 5    from fleeing.
 6            Mitar Vasiljevic got into the red Passat with Milan Lukic.  Hasan
 7    Mutapcic, and Amir Kurtalic and VG14 were in that car.  The remaining
 8    captives were in Dzafic's Yugo.  In order to overcome their resistance and
 9    reduce the chance that they would attempt to flee, the captives were
10    repeatedly told that they were being taken to be exchanged.
11            The cars pulled over on the main road in the area of Sase, and as
12    they stopped, Mitar Vasiljevic pointed out to a house across the road and
13    told Milan Lukic that it belonged to a Muslim family.
14            As they got out of the cars, the calming reassurances that they
15    were being taken for an exchange ceased, and captors, including Mitar
16    Vasiljevic, became abusive and aggressive.  The Muslim men were ordered at
17    gunpoint to move in the direction of the Drina River.  Milan Lukic and
18    Mitar Vasiljevic and the other men guarded them from the sides as they
19    made them walk through the fields towards the river.  Mitar Vasiljevic
20    guarded the men by pointing his readied automatic rifle at the men as they
21    walked to the Drina.
22            As the men made their way to the river, some, if not all, realised
23    that they were going to be killed.  As they walked the final ten metres to
24    the river's edge, they collected the final thoughts of their lives.
25            On the way down to the river, Meho Dzafic pleaded with his

 1    long-time friend and colleague Mitar Vasiljevic to spare his life.  Mitar
 2    was deaf to his pleas.
 3            The men were lined up along the edge of the river.  Milan Lukic,
 4    Mitar Vasiljevic, and the others lined up a few metres behind the men.
 5    Milan Lukic mockingly asked them if they could swim, and one of them
 6    asked -- one of the other co-perpetrators asked whether they should shoot
 7    the men with automatic fire or with single shot, to which Milan Lukic told
 8    them to use single shot.
 9            They stood along the bank, Hasan Mutapcic, Meho Dzafic, his son
10    Ekrem Dzafic, Hasan Kustura, Amir Kurtalic, VG14, and VG32.  As they stood
11    along the river's edge, and in response to Milan's direction, VG32 could
12    hear the sound of the three automatic rifles being switched from automatic
13    to single mode.  One of the rifles being switched was in the hands of the
14    accused as he readied himself to commit the murder of the seven Muslim
15    men.
16            VG32 told the Court, "I heard the automatic weapons being adjusted
17    for bursts of gunfire.  That is a sound that can be heard quite clearly on
18    an automatic rifle.  I heard very well these three clicks coming from
19    three different sides behind me.  Believe me, until this present day, I am
20    often awakened from my sleep by these three clicks."
21            Milan Lukic's gun, a different one, a sniper's rifle, was a
22    semi-automatic weapon and had no such adjustment.  As the three clicks
23    finished, Meho Dzafic, Mitar's close friend, was shot in the back of the
24    head.
25            VG14 and VG32 threw themselves into the water and pretended as if

 1    they were dead.
 2            Unsure whether to try to swim away, VG32 pretended to be dead and
 3    turned around to place his head above the water on a small shelf of sand
 4    at the river's edge.  He lay there wondering whether he could more
 5    convincingly resemble a dead man with his eyes open or his eyes closed.
 6    As he lay there, he saw Hasan Mutapcic, a member of his family, fatally
 7    wounded, struggling to stay alive.  Mutapcic tried to climb up on the
 8    river bank.  After closing his eyes, VG32 could feel the wealth of one of
 9    the victims as that victim fell on his back.
10            The perpetrators walked closer to the river's edge to inspect
11    their victims.  VG32 heard one of them say, "Here's one who is alive."
12    VG32 feared that he had been discovered and braced for being shot.  But
13    after hearing two additional shots and a blunt thud as they struck their
14    victims, there was silence but for the footsteps of the men as they walked
15    back to their cars.
16            The two men edged their way down the river to the safety of the
17    western bank and returned to look across the river at the bodies of their
18    friends, lying across on the opposite bank for the next five days.
19            As I said in my opening remarks, it is not in issue whether the
20    accused was present.  He has readily admitted that he was.  What is in
21    issue are those facts which he denies.  He denies that he ever had a gun
22    that day.  He denies that he ever shot the men.  In fact, he claims that
23    his entire participation in the event was to plead repeatedly with Milan
24    Lukic for the lives of Meho Dzafic, his friend, as well as the lives of
25    the other men as they made their final walk to the river's edge.

 1            Just before the men were shot, they were made to turn their backs
 2    on their assassins and face the river.  There is no witness who says that
 3    he or she saw Mitar Vasiljevic shoot these men in the back.  The
 4    Prosecution must necessarily rely on the common sense of the Chamber to
 5    draw reasonable inferences from the evidence that was presented during the
 6    course of this trial.
 7            The Prosecution submits that the inability to produce an
 8    eyewitness who actually saw the accused pull the trigger of the gun is not
 9    of significance, for if the Chamber credits the testimony of the two
10    survivors - the Prosecution submits that every indication is they were
11    both credible and reliable - if the Chamber credits their testimony that
12    the accused guarded the seven men and prevented them from fleeing by
13    pointing his automatic weapon at them, then that alone would be sufficient
14    for a finding of guilt.
15            The accused, in his own self-interested testimony, told you that
16    when the cars pulled over in Sase, that he was sure at that point that
17    Milan Lukic intended to kill the men.  If you find that, through the walk
18    through those fields, that he guarded the men and prevented them from
19    fleeing as they were forced down to the execution site, then there is a
20    sufficient basis for a finding of guilt.
21            But in fact there is more than that.  One of the survivors, VG32,
22    described in detail the types of guns the men had, he being familiar with
23    them from his service in the Yugoslav People's Army.  He described Milan
24    Lukic as having the semiautomatic sniper's rifle and the others as having
25    the three automatic rifles that would have been the standard issue for the

 1    Yugoslav People's Army.  He went on to describe in vivid detail how he
 2    heard three distinct clicks of the automatic weapons as they were adjusted
 3    just before the shots were fired.
 4            The Defence will no doubt rely in part on the observations of
 5    VG79, who, from a half kilometre away, had a partially obstructed view of
 6    the killing.  When evaluating the testimony of VG79, it is important to
 7    keep in mind several factors that affect his ability to see what happened
 8    when he described seeing three guns fired.
 9            He was a half kilometre away, downstream, on the opposite bank of
10    the river.
11            He was observing the scene at an angle.  The river bank was not a
12    straight bank, but a meandering one, with bushes and trees growing along
13    its bank.  VG79's view of the scene was partially obstructed by some of
14    the growth along the river's edge.
15            It is also important to recall that VG79 was looking at this scene
16    through binoculars, binoculars that he was sharing at the time with
17    another man who was there, and according to him, the other man was the
18    person who had the greater use of these binoculars.
19            It is also important to consider that, when asked how many shots
20    he heard, he said he heard two or three shots.  We know from the number of
21    men that died that day and the testimony of the two survivors that indeed
22    more than two or three shots were fired.
23            It is also important to consider that Milan Lukic had a very
24    different weapon than the other three men.  His weapon was a sniper's
25    rifle with a silencer or suppressor attached to the end.  The suppressor,

 1    whose function it was to contain the sound, did this by suppressing the
 2    expanding gases leaving the gun.  The Prosecution submits that the
 3    accused's gun was one of the three guns that VG79 saw discharged from
 4    across the river.
 5            I'd ask at this time, or draw the Chamber's attention to the
 6    diagram that VG32 drew of the placement of the different perpetrators, and
 7    that is on the ELMO now, and I'd ask the video booth to please put that on
 8    the video feed so that the Chamber can see it.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Is this the one?
10            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  Yes, Your Honour.  I see it on one
11    of our monitors here, but not the one in front of me, so I trust that you
12    have it before you.
13            If you recollect the testimony of VG32, this is the position of
14    the men that he was able to identify seconds before the shooting started.
15    This is what he saw just as he was forced to turn around and then the
16    shooting began.  So I submit to the Chamber that this is the proper
17    positions -- or the proper position of Mitar Vasiljevic at the time those
18    men were executed.  He was to Milan Lukic's right hand, he was on the bank
19    of the river itself, and it was one of his shots -- or it was the gun that
20    he was using to try to kill all these men that VG79 saw from across the
21    river.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, remembering that the fellow across the
23    river saw only three people, have we got anything in the transcript to
24    show just precisely where those trees were, that he said that there might
25    have been somebody behind a tree?

 1            MR. GROOME:  If I can draw your attention, Your Honour, once again
 2    to this exhibit.  I'm sorry, I do not have it, but if you see, the witness
 3    drew very carefully the outline of the trees and the bank, and they were
 4    labelled in both B/C/S and in English.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  It may not be the same document I've got, but it
 6    isn't very clear.  That's why -- if you see it's up on the screen at the
 7    moment, that's the one that I've got.
 8            MR. GROOME:  I see some additional marks on this one, Your Honour,
 9    that I do not see on yours, so I wonder if that is --
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Mine is an exact copy except that it hasn't got the
11    name scratched out from one of the protected witnesses.
12            MR. GROOME:  In your copy, Your Honour, the four circles --
13            JUDGE HUNT:  The word "willows," you see, and then there are lines
14    there.
15            MR. GROOME:  Now, by the willows, Your Honour, there are four
16    circles, and the witness had drawn "ML" and "MV" in there to indicate the
17    position of Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  And the other two are the other two people he said
19    were standing behind him.  Now, the person who was across the river was at
20    an angle.  That's fairly clear.  But I'm not sure what angle it was to
21    this document.  They said they were facing the river.  If it was straight
22    on, then there's still quite an angle, that the fellow was slightly behind
23    them, who was watching - I think, on the map - who was watching from the
24    binoculars.
25            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  The Prosecution would submit if

 1    there was a person that he was unable to see, it was this circle that is
 2    right at the edge of the willows, that that is the person that he was not
 3    able to see.
 4            May I suggest to the Chamber there is video of the width of the
 5    river.  The witness estimated he was a half kilometre away.  So perhaps by
 6    judging the width of the river, the Court would get some idea of his
 7    position and the angle from which he viewed the killing.
 8            It's also important to consider that the accused gave his account
 9    of what happened only after having a copy of VG79's statement in his
10    possession.  Is his account corroborated by VG79 or did he, as the
11    Prosecution submits, adopt his testimony to avail himself of the
12    inconsistency between VG79 and the two survivors of the execution?
13            There are other important issues regarding what happened the 7th
14    of June, regarding what the accused says happened.  I will be dealing with
15    those later in my closing remarks in an area of -- when I discuss the
16    credibility of the different witnesses.
17            I want to leave now the Drina River killings and draw your
18    attention to the 9th of June.
19            Now, according to the accused, he was so upset by what he saw at
20    the Drina River that the very next day he went to Dragan Tomic, the police
21    commander and, according to the accused, Milan Lukic's boss, and told him
22    about what he did.  He further told the Chamber that after that day, he
23    decided not to associate with Milan Lukic any more.  I believe he said it
24    was embarrassing to be with him after what he had done.  Incidentally, a
25    claim which is now clearly false in light of what we have learned about

 1    Milan Lukic's and Mitar Vasiljevic's relationship in the years since the
 2    Drina River killings.  Yet two days after the Drina River killings, on the
 3    9th of June, a witness describes seeing Milan Lukic, Mitar Vasiljevic, and
 4    another man she did not recognise stop in the red Passat on the road in
 5    front of Kosovo Polje.
 6            And if you recall, the Serb witness who testified before you also
 7    mentioned the red Passat with Milan Lukic, Mitar Vasiljevic, and a person
 8    that was unknown to her.  The Prosecution would submit that it was the
 9    same three on both these occasions which are separated by days.
10            On this particular occasion, they began arguing with a Muslim
11    professor by the name of Rasim Torohan.  VG81 saw them push him into the
12    red Passat and told the Court that he had not been seen after this.
13            The very next day, the 10th of June, one day before the Muslim
14    holiday of Kurban Bajram, VG81 saw Mitar Vasiljevic again as the passenger
15    in a green Zastava car on the road in the area of Gajic.  He was holding a
16    black flag out of the window that bore the insignia of a skull and bones
17    on it.  He called out to a number of Muslims working in the fields,
18    "Muslims, we are distributing Kurban meat tomorrow."  The flag was
19    similar to one described by VG59 as hanging in the lobby of the Vilina
20    Vlas Hotel in early June, the hotel where Milan Lukic and his men brought
21    captives and stayed the night.
22            And the 13th of June, the third day of Bajram, VG105 testified how
23    the White Eagles came to her village and gathered all the remaining
24    Muslims together on a truck and took them into town.  The people were
25    brought to the fire brigade building.  A few days after that, she

 1    testified that she saw Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic take some of the
 2    men away.  Some of those men's bodies would be recovered from the Drina
 3    River near the village of Slap later that month.
 4            That brings me to the 14th of June and the most serious incident
 5    of the two charged on this indictment.  The accused is charged for his
 6    participation in the burning alive of 70 people, over 66 of which died,
 7    mostly women and children, in the Omeragic house on Pionirska Street.
 8            For the people of Koritnik, the problems began in early April like
 9    they began for many Muslims of Visegrad.  After an attack by the Serbs
10    from a neighbouring village, many of the Muslims fled into the woods or
11    across the river to the village of Brstanica.  Those who escaped to
12    Brstanica were among those that were gathered in the football stadium,
13    searched, and told where they could and could not go in the municipality.
14            When they returned to Koritnik, the attacks from their Serb
15    neighbours continued, increasing after the Uzice Corps left the area.  The
16    last attack occurred on the 10th of June, 1992.  At this stage, many of
17    the men had fled into the woods towards Muslim-held territory.
18            Shortly after this final attack, some local Serbs came to the
19    village and told those remaining Muslims that on the 14th of June, they
20    would be taken by convoy to Muslim-held territory.  One of them told the
21    Muslims, with alarming frankness, that they were being ethnically
22    cleansed.
23            The Muslims from Koritnik, with no other alternatives, packed
24    their meagre belongings on the 13th of June, prepared food for the
25    journey, and resigned themselves to leaving their homes.

 1            The 14th was overcast and there were periods of rain in the
 2    morning.  The group assembled in the village and left for the bus-stop in
 3    the company of some Muslims there.  Among the group was Jasmina Vila from
 4    Musici, who had been raped and abused by Milan Lukic.  Also in the group
 5    was a small two-day-old baby that had been born in the woods.
 6            The group travelled down to Visegrad when the bus they were
 7    promised never arrived.  On the way down, they were verbally abused by
 8    Serbs both in cars and in the houses that they passed on the way down.
 9            When they arrived near Sase, some more Muslims from there joined
10    the group.  They, too, had resigned themselves to fleeing the area and
11    were simply looking for the quickest way out of town.
12            The villagers from Koritnik were not the only Muslims who were
13    told they were being ethnically cleansed from Visegrad.  Muslims from the
14    village of Smrijece and its surrounding hamlets had been told that they
15    too would be leaving on buses from Visegrad on the 14th.  These Muslims
16    gathered in front of the Hotel Visegrad by the old bridge before boarding
17    buses they were told would take them to safety.
18            Milan Lukic boarded one of those buses.  All of the men on that
19    bus except one, Ferid Spahic, would be summarily executed at a ravine near
20    Rogatica.  What emerges from the evidence is the stark and shocking
21    reality that the activities of Milan Lukic and his men were intertwined
22    with what Muslims believed to be legitimate Red Cross convoys leaving the
23    town.  Milan Lukic and his men found that the convoys provided a ready
24    source of victims to be robbed and at times, when they were so inclined,
25    to be killed.

 1            As the Koritnik group on its way to catch one of these convoys
 2    passing through Sase, another two Muslim families joined the group.  Among
 3    these ten to 13 additional people was a man by the name of (redacted),
 4    a friend of the accused.  They, too, had been warned that it was no longer
 5    safe for Muslims to remain in their homes.  They were also hoping to find
 6    a way to leave Visegrad.
 7            As the group passed through the next settlement along the road, a
 8    small, predominantly Muslim settlement called Kosovo Polje, a group paused
 9    to watch the group as they travelled down the read.  Igbala Kurpashic, who
10    lived in Kosovo Polje, joined the rest of her family from Koritnik on
11    their way to Visegrad.
12            While these people were making their way down to the town of
13    Visegrad, the accused was already up on Pionirska Street.  He was there
14    trying to discover any few remaining Muslims that may have been hiding
15    there.  At the time the witness saw him, he was unarmed, with a megaphone,
16    calling to the people to come out and clean the streets.  This witness,
17    who was hiding in his attic, explained his interpretation of this curious
18    sight.
19            At this point in time in Visegrad, people were regularly being
20    taken away and being killed.  Others were fleeing for their lives, and
21    here is Mitar Vasiljevic, trying to coax people to come out of their
22    houses to clean their gardens and their footpaths.  This witness believed,
23    and the Prosecution submits that his conclusion is the truth of what was
24    happening, that this was a ploy for Mitar Vasiljevic to find others like
25    him, this Muslim hiding in his attic, that it was an attempt by the

 1    accused to draw them out of their homes.
 2            This strange behaviour of the accused corresponds with the
 3    activities of Milan Lukic in Pionirska Street a few days earlier.  A
 4    witness reported that he was up there, telling the people that he would
 5    see that they were safe and that they would be secure and that he would
 6    help them find safe transportation out of the area.  He, like Mitar
 7    Vasiljevic would do later, instructed them to remain there and not to
 8    leave.
 9            What the evidence tells us is that, just as on the 7th of June,
10    Milan Lukic and his men were carefully and methodically searching the
11    Muslim area of Bikavac for remaining Muslims to expel or kill as they had
12    now turned their attentions to Pionirska Street.  They were now doing in
13    Pionirska Street what they had done in Bikavac; methodically making sure
14    that no Muslims remained in that part of town.  Both the activities of
15    Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic, although separated in time by a number
16    of days, were coordinated and calculated to identify potential victims for
17    their intended crimes.
18            Now to return to the group from Koritnik.  The group eventually
19    made their way to the Visegrad Hotel, were assembled and waited for a
20    bus.  No bus came that day, and although there are some discrepancies
21    regarding how it was they came to walk towards Pionirska Street, they
22    walked back through the town and up along Pionirska Street.
23            We do know that at least one witness found it strange that, given
24    the many vacated apartments in town, some belonging to a relative of hers,
25    that she and the others were being asked to walk to the last settlement in

 1    town, the Muslim Mahala settlement on the edge of town.
 2            The group that made its way up to Pionirska Street did so in a
 3    long line stretched out over some distance with the slower and more
 4    heavily laden people falling towards the rear of the line.  Some of the
 5    people in the line saw the accused as they made their way up.  One witness
 6    testified that as she was walking in the opposite direction, Mitar
 7    Vasiljevic, in the company of another armed man, tried to convince her to
 8    join the group with implied threats and warnings.  VG115, a Serb woman who
 9    was walking up behind the group, also saw this interchange between Mitar
10    Vasiljevic and VG77.
11            The witness who was hiding in his attic, peering out through the
12    lifted roof tile, could see the group as they arrived in front of the
13    Memic house and disappeared from view between the two Memic houses.
14            Shortly after the group arrived at Pionirska Street, the accused,
15    Mitar Vasiljevic, approached them and engaged some of their number in
16    conversation.  He immediately recognised a man from the group, (redacted)
17    (redacted), and exchanged greetings with him.  The accused then introduced
18    himself as Mitar Vasiljevic and told the group that he was from the Red
19    Cross and that he was in charge of accommodating refugees.  He also told
20    them that there would be a convoy for them in the morning.
21            Now, Mitar Vasiljevic said a number of things to the people from
22    Koritnik and Sase.  The Prosecution submits that if the Chamber carefully
23    studies what he said, it will become clear and it will become certain
24    beyond a reasonable doubt that this is when the murder of these people was
25    first considered, first conceived.  This was when the crimes against these

 1    people began.
 2            A consistent characteristic is common to everything he told the
 3    people there.  Everything he said was intended to trick the people into
 4    remaining at the Memic house so that he could go and find Milan Lukic and
 5    his other accomplices to commit crimes against the victims he selected.
 6            His statements to them fall into several categories, making clear
 7    the intent behind the statements and how they were designed to prepare and
 8    facilitate the commission of the later crimes.
 9            Mr. Vasiljevic knew that these Muslims, just recently forced from
10    their homes by other Serbs, perhaps some already having some relatives
11    killed, he knew they would not readily trust a Serb.  They were
12    mistrustful of Serbs.  They were attentive to any indication that a Serb
13    might be intending to harm them, and so he began his interaction with them
14    by disarming them of this fear, by making misrepresentations to them
15    calculated to disarm their fear and gain their trust.
16            His first ploy, an extremely effective one, was to impersonate a
17    member of the Red Cross, an organisation that has historically provided
18    safety and security for the most vulnerable of people.
19            VG18 heard him as he said, "My name is Mitar Vasiljevic.  I
20    represent the Red Cross.  I am in charge of your accommodation and
21    security."
22            By misrepresenting himself as a member of the Red Cross, he
23    quickly had their attention and he had their trust.
24            He went on to further gain their trust by providing one woman
25    there with false information regarding her missing brother.  One of the

 1    Red Cross's primary functions in a time of conflict is to help family
 2    members locate their missing relatives.  When this woman expressed her
 3    concern about her brother's whereabouts, Mitar Vasiljevic was quick to
 4    reassure her, and that he knew her brother was now safe in Sarajevo.  He
 5    falsely reassured her that she would eventually be reunited with him.
 6            Now, once he had gained some level of their trust, he tried to
 7    make them feel safe where they were presently.  He did this in order to
 8    facilitate his commission of the crime.  In order to facilitate it, he
 9    needed to keep them together, and the best way to do that was to falsely
10    reassure them that they were safe where they were.  He asked them if they
11    were settling in in the Memic house and assured them that nobody would
12    harm them there.
13            One witness described him, as saying:  "Yes, he shook hands with
14    Mujo and he addressed us too, saying he was Mitar Vasiljevic, that he was
15    accommodating refugees on behalf of the Red Cross, and that we should feel
16    free and safe, and that we should all be in one group, and that no one may
17    touch us and no one would."
18            But Mitar Vasiljevic did not stop there with his representations
19    to the group.  In order to increase the likelihood that they would remain
20    together, he offered them false hope, hope that if they followed his
21    instruction, they would be taken away on a convoy of buses the next
22    morning.
23            He spoke authoritatively as if he knew this for a fact or had some
24    responsibility for arranging buses.  And if you'll recall, at this point
25    in time, the witnesses were all under the impression that the convoys were

 1    being orchestrated and organised by the Red Cross.  Mr. Spahic even
 2    referred to it as a Red Cross convoy.
 3            He attempted to convince them that their surest way to safety was
 4    by listening to him and following his instructions.
 5            Mr. Vasiljevic is quite correct when he said what could he have
 6    told these people about a bus, that he had no such authority.  While that
 7    may very well be true, it is also true that he made those representations
 8    not because he had the authority to but because it served his purpose of
 9    holding the victims until he could find and return with his cohorts.
10            One witness, VG85, said:  "He said there would be a convoy the
11    next day and that nobody would touch us."
12            The final group of statements that he made to the people gathered
13    at the house were carefully calculated to keep the group together.  These
14    final comments were in the nature of directions to them.  He had already
15    established himself in their eyes as having the legitimate authority of
16    the Red Cross.  He had further convinced them with his statements about
17    being responsible for them and that they would be brought to safety the
18    next day.  He now gave them specific instructions to remain together in a
19    single group.
20            VG18 described for the Chamber how some of the people there were
21    intending to stay their last night in Visegrad with some relatives in
22    town.  Common sense tells us that if these people were leaving the next
23    morning, they would want to see and spend time with their relatives,
24    particularly during these times, to see if their relatives were okay.  Yet
25    Mitar Vasiljevic told them not to, they should not; they should remain

 1    together in one group.  It was not even enough that they remain as a group
 2    in that area.  He wanted them in the Memic house.
 3            One of the twin sisters testified that when she first arrived at
 4    that area, she actually went in the direction of the Omeragic house, and
 5    that's where she intended to stay.  But when Mitar Vasiljevic arrived at
 6    the scene, he told her not to go into that house but called her back and
 7    directed her to stay in the Memic house.
 8            Finally is the issue of the certificate.  Several witnesses
 9    described seeing Mitar Vasiljevic take out a pad and write something that
10    he gave to (redacted).  In giving it, he instructed the people to show
11    the certificate and that, in showing it, they would not be harmed.
12            He then handed (redacted) a piece of paper on which he had
13    written something.  He instructed them to show the piece of paper to
14    anyone who came to the house, including the police.  He told Mujo that
15    this was going to guarantee their safety and that nobody would harm them.
16    He also told Mujo to show this piece of paper to anyone who would come in
17    order to be safe.  (redacted) then showed this piece of paper to other
18    members of the group.
19            Some of the witnesses that testified before you saw him write this
20    note and give it to Mujo.  Others were shown the note afterward, when Mujo
21    displayed it for the people who were inside the house when Mitar
22    Vasiljevic had written it.
23            The accused has acknowledged on cross-examination that he may have
24    written something on a piece of paper for Mujo, but that it was not a
25    certificate of safety but simply his address and phone number.  The

 1    accused was correct when he testified that he had no such authority to
 2    give such a guarantee and that even if he had written such a note, no one
 3    would have observed his promise to these people.  The question is not
 4    whether he had the authority but whether or not he induced those people
 5    who rely on his promises, to believe in the power of this scrap of paper,
 6    in order to ensure that they would be there when he returned with Milan
 7    Lukic.
 8            The accused's use of the Red Cross to impersonate its employees
 9    and authority was not unique to the people of Pionirska Street.  Several
10    defence witnesses testified, albeit reluctantly, that in earlier
11    statements given to Mr. Tanaskovic, they had stated that they observed the
12    accused wearing the sign of the red cross on his armband.
13            Additionally, VG117, a woman who has known the accused from
14    childhood, testified about a day in June when she was brought to the Vuk
15    Karadzic school as a part of the ethnic cleansing campaign in Visegrad.
16    There, Mitar Vasiljevic came, identified himself as a member of the Red
17    Cross, and began to record the names of the 119 people there, who,
18    according to him -- or according to him, he was writing down the names in
19    order to send them to the Red Cross headquarters in Geneva.  The witness,
20    in daylight, for over an hour, stood close to the accused as he collected
21    the names of the Muslims.  And incidentally, sometime after he left that
22    group, Milan Lukic appeared, terrorised the group, and robbed them, much
23    as he had done before to other people in Pionirska Street.
24            What also has emerged from the evidence at trial is a picture of
25    how this group operated and the tools they employed to overcome possible

 1    resistance by the victims that had been selected by them.  The tool that
 2    they employed was not one they invented and has been used to facilitate
 3    criminal activity throughout human history.  Milan Lukic, Mitar
 4    Vasiljevic, and other members of the group lied to their intended victims
 5    in order to facilitate their ability to perpetrate crimes against them.
 6            There was evidence regarding the lies that Mitar Vasiljevic told
 7    the families of VG55 and VG59.  He admitted falsely reassuring them that
 8    they should remain calm and that nothing would happen to them, even though
 9    he believed Milan Lukic posed a real threat to them.  He also
10    misrepresented that Milan Lukic and him were there to search for a killer
11    and needed to search their attic.
12            During the Drina River killings, the victims selected for summary
13    execution were repeatedly told by their captors that they were only going
14    to be exchanged.  These men were not bound and could have offered
15    resistance to Milan Lukic, Mitar Vasiljevic, and the other perpetrators.
16    To overcome the possibility of these men resisting or them fleeing, the
17    men were constantly reassured that they would not be harmed and would be
18    released into Muslim territory later that day.  The behaviour of the men
19    drastically changed once the cars stopped at the killing site.  So
20    desperate were these men to believe the lies told to them by their captors
21    that they denied the reality foretold by Milan Lukic's destruction of
22    their identity documents.
23            Your Honour, does the Chamber wish to break at 4.00?
24            JUDGE HUNT:  We might as well keep to the usual timetable.  It
25    might be just as well, though, if we resumed, say, in 20 minutes rather

 1    than 30, to see whether we can fit this whole set of addresses in this
 2    afternoon.
 3            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  We'll resume at 4.20.
 5                          --- Recess taken at 4.00 p.m.
 6                          --- On resuming at 4.25 p.m.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome.
 8            MR. GROOME:  Your Honours, I'd like to continue with my
 9    description of how very often Milan Lukic and other members of his group
10    employed the tool of trickery to help overcome the resistance of their
11    intended victims.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, all of this is in the document.  We're
13    hoping that you might just tell us some of the evidence that you rely upon
14    for some of the things that you haven't identified in the document rather
15    than just repeat what's in the document.
16            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  I'll just briefly touch upon some
17    of the most important ones.
18            Another witness testified to a scene in the fire brigade in which
19    Mitar Vasiljevic was one of the people who took away her father.  As the
20    little girl began to cry, he took the small girl into his lap and said,
21    "Don't cry.  I also have a daughter.  Your daddy will be back.  He will
22    be exchanged."  And of course we heard in the evidence that her father was
23    one of the bodies recovered in Slap.
24            There has been testimony from Prosecution witnesses and the
25    accused himself that indicates that the presence of the group inside the

 1    Memic house was not readily apparent from outside.  The door to the Memic
 2    house was not on Pionirska Street itself but in the alley between the two
 3    houses.  There were no fires lit for cooking, and there were no lights in
 4    the house.  Witnesses testified that the group went into the house and
 5    remained in the house.  The accused himself testified that when he went
 6    past the house 15 to 20 minutes after he left the house to retrieve the
 7    horse, there was no sign of any of the people that he had seen there
 8    earlier.
 9            Yet shortly after Mitar Vasiljevic left the house - and witnesses
10    have varied in their estimates, between 45 minutes to an hour and a half -
11    Milan and Sredoje Lukic arrived with other men.  Although not all
12    witnesses recognise all of the people, among the members that were
13    identified were Mitar Vasiljevic; Milan Susnjar, also known as Laco; and
14    Bosko Djuric.  VG38 could see both Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic
15    standing in front of the house as he looked through a nearby window.  When
16    the men returned, VG13 could see other members of the group gathering some
17    additional residents from Pionirska Street.
18            After the group entered the house, they ordered the people
19    gathered there to go into an adjacent room where Milan Susnjar sat in an
20    armchair with an automatic rifle resting on his leg.  He made all of the
21    people strip completely naked and took all of their belongings.  During
22    the strip-search, the group from Koritnik and Sase could hear other
23    members of Milan Lukic's group outside the house, laughing.
24            During the course of the ordeal, Milan and Sredoje Lukic took
25    Jasmina Vila, Ifeta Kurpashic, and another young girl by the name of

 1    Mujesira Kurpashic out of the Memic house.  When they returned, it was
 2    clear that they had been sexually assaulted.  One of these young women was
 3    pregnant.  They cried uncontrollably, and they ominously told the other
 4    women that their turn would come as well.
 5            The men eventually left while there was still daylight outside.
 6            The Defence, in its brief, asks the question:  Why didn't the
 7    people leave at this point?  Why didn't they leave after the robbery?
 8    What choice did the victims have to go out onto the streets that they knew
 9    turned deadly at night?  Where could they have gone?  They are now at one
10    of the settlements on the outer limits of the town.  Their options were to
11    walk through woods that were unfamiliar to them or to return back and walk
12    through the middle of town, a place where they knew it was very likely
13    they would run into paramilitaries.
14            It is unreasonable to expect that the victims could have gone
15    anywhere, and it is inappropriate to suggest that their failure to do so
16    somehow contributed to the crimes committed against them.
17            The group did return, and it was approaching nightfall when they
18    did.  They returned in a car that had lost its muffler.  There were no
19    lights in the Memic house, and some of the women had put their children
20    down to sleep.  When they arrived at the house, they shone the car's
21    headlights into the house to illuminate it.  One of the women remarked
22    that they had returned to kill them.  Four of the men - Milan Lukic,
23    Sredoje Lukic, Mitar Vasiljevic, and Milan Susnjar - each had large
24    flashlights.  There were additional men, and although witnesses could see
25    and hear them, they could not readily identify them.  Mitar Vasiljevic

 1    could be seen standing at the front door of the house.
 2            Your Honours, the Prosecution believes it is important to make the
 3    names of each individual who died that night part of the public record of
 4    this case, and rather than simply read the names, we have prepared two
 5    short presentations, the first one which is less than four minutes, the
 6    next one which is three minutes.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, look, that's the very sort of thing we don't
 8    want in a final address.  You've given us a presentation during the course
 9    of the trial.  Now, we've got their names in some document, have we not,
10    already?
11            MR. GROOME:  Well, Your Honour, what I was proposing --
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Please, this is very important.  We've got to know
13    what is the evidence upon which you rely, and all we've got are a number
14    of general statements in this document that you filed as a final brief,
15    many of them without any citation of the evidence at all.  Now, that's
16    what we expected you to be filling in.  That's what you promised in that
17    document.  But all you've done so far is repeat what's in the document.
18    Now, public record.  You've got them on the public record.  We had
19    photographs.  We've got the works.  Now, please just get on with your
20    final address so that we can finally try and get from you, when you've
21    finished, the evidence that you rely upon for a number of very important
22    statements.
23            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
24            Milan Lukic ordered the group to move from the Memic house to
25    another house approximately 50 metres behind the Memic house, closer to a

 1    creek.  It was the house of Adem Omeragic.  There the group was told
 2    another lie, that the Green Berets were attacking and that they were no
 3    longer safe there.  They were also told to leave all of their belongings
 4    behind.  They were forced to walk in a line between the two Memic houses,
 5    toward the bottom floor of the partially-constructed house of the Omeragic
 6    family.
 7            VG13 was one of the first people to leave the Memic house for the
 8    Omeragic house.  She saw Mitar Vasiljevic ushering the people to move
 9    faster.  He actually led the first group of people to the house by the
10    creek.  She was only half a metre from Mitar Vasiljevic as she walked past
11    him and was able to see his features sufficiently to be sure that it was
12    him.  She, having known him for a long period of time, also recognised his
13    voice as he told the people to hurry up.  She also heard Mitar Vasiljevic
14    curse her elderly mother-in-law, who was one of the victims of the fire.
15            As the people were moved to the other house, lights were shone on
16    them from both the perpetrators' cars and their flashlights.  Two
17    witnesses saw the accused, Mitar Vasiljevic, as well as some of the other
18    perpetrators, carrying these flashlights.  Another witness saw Mitar
19    Vasiljevic, Milan Lukic, and others walking between the two Memic houses,
20    guarding the people as they moved from the Jusuf Memic house to the
21    Omeragic house.
22            VG101 saw the accused as she left the Pionirska Street house.  She
23    was close enough at that time to have touched him.  She saw him a second
24    time closer to the Omeragic house as she walked close by him.  VG101, who
25    had heard the warning that she might be raped, at that point decided to

 1    flee.
 2            When entering the house, some of the victims were struck by the
 3    smell of a chemical on the floor.  To some it smelled like paint; to
 4    others, like some volatile glue.
 5            There were two windows in the room facing the rear of the house
 6    toward the creek.  The glass in them was reinforced glass.  One of the
 7    first witnesses to enter that room saw approximately ten other people in
 8    the room.  VG18 and VG84 were among the last to be forced into that room,
 9    and by that time the room was crowded with the perpetrators' intended
10    victims.  Someone who VG18 did not recognise shoved her into the room and
11    cursed at her.
12            Over 70 people had been forced and prepared for their death by
13    being placed into that house.  VG61's father was probably one of the last
14    ones to enter the room.  The people inside, each keenly aware of what lay
15    ahead, reacted differently.  Some panicked, others prayed.  Shortly after
16    everybody had entered the house, the door opened and Milan Lukic put an
17    explosive device on the floor.  One of the witnesses could see Mitar
18    Vasiljevic clearly standing next to him with an automatic rifle,
19    preventing the people from leaving.  His face was illuminated by the light
20    from the group of houses across the creek.
21            The explosion of that device ignited the accelerant-soaked floor
22    so that the waist-high flames quickly spread around the room.
23            VG18 made her way next to the window furthest from the door, and
24    as the fire spread, she repeatedly and frantically tried to break the
25    glass window.  As she did that, one of the perpetrators lobbed a grenade

 1    into an opening in one of the other windows.  When she was finally able to
 2    break the glass, her son, VG84, pushed her through the reinforcing mesh of
 3    the window and onto the bank of the creek below.  He followed immediately
 4    after her.
 5            Soon after VG84 leapt from the window, another young boy about the
 6    same age, VG38, also jumped.  VG13 saw them jump through the window and
 7    could hear gunfire as they did.  VG13, the mother of VG38, tried to follow
 8    him, but as she leapt through the window, she could see Mitar Vasiljevic
 9    shine a flashlight on her while Milan Lukic took aim.  His bullet pierced
10    her body and she rolled to the creek bed where she lay unconscious and
11    where she remained for three days.  On that night, she did not know if her
12    son had survived nor did he know whether she had, and it would be three
13    years before they would be reunited.
14            The accused in this case has raised the Defence of alibi, and in
15    doing so, the Defence now requires the Prosecution to eliminate the
16    reasonable possibility that that alibi is true.  Although the accused had
17    no burden of coming forward with evidence, he did.  He produced friends
18    and acquaintances who testified that on the 14th of June, he fell off of a
19    horse and was brought first to Visegrad Health Centre and subsequently to
20    Uzice hospital.  Medical records were introduced from both hospitals.  In
21    addition to the medical records themselves, we heard from numerous defence
22    witnesses who testified about the records and the conclusions that they
23    were able to draw from them.
24            Finally, the Defence called Dr. Moljevic, who testified that he
25    did in fact recall the night the accused, who he previously knew, was

 1    brought into the hospital.
 2            The accused's defence of alibi has dominated much of this trial.
 3    In many ways, it is confounding because there is compelling evidence that
 4    both supports it and contradicts it.  It is certainly not the Prosecution
 5    case that the senior and respected doctors and nurses from Uzice hospital
 6    that came to this Tribunal willingly lied on behalf of the accused.  They
 7    testified honestly from the information they could read from the various
 8    medical records that they used to testify from.  While there is still much
 9    confusion surrounding the accused's alibi, there are a number of facts
10    which at this point seem beyond dispute.
11            First, the Prosecution, after having some of the medical records
12    tested for authenticity, can provide the Chamber with no evidence that
13    they were in fact forged or altered documents, except for the case of
14    Sredoje Lukic, his name being changed.
15            Secondly, the X-rays taken in 1992 which bear the name of Mitar
16    Vasiljevic and the date the 14th of June, 1992, cannot be of the accused's
17    leg.
18            Thirdly, certain information on the case history form must call
19    into question the reliability of that record.
20            The law obliges the Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt
21    the elements of the offences charged.  It does not require the Prosecution
22    to prove beyond reasonable doubt every fact related to a case.  There are
23    certainly questions regarding how and when the accused injured his leg
24    that I imagine will remain long after the verdict in this case is
25    settled.  There may always be doubt as to whether he broke his leg once or

 1    twice.  There may always be a question as to whether he broke his fibula.
 2    There may always be a question as to how he in fact sustained the injury
 3    we can see in the 2001 X-ray taken at the Detention Centre.
 4            But there can be no doubt that the X-ray of 1992 is not of his
 5    leg.  There can be no longer any doubt that the X-ray that was part of the
 6    medical records of the patient who entered the hospital on the 14th of
 7    June bearing the name of Mitar Vasiljevic is not an X-ray of the leg of
 8    this man here in court.
 9            The Chamber will undoubtedly review carefully all of the expert
10    testimony and evidence in this regard.  I would recall for the Chamber the
11    testimony of Dr. Vucetic.  Recall, although how it took some time, I was
12    finally able to discover the reason his measurements were so very
13    different from those measurements made by the Prosecution experts.  He
14    finally admitted that he used measurements from the lower portion of the
15    tibia to the top, completely separated portion.  Common sense makes it
16    apparent that that measurement is of no use because it would change as the
17    bone moved.  The two bones were completely separate from each other.  You
18    don't need to be an orthopaedist, a radiologist, or an X-ray technician to
19    realise the absurdity of using such a measurement, and I submit that his
20    report and testimony in this regard was a deliberate attempt to confuse or
21    mislead this Chamber.
22            Similarly, there can be no doubt that if the accused, as he
23    claims, always told medical staff that he injured himself falling off of a
24    horse, that the doctor who admitted Mitar Vasiljevic, who interviewed a
25    conscious and alert patient, would not have written down that that

 1    injury -- or the correct way in which that injury was sustained.  I submit
 2    that it is unreasonable to think that a professional medical doctor, after
 3    being told how a person injured themselves, would have deliberately
 4    falsified a medical document and have written down what we have on the
 5    case history, that it was sustained as a fall on a flat surface on the
 6    battlefield.
 7            Also in that original note was the doctor's conclusion, presumably
 8    after examining the 1992 X-ray, that the patient had suffered a simple
 9    fracture of the tibia, something we know to be false according to the
10    defendant's -- the accused's own testimony and the 2001 X-ray which
11    clearly shows a healed fracture of the fibula.
12            Your Honours, the accused has no burden of proof in this matter.
13    The burden never shifts from my shoulders.  But having said that, once he
14    has advanced a defence, it is appropriate for this Chamber to consider the
15    quality of the witnesses that were called and which witnesses were not
16    called.  The Defence had on two occasions informed the Chamber and the
17    Prosecution in open court that it would be calling Dr. Jovicevic, the
18    doctor who admitted that patient that night, the patient supposedly called
19    Mitar Vasiljevic, the doctor who would have seen the person, who would
20    have written that note regarding the battlefield, who would have examined
21    that 1992 X-ray.  He was ultimately not called.  The Prosecution submits
22    that he was not called because of all the medical staff that were brought
23    before you, this one person who could have definitively answered some of
24    the remaining questions would not have advanced the theory of the Defence
25    case.

 1            The Defence in its brief minimises the importance of the fact that
 2    in the ledger from the Visegrad Health Centre records from the 14th of
 3    June, that those records contain the name of Sredoje Lukic, thereby
 4    possibly giving him an alibi to this crime as well.  The Defence minimises
 5    the attempt to disguise his name by pointing to the date of birth
 6    contained in the right-hand column.  I submit that that is an
 7    unsatisfactory explanation.  First, from the rest of the ledger, we know
 8    that many columns and spaces of the book have been left blank.  It would
 9    have been possible to go, to return to this entry and amend it if it were
10    among those that had been left blank.
11            It is also significant that both Dr. Vasiljevic and Mitar
12    Vasiljevic, both kums with the Lukic family, did not tell us who this
13    second Sredoje Lukic was or where we could find him.  Or in the event that
14    the name was in fact somebody else and it was amended to correct a
15    mistaken entry of Sredoje Lukic, we were not advised by Dr. Vasiljevic who
16    this person was from the town of Visegrad.
17            What weight you eventually give these medical records and the
18    testimony of the witnesses, you alone will decide.  The Prosecution
19    submits that you should be cautious in the weight that you place on them.
20    While the Prosecution has not been able to show them to be fabricated
21    documents, there is sufficient indicia for the Chamber to approach them
22    with caution.
23            Do not do as the Defence has suggested, and that is to summarily
24    dismiss every witness who spoke about seeing the accused after the 14th.
25    I encourage you to carefully consider all of the evidence, evaluate the

 1    demeanour of these witnesses and the reasonableness of what they have
 2    testified to, and I want to review some of their testimony now.
 3            Four eyewitnesses and survivors of the Pionirska Street fire
 4    confirmed that Mitar Vasiljevic was present at the time of the commission
 5    of the crime, and while it is unclear as to the accuracy of their
 6    estimates of time, for a number of reasons, the Prosecution would
 7    submit: one, their watches were taken; and two, most of the women that
 8    were there were there in fear of being raped and that it is reasonable for
 9    the Court to infer that this tremendous fear of such a horrible crime
10    being committed against them could have distorted their perception of the
11    time.  The evidence of VG101, 78, 13, and 38 established Mitar
12    Vasiljevic's presence at the time of the transfer from the Jusuf Memic
13    house to Adem Omeragic's house closer in the vicinity of the latter.  He
14    carried a flashlight, with which VG13 testified he shone at her when Milan
15    Lukic shot her while escaping through the window.  He stood guard as the
16    people were transferred from one house to another.  Although it was dark,
17    light came from other sources and nearby houses and the lights that the
18    men were holding.  In all four cases, the witnesses saw Mitar Vasiljevic
19    at a distance of several metres.
20            Several Prosecution witnesses who knew Mitar Vasiljevic testified
21    that they saw him after the night of the 14th of June.
22            A day or two after the conclusion of Muslim Bajram, which ended on
23    the 14th, VG105 recognised Mitar Vasiljevic and Milan Lukic when they came
24    to the fire brigade building.
25            Two days after the Pionirska Street fire, on the night of the 16th

 1    going into the 17th, at approximately 4.00 in the morning, VG81 was
 2    awakened by her neighbours in Kosovo Polje, who asked her to come and
 3    bandage a woman.  It was VG13, one of the survivors of the fire.
 4            On the 18th of June, the day before VG81 and remaining villagers
 5    of Kosovo Polje escaped across the river, she saw Mitar Vasiljevic at
 6    approximately 6.00 in the evening.  She watched as Milan Lukic and Mitar
 7    Vasiljevic killed a Muslim woman by the name of Nurka Kos.
 8            VG81, who lived quite close to the accused, saw him on a number of
 9    other occasions from where she was hiding near her house.
10            Shortly after the fire on Pionirska Street on the 14th of June,
11    VG115, a Serb by nationality, observed when passing how Mitar Vasiljevic,
12    Milan Lukic, and two others assaulted a Muslim man by the name of Kahriman
13    on the old Turkish bridge.  She reported another occasion in which she saw
14    Mr. Vasiljevic.
15            VG117 testified that on the 14th of June, she was told she had to
16    leave her village on a convoy out of Visegrad.  She was told later that
17    she could not leave that day but would leave on the 22nd of June.  She and
18    other members of her village were picked up by trucks in their village and
19    brought to the Vuk Karadzic school on Pionirska Street.
20            Shortly after they arrived at the school, Mitar Vasiljevic
21    approached them and told them that he worked for the Red Cross.  She stood
22    for one and a half hours in his presence on a sunny morning.  His face was
23    not disguised, and she was close enough to have touched him.
24            VG117 described seeing several other people who had accompanied
25    them on the truck, and from that group, she only recognised one man, a man

 1    by the name of Cira Duric.  She did not know his name was Zoran.  A
 2    Defence witness by the name of Zoran Duric, in his testimony, would
 3    confirm that most of the people knew him as Cira and the fact that he was
 4    at the school that date with VG117.  Cira Duric's testimony here before
 5    the Chamber was clear evidence that VG117 was not wrong when she
 6    identified him as being there.  Isn't her identification of Mitar
 7    Vasiljevic, a person that she knew far better and far longer than she knew
 8    Cira, isn't her identification of Mitar Vasiljevic corroborated by her
 9    identification of Cira?
10            Perhaps most significant is the fact that, prior to seeing the
11    accused on the 22nd of June, VG117 saw VG18 after she escaped the fire on
12    Pionirska Street.  She testified that sometime after the 14th of June,
13    when she was originally told to leave her village, and before the 22nd,
14    VG18 and her son came to the village and recounted what happened to them
15    on Pionirska Street.
16            Perhaps the most convincing is the testimony that was taken from a
17    Defence witness in closed session.  I will not say much about it here in
18    open court and instead rely on the confidential supplement to the
19    Prosecution final trial brief.  What I will say, that given the testimony
20    from witnesses and experts regarding this matter, the Prosecution has
21    established convincingly that even one of the most important Defence
22    witnesses supports the conclusion that the accused was present in Visegrad
23    and well able to participate in the Pionirska Street fire as described by
24    witnesses.
25            The credibility and reliability of witnesses is always a matter of

 1    importance, but it is of a special importance in this case.  When I use
 2    the word "credibility," I mean did the witness tell the truth as they
 3    believe it to be when they testified?  And when I say "reliability," I
 4    mean to say that even if the witness described the truth as they believe
 5    it, can we be sure that they are not honestly mistaken?
 6            You, the Chamber, will decide which witnesses you find to be both
 7    credible and reliable, and return a verdict in large part based upon which
 8    witnesses you have believed during the course of this trial.  In large
 9    part, you will rely on your experience as Judges, as well as your common
10    sense, in evaluating what was said from the witness chair during the
11    course of the trial.  I would submit the following for your
12    consideration:
13            There have been a number of times during the course of the
14    Prosecution witnesses' testimony that it was clear that if they were so
15    disposed to testify falsely against the accused, they could have.  Early
16    in the trial, the Chamber heard from VG55 and 59.  They were very clear
17    regarding the conduct of the accused.  They saw him guard the front door
18    and ask if somebody was hiding in the attic, essentially no more or no
19    less.
20            The very next night when Milan Lukic and his group returned to
21    Musici, they believed that Mitar Vasiljevic was among them, but with all
22    candor they said that they did not see him on that occasion.
23            Consider the testimony of VG117.  In her view, Mitar Vasiljevic
24    never did anything wrong.  She bears no malice towards him.  She has not
25    accused him of any crime.  If she was so inclined to testify falsely

 1    against Mitar Vasiljevic, clearly she could have changed her testimony in
 2    a way that implicated him in some crimes.  She did not.  She merely said
 3    that on the 22nd of June she saw him and described what she saw him
 4    doing.
 5            The reverse is also true.  You heard VG55 and 59 describe the
 6    actions of Sredoje Lukic, one of the co-accused, and almost commending him
 7    in effecting the release of some of the Muslims from the Vilina Vlas
 8    Hotel.  They did not minimise his benevolent actions.
 9            Similarly the witnesses regarding the Drina River killings.  It
10    was clear and consistent.  They never exaggerated Mr. Vasiljevic's conduct
11    in those events.  They never tried to ascribe to him conduct which they
12    saw other people do.
13            The witnesses who survived Pionirska Street all readily admitted
14    that they did not know all of the perpetrators.  Consider which
15    perpetrators they identified to the Chamber.  They identified those
16    perpetrators whom they either knew or who identified themselves during the
17    course of the event.  While it is clear that all of the witnesses felt
18    that other Serbs were also responsible for their plight that day, it is
19    equally clear that all of them identified only those perpetrators that
20    they saw there that day.  They identified Mitar Vasiljevic, Sredoje Lukic,
21    Milan Lukic, either from personal knowledge or by hearing other people in
22    the house refer to them.  They referred to Milan Susnjar because they
23    heard the other perpetrators call him by name.  The witnesses had no way
24    of knowing at that time that the accused had worked with a person by the
25    name of Susnjar, also with the alias of Laco, up in Prelovo earlier or at

 1    the end of May.
 2            The Defence in its brief claims that the Prosecution witnesses
 3    have testified falsely before you in order to name a known Serb like Mitar
 4    Vasiljevic in place of Serb perpetrators that were then unknown to them.
 5    I submit that the exact opposite is the case.  The fact that so many of
 6    the perpetrators remain to this day unidentified is clear evidence of the
 7    credibility of Prosecution witnesses.  If they were somehow motivated to
 8    falsely accused Mitar Vasiljevic for what happened at Pionirska Street,
 9    common sense dictates that they would have also falsely identified some of
10    the other perpetrators as being people they also thought were responsible
11    for what happened to them.
12            The Court heard VG13 testify to all the names of the several men
13    whom she believed were involved in what happened to her that day.  In her
14    mind, she believes that the Serbs who arrived to escort the people of
15    Koritnik to Visegrad were involved as well.  Given that, if she were
16    inclined to falsely testify about Mitar Vasiljevic, we could expect that
17    she would have included the names of these other men as well.  She did
18    not.  She simply said that there were men present whom she did not
19    recognise.
20            The Chamber should also consider the costs involved for many of
21    the Prosecution witnesses who appeared here.  The Chamber became aware in
22    some instances of the legitimate fears that many of these witnesses had
23    for their own safety as a result of coming here to testify.  They did not
24    assume those risks to themselves and their families because they wanted to
25    testify falsely against the accused.  They took those risks because they

 1    longed for justice for themselves and the people who died in that fire.
 2            The Defence has made much of the minor inconsistencies between
 3    witnesses regarding clothing descriptions and at times different
 4    observations were made.  The Defence has put these forward as evidence
 5    that some of the witnesses have not been truthful with the Chamber.  The
 6    Prosecution submits that these differences have an entirely different
 7    meaning and, accordingly, the Chamber should draw a different conclusion
 8    than that suggested by the Defence.
 9            It has been over nine years since these people witnessed the
10    events they testified about.  It is quite reasonable that, as time has
11    passed, their memories have faded, that when asked for precise answers to
12    observations that are now somehow vague, there will naturally be
13    differences between the testimony of different individuals.  The fact that
14    most of these expected inconsistencies were brought out by questions put
15    to the witnesses by the Prosecution demonstrates two things:  First, there
16    has been no attempt to influence the memory of witnesses.  The Prosecution
17    takes the recollection of the witness as it has been found and presents it
18    to the Chamber.  And second, that witnesses have not spoken to each other
19    about their testimony in an attempt to ensure that their stories
20    correspond.  Each told the truth as best he or she recalled it some nine
21    years after the event.
22            The Chamber should also consider the state of mind of many of
23    these witnesses at the time they saw what they described here for the
24    Chamber.  Most were in fear of imminent death, some of imminent rape.  If
25    we stop to consider the task we give these witnesses for a moment, we can

 1    only see how near impossible it is to ask questions like, "Did he have
 2    facial hair?  What was the colour of his shirt?"  At the time, the minds
 3    of these witnesses were racing with thoughts on how they might escape or
 4    what would happen to their children.
 5            This point should also be considered when the Chamber evaluates
 6    the testimony of defence witnesses.  We saw very clear examples of Defence
 7    witnesses who were certain of the same facts as other defence witnesses,
 8    such as information about the armband or when they made certain
 9    observations.  And yet these very same witnesses were so clearly lacking
10    in any clear recollection of other related facts.
11            Eighteen Defence witnesses have applied for and received
12    guarantees that they would not be arrested for crimes under the Tribunal's
13    jurisdiction while they were here in the Netherlands.  That is about half
14    of the Defence case.  They included the doctors Vasiljevic and
15    Dr. Loncarevic.  The Prosecution submits that Dr. Vasiljevic's refusal to
16    treat a critically burned victim, Muslim victim, from one of Milan Lukic's
17    other house burnings demonstrates a great deal about his bias and his
18    credibility.
19            Crimes over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction, there are no
20    minor crimes.  What do these people have to fear about coming to the
21    Tribunal?  The Prosecution submits that this is a fact that the Chamber
22    should consider when evaluating their evidence.
23            The Prosecution would also submit witnesses like Zoran Duric
24    actually participated in the ethnic cleansing of Visegrad.  Or VGD24, a
25    reserve police officer who stood by idly while outside paramilitaries

 1    invaded Visegrad, or the other Defence witness who accompanied a convoy
 2    like the one that Mr. Spahic was on which resulted in Muslims being
 3    killed.
 4            I want to now talk about the credibility of the accused.  The
 5    accused testified on three different occasions over the course of this
 6    trial and it is the subject of many pages of transcript.  I submit that if
 7    the Chamber studies his testimony, it is replete with evidence that he
 8    deliberately tried to mislead this Chamber.  Sometimes this became evident
 9    as his testimony was contradicted by other witnesses.  At other times, it
10    is the sheer improbability of what he says that clearly identifies it as
11    false.  There are many such examples regarding his testimony.  I will name
12    simply seven regarding the Drina River killings.
13            The first is the improbability of the waiter's uniform, that
14    story.  I've discussed that earlier.
15            The improbability of this elderly janitor by the name of Susnjar
16    standing up to Milan Lukic.  According to the accused, this elderly
17    janitor refused to give Milan Lukic the keys he was looking for, disarmed
18    Milan Lukic because Lukic was rude to him.  The improbability of Lukic,
19    and everything we know about him, accepting the elderly janitor's refusal.
20            The improbability of the Stanko Pecikoza story, which I've already
21    dealt with.
22            The improbability of the portion of his testimony that dealt with
23    the cigarette and Meho Dzafic.  He testified that while the others were in
24    the hotel lobby, he took Meho Dzafic outside without saying anything to
25    Milan Lukic.  It is improbable that Milan Lukic would have allowed this

 1    unfettered captive to stroll out of the hotel with Mitar Vasiljevic.  It
 2    is also not reported by either of the two survivors who were standing in
 3    that hotel lobby.
 4            The accused testified that when Milan Lukic came outside with the
 5    others, he told Meho not to smoke in the car and took his cigarette.  Now,
 6    according to the accused, Meho rode in the Yugo, his own Yugo, and Milan
 7    Lukic rode in the Passat.  What possible reason could Milan Lukic have had
 8    for not wanting Meho to smoke a cigarette in his own car?  Milan Lukic was
 9    riding with him, so it wasn't as if he would be bothered by the smoke.
10            There is even a more important reason why you know that Mitar
11    Vasiljevic never went outside to have a cigarette with Meho.  You know
12    that because Mitar Vasiljevic told you that he was present when Milan
13    Lukic was trying to find the keys.  He was present during all of that.
14    You also know from the two survivors that as soon as Milan Lukic couldn't
15    find the keys he was looking for, he ordered the men back into the cars.
16    There just was never any time for Mitar Vasiljevic to take Meho outside to
17    the pine trees there by the parking lot and to have a smoke with him.  It
18    just didn't happen.
19            One of the more outrageous facts that the accused tried to assert
20    was that Meho did not want to be exchanged and that this was the purpose
21    of the accused going to the exchange.  He didn't want to go with his son
22    but instead wanted to return to Visegrad so that he could continue his
23    medical treatments at the Visegrad Health Centre.  He would have you
24    believe that after being forcibly captured at gunpoint, robbed, threatened
25    with death, the destruction of all his identity documents, that Meho,

 1    after all of this, wanted to return to continue his treatment for an
 2    ulcer.  An ulcer.  It's preposterous.
 3            The accused testified that Milan Lukic and his men were working
 4    with the police in Visegrad at the time.  He also told us that he was very
 5    afraid of the men Milan Lukic was with.  So afraid that he asked not to
 6    have -- so afraid was he that he asked not to be made to say their names
 7    in open court.  And yet he would have you believe that the very next day,
 8    he went down to the police station and filed a complaint with their boss,
 9    accusing them of a crime.  When challenged on this, you will recall he
10    asked Dragan Tomic not to reveal who made the complaint.
11            I quote from what he said.  He said, "I asked the commander not to
12    say that it was I who reported it."
13            But recall his state of mind.  In his state of mind, or according
14    to what he's told us, he is the only witness to that crime.  He does not
15    know that two Muslims survived.  He does not know about VG79 across the
16    river.  There are no houses where people can see what is going on.  In his
17    mind, he can be the only possible witness, and yet it is his testimony
18    that the next day he reported this crime, despite his fears of these men.
19            From the time of his statement in November 2000, the accused
20    claimed that he was cleaning the streets on the day of the 14th.  No
21    one - the accused, the Defence, or the Prosecution
22    investigators - realised that the 14th was in fact an important religious
23    holiday for Serbs, a so-called red-letter day, one of the more significant
24    feasts of the Serbian church.
25            Evidence has now shown us otherwise.  Consider the improbability

 1    of him, on such an important day, a Sunday as well, going out to clean
 2    streets in the morning.  If he had forgotten the day, certainly he would
 3    have seen people going dressed to church or hear the church bells.  There
 4    is nothing to suggest that Mitar Vasiljevic was so industrious that he was
 5    inclined to work on a Serb holiday.
 6            Recall the testimony of the brandy.  The accused contradicted
 7    himself when he testified about the bottle of brandy.  At first he said
 8    that Mujo went to the store to buy it, and then he said that he brought it
 9    with him.  When confronted on cross-examination with this contradiction,
10    he admitted lying to the Chamber; however, he excused it because he said
11    he was embarrassed to admit that he was an alcoholic and that he had
12    carried the bottle with him.
13            The Prosecution submits that the entire story about the horse is a
14    fabrication and that those witnesses who testified regarding it should not
15    be believed.  From the very start, it is improbable that he would
16    undertake this task on a Serb holiday, this mission to save a horse.  He
17    was first asked to describe the details of his story in November of 2000,
18    and perhaps he had not given the story as much thought as he might have.
19    Consider the improbability of his intentions:  He plans to go and retrieve
20    the horse belonging to a Muslim from a field and then carry it down to the
21    town and leave it alongside the railroad tracks, and the reason he does
22    this is so that the horse will walk along those railroad tracks to a Serb
23    village in which Mitar Vasiljevic hopes someone will take care of the
24    horse.  We must evaluate this story in light of common sense, and common
25    sense rejects it as absurd.

 1            Consider that, according to him, (redacted) says, "I had to
 2    abandon my cows.  I would like to give them to you if you would take care
 3    of them."  And to this Mitar Vasiljevic says no.  He says no to looking
 4    after Mujo's cows in the middle of the summer when there is little other
 5    to do than to ensure that they have water.  He ignores the livestock of a
 6    friend who lives just down the road from him, yet goes such a great
 7    distance and such great lengths to look after the old mare of a stranger.
 8            Regarding his account of him riding the horse, common sense should
 9    be sufficient to make it plain the improbability that he was able to jump
10    up on the back of this mare without a saddle, stirrups, no bit in its
11    mouth, no fence around to get a boost, that Mitar Vasiljevic, a little bit
12    drunk, was able to walk up to this strange horse and leap onto its back
13    and ride it into town.  I submit that it is so blatantly improbable that
14    it could not have occurred.
15            Consider also that the people of Koritnik were all crowded into
16    the Memic house at the time Mitar Vasiljevic says he rode past the house
17    on the horse and could see no one.  Certainly someone in the house would
18    have heard the horse, would have looked out the window and remarked to the
19    others that Mitar Vasiljevic was riding past on a horse.  No one did
20    because it didn't happen.
21            Perhaps the most blatant attempt by the accused to mislead the
22    Chamber was regarding Milan Lukic's wedding.  Both him and his wife
23    attempted to minimise his role in Milan Lukic's wedding by telling you
24    that it was an unplanned wedding, that Milan Lukic simply picked him up by
25    the side of the road, drove with him to the government office, and

 1    witnessed the signing of official wedding documents.  He denied that there
 2    was a church ceremony or reception, and said that he had no advance notice
 3    of it.  In fact, he told you that he didn't even have an opportunity to
 4    change his clothes before going to be a witness.  His wife confirmed the
 5    story and said the night of the wedding he told her essentially the same
 6    thing he described for the Court.
 7            But then I happened to ask one of the Defence witnesses about
 8    Milan Lukic's wedding, and we get a very, very different account.  He told
 9    the Chamber that Milan Lukic had a church service, a civil ceremony, and a
10    reception.  He further told the Chamber that he received an invitation one
11    month before the wedding.  He also said that Mitar Vasiljevic was at the
12    reception and was dressed as you would expect him to be for a wedding.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, whilst you're on that, you'll remember
14    when that witness, who I think ended up with a pseudonym VGD30, he was
15    shown a video during the course of his evidence in his cross-examination,
16    and he suddenly said:  That is not the wedding of Milan Lukic; it's
17    another wedding altogether.  What's the answer to that?
18            MR. GROOME:  There were two weddings discussed in his testimony.
19            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, but the one that you showed him, the video, when
20    he saw it, he said that wasn't his wedding.
21            MR. GROOME:  And Your Honour, that is not -- the Prosecution never
22    alleged that it was Milan Lukic's wedding.  That was always very clear.
23    It was a wedding of a relative of Milan Lukic, where Milan Lukic was the
24    best man at that wedding.  If you look at that person's testimony, Your
25    Honour, and in particular, look at it before the break and after the

 1    break.  Before the break, he's very clear that Milan Lukic -- and he
 2    describes Milan Lukic's wedding in great detail.  After the break, he's
 3    asked a question very early on in the re-examination, and he says
 4    something to the effect:  Oh, what I really meant is -- I misunderstood
 5    what Mr. Groome was saying.  I thought Mr. Groome was talking about this
 6    other wedding.
 7            You will be the trier of fact.  I would encourage the Chamber to
 8    take a close look at that portion of his testimony, and it is clear that,
 9    although he changed his testimony after the break, that it is clear that
10    before the break there was no misunderstanding about which wedding we were
11    discussing.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, the problem is he actually identified, as I
13    recall, the groom's father, and there was no challenge to his
14    identification of the groom's father, and it wasn't Milan Lukic's father.
15            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I think there's some confusion here.
16    The wedding video was taken, I believe, in 1997, 1998.  It has nothing to
17    do with Milan Lukic's wedding and it was never put to the witness that it
18    did.  It was put to the witness, that wedding, because that wedding -- the
19    video of that wedding was sold, in an attempt for money, to a person -- I
20    don't want to mention their name, but that wedding video was sold, and it
21    was just brought out to show that this man had in the past exchanged
22    information for money with Muslim survivors.
23            Now, when we talked about the Milan Lukic wedding, it was at a
24    completely different portion of his testimony.  It's completely distinct.
25    And what I'm suggesting to the Chamber is if you read that again, despite

 1    what he says on re-examination, I believe that it's clear from the words
 2    and his answers to my questions that he's not misunderstanding the
 3    questions and thinking that we're talking about the wedding video.  It's
 4    very clear in his mind that we're talking about Milan Lukic's wedding.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Okay.  Well, that's your answer to it, but it hadn't
 6    been put in your document.  It would have been better if you had dealt
 7    with that.
 8            MR. GROOME:  I apologise for that, Your Honour.
 9            Your Honours, you may find that the accused has not been truthful
10    in his testimony.  You may find that he deliberately tried to mislead the
11    Court regarding material facts in this case.  The Prosecution submits that
12    if you determine that if he, or any witness, for that matter, tried to
13    mislead the Chamber regarding a material fact, that you may disregard the
14    entire testimony of that witness.  In addition, the Prosecution submits
15    that, in the event that you come to such a conclusion regarding the
16    accused's testimony before you, that you should consider such deliberate
17    attempt to mislead you as evidence of his own awareness of his guilt or
18    his consciousness of guilt.
19            For as long as people have committed crimes, they have also lied
20    to cover them up, to evade responsibility for them.  If you find that the
21    accused has tried to mislead the Chamber, then I submit you must ask
22    yourselves why, and I submit the answer to that question is his awareness
23    of his own guilt.
24            The Chamber should also consider that he, more than any other
25    person who testified here, has something to lose or to gain from your

 1    verdict.
 2            The Prosecution submits that there is a sufficient basis for the
 3    Chamber to discredit significant portions of the alibi evidence offered at
 4    trial and instead rely on the identifications of the accused by
 5    Prosecution witnesses.  I want to spend just a few minutes discussing the
 6    reliability of the Prosecution witnesses' identification of the accused.
 7            You have heard testimony regarding the identification procedures
 8    conducted with witnesses.  You have seen the actual photo arrays that were
 9    used and how the witness indicated that they recognised the accused.  The
10    Prosecution submits that the evidence introduced regarding the
11    identification procedures could not have been fairer to the accused and
12    that the Chamber should have a high level of confidence in the results of
13    these identification procedures.
14            It is also significant to this case that the identification of the
15    accused by most of the witnesses was a matter of recognising him from
16    their prior dealings with him and not simply an identification from the
17    crime nine years earlier.  The Defence will undoubtedly point to the
18    differences among the descriptions given by the witnesses as a reason for
19    disregarding them.  It is important to consider for a moment the
20    difference between recognition and description.
21            That portion I've covered in the final trial brief, Your Honour,
22    and I'm sure the Court in its experience is well aware of the difference
23    between recognition and description.  Suffice it to say that the inability
24    of the witnesses to give consistent and perfectly corresponding
25    descriptions of the accused nine years later does not impeach the

 1    reliability of their positive identifications of him when presented with
 2    the photo arrays.
 3            The Prosecution submits that even if the Chamber has a reasonable
 4    doubt as to whether or not the accused was present at the time the fire in
 5    the Omeragic house on Pionirska Street was started, that credible and
 6    reliable evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was
 7    involved in the planning and commission of that crime.
 8            It is the Prosecution's case that the crime did not begin when the
 9    fire was ignited, or even earlier, when the people in the Memic house were
10    robbed and raped.  The first concrete acts to plan and prepare for this
11    crime were those of the accused, when he identified and selected the
12    victims of the planned crime and took steps to ensure that they would
13    remain in a place in which he could find them at a later time.  The fact
14    that he may have suffered an injury before he was able to participate in
15    setting the house on fire does not negate or vitiate in any way his
16    criminal culpability for his acts earlier in the day.
17            Your Honours, in the final trial brief, there is a suggestion of
18    these acts and their importance to your consideration of whether the
19    Prosecution has met its burden in establishing the various elements of the
20    crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.  I will not repeat all of those
21    arguments now.  I would like to say the following:
22            The Prosecution recognises that it has a heavy burden to prove the
23    guilt of Mitar Vasiljevic, and it is not a burden we have shirked but one
24    which we have met with clear and convincing evidence.
25            If the Chamber ultimately resolved the issues surrounding the

 1    accused's hospitalisation in such a way to conclude that there did exist a
 2    reasonable possibility that he was not present when the match was struck,
 3    then the Prosecution's burden must be met on the evidence of his conduct
 4    earlier in the day and at a time when he admits being present at the
 5    scene.  As part of that burden, the Prosecution must establish beyond
 6    reasonable doubt that at the time the accused spoke to the people in the
 7    afternoon on Pionirska Street, he did so with criminal intent, that is,
 8    acts and words were coupled with a state of mind necessary for the
 9    commission of crimes for which he is charged.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  We'll keep going until quarter to before the next
11    break.
12            MR. GROOME:  It is not an easy thing to examine the mind of
13    another and especially not easy after the passage of a significant period
14    of time.  Fortunately, in this case this is a tool, a tool in the form of
15    a question, a question that if the Chamber seeks the answer to will
16    illuminate the state of mind of the accused and will lay bare and obvious
17    his intentions on the afternoon of the 14th.
18            I have already described the evidence that the accused instructed
19    the people on Pionirska Street to remain together as a group.  What
20    possible reason could he have had for wanting them to remain in a single
21    group?  What difference does it make to him whether the group disperses or
22    whether the group remains together?
23            And I would encourage the Defence to offer an answer to this
24    question in its closing remarks.

 1    in Visegrad with relatives, and this man says, "No.  You must stay
 2    together."  Why?
 3            You heard one videolink witness describe how, when she arrived in
 4    Pionirska Street, she walked back to the back of the Memic house and was
 5    actually on her way into the Omeragic house when she was called back,
 6    called back by the accused.  Why did he not want her to go to the Omeragic
 7    house at that time, the house that was ultimately set on fire?  What
 8    possible reason could he have had?
 9            Perhaps the earliest example of his criminal intent and how it is
10    exposed by this question is the woman who happens by Mitar Vasiljevic and
11    the group on her way down in the direction of town.  Mitar Vasiljevic does
12    his best, his best to convince her that she, too, should join the group.
13    What possible reason does he have for her joining the group?  Why does it
14    matter to him?  It mattered to him because, even then, he had already
15    formed the intent to commit serious crimes against them, crimes that in
16    light of his prior participation with Milan Lukic and his men certainly
17    included murder.
18            In truth, isn't this the reason he drafted the certificate?  Not
19    so much to get him to believe -- or get them to believe that he was an
20    official of the town or for the Red Cross, for he had convinced them of
21    that already.  Wasn't the certificate his clever way of ensuring that they
22    remained together, that they did not disperse?  With only one certificate,
23    any person who wanted to avail themselves of this protection had to remain
24    in the group with (redacted) in the Memic house.  Any others who would
25    depart from that group did so at their own peril.  By giving them that

 1    certificate, he knew that they would in all likelihood remain as a group
 2    at the Memic house.
 3            Why he did this, we may never know.  Perhaps it was to avenge his
 4    cousin's death by Muslim forces.  Perhaps it was in retaliation for his
 5    six-month gaol sentence for illegal nationalistic behaviour in the village
 6    of Koritnik.  Perhaps it was as simple as trying to impress his kum, Milan
 7    Lukic.  We may never know.  But his conduct demonstrates clearly his
 8    intent to participate in the crimes committed against the people of
 9    Koritnik and Sase on the 14th of June.
10            Didn't that certificate serve as a fetter stronger than any
11    handcuffs or rope, stronger than any lock he could have placed on the door
12    of the Memic house?  Using their own fear and a simple piece of paper, he
13    bound those people to ensure their demise.  That old adage about the pen
14    being mightier than the sword is usually used to demonstrate the triumph
15    of good by means of the written word.  In truth, Mitar Vasiljevic has
16    demonstrated that evil can also have its triumphs by way of the written
17    word.  Using the fear of his victims and a scrap of paper, he bound them
18    to their own demise.  He bound them to a fate he had chosen for them.
19            Your Honour, I just have about two minutes left.  If the Court
20    would wish me to address some questions, I would certainly welcome them at
21    this point.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  You mean you want to save a peroration for the end.
23            MR. GROOME:  Well, you will characterise what it is when I'm
24    finished, I'm sure.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  That's all right, Mr. Groome.  I'm not criticising

 1    you for it.
 2            There are a few matters that I would like to raise.  The first one
 3    is only to clear something up.  You did refer to it during the course of
 4    your address, and I didn't recognise it until it was too late.
 5            The Serb woman who gave evidence of having seen the accused shoot
 6    somebody in the back of his head near the bridge, you will remember that
 7    she had a driver, and she was asked the name of that driver and she said
 8    she didn't want to give it, and as a result of that, as I recall, we said
 9    we would not rely upon her evidence of that incident.
10            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I don't recall the specific colloquy on
11    that point.  I will rely on the Court's recollection.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  My reference is page 1072, but I haven't gone back to
13    check that.  But from the summary of the evidence we've got, that's where
14    it seems to be.  I just wanted to know whether you had some alternative
15    argument in relation to that particular incident.
16            MR. GROOME:  Might I just ask the Court, is the Court inclined to
17    disregard her testimony on that one particular incident or all of it?
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, on that one incident, because she was unable to
19    present the evidence -- well, the name of the person who was with her, for
20    very understandable reasons.
21            MR. GROOME:  Your Honours, the Prosecution doesn't have any
22    alternative, and I will rely on the Court's recollection of what happened
23    with that witness.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  Right.  Well, now, is it the Prosecution case that
25    the accused was never in Uzice hospital with a broken leg during 1992?

 1            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, as I said earlier - and I think I may
 2    very well be haunted until the day I die the answer to that question - all
 3    I can say is what I've said before, Your Honour, is that the Prosecution
 4    does not have the burden of proving every fact, and I realise that there
 5    is still an unsatisfactory answer to whether or not he was in Uzice
 6    hospital.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  No.  But this is very important to one of the
 8    subsidiary facts in relation to this issue of his alibi.  It seems to me
 9    that we have evidence that you cannot challenge about a number of things
10    because you've tried to have them tested and you can't, and very sensibly
11    you said during the course of your address, well, then, we have to rely
12    then upon the evidence of the people who said they saw him at the fire.
13    But I think it's important for a subsidiary issue to know whether the
14    Prosecution is saying he was never in hospital so that Dr. Moljevic, for
15    example, who had to depend upon the hospital records for the date, that
16    nevertheless he was lying and that sort of thing.
17            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, it seems that a couple of things seem
18    quite probable.  After seeing the X-rays from 2001, it's clear that at
19    some point he did break his leg.  He says he broke his leg on two
20    occasions.  You recall that Dr. Raby said that he could only see evidence
21    of one break.
22            It is also probable that if he did break his leg in Visegrad, he
23    at some point would have gone to Uzice hospital.  That is the closest
24    major health care facility to Visegrad.  When he went there, I believe
25    there is significant evidence that it was not on the 14th.  The date that

 1    he in fact did arrive at that hospital I am unable to say.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  That's why I'm trying to get you to an issue.  The
 3    issue, as I see it, is not whether he was there but when he first went
 4    there.  Now, is that the issue which the Prosecution sees?
 5            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  And if that is so, what is the significance of the
 7    discrepancies in that X-ray that was produced by Dr. Moljevic to your
 8    predecessor, Ms. Korner?
 9            MR. GROOME:  The significance of it is that that X-ray which was
10    part of records, the medical records of the person, it seems that there
11    was somebody with a broken leg at Uzice hospital on the 14th of June.
12    There seems to be no question about that.  The question seems to be
13    whether it is this man that's before the Chamber.
14            The discrepancy, or the -- I believe what's now been demonstrated
15    very clearly is that the X-ray of the person that was taken that night
16    that presented themselves with a broken leg, that that person is not the
17    accused.  Although the name "Mitar Vasiljevic" may appear on that X-ray
18    and on the other medical records generated that night, it is not this man
19    who is before the Chamber.
20            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, the next matter you may have dealt with just
21    very recently in your oral submissions, but it's certainly not dealt with
22    anywhere in the written brief.
23            You say that his state of mind at the time that he handed out the
24    safe conduct certificate was to ensure that they were kept there because
25    there was some evil act to be done to them which you have characterised as

 1    murder as a result of his previous association with the Drina River
 2    killing.
 3            Now, is that the whole of your case on that?  Because at some
 4    stage during the course of your final submission, you put up some
 5    submissions that it didn't matter what the crime was going to be, if he is
 6    to be, for example, aiding and abetting it.  I don't think that is the law
 7    myself.
 8            MR. GROOME:  I'm not sure what I said that the Court understood
 9    that way.  I think it's very clear that, not only with the Drina River
10    incident but with the other incidents that we've heard about prior to the
11    14th, that it is clear that his involvement with Milan Lukic is about
12    killing Muslims, and that is why the Prosecution submits that when he
13    intended and took acts to try to facilitate and to try to prepare for the
14    eventual commission of the crime, that he had murder in mind.  I cannot
15    say that he at that stage, or there's no evidence that we have been able
16    to bring before the Chamber that he knew specifically that it would be by
17    fire and it would be on such a large scale, but it is clear from what we
18    know about what happened prior to that day that murder certainly was the
19    intended crime.
20            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  Well, I'm glad that we've got it tied down at
21    last, because I looked in vain for the answer to the question that I posed
22    in that document that was sent to you in advance.
23            Now, obviously you rely upon not just the handing out of the Red
24    Cross certificate.  In your final address, you deal with this in a number
25    of places.  For example, at page -- I'm sorry, paragraph 340, which is on

 1    page 116, you say:  "He selected the victims and took definitive steps
 2    to ..." I think that should read "ensure"  "... they would remain where he
 3    left them while he went to notify Milan Lukic and the others and to make
 4    preparations ..." I think that should read  "... for the intended crime."
 5            Now, where is there any evidence that he went to notify Milan
 6    Lukic?
 7            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I believe common sense and a reasonable
 8    inference would lead us or lead the Chamber to the conclusion that at this
 9    time we know that there is no evidence that these people are there.
10    There's no apparent sign from outside the street that they're there.  Yet
11    within between 45 minutes and an hour and a half later, Milan Lukic and
12    his crew arrive back at the scene.  I believe it is a reasonable inference
13    for the Chamber to draw that evidence that, given the fact that there is
14    no obvious sign, that given the quickness with which he, Milan Lukic,
15    arrives at the scene, that he must have been told that they were there by
16    someone, and I submit that that is Mitar Vasiljevic.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Are we not treading on somewhat dangerous ground when
18    you're asking us, first of all, to draw the inference that he went to
19    notify Lukic, and then a further inference based upon, in part, that
20    inference he therefore knew that Lukic was going to murder them?
21            MR. GROOME:  No, Your Honour.  I would disagree with the Chamber.
22    I think it's --
23            JUDGE HUNT:  It is a question, that's all.
24            MR. GROOME:  I believe it's a perfectly reasonable inference.
25    Certainly it would be a stronger influence if Milan Lukic showed up five

 1    minutes after he left.  But 45 minutes is the earliest estimate, is I
 2    believe a very strong inference, given that Milan Lukic was not in that
 3    area at that time, the fact that he came not alone but with his group, and
 4    I believe that it is quite a reasonable inference to draw from that fact.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  I think we might take the break there, but I'll just
 6    tell you what I want to ask you about when you return so that you've got
 7    some opportunity to consider it.
 8            That document which we sent to you, which I confess to having been
 9    the author of mainly, is not as happily expressed as it could have been.
10    We have asked you to provide the appropriate definition of the crimes of,
11    amongst other things, violence to life and person, and then in square
12    brackets it says:  "[There appears to be no jurisprudence concerning this
13    crime in either of the Tribunals.]"  Perhaps the words in square brackets
14    should have rung a warning bell.
15            What we're after is this:  "Violence to life and person" comes
16    from Common Article 3 of the various Geneva Conventions.  The Appeals
17    Chamber of this Tribunal has held that that constitutes customary law upon
18    which there can be based a charge of individual criminal responsibility,
19    but in order to do so, it has to also be demonstrated that at the time
20    these crimes are alleged to have been committed there was a proper
21    definition of that crime and that there is -- obviously the only way of
22    demonstrating that is by some form of state practice.
23            Now, the Blaskic case to which you've referred us unfortunately
24    gives us not any clue at all where they got that definition from, and
25    really in order to supply an answer to that question we were seeking some

 1    assistance.  You may not be able to give me the answer when we return, but
 2    I want you to think about it and whether you -- if you need time to look,
 3    we'd be very happy to give it to you.
 4            What we need to know, because we've looked and can't find any
 5    evidence of state practice at the relevant time, 1992, which would support
 6    that statement in the Blaskic decision that that was a proper definition
 7    of the crime.  And I'm sorry that I didn't express it very well.  You have
 8    to excuse me.  I'm not an international lawyer, and perhaps I hadn't quite
 9    understood what it was I was asked to ask, but that's what we're after.
10    Now, you may not be able to find it in the next 20 minutes, but you may be
11    able to give us some idea on whether you think that you'll be able to find
12    something, because we really do need some assistance.
13            In the end, it may prove to be unnecessary because you've got
14    murder and you've got inhumane treatment and you've got cruel treatment
15    and you've got inhumane conduct, which would probably cover them all
16    anyway, but if you want us to consider that as a crime which at the time
17    of these offences did constitute a basis for individual criminal
18    responsibility under customary law, we want some assistance.
19            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
20            JUDGE HUNT:  Okay.  We'll take a break now until five past.  But
21    before we go, Mr. Domazet, we have found at last a window of opportunity,
22    to use a phrase I don't like, on Friday afternoon at 3.00.  We can have a
23    courtroom when we can continue.  So I don't want you to feel under any
24    pressure to finish by tonight.  But how long do you think you will be in
25    your address?

 1            MR. DOMAZET:  Your Honour, it is very difficult --
 2            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for the counsel, please.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  Microphone.
 4            MR. DOMAZET:  Your Honour, it is very difficult for me to say now,
 5    but I think about three hours in total.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, if we start --
 7            MR. DOMAZET:  It would be --
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm sorry.
 9            MR. DOMAZET:  -- two and a half, but really I'm not sure at this
10    moment.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, we'll start with you tonight and then we'll
12    have to resume again at 3.00 on Friday.  I'm sorry for the break.  The
13    fire in the kitchen yesterday has caused untold problems with the
14    scheduling, and it's only because there is a trial which will not be
15    proceeding because of the illness of one of the Judges that we've got this
16    opportunity.  But I'd like to be able to finish it this week if only for
17    your convenience.
18            All right.  Well, ten past, ten past six.
19                          --- Recess taken at 5.50 p.m.
20                          --- On resuming at 6.11 p.m.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, Mr. Groome, have you got any idea when you
22    might be able to tell us the answer to our problem?
23            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I apologise for not having recognised
24    exactly what the Chamber was seeking.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  That's perfectly all right.  It was my fault.  I

 1    accept that entirely.
 2            MR. GROOME:  I would ask for a reasonable period of time with
 3    which to have our experts in international law look at it.  The Chamber
 4    has said that it has not found state practice.  I don't expect that we
 5    will have any greater luck, but perhaps there might be some alternative
 6    arguments that the Office of the Prosecutor would like to make.  If we
 7    could have a reasonable period of time to submit something.  If, during
 8    the course of that, it becomes clear that there is no reasonable arguments
 9    to be made, we would notify the Chamber of that as soon as possible.  We
10    would not want to delay the work of the Chamber.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, I won't put a limit on it at this stage, but I
12    would hope that sometime next week you can let us know how long you'll
13    need.
14            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour, certainly.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  And then when you've done that, then we'll certainly
16    put a time limit on and then give Mr. Domazet the right to respond.
17            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Okay.  Thank you.
19            Yes, Judge Janu has a question.
20            JUDGE JANU:  I would like to know what is the position of the
21    Prosecution as to the relation of the paramilitary group of Milan Lukic to
22    the official authorities, army or police or ...
23            MR. GROOME:  Just a second, Your Honour.
24            JUDGE JANU:  And another question:  From reading your closing
25    arguments, under page 30, paragraph 84, it seems that the position of the

 1    Prosecution is that the accused participated in the detention of the
 2    Muslims who were later escorted to the Drina River.  On what evidence does
 3    the Prosecution base its position?
 4            MR. GROOME:  Judge Janu, regarding your first question, the
 5    relationship between Milan Lukic's group and the official government as it
 6    existed in Visegrad, it's clear that at this period of time the government
 7    in Visegrad was in a state of flux.  The police departments had separated
 8    and the SDS had taken control of certain governmental institutions.  We
 9    know from Mr. Vasiljevic that he said that they were working with the
10    police, and he said that a number of times in his testimony.  I think
11    there's also some evidence that we have from other witnesses that show
12    that also to be true, that -- namely, I think the most significant piece
13    of evidence that I can think of that comes to mind most immediately is
14    that as the men are being brought from Bikavac to the Vilina Vlas Hotel,
15    they actually are stopped at a checkpoint, and we've heard testimony from
16    various sources that the purpose of the checkpoint was to check
17    identification cards and control who was coming and going.  Not only did
18    they allow Milan Lukic to travel through that checkpoint with these
19    people, but he actually bragged to them that -- he had called them
20    balijas, that derogatory term for Muslim.  So he actually bragged to them
21    that he had captured these Muslims and they were allowed to proceed
22    through the checkpoint.
23            The Prosecution would also submit that the Vilina Vlas wasn't some
24    hideaway.  It was a very open and public place.  The accused testified
25    that is where some of the JNA actually stayed during the course of their

 1    time in Visegrad.  So I would also submit to the Chamber that his presence
 2    in Visegrad was so open, so public, and his movements about the city so
 3    open and public that the reasonable inference to be drawn from that is
 4    that if he wasn't working directly for the politicians or the police, that
 5    they at least acquiesced or permitted him to carry on what he was doing.
 6            If you recall, I believe it was the witness Zivorad Savic who
 7    testified to seeing approximately 100 or so bodies in the immediate
 8    downtown area.  So I think it would have been very clear to the legitimate
 9    authorities that there was this paramilitary group operating and they
10    would have been aware of what was transpiring.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  His evidence, if I may point out, is very unclear as
12    to when he saw that.  He said it could have been in June, it could have
13    been July.
14            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm not quite sure if that supports your case,
16    though.
17            MR. GROOME:  I believe there's other evidence.  Unfortunately, I
18    wouldn't be able to recite it right this minute, but I believe there are
19    other witnesses who did testify about there being obvious signs, certainly
20    not as dramatic as the hundred bodies, but did see obvious signs of
21    violence around the time of early June.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm sorry to interrupt.
23            MR. GROOME:  Now, your second question regarding paragraph 84.  It
24    is the Prosecution's position that from the time that these men were
25    brought in to the lobby of the hotel, that Mr. Vasiljevic participated in

 1    their detention.  We heard about Milan Lukic going behind the reception
 2    area and looking for keys, and I think that it is quite reasonable to
 3    conclude that part of the reason Milan Lukic was able to turn his back on
 4    these people he had captured and to spend some time looking for keys was
 5    he knew that the person on the other side of the counter, Mitar
 6    Vasiljevic, would keep an eye on his captives.
 7            When the Prosecution uses the word "detention," it also includes
 8    the period of time when the men were transported down to the Drina River
 9    and the period from getting out of the car further down.  I think it's
10    important for the Chamber to consider that Milan Lukic is driving the car,
11    Mitar Vasiljevic is in the passenger, front passenger seat, and the
12    captives are in the back and they're not handcuffed in any way; that while
13    Mitar -- obviously Milan Lukic had his hands on the wheel, was unable to
14    watch them or guard them, that the only person who would have been able to
15    prevent them from trying to escape or prevent them from trying to overcome
16    Milan Lukic driving the car was Mitar Vasiljevic, sitting in the front
17    passenger seat with his gun.  So that is what the Prosecution means when
18    it says "the detention."
19            JUDGE JANU:  Okay.  I just -- I was just thinking that you tried
20    to say - we understood it this way - that Mitar Vasiljevic was present
21    from the beginning --
22            MR. GROOME:  No.
23            JUDGE JANU:  -- when the freedom of those people was limited, when
24    they were factually captured.
25            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  From the period --

 1            JUDGE JANU:  Not from the beginning.
 2            MR. GROOME:  Not from the beginning.
 3            JUDGE JANU:  From the hotel.
 4            MR. GROOME:  From the hotel lobby forward.
 5            JUDGE JANU:  Yes.  Okay.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Now you can give us your peroration, Mr. Groome.
 7            MR. GROOME:  If the Chamber will indulge me.
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  We'll give you the two minutes you promised.
 9            MR. GROOME:  Your Honours, the Prosecution has recommended a
10    sentence of no less than 25 years' imprisonment if the accused is
11    convicted of the crimes concerning his participation in the Drina River
12    killings.  The Prosecution has recommended a sentence of life imprisonment
13    if you find him guilty of the Pionirska Street fire.
14            To put the Pionirska Street fire into perspective, we engaged in a
15    simple exercise of arithmetic.  Assuming that the people who died that
16    night would have lived to the approximate age of 70, we subtracted the age
17    of each victim to calculate the approximate number of years of human life
18    this man and his accomplices were responsible for taking on that night.
19    Not accounting the people for whose ages we do not know, if you add up all
20    those years, it amounts to over 2.000 years of human life.  A staggering
21    figure.
22            I want to conclude by describing for you a story, a true story
23    that illustrates the reality of what happened on Pionirska Street.  Last
24    June, the Office of the Prosecutor returned to the town of Visegrad to
25    take some of the pictures that were used during the course of the trial.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  I hope you're not going to go outside the evidence in
 2    this story.
 3            MR. GROOME:  It would be just to illustrate a point, Your Honour.
 4    I don't intend --
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  But we cannot take into account anything that is not
 6    in evidence.
 7            MR. GROOME:  I'm certainly not suggesting that anything that I'm
 8    about to say is evidence.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Very well.
10            MR. GROOME:  We were accompanied on that trip with VG13 to show us
11    the places where the crimes occurred.  SFOR, concerned about security,
12    accompanied us.  When we arrived in front of the Vuk Karadzic school, we
13    left the van and walked towards the Omeragic house.  And after spending
14    some minutes there, all of a sudden VG13 ran from the safety of the SFOR
15    soldiers back towards the street between the two Memic houses.  A few of
16    us and the interpreter were able to coax her into the van we were riding
17    in.  Visibly distraught, she pulled a balaclava that SFOR had provided off
18    her face, and she sat in the van with tears running down her face, saying,
19    "I could see the flames, I could hear the people screaming, I could smell
20    the smoke."
21            Her flashback perhaps is not as imagined as we might think, for,
22    in a way, the fire on Pionirska Street still burns.  The hot embers of
23    nationalism that have made that crime which this man committed possible,
24    perhaps even acceptable in the eyes of some, is still there, still
25    smouldering, and all of the water in the Drina cannot put it out.  There is

 1    only one thing powerful enough to extinguish these smouldering embers, and
 2    that is justice, a just verdict in this case, a verdict required by the
 3    evidence in this case; a verdict of guilty.
 4            Thank you, Your Honours.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, I wouldn't like that little illustration
 6    you gave to go unremarked upon.  I said we didn't want to go outside the
 7    evidence.  Now, you could only have put that to us in order to put an
 8    emotional issue for us to consider about the fires are still burning.  It
 9    is not really proper advocacy, if I may say so.  You're not the first from
10    the Office of the Prosecutor who has done this, and I wonder if there's
11    some sort of belief up there that final addresses can be based upon
12    material outside the evidence in the case, because it can't be.
13            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I apologise if the Court sees it as
14    inappropriate comment.  I certainly do not expect or ever thought that the
15    Court would be -- the Court's judgement would be affected by emotional
16    arguments.  I just put it to the Chamber to illustrate the importance of
17    the Chamber's work in particular and individual cases such as this, that
18    it is a just verdict in this case that is something that is -- or is one
19    of the only things that can prevent something like this from happening
20    again.  Whatever the Chamber ultimately decides is a just verdict is
21    obviously for the Chamber and the Chamber alone, and again, I apologise if
22    the Court feels that what I have just said is inappropriate.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm sorry to say that I do think it is inappropriate,
24    and as far as I'm concerned, I will disregard what you said.
25            Mr. Domazet.
 1                          [Defence Closing Statement]
 2            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honours, I shall try not to
 3    repeat what has already been stated in the Defence closing brief, and I
 4    shall not, at least for now, speak of matters relating to the history and
 5    the background leading up to the time relevant for this indictment,
 6    because this has not been referred to by Mr. Groome today, and he and I
 7    have both referred to it in our final briefs.  Of course, if any questions
 8    are put about these matters, I will answer them.  I will try to focus in
 9    my closing argument on the key issues referred to today in Mr. Groome's
10    closing argument.
11            First of all, I shall begin with a contested issue that has been
12    referred to today, that has been considered in both briefs.  The issue in
13    question is whether Mitar Vasiljevic was a member of Milan Lukic's group,
14    which was a paramilitary formation.  It was not a military formation that
15    was legal.
16            In the opinion of the Defence, it is very important to interpret
17    correctly the evidence referred to today, and this primarily refers to
18    events in the village of Musici in late May 1992; the Drina River incident
19    of the 7th of June, 1992; and the kum relationship obtaining between the
20    Lukic and Vasiljevic families, which has also been mentioned as one of the
21    reasons for the alleged membership of the accused Mitar Vasiljevic in this
22    paramilitary formation.
23            As I have seen in the Prosecution final brief, the Prosecutor
24    accepts the fact that Milan Lukic arrived with a group of 10 to 15 men
25    from Obrenovac or in general from Serbia and that this was sometime in

 1    mid-May 1992, this being the time when his activities began.  In the view
 2    of the Defence, the evidence presented before the Court shows that this
 3    paramilitary activity on the part of Milan Lukic and others began around
 4    the 20th of May, 1992, when the Uzice Corps of the then-Yugoslav People's
 5    Army, or the JNA, left the area of Visegrad and withdrew to Uzice.
 6            Although when evaluating the role of the Uzice Corps during the
 7    time it was in Visegrad the position of the Prosecution differs greatly
 8    from the position of the Defence - and this is something I will not go
 9    into now because it's in the written brief - it is evident that in the
10    period leading up to the withdrawal of this military unit there were no
11    significant incidents and life in Visegrad was almost normal.  Of course,
12    in the context of the prevailing circumstances, that is, the fact that
13    there were a conflict between two sides all over Bosnia and Herzegovina.
14            Milan Lukic turned up after several years of absence from
15    Visegrad, and according to the evidence on record and witness statements,
16    he spent a few years working abroad.  The reason for his arrival and the
17    arrival of his group in the formation that existed is difficult to fathom,
18    especially if we consider that they obviously committed a large number of
19    serious criminal offences, that he and his group were very well-armed and
20    equipped, and according to witnesses, they all had camouflage uniforms,
21    some of which, such as that of Milan Lukic, were blue camouflage uniforms
22    which both then and now are uniforms worn by the police.  Others had
23    ordinary military-style camouflage uniforms where the prevalent colour was
24    brown or yellow.
25            This is characteristic because, at that time, these uniforms were

 1    not commonly used either in the former JNA, whose reservists had only what
 2    is here referred to as SMB or olive-grey uniforms.  The three letters SMB
 3    stand for "olive-grey" colour.  This was a uniform of a light colour, pale
 4    green or olive-grey.  Many reservists kept such uniforms at home because
 5    that was how it was done in the former Yugoslavia, so that when they were
 6    called up for military exercises, they could go to the exercises with
 7    these uniforms, and also they would put them on if they were called up.
 8    Everybody had such a uniform.
 9            Let me remind you that Witness VG14 confirmed on the 7th of June,
10    1992, in Bikavac, Milan Lukic, when searching his home, found such a
11    uniform and took it with him.  Mitar Vasiljevic also had this kind of
12    uniform at home as did many reservists.  I'm saying this precisely because
13    this is only one of the points indicating that Mitar Vasiljevic was never
14    a member of Milan Lukic's paramilitary unit.
15            I think there is no dispute about the fact and that most
16    witnesses, when speaking of Mitar Vasiljevic's clothing, said they saw him
17    either in a SMB olive-grey uniform or in civilian clothes, in a dark suit
18    or something else, but nobody ever said that he had either a blue
19    camouflage uniform or the other kind of camouflage uniform, the military
20    one, which was standard equipment in Milan Lukic's unit.
21            Not only was Milan Lukic's group well-armed, but Milan Lukic
22    evidently did not want anyone from Visegrad to be a member of his group,
23    and it is evident from the testimonies of witnesses that members of his
24    unit were mostly young people.  Mitar Vasiljevic is 13 years older than
25    Milan Lukic.  They had nothing in common.  They had nothing in common in

 1    view of their previous lifestyles.  They did not socialise because when
 2    Mitar Vasiljevic was still in school, Milan Lukic was already working.
 3    When -- when he left Visegrad, there was no further contact between them.
 4            The existence of the kum relationship between their families --
 5    when I say "their families," I am referring not only to Mitar Vasiljevic's
 6    immediately family, his wife and children, or to Milan Lukic's wife and
 7    children, but to all the Vasiljevic family and all the Lukic family.  The
 8    kum relationship goes back over a hundred years.  What this relationship
 9    means in that environment was explained by many witnesses, including Mitar
10    Vasiljevic himself, his wife Milojka.  And regardless of the fact that the
11    existence of the kum relationship means that there is a kind of special
12    relationship between these people, this cannot be seen as the kind of
13    relationship that would have led to Mitar Vasiljevic joining this group
14    because he was in Musici in late May 1992 with Lukic or in the other event
15    of the 7th of June, 1992.
16            With regard to the event in the village of Musici in late May
17    1992, it is quite correct, and Mitar Vasiljevic, when making his voluntary
18    statement to the investigators said this, he really was in Musici on one
19    occasion with Milan Lukic.  He was in uniform, and he was armed on that
20    occasion.
21            This was the time when he was in Prelovo.  He was in Prelovo until
22    the time he was detained and transferred to Uzamnica, which was used as a
23    prison.  His stay in Prelovo as a reservist in the military kitchen in
24    Prelovo actually coincided with this period until late May or early June.
25    This was the reason he was in uniform and armed when he came to Musici,

 1    because he took the opportunity, as he usually did in that period, to
 2    leave Prelovo, in the evening hours when he was off duty, to go to
 3    Visegrad and come back in the morning.  Or if a van with the driver
 4    Vojinovic went to get supplies, he would take the opportunity to go to
 5    Visegrad and come back.  He visited his home in Visegrad in this way on
 6    numerous occasions, as did other witnesses who were in Prelovo in the
 7    military kitchen at that time.  And due to circumstances, the only time
 8    when Milan Lukic came by and gave him a lift in his own vehicle, this
 9    event occurred and this is the reason why Vasiljevic has to explain how he
10    came to be in Lukic's vehicle and to have to say whether this proves that
11    he was in that unit.
12            He also testified before the Court that that was the only reason
13    why he had gone with Milan Lukic.  He furthermore stated that he did not
14    know that Milan Lukic would make a stop along the way, including Musici,
15    which is on the way from Prelovo to Visegrad.  So it was not that they
16    turned to Musici.  They passed through the village of Musici.  But this is
17    where they stopped.  And he went to the houses of VG55 and VG59.
18            What the Prosecutor indicated in his closing arguments was not
19    supported by any witnesses, that is, that Milan Lukic directed him to this
20    house.  Mitar Vasiljevic told the Court that he personally knew that VG55
21    was a member of the reserve police force.  He was there for a reserve
22    police officer.  And even if he had been at home, even if he were at home,
23    he never said that to Milan Lukic nor would he have ever said that to
24    anyone.
25            Let me remind the Court that the event took place in late May.  At

 1    that time, he had no reasons to doubt Milan Lukic in any way and fear that
 2    Milan Lukic would do anything to harm the individuals in question.
 3            According to witness testimonies, the conversation which took
 4    place, which was corroborated by VG55 and 59, the subject of the
 5    conversation was whether there were any weapons there or not, whether
 6    anyone had opened fire on the police which had passed by.  And Milan
 7    warned them that such a thing should never repeat itself and that nobody
 8    risked any harm.
 9            It is true that something did occur in the village on the
10    following day.  However, as far as Mitar Vasiljevic is concerned, the
11    event itself has nothing to do with him, because on the said day and on
12    the following day, he was never again with this group in the village of
13    Musici.  And as Mr. Groome indicated today, this was indeed supported and
14    accepted by witnesses VG55 and VG59, which he took as an example of fair
15    testimony, correct testimony when he spoke about the fact that those
16    witnesses could have falsely accused Mitar but they didn't.  This,
17    however, doesn't mean that other witnesses whose testimony -- testimonies
18    I will address later in my closing arguments did not act differently.
19            The interpretation of the story, that is that Mitar Vasiljevic was
20    standing by the door as a guard, is simply an assumption which lacks
21    foundation in facts.  Milan Lukic was the one who spoke to the people in
22    the house.  He wanted other people also to come to the house so that he
23    might talk to them as well.
24            The fact that Mitar Vasiljevic did not want to enter the house was
25    explained by him.  He stated that he didn't think that his presence inside

 1    the house was necessary, that he simply remained standing there.  And as
 2    to the doubt which had been expressed regarding the presence of anyone in
 3    the house or in the attic, he personally asked the witness whether this
 4    was correct or not, and when the witness said that it was not, he told
 5    Milan Lukic that that was true, that the man was telling the truth.  Maybe
 6    it was in this way that he wanted to avoid any uncomfortable situation or
 7    Milan Lukic searching the house.  It is true that he found himself in a
 8    situation that he perhaps didn't want to find himself in because he knew
 9    these people personally, and these people knew him very well too.
10            His presence in the village on the said night only involved these
11    facts.  He left the village without knowing that what transpired later on
12    and what was discussed later on by witnesses.  VG55 and VG59 didn't know
13    the fact that other villagers remained in the house and that other members
14    of Milan Lukic's paramilitary unit robbed the house in the meantime.
15            This, I believe, is reproached to Mitar Vasiljevic in the
16    Prosecutor's final brief.  It is alleged he should have noticed that and
17    that he should have been aware of that fact and that that would prove his
18    participation in the events.  However, that is not what follows from the
19    evidence, because this was not known by the witnesses who were at the
20    house at that time, in the house where Milan Lukic was and at whose door
21    Mitar Vasiljevic stood.
22            They left the place in their vehicle as they had left Prelovo
23    earlier on, and nothing happened on that evening, nothing that would have
24    caused Mitar Vasiljevic to believe that anything untoward would happen the
25    following day.  However, the fact that he appeared in the village of

 1    Musici on that night with Milan Lukic can by no means constitute evidence
 2    as to his membership in his paramilitary formation, because at that time,
 3    and that is something which was testified by Defence witnesses such as
 4    Vojinovic, Lindo, Simic, who stated that throughout that period of time
 5    they were at the military kitchen and that Mitar Vasiljevic was also
 6    present at all times in the military kitchen except on those occasions
 7    when he went home to see his family or when he went to Visegrad to get the
 8    supplies.
 9            This was one such occasion.  He took the opportunity of having
10    transport home, and he happened by chance to be in the village of Musici,
11    which is, I have to state once again, situated on the very road leading
12    from Prelovo to Visegrad to the Vasiljevic house which is situated on the
13    same road in the outskirts of Visegrad.  Therefore, it is our submission,
14    Your Honours, that Mitar Vasiljevic's presence there, which was not in
15    itself disputed by the Defence, cannot constitute evidence about his
16    membership in Milan Lukic's group.
17            Let me now move to the second event which is interpreted once
18    again as evidence of his membership in Milan Lukic's group, namely the
19    Drina River incident which took place on the 7th of June, 1992.
20            There was a lot of talk in the closing arguments that we heard
21    today about the fact that Mitar Vasiljevic did not happen to be at the
22    hotel accidentally.  Assertions would made that the hotel was Milan
23    Lukic's base and that the reasons for that was not Pecikoza's story or
24    he's going to take the -- his uniform which was in the hotel but that he
25    was there to help out Milan Lukic.

 1            Let me now focus on certain details which dispute the assumption
 2    made by the Prosecution.  Had that been one of -- that that was one of the
 3    bases of Milan Lukic we can perhaps accept as true because there have been
 4    several cases detention of various people in the hotel even before that.
 5    The hotel was not used as a hotel during that period of time.
 6            However, let me remind you of the fact that Milan Lukic came to
 7    the hotel with two of his soldiers and seven Muslims.  He was approached
 8    first of all by an individual wearing camouflage uniform, who told him,
 9    "This stupid person has released your detainees," referring to Susnjar,
10    who was an employee of the hotel, who worked at the hotel.  He wanted
11    explanation from Susnjar, and he allegedly asked Susnjar for the keys to
12    one of the rooms.
13            It is also alleged that Mitar Vasiljevic was standing in the lobby
14    near the passage leading to the swimming pool, which was explained by
15    Witness VG42.  Nobody asked him anything.  Nobody requested anything from
16    him.  That Mitar Vasiljevic -- it is alleged that Mitar Vasiljevic was
17    there as a member of the group, that he guarded the prisoners.  Of course,
18    we believe that it would have been normal for Milan Lukic to address him
19    first of all and to talk to him before anyone else, especially in view of
20    the fact that their kum relationship is being so emphasised.  But it is
21    because of the way the events unfolded and because of the way this
22    conversation proceeded, it is obvious that Mitar Vasiljevic had nothing to
23    do with what happened.  It is our submission that he had nothing to do
24    with the release of the detainees, the release in respect of which
25    explanation had been asked from Susnjar, and that he talked to one of the

 1    members of this group.
 2            Explanation was given that the people had been detained for
 3    several days and that Milan was not there and that that was the reason why
 4    the individuals were released.  Milan Lukic, it follows from the evidence,
 5    was absent from the Vilina Vlas Hotel for several days.  It is therefore
 6    not credible that Mitar Vasiljevic should have known that, that he should
 7    have come there without knowing that Milan Lukic was there or not.
 8            Let me remind you of the fact that the day before that, Mitar
 9    Vasiljevic attended the funeral of his cousin in the village of Vardiste,
10    together with his wife, which event occurred on a Saturday, which was the
11    6th of June, that he had already visited the family to express his
12    condolences, which took place after his release from prison.
13            Mr. Groome, in his argument, used this particular fact to allege
14    that it would not have been logical for Mitar Vasiljevic to do so the day
15    before he started his cleaning duties, that is, that it would not have
16    been logical for him to go to the Vilina Vlas Hotel with Stanko Pecikoza
17    to look for Milan Lukic.  It is not true that he was supposed to start
18    cleaning the city on that day.  He had already started with his cleaning
19    duties.  They began on the day of his release from prison and not on that
20    particular day.  It was not on that particular day that he was released
21    from prison, because that would have been the 6th or the 7th of June, and
22    you can find, Your Honours, this in our brief.  He was released from
23    prison on or about the 3rd of June, maybe even a day before that date,
24    because obviously this release was linked to his learning about his
25    cousin's death.  And in view of the fact that he remained two or three

 1    days in prison only, that could have only taken place at the very
 2    beginning of June, that is, on the 1st, the 2nd, or the 3rd of June.
 3            Prior to the funeral, he had gone to Vardiste on one occasion, and
 4    then on the 6th of June, on Saturday, he went to the funeral.  The event
 5    in question took place on the 7th of June.
 6            The allegation that nobody spoke to Mitar Vasiljevic at the
 7    reception of the Vilina Vlas Hotel -- the fact - excuse me - the fact that
 8    nobody spoke to Mitar Vasiljevic at the reception of the Vilina Vlas Hotel
 9    follows from the evidence given by VG14 and VG32.  They told the Court
10    that he had stayed there, that he didn't say a word throughout that period
11    of time, whilst Milan Lukic was being very angry at Susnjar.  He was
12    looking for the keys, and he was coming and going, and eventually he
13    ordered everyone to go back and to take the car and to return to where
14    they had come from.  That is, the fact that Mitar Vasiljevic happened to
15    be, on the 7th of June, in this manner, that he happened to be there on
16    that particular day, can by no means constitute evidence of his membership
17    in Milan Lukic's unit, especially in view of the submission made by
18    Mr. Groome today that it is absolutely unacceptable that he came to the
19    hotel for the reason that he had stated.  It is my submission, Your
20    Honour, that what he said is correct and true.
21            Stanko Pecikoza was indeed a highly ranking Serb official within
22    the SDS party, as was stated by the Prosecutor today, but he was also a
23    man who protected Muslims.  He was also a very good friend of Mitar
24    Vasiljevic.  Mitar Vasiljevic even worked at his place - he made some
25    woodwork in his house - and he had no reason to refuse his request, that

 1    is, when he wanted to go and see -- go and find Milan Lukic.  Although at
 2    first sight it may seem unnecessary or illogical, however, the truth is
 3    that he simply did not refuse that request.  And the uniform was a
 4    subsidiary issue, and he believed that it would be a good opportunity for
 5    him to take the uniform from the hotel.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, we'll resume again at 3.00 on Friday.  I
 7    don't know which courtroom we'll be in, but you'll be notified.  3.  Well,
 8    let's hope that it's been repaired from the fire.  But when you do resume,
 9    Mr. Domazet, please remember:  We have read your submissions.  We don't
10    want the evidence simply repeated.  You're here to argue further matters
11    and to respond to Mr. Groome's arguments, but we don't want you just
12    simply to tell us what's already in the document, which we've read.
13            3.00 on Friday.
14                          --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at 7.04 p.m.,
15                          to be reconvened on Friday, the 8th day of March,
16                          2002, at 3.00 p.m.
