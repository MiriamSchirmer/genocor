          3                 [Initial appearance]
          4                 --- Upon commencing at 10.38 a.m.
          5            JUDGE HUNT:  Call the case, please.
          6            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] This is case
          7  IT-98-32-I.  The Prosecutor against Mitar Vasiljevic.
          8            JUDGE HUNT:  Appearances.
          9            MS. KORNER:  Joanne Korner.  I represent the
         10  Prosecution, with the assistance of co-counsel,
         11  Ms. Nancy Paterson, and case manager Diane Boles.
         12            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  For the accused?
         13  Are you appearing for the accused?
         14            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for the Judge,
         15  please.
         16            MR. PRODANOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour,
         17  I am Slavisa Prodanovic.  I am legal counsel today for
         18  the accused Vasiljevic.
         19            JUDGE HUNT:  Have you had a chance to discuss
         20  this matter with your client yet?
         21            MR. PRODANOVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your
         22  Honour.  I did have an opportunity of discussing it
         23  with my client yesterday and today, and he is aware of
         24  the procedure.
         25            JUDGE HUNT:  And is he aware of the nature of

          1  the allegations made against him?
          2            MR. PRODANOVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your
          3  Honour.  Yes, he is aware, and he is also aware of the
          4  plea he is supposed to enter.  And we wish to suggest
          5  to the Court not to have the factual part of the
          6  indictment read, only to have the accused enter his
          7  pleas.
          8            JUDGE HUNT:  I am grateful to hear that.  But
          9  he is ready to enter a plea today, is he?
         10            MR. PRODANOVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your
         11  Honour.  Yes.
         12            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Before we actually
         13  take the pleas, I should ask the accused:  Are you able
         14  to hear the proceedings in a language which you
         15  understand?  Are you able to hear the proceedings in a
         16  language which you understand?
         17            THE ACCUSED:  Yes.
         18            JUDGE HUNT:  What is your full name?
         19            THE ACCUSED:  Mitar Vasiljevic.
         20            JUDGE HUNT:  And what is the date upon which
         21  you believe you were born?
         22            THE ACCUSED:  The 25th of August, 1954.
         23            JUDGE HUNT:  And what is the address at which
         24  you resided before you were arrested?
         25            THE ACCUSED:  Vojvode Stepe 140, Visegrad.

          1            JUDGE HUNT:  And you are now ready to enter
          2  pleas to the charges against you in the indictment?
          3            THE ACCUSED:  Yes.
          4            JUDGE HUNT:  I propose to read out to you
          5  just the charge, and then I will ask you:  How do you
          6  plead to that charge, guilty or not guilty?  Your
          7  answer in each case should be "guilty" or "not guilty,"
          8  as the case may be.
          9            The first count against you is a charge of
         10  extermination, being a crime against humanity.  How do

         12            THE ACCUSED:  Not guilty.

         15  as a crime against humanity.  How do you plead, guilty
         16  or not guilty?

         23  charge of murder, as a violation of the laws or customs
         24  of war.  Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
         25            THE ACCUSED:  Not guilty.

         19            JUDGE HUNT:  Sit down, please, sir.
         20            The Registrar will be instructed to fix a
         21  date for trial, when appropriate.  And the accused is
         22  remanded in custody until further order.
         23            Is there any matter which the Prosecution
         24  wishes to raise at this stage, Ms. Korner?
         25            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, just to say this:

          1  We are in a position to make immediate disclosure of
          2  the Rule 47 supporting material, both in English and in
          3  B/C/S.  But, as I understand the matter, Defence
          4  counsel will not be instructed or may not be instructed
          5  by his client, and so it may well be that for the
          6  moment we'd better, as it were, hang onto it.
          7            Can I just mention one other matter?
          8            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.
          9            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, we filed a motion
         10  for protective measures.  We were unaware, at the time
         11  that we filed the motion, that Your Honour had issued a
         12  scheduling order in respect of another matter, of which
         13  Your Honour is seized, effectively asking for
         14  clarification of the order that was dealt with in that
         15  case.  So we will re-examine the motion that we filed,
         16  in the light of the order that Your Honour has made.
         17            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, I am grateful to that.
         18  There is another matter which you should consider, and
         19  that is the definition of the public includes various
         20  persons other than the Judges of the Tribunal and the
         21  staff of the Registry.
         22            Now, that may be interpreted as a term of
         23  art, which means those people who work in the Registry,
         24  rather than the staff of the Registrar, who also work
         25  in Chambers.  So at the moment you are denying us the

          1  opportunity of showing our own legal officers and
          2  secretaries the material that we have to deal with.
          3            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, I am very grateful
          4  for that.  We will reconsider that matter as well.
          5            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.  This is a new form, this
          6  one, so far as I am aware, and it does need a little
          7  bit of cleaning up, I think.
          8            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, I'll make sure that
          9  the appropriate steps are taken.
         10            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Mr. Prodanovic, do
         11  you want to raise any matter at this stage?
         12            MR. PRODANOVIC:  I have nothing special to
         13  add, Your Honour.  It is true that I shall no longer
         14  appear as Defence counsel in this case, because I am
         15  busy with another case.  However, the accused is
         16  quickly going to find a new attorney and all
         17  communication will go through him.  Thank you.
         18            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, I am grateful to you for
         19  telling us this.  You might enforce this with your
         20  client, however, that the sooner he does obtain Defence
         21  counsel, the sooner he will find out what this is all
         22  about, by the material which the Prosecution will
         23  provide.
         24            It is necessary, of course, to notify the
         25  Registry, or the Defence counsel unit anyway, so that

          1  the Prosecution are aware of to whom the material
          2  should be sent.  So will you make sure, before you
          3  leave the case, that you explain to your client, your
          4  current client, the importance of moving quickly.
          5            Well, that's all.  We'll adjourn.
          6            --- Hearing adjourned at 10.50 a.m. sine die
