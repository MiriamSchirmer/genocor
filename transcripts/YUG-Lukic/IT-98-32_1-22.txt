 7            THE REGISTRAR:  Case Number IT-98-32-T, the Prosecutor versus
 8    Mitar Vasiljevic.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet.
10            MR. DOMAZET:  Thank you, Your Honour.
11                          WITNESS:  WITNESS VG38 [Resumed]
12                          Cross-examined by Mr. Domazet: [Continued]
13       Q.   Witness, when you spoke about the event which preceded the
14    transfer of those people to the house which was burned down, you said that
15    four individuals whom you named arrived and that all four of them had
16    flashlights in their hands; is that correct?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   Could you please explain to us what kind of flashlights they were,
19    the hand-held long ones or the square short ones?  Were you able to
20    observe the kind of flashlights they were wearing?
21       A.   Yes.  They were carrying military flashlights, round in shape and
22    rather large.
23       Q.   When you say they were round, what exactly do you have in mind?
24       A.   That they were round and not square, as you said.  I don't know
25    how you would explain that.

 1       Q.   Am I to understand that those flashlights were some 10 or 15
 2    centimetres long, where the actual light and battery is behind the bulb?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   So they were lighting the area between the two houses with those
 5    flashlights?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   And Memic house, where you were on that night, did have lights on;
 8    is that correct?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   However, the house which you indicated as being the house where
11    people, including yourself, were eventually taken to, the Omeragic house,
12    was not lit at all except for the light coming from those flashlights; is
13    that correct?
14       A.   Yes.  On that night, the house -- that house was not lit.
15       Q.   Do you remember the room in question, in particular the door of
16    that room?  Was there any door, and if "yes," what kind of door was it?
17       A.   There was a door.  However, I was unable to observe what kind of
18    door it was because of the dark.  I didn't pay much attention to the door.
19       Q.   You approximated for us.  You said that the room was eight by
20    eight metres large.  Were you able to have a good look at the room and be
21    certain as to its size?
22       A.   Yes, approximately.
23       Q.   When you gave the description of your escape from that room and
24    you told us that you had jumped out of the second window, do you remember
25    whether anyone else had jumped out before you, or were you the first

 1    person to have jumped out of the window, if you can remember that?
 2       A.   Yes.  VG18 had jumped out before me.  Then I did.  And after me,
 3    VG048.
 4       Q.   As far as I understood, after you had jumped out of the window,
 5    you no longer saw any of those individuals anywhere near the house.
 6       A.   No.
 7       Q.   So how is it that you know that that individual jumped out of you
 8    [sic]?  Is it because she managed to save herself, or is it because she
 9    survived?
10       A.   When I jumped out of the window, sir, I did linger around a little
11    bit, and I managed to see VG084 jumping out of the window after me.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, it may be a typographical error, but his
13    earlier answer was that VG84 jumped out after him, and then after him,
14    VG48.  Now there's no 48 on these lists, but there is an 84 on these
15    lists.  I assume that's the same person.
16            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Yes.  First time he said 48, and
17    after that he said 84.  I think that is --
18            JUDGE HUNT:  It's not a typographical error, but it may be that we
19    better know who he means by "VG48."
20            MR. DOMAZET:
21       Q.   [Interpretation] Sir, have you heard the question?  Could you
22    please explain to us whether you misspoke when you identified the
23    witness.
24       A.   It may have been my mistake.  084.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.

 1            MR. DOMAZET:
 2       Q.   [Interpretation] Do you remember when it was that you first
 3    learned about the arrest of Mitar Vasiljevic?
 4       A.   No, I don't remember, but I remember reading about it in the
 5    paper.
 6       Q.   When you say "in the paper," I assume you are referring to the
 7    newspaper which was published in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   Do you remember by any chance what paper it was?
10       A.   I think it was in Oslobodenje.
11       Q.   Were there any photographs in that article, his photographs?
12       A.   Yes, there were.
13       Q.   In the meantime, that is, in the period of time after his arrest
14    and afterwards, did you watch or hear anything about him and his
15    proceedings either on TV or in the papers?
16       A.   Yes, I regularly followed that subject.
17       Q.   So in the "Hague Chronicle" he was shown as being here in the
18    courtroom, in the Hague?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   You gave a statement to the investigator of the Office of the
21    Prosecutor several years ago; is that correct?
22       A.   Yes, that's correct.
23       Q.   Yesterday, you were shown a photo spread on which you signed your
24    name under the photograph of the individual whom you said was Mitar
25    Vasiljevic, and you also wrote down the date when you identified him; is

 1    that correct?
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   However, you did not do that -- you did not identify him on the
 4    first occasion when you gave the statement to the investigator.  Were you
 5    also shown his photograph on that first occasion?
 6       A.   I was shown his photograph at the time of my interview, before I
 7    read the papers.
 8       Q.   Let me be specific.  On the first occasion when you gave an
 9    interview to the Office of the Prosecutor here in the Hague - I'm
10    referring to your first statement - were you given an opportunity on that
11    particular occasion to identify and recognise Mitar Vasiljevic?
12       A.   I cannot remember that.
13       Q.   Do you remember when it was that you recognised Mitar Vasiljevic
14    in the photo spread?
15       A.   Well, I recognised him immediately on those photographs, which
16    included his photograph as well.
17       Q.   Yes, but my question referred to the time when that took place.
18    When was it that you were shown that particular photo spread -- or let me
19    be more specific.  Was that on the 21st of June, 2001, this year?  If
20    necessary, perhaps you could have another look at the photo spread.
21       A.   I think it was in the month of June.
22       Q.   The month of June of this year, 2001?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   Thank you.
25            Let me ask you a few questions concerning your first statement

 1    given to the Office of the Prosecutor, the one which you gave before the
 2    arrest of Mitar Vasiljevic.  You stated in that statement, among other
 3    things, that before your arrival in Visegrad, you were first put up in a
 4    house near the old hotel, that it was there that you spent the night, and
 5    that you went to Jusuf Memic's house in the Nova Mahala neighbourhood only
 6    the following day.  You also stated that the individual whom you
 7    identified as Mitar escorted you to the house and that the event took
 8    place around 3.00, 3.00 p.m., then on the second day that you spent one
 9    night -- that is, that you spent one night in a house near the old hotel.
10    Do you remember stating that to the investigator?
11       A.   No, sir, that is not correct.
12       Q.   Perhaps what is not correct is the fact that you had spent one
13    night there before that, but I'm asking you whether that was what you
14    stated to the -- in the statement given to the investigator of the
15    Tribunal.
16       A.   Sir, I never mentioned any house near a hotel, nor that we spent
17    the night there, but that we stayed in the Nova Mahala neighbourhood in
18    the house belonging to Jusuf Memic.
19       Q.   Let me read you the statement.  Let me quote that perhaps to
20    refresh your memory.
21            "First we stayed in a house close to an old hotel.  From there,
22    three men were taken out to bury dead people.  The three men were Alija
23    Kurspahic, Becar Kurspahic, and Redzo Memisevic.  They are all dead now.
24    They did not tell us the names of the people they buried.  The next day,
25    we were told by Mitar Vasiljevic to go to the house of Jusuf Memic, also
 1    in Mahala.  Mitar escorted us to the house.  This happened around 3.00."
 2            Do you remember having stated that?
 3       A.   Yes.  Those people went to bury the dead, but we were staying in
 4    Jusuf Memic's house at that time.
 5       Q.   However, that is not what you stated in respect of those
 6    individuals.  I asked you yesterday specifically if any people were taken
 7    out and then taken back to that particular house, and you said, "No."
 8       A.   Yes, because I couldn't remember.
 9       Q.   The fact that you cannot remember, is it perhaps because at the
10    time you were 13 and a half?
11       A.   Well, yes.
12            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Thank you, Witness.  This concludes
13    my cross-examination, Your Honour.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Re-examination, Mr. Groome.
15            MR. GROOME:  Thank you, Your Honour.
16                          Re-examined by Mr. Groome:
17       Q.   Yesterday, Mr. Domazet asked you about your observations of Mitar
18    Vasiljevic with Mr. (redacted).  Do you recall your testimony on that
19    matter?
20       A.   Yes, I do.
21       Q.   During the time that you made your observations of this, did you
22    at any time see Mr. (redacted) leave the house or leave the area and
23    return?
24       A.   No.  He was standing there with him.
25       Q.   That was my next question.  At any time, did you see these two men

 1    sitting, or were they always standing at the time you observed them?
 2       A.   Yes, they were standing there all the time.
 3       Q.   And approximately how long were they together in total?
 4       A.   I cannot tell you the exact time, but I know that they were
 5    standing.
 6       Q.   Can you give us your best estimate of the time?
 7       A.   For about 20 minutes.
 8       Q.   Now, you testified regarding your observations of Mr. Susnjar by
 9    the house, the Omeragic house.
10       A.   Could you please repeat the question?
11       Q.   You testified regarding your ability or -- your observations of
12    Mr. Susnjar when he threw a grenade or threw a bomb into the window of the
13    Omeragic house.  Do you recall that testimony?
14       A.   Yes.  Yes, I do.  I remember that.
15       Q.   Was the lighting sufficient at that period of time to see
16    Mr. Susnjar clearly?
17       A.   Yes.  It was the fire, not the lighting.
18       Q.   Now, Mr. Domazet asked you about several opportunities you may
19    have had to see either pictures or photographs or video of Mr. Vasiljevic
20    in the news media, and my question to you is:  When you saw these
21    pictures, did you immediately recognise the person who you saw in these
22    photographs and news media as Mr. Vasiljevic?
23       A.   Yes, I recognised him immediately.
24       Q.   And your identification of Mr. Vasiljevic in the group of photos
25    that you were shown, was that based on seeing Mr. Vasiljevic in the news
 1    media, or was it based on your observations of him back in the spring of
 2    '92?
 3       A.   On the basis of my recollections from 1992.
 4            MR. GROOME:  Thank you.  I have no further questions, Your
 5    Honour.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you, sir, for coming along to give evidence.
 7    We're very grateful to you for coming and for the evidence you've given.
 8    You are now free to leave.
 9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you too.
10                          [The witness withdrew]
11            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, the Prosecution calls VG13.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  It will be Exhibit P89, and it is under
13    seal.
14                          [The witness entered court]
15            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, madam, would you please make the solemn
16    declaration in the form of the document which the usher is showing you.
17    Would you read it out, please.
18            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly declare that I will speak
19    the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
20                          WITNESS:  WITNESS VG13
21                          [Witness answers through interpreter]
22            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  You may sit down.
23            Mr. Groome.
24            MR. GROOME:  Thank you, Your Honour.  I would ask that we begin by
25    showing the witness P89.

 1                          Examined by Mr. Groome:
 2       Q.   Good morning, VG13.
 3       A.   Good morning.
 4       Q.   The document entitled "P89" has just been placed before you.  I
 5    would ask you to read the top line of that document and ask you:  Is that
 6    your name at the top?
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Read it to herself.
 8            MR. GROOME:  Sorry.  Read it to yourself.
 9       Q.   Is that your name?
10       A.   It is.
11       Q.   And on the second line, I'd ask you to read to yourself what's
12    written there and ask you:  Is that your date of birth?
13       A.   It is.
14       Q.   For the purposes of concealing your identity, we will refer to you
15    as "VG13" throughout these proceedings.  If you need to refer to any of
16    the people listed on that sheet, I would ask you to do so by referring to
17    their number below.
18       A.   [In English] Okay.
19       Q.   Can you tell us where you were born?
20       A.   In Visegrad.
21       Q.   And for most of your life, have you lived in Visegrad?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   And are you married?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   And do you have children?

 1       A.   Three children.
 2       Q.   And is one of those children VG38 on your sheet?
 3       A.   Yes, yes.
 4       Q.   Can you tell us how far you attended or how many grades of school
 5    you attended?
 6       A.   Four grades of primary school.
 7       Q.   And was that in Visegrad?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   As an adult, did you work in a company in Visegrad?
10       A.   [redacted]
11       Q.   Can you tell us what village you're from?
12       A.   I was born in the village of [redacted], and my husband is from the
13    village of Koritnik.
14       Q.   What village did you live in?
15       A.   In [redacted].
16       Q.   What is your ethnicity?
17       A.   I am Muslim.
18       Q.   In 1992, were you a member of any political party?
19       A.   No, never.
20       Q.   And your husband?
21       A.   He wasn't ever a member either.
22       Q.   I want to draw your attention now to the 10th of June, 1992.  Do
23    you recall that day?
24       A.   Yes, I remember it well, when our village was attacked.
25       Q.   Who attacked your village?

 1       A.   Neighbours.
 2       Q.   Can you describe for the Chamber what occurred.
 3       A.   They attacked us.  They wanted us to give them weapons.  They were
 4    looking for men and such like.
 5       Q.   Did you actually speak to these people who attacked you, or did
 6    you have a face-to-face confrontation with these people?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   Who were these people?
 9       A.   There was Milovan Jasika, Miloje Gavrilovic, Dusan Grujic, Ljubisa
10    Grujic, Mladjo Grujic, Radomir Djuric, Gavrilovic, and others.  I didn't
11    see them all, but these I did.
12       Q.   As a result of this attack, did you have to move from the house
13    that you were living in at that time?
14       A.   I did.  I wasn't -- I was a bit outside the village, so I had to
15    go to the Kurspahic house.
16       Q.   Did you do that because you believed you would be safer?
17       A.   We weren't safe anywhere, but we went there to be together.
18       Q.   What happened to the young men in the village at that time?
19       A.   At that time, well, there was shooting -- or rather, as soon as
20    there was a lull in the shooting, some boys crossed the fields and went
21    into the woods, whereas the older men stayed in the village.
22       Q.   After this attacks, did you have an opportunity to go outside and
23    see evidence of the attack?
24       A.   We went outside, and Ilija Gavrilovic came in front of the door of
25    Sumbula Kurspahic's looking for her son and the other men.

 1       Q.   Do you know what village Ilija Gavrilovic came from?
 2       A.   Also from the village of Koritnik, one village next to another.
 3       Q.   How was he dressed?
 4       A.   In civilian clothes.  He had two pistols on him, and he held one
 5    in his hand.
 6       Q.   Was he alone or with other people?
 7       A.   There was Radomir Djuric from the neighbouring village of
 8    Loznica.  And his nickname is "Cinda".  That's how they call him.
 9       Q.   Was there anyone else aside from these two men?
10       A.   There were others in the village, but I didn't really look
11    around.  There was fear.  There was chaos.
12       Q.   At that time, were you able to see any damage to the houses caused
13    by this attack?
14       A.   There was some damage from bullets and some kind of shells.  I
15    don't know how I can explain.  Those that you shoot from the shoulder with
16    a tube like this.  So I really don't know much about weapons, but that's
17    what they looked like.
18       Q.   Approximately how long were those men there at that time?
19       A.   The men that attacked us?
20       Q.   Yes.
21       A.   They stayed for about an hour looking for weapons.  The men, they
22    found an old man, Osman Kurspahic.
23       Q.   Did they do anything to Mr. Kurspahic?
24       A.   They didn't do anything to him at the time, but they just told him
25    to find his rifle and surrender it, and his son.

 1       Q.   Did there come a time two or three days that these men returned to
 2    the village of Koritnik?
 3       A.   They never came back to the village again.  They didn't dare come
 4    back.
 5       Q.   Did there come a time when soldiers came back and surrounded the
 6    village?
 7       A.   They came looking again, but we were hiding in the woods.
 8       Q.   Did there come a time when you were told that you had to leave the
 9    village?
10       A.   Yes, Dusan Grujic told us and Milorad Lipovac.
11       Q.   When was this?
12       A.   Well, that was the 13th -- between the 13th and the 14th they told
13    us we had to move out.
14       Q.   And Dusan Grujic, where was he from?
15       A.   Also from the village of Koritnik.  (redacted).
16       Q.   I ask you to tell us, using the words that Mr. Grujic used
17    himself, what exactly did he say?
18       A.   Mr. Grujic said to us that we should pack some food for one day
19    and one set of clothing because we had to leave the village because there
20    was ethnic cleansing.
21       Q.   Did he tell you where you were going to be taken to, or where you
22    would go?
23       A.   He said that we would go to Kladanj, to be exchanged and that
24    Serbs would come to live in our houses.
25       Q.   Did he say when you would have to leave?

 1       A.   On the 14th, we left our village.  That is what we were told to
 2    do.
 3       Q.   On the 13th, the night of the 13th, did you pack some things to
 4    take with you?
 5       A.   Yes, we packed some things.
 6       Q.   What kinds of things did you pack?
 7       A.   A change of clothing and food that would be sufficient for a day
 8    or two.
 9       Q.   Did you take any other personal possessions?
10       A.   I took my documents, some money, and such like.
11       Q.   Did you think that you would be returning to your home in
12    (redacted)?
13       A.   Well, yes.  We thought that after a short while, we would go back;
14    however, we didn't go back.
15       Q.   Can you describe for us what happened on the morning of the 14th.
16       A.   On the 14th, in the morning, we got ready.  It was raining.  And
17    our neighbours told us nicely that the bus would come.  But that was a
18    trick.  The bus didn't come.  About half past 8.00, our neighbours came to
19    plunder our village before our eyes.  They loaded whatever they wanted and
20    took away.  They took away our tractors and everything.
21       Q.   Did you see this yourself?
22       A.   Personally I saw this, and I stand by whatever I am saying.
23       Q.   What was the ethnicity of the neighbours that you say plundered
24    your possessions?
25       A.   Serbs.

 1       Q.   When the bus did not come, what did you do?
 2       A.   Our neighbour Grujic and Milorad Lipovac told us to go on on foot.
 3       Q.   This Grujic that you are referring to now, is this the same person
 4    you referred to earlier as Dusan Grujic?
 5       A.   Yes, yes.
 6       Q.   And did you go towards Visegrad on foot?
 7       A.   We did.  We reached Greben.  We moved slowly because there were
 8    old people and small children, and then two soldiers came up.  I didn't
 9    recognise them.  I didn't dare look.  One had a beard.  And they asked us
10    where we were going, and mistreated us, and beat us, and they wanted to
11    kill us.  And then his colleague said, "Don't do anything now.  We'll go
12    to Prelevo, and then when we come back, we see."
13       Q.   Did any of -- did either Mr. Lipovac or Mr. Grujic accompany you
14    on your trip towards Visegrad?
15       A.   Dusan accompanied us as far as [sic] Milorad Lipovac, and then he
16    told him you take over and leave them.
17       Q.   What village was that that occurred?
18       A.   The village of Greben.
19       Q.   Did there come a time when you reached the intersection of the
20    road between Greben and Visegrad and the road that leads up to the Vilina
21    Vlas Hotel?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   And did something happen in that area?
24       A.   There, again, they stopped us and said that the buses would come
25    there.  And they were discussing the possibility of killing us there next

 1    to the Drina River.
 2       Q.   Did Mr. Lipovac say anything at this time regarding the
 3    possibility of you being killed?
 4       A.   Mr. Lipovac said to these men, "Don't kill them here," and take
 5    them to the town - and I apologise - that they should fuck us as they
 6    want.
 7       Q.   Are you familiar with a young woman by the name of "Jasmina Vila"?
 8       A.   From the village of Musici.  She's a neighbour.  It's also a
 9    neighbouring village.
10       Q.   Was she with you that day?
11       A.   She was with us, and Stanislava Susnjar brought her, because Milan
12    Lukic had brought her from the village of Kamenica, from the hunting
13    lodge.  She looked awful, and then she went on with us.
14       Q.   Can you describe her condition in greater detail, please?
15       A.   She was black here.  She had bruises and cuts.  Her hair was all
16    untidy.  She looked awful.  There were bites, traces of bites.  Her face
17    was peeling from these bites.
18       Q.   And where did she join the group?
19       A.   Stanislava Susnjar brought her to our village because they are
20    close by.  She said, "We can't keep her here."  She brought her on the
21    13th, and "As you're going the next morning," she said, "let her go with
22    you."
23       Q.   Approximately how many people altogether were in the group?
24       A.   About 70, including those from Sase and us from our village, so
25    about 75.

 1       Q.   And did there come a time when this group eventually did reach the
 2    centre of Visegrad?
 3       A.   We arrived about 3.00 or 4.00 in the afternoon, it was.
 4       Q.   And where did this journey end, what part of Visegrad?
 5       A.   The journey ended when we reached Janidja [phoen], it's called,
 6    the Red Cross.  But it was Sunday, nothing was working, so we went in
 7    front of the new hotel, in the terrace of the hotel.
 8       Q.   Why did you go to the Red Cross building or Red Cross office?
 9       A.   That's what they told us, because the Red Cross was allegedly
10    going to take us over.
11       Q.   And when you say "they," who are you referring to?
12       A.   People in the Red Cross who were working there.  Milorad Lipovac
13    and these others told us, "You would be registered there and then you'll
14    go on from there."
15       Q.   Did those two men themselves tell you they were working for the
16    Red Cross?
17       A.   They didn't say they were working for the Red Cross, but they just
18    gave us those instructions.
19       Q.   Can you describe for the Chamber, where is the Red Cross office in
20    relation to the place you've described as "the new hotel"?
21       A.   It comes first, before the new hotel, and apparently that was
22    where the Red Cross -- but it wasn't there.  Before the hotel, on the
23    right-hand side.
24       Q.   Now, I'm going to ask you to describe the area in front of the
25    hotel.  Can you describe for us the area in which this group gathered?

 1       A.   There's a street, the street where we had gathered, and we got --
 2    we assembled in front of the new hotel, the terrace of the hotel, all of
 3    us.
 4       Q.   Aside from the group of people from Koritnik and Sase, what other
 5    people were on the street at that time?
 6       A.   We met people in the street, but I didn't take note of who they
 7    were.  There were there people walking around.
 8       Q.   Did you see any people in uniforms at that time on the street?
 9       A.   Yes, we did.  We saw there police, and there were soldiers too
10    around.
11       Q.   Can you describe the uniforms that the police were wearing?
12       A.   The police wore blue uniforms with badges on their sleeves and
13    caps, some kind of little flags.
14       Q.   Did the uniforms appear to be the same uniform that the police
15    wore before the conflict began?
16       A.   No.  These were darker than the old ones.
17       Q.   Could you see the insignia on these uniforms?
18       A.   I did.  I saw these small flags on their caps and on their
19    sleeves.
20       Q.   And was that different from the insignias that the police wore
21    before the war?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   Did any of these police say anything to the group of people from
24    Koritnik?
25       A.   They mistreated us, and he said, "These should be killed straight

 1    away right here."
 2       Q.   Do you know the name of that person?
 3       A.   I don't know his name, but he did abuse us and asked us, "Where
 4    are your men?  They've gone to join the Green Berets," and he cussed us
 5    like that.
 6       Q.   Can you approximate for us how many police were present during the
 7    time you were in front of the new hotel?
 8       A.   There were three.  They came to meet us.  Then I saw others.  But
 9    I didn't really look around.  I was so scared, I didn't even dare look at
10    myself, never mind around.
11       Q.   You mentioned earlier in your testimony that soldiers were present
12    as well.  Can you tell us approximately how many soldiers were present, if
13    you're able?
14       A.   I didn't count them, but there were some.
15       Q.   And can you describe how they were dressed?
16       A.   They were wearing camouflage uniforms.
17       Q.   Were they armed?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   Were the police armed?
20       A.   They were armed too, yes.
21       Q.   How long did you remain in this area?
22       A.   We stayed for about an hour, maybe longer, until they told us to
23    go to Pionirska Street.
24       Q.   And who did you tell -- or who told you to go to Pionirska Street?
25       A.   Brana Tesovic walked in.  He was a waiter and he was a worker at

 1    Hidrogradnja.  And he said to one of our colleagues that in order to avoid
 2    being mistreated, that we should go to Pionirska Street.
 3       Q.   And did you and the group leave for Pionirska Street?
 4       A.   Yes, we did, we headed in that direction.
 5       Q.   And did anybody accompany the group up to Pionirska Street?
 6       A.   We were followed by some people, but I didn't turn around to look
 7    and see who they were.
 8       Q.   They were people that were not with the group from Koritnik?
 9       A.   Yes, that's right.
10       Q.   Were you able to tell whether the people that followed you were
11    armed or not?
12       A.   They were armed.
13       Q.   And were you able to tell whether they were -- had some type of
14    uniform on?
15       A.   As I turned around once, I saw that policemen were following us,
16    but I didn't turn back again.
17       Q.   How long did it take the group to reach or to go from the new
18    hotel to Pionirska Street?
19       A.   We went slowly.  It took us about half an hour, maybe a little
20    longer, because it was raining and there were elderly with us.
21       Q.   When you reached Pionirska Street, where did you go?
22       A.   One group went to Jusuf Memic's house, and the others went to Mujo
23    Memic's house.  Mujo was Jusuf's son.
24       Q.   And were these houses next to each other?
25       A.   Yes.

 1       Q.   Which house did you go to initially?
 2       A.   Mujo Memic's.
 3       Q.   And approximately how many people out of the group went to Mujo
 4    Memic's house initially?
 5       A.   About four families.
 6       Q.   And the remainder of the group went to Jusuf Memic's house; is
 7    that correct?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   After you were inside of Mujo Memic's house, did anybody come to
10    the door?
11       A.   After we had a cup of coffee and we changed our clothes because we
12    were wet, Mr. Mitar came.  He gave Mujo a piece of paper, some sort of
13    certificate that we should not be afraid of anything, that we would be
14    quite safe.
15       Q.   The person you're referring to as "Mitar," do you know this
16    person's last name?
17       A.   Vasiljevic.
18       Q.   And can you describe for the Court how you knew this person's
19    name?
20       A.   I knew Mr. Mitar as a waiter in the Panos Hotel, and sometimes he
21    would be working at the new hotel.
22       Q.   Can you tell us, for what period of time did you know
23    Mr. Vasiljevic?
24       A.   I knew him quite a long time, even when he was a young man.  We
25    would go to get-togethers, parties, and he went to school with a relative

 1    of mine.
 2       Q.   Can you describe what he was wearing?
 3       A.   He was wearing a black suit and a black hat at the time.
 4       Q.   And were you able to tell if he was armed?
 5       A.   He came to give (redacted) the certificate, and he didn't have
 6    a weapon.  He was not armed.
 7       Q.   Did there come a time, in connection with this case, that an
 8    investigator from the Office of the Prosecutor showed you a group of
 9    photos of different men?
10       A.   No, they didn't show me.
11       Q.   Do you ever recall being shown photographs of different people?
12       A.   Yes, yes.
13       Q.   Was that by an investigator of the Office of the Prosecutor?
14       A.   I don't know.
15       Q.   I'm going to ask that the witness be shown --
16       A.   Probably, yes.
17       Q.   -- witness be shown Prosecution Number 55-VG13, already admitted
18    into evidence.  And I'm going to ask the witness to look at both the front
19    and the back of that exhibit.
20            I would ask you to look at both the front and the reverse of those
21    documents in front of you.  Do you recognise that group of photos, VG13?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   Were you shown those photographs on an earlier occasion?
24       A.   Not until now.
25       Q.   I would ask you to turn over to the reverse of Exhibit 55-VG13.

 1    Can you look at the rear of the page.  Do you recognise any of the
 2    signatures on that page?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   Without saying any of the names, is your signature on that page?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   Do you recall now whether you were shown these photographs at an
 7    earlier point in time?
 8       A.   Yes, they were.
 9       Q.   Out of these ten pictures of men, did you recognise one of the
10    people among them?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   Who did you recognise that person to be?
13       A.   Mitar Vasiljevic.
14       Q.   And what number is next to his picture?
15       A.   Four.
16       Q.   Thank you.
17            I'm going to ask you to look around the courtroom this morning and
18    ask you if you recognise anybody in the courtroom.
19       A.   I can recognise Mitar, my neighbour, the gentleman over there.
20       Q.   Can you describe where he is sitting and what he is wearing.
21       A.   He is sitting on the left side.  He is wearing a brown suit and an
22    off-white shirt.
23            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I don't want to repeat my mistake of
24    yesterday.  Using the words the record reflects, may we mark this for
25    identification somehow.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  It will be noted that the witness has identified the
 2    accused.
 3            MR. GROOME:
 4       Q.   The first time that you saw Mr. Vasiljevic at the house of Mujo
 5    Memic, did he say anything?
 6       A.   The first time he came, he brought the certificate and he told us
 7    to gather near Memic's house.
 8       Q.   At that time that you saw him, was he alone or with somebody else?
 9       A.   At that time, he was alone, standing in front of the door, whereas
10    we were inside the house.  But then we went to the other house, the
11    adjacent house, and then he left.
12       Q.   Why did you go to the other house?
13       A.   Well, we didn't know why we had to go there.  They had probably
14    organised themselves in advance.  They probably knew why they were
15    gathering us there.
16       Q.   Did somebody tell you to move from the house of Mujo Memic to the
17    house of Jusuf Memic?
18       A.   Yes.  At about 10.00 or 10.30, they took our gold and our money.
19    They told us to take off our clothes, and they mistreated us and beat us.
20    And after that, they told us to go to Memic's house.
21       Q.   Before we talk about that --
22       A.   Sorry, the Omeragic house.
23       Q.   I would like to ask you a few questions about this paper you
24    referred to.
25       A.   Yes.

 1       Q.   Can you tell us exactly -- let me ask you this:  Did you actually
 2    see this piece of paper?
 3       A.   Yes.  Mujo showed it to us, and I was standing next to him.  We
 4    were all there together.  And written on that piece of paper was "Do not
 5    be afraid.  Nobody is going to harm you".  And Mr. Vasiljevic, my
 6    neighbour, he explicitly told us that the following morning, we would be
 7    taken over by the Red Cross.  And everything had been prepared in
 8    advance.  They knew what they would do with us.
 9       Q.   I ask you to tell us, using the words that Mr. Vasiljevic used,
10    exactly what he said regarding the Red Cross at that time.
11       A.   I don't know why he said that.  Probably to comfort us a little
12    bit, to reassure us so that we wouldn't be afraid.  But we were already
13    afraid when we left that house -- when we left our houses.
14       Q.   Were you able to see a signature on that piece of paper?
15       A.   I could see everything, the way I can see this paper in front of
16    me.
17       Q.   Was there a signature on that paper?
18       A.   Yes, there was a signature.
19       Q.   Were you able to tell whose signature it was?
20       A.   Well, it was his signature, since he was the one who brought the
21    paper, and he wrote it down.  As soon as you write something down, you
22    have to sign it so as to make it yours.
23       Q.   I would ask you, just so we're clear, who is -- who are you
24    referring to?  Who is the "he" whose signature is on this paper?
25       A.   Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic.

 1       Q.   Did there come a time after this that some of the men in the group
 2    from Koritnik were taken away to do some work?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   Approximately what time of the day did this happen?
 5       A.   Well, when we got there, in the early evening hours, Alija
 6    Kurspahic left together with Medo to bury a man who had been killed,
 7    together with his wife.  He used to work at the veterinarian station.  I
 8    don't know what their surname is.  They went to bury him.  And when they
 9    came back, we were told that he and his wife had been killed, and that
10    they had to go there to bury them.
11       Q.   Did you see the people who came to take these men away to do this?
12       A.   This police force of theirs went there to pick them up, I suppose,
13    but somebody must have brought them where we were.
14       Q.   You did not see that; is that correct?
15       A.   I could see.  But frankly, I'm not able to tell you who it was.
16    It was Mitar who came to take them over there to bury those people.
17       Q.   Again, I would ask you to just say the last name of the person you
18    are referring to as "Mitar."
19       A.   Mitar Vasiljevic.
20       Q.   Can you approximate for us what time this occurred at?
21       A.   I did not have a watch.  Nobody had a watch.  The watches had been
22    seized from us.  But I think that it was about 5.00, 5.00 in the
23    afternoon.
24       Q.   Can you describe what Mr. Vasiljevic was wearing at this point in
25    time?

 1       A.   The same black suit and black hat.
 2       Q.   Did there come a time later in the day when you saw Mr. Vasiljevic
 3    again?
 4       A.   Yes, we did.
 5       Q.   And was he alone or in the company of other people?
 6       A.   Milan Lukic, Bosko Djuric, Milan Susnjar were there as well.
 7       Q.   Was there just those four men, or were there others?
 8       A.   There were probably others as well, but I didn't dare watch.  I
 9    didn't dare count them.  We were afraid.  We hardly knew where we were.
10       Q.   Did you, yourself, see any other people aside from these four that
11    you have mentioned by name?
12       A.   Of course.  There were people walking around the Nova Mahala
13    neighbourhood, and the residents were being gathered on Pionirska Street.
14       Q.   The person you refer to as Milan Lukic, can you tell the Court how
15    it is you came to learn his name or how do you know him?
16       A.   I know Milan Lukic just as I know Mitar Vasiljevic.  They all come
17    from neighbouring villages.  He is from Rujiste, and there were Serb
18    villages, Muslim villages, and mixed villages in that area.
19       Q.   Can you approximate for us how long it is that you know or knew
20    Milan Lukic?
21       A.   Well, I had known him for quite some time, like I had known
22    Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic and others.  I lived in that town, so I knew all my
23    neighbours.
24       Q.   The person you referred to as Milan Susnjar, can you tell us how
25    it was you knew him?

 1       A. [redacted]
 2     [redacted]
 3       Q.   And Mr. Bosko Djuric who you mentioned, how did you know him?
 4       A.   He is also from a neighbouring village, the village of Loznica.
 5       Q.   What occurred after these men arrived?
 6       A.   What occurred was that our money and gold were taken away from
 7    us.
 8       Q.   Will you tell us specifically what happened, how did that occur.
 9       A.   Milan Lukic came to the house, and he threw a piece of cloth onto
10    a table, and he told us to assemble, to sit down, to get together in one
11    room.  He said, "You should put all your jewellery and money here,
12    everything that you have.  If you do not surrender everything that you
13    have, you will get a bullet in your forehead, and you will be searched
14    once again."  We gave them everything we had.  And after they had taken
15    all our belongings, they sent us to another room, to a next-door room, and
16    told us to take off our clothes.
17       Q.   In which house is this occurring?
18       A.   In Jusuf Memic's house.
19       Q.   And this other room that you're referring to, can you describe
20    what room it was in the house?
21       A.   We were in the kitchen, which is in the left-hand side.  And on
22    the right-hand side, there were two rooms.  And in one of the rooms, we
23    were made to take off our clothes.  We had to do it, and they made us
24    dance around.
25       Q.   And what was the purpose of making you dance around or the people

 1    in the group dance around?
 2       A.   Well, all of us women who had taken our clothes off had to dance
 3    individually around Mr. Milan Susnjar.  And the others were standing
 4    around the house, guarding the house so that we wouldn't jump out.
 5       Q.   What happened to young children that were there at that time?
 6       A.   Well, we also had to take their clothes off so that they could
 7    check that nobody had hidden anything.
 8       Q.   Was there one young woman who refused to take her clothes off?
 9       A.   Yes.  So other women were made to take her clothes off.
10       Q.   Approximately how long did this take?
11       A.   It took about two hours, the dancing, they mistreating us, telling
12    us what to do, how to dance, how to turn around.
13       Q.   And was your watch taken at this time?
14       A.   Yes, everything.  We had to take off our earrings, everything.  We
15    had to give them everything we had.
16       Q.   And were watches taken from the other people in the group?
17       A.   Everything.  We gave them everything.  Though he may have thrown
18    it away and not used it at all, it's just that everything was taken from
19    us.
20       Q.   Did there come a time when two women in the house were actually
21    taken out of the house?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   And do you know the name of those two women?
24       A.   Ifeta Kurspahic, Jasmina, and Mujesira Kurspahic.
25       Q.   So there were three women taken out?

 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   The person you referred to as "Jasmina," what is her last name?
 3       A.  "Vila."
 4       Q.   And is this the same "Jasmina Vila" who you referred to earlier in
 5    your testimony as coming from the village of Uzice?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   Can you describe the circumstances under which these women were
 8    taken out of the house of Jusuf Memic?
 9       A.   The girls were taken out, and when they returned, they didn't look
10    quite in shape.  Jasmina wanted me to give her a tablet.  And we asked
11    them what had happened, and they said, "Well, you know what happened."
12    They didn't want to tell anything.  And Ifeta, when she came back, she
13    also looked bad, she was crying, and she said, "Your turn will also come."
14       Q.   What did you understand her to mean by that?
15       A.   Well, they managed to tell us that they had been raped, and we
16    could see for ourselves, you know, how they looked after they had been
17    mistreated.  And she told -- they told -- they told us to try and escape,
18    because apparently Milan Lukic and others told them that we would all be
19    raped.
20       Q.   And can you describe the condition of the clothes of these three
21    women?
22       A.   Well, they were dressed.  They were wearing skirts or suits.  They
23    were neatly dressed because they had set out on a journey.  They were
24    wearing their regular civilian clothes, costumes --
25       Q.   And what was the --

 1       A.  -- and scarves.
 2       Q.   What was the condition of their clothes when they returned and
 3    spoke with you?
 4       A.   They looked dishevelled.  Their buttons had been torn off.
 5       Q.   Were you able to tell whether these women were taken simply to
 6    another part of the house or were they taken away from the house?
 7       A.   They were taken out of the house.  And after about an hour, an
 8    hour and a half, they were taken back.
 9       Q.   And were you able to tell who it was that took these women from
10    the house?
11       A.   Milan Lukic took them away.  I don't know what happened
12    afterwards.  But whatever happened, they came back looking dishevelled,
13    their clothes torn, traces of bites on their skin.  They looked as if they
14    had been mistreated.
15       Q.   Now, at the time that Milan Lukic took them away, were you able to
16    see where the other men that came with Milan Lukic were?
17       A.   They were around the house.  We could see them.
18       Q.   And approximately what time, if you're able to tell us, did these
19    women return?
20       A.   They returned at about 8.00 p.m.
21       Q.   Did there come a time after this that you became aware that Mitar
22    Vasiljevic and Milan Lukic and the other people you've referred to were no
23    longer present at the Jusuf Memic house?
24       A.   They were standing around the house, and by the time the girls
25    came back, they no longer entered the house.  It was only some time later

 1    that they came to take us from Memic's house to Adem Omeragic's house.
 2       Q.   And approximately how much time transpired between the time that
 3    these young women were returned and the time you were taken to Adem
 4    Omeragic's house?
 5       A.   From 8.00 up until half past 9.00, 10.00, when they came and
 6    knocked on the door.  And they told us to get our belongings, to pack and
 7    move out, that the place was no longer safe.
 8       Q.   And can you tell us, who returned at this point in time?
 9       A.   Mitar Vasiljevic, Milan Lukic returned.  I could see the two of
10    them at the door.  Lukic was holding the door, the knob of the house on
11    Jusuf Memic's house, and he told us to hurry up before the shooting would
12    start.  And Mr. Vasiljevic was standing on Adem Omeragic's house, and he
13    was yelling, "Hurry up, hurry up."
14       Q.   And did Mr. Lukic say anything regarding who was doing the
15    shooting?
16       A.   Well, he said that our army was shooting.
17       Q.   Now, aside from Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic, did you see any
18    other men present at the Jusuf Memic house or in the vicinity of it at
19    this time?
20       A.   Around the house, there were other people as well, probably their
21    soldiers.  But I didn't recognise them because the lighting was not very
22    good.  It was further down, so we couldn't see.
23       Q.   At the time you see Milan Lukic this time, is he armed?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   And does he have anything else with him at that time?

 1       A.   He had a multicoloured uniform.  He was holding a rifle in one
 2    hand and holding the door with his other hand, and he told us to hurry up,
 3    that there was no time to wait.  Kada Sehic asked him for permission to
 4    put on her shoes, and he said, "Hurry up.  You will need no shoes."  And
 5    there was one man from our group who asked her, "How do you know it is
 6    Lukic," and she said, "He had taken my son away," and her husband, and
 7    their names were Rasim and Kender.
 8       Q.   And Mr. Vasiljevic at this time, could you tell whether he was
 9    armed?
10       A.   At the time, Mr. Vasiljevic was carrying a flashlight.
11       Q.   And aside from the flashlight, did you see whether he was carrying
12    anything else?
13       A.   He also had a rifle.
14       Q.   Can you describe for us precisely where it was -- where it was
15    Mr. Vasiljevic was standing this time that you see him in relation to
16    Jusuf Memic's house?
17       A.   When we left Memic's house, Milan Lukic was holding the door of
18    that house, Jusuf Memic's house.  And Mr. Mitar was walking ahead of us,
19    and he brought the first group of people to this other house.
20       Q.   And do you know the owner of that other house?
21       A.   Yes, I know.  Amir Omeragic.
22       Q.   And are you familiar with a creek in the area of Pionirska Street?
23       A.   Yes, there is a creek there.  It is a kind of derivation for
24    rains, for heavy rains.  And there is also a sewage further down.
25       Q.   Where is the house of Adem Omeragic in relation to the creek?

 1       A.   Near the creek, some 50 metres -- 10 metres away from the creek.
 2       Q.   Now, you've testified that Mr. Vasiljevic was in front of you as
 3    you went down to this house.  Did there come a point in time when you
 4    passed by him?
 5       A.   Yes, yes.  Yes, we did.
 6       Q.   And can you tell us where that was?
 7       A.   While he was holding the door of Adem Omeragic's house.
 8       Q.   And did you walk past him to get inside that house?
 9       A.   Yes, we did, because Mitar Vasiljevic was shouting, telling us to
10    hurry up.
11       Q.   And did he have a flashlight with him at this point in time?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   Based on your prior knowledge or experience with Mr. Vasiljevic,
14    are you able to recognise his voice?
15       A.   Yes.  Yes, I am.
16       Q.   Who is -- what members of your immediate family were with you at
17    this point in time?
18       A.   My son, my mother-in-law, and some other relatives.
19       Q.   Did anything happen to your mother-in-law as she passed Mitar
20    Vasiljevic?
21       A.   Yes.  As she was going through the door, and she was an elderly
22    woman, aged over 80.  He pushed her and told her to hurry up, and she
23    said, "Why are you pushing me?"  And then he cursed her mother.
24       Q.   At the time that you passed Mr. Vasilejic, can you approximate for
25    us how far is your face from his face?

 1       A.   Less than half a metre.  It was a passage like this.
 2       Q.   Was there anything covering his face?
 3       A.   No.  He had a hat, of course, but the lighting was good, and I
 4    could see him very well.
 5       Q.   I'm going to ask you now to describe the room that you were placed
 6    in in the Omeragic house.
 7       A.   The room had a couch inside and a closet, and there were some
 8    carpets on the floor, which had been sprayed by something, some product
 9    which made the whole atmosphere very suffocating, and it looked like some
10    kind of glue.  And we all entered that room, and there were some people
11    who had already been brought there.  I don't know who they were.  I could
12    only recognise Jasmina who was married to Ahmed Belic, and she was there
13    with her son, who was two years old.  Her mother-in-law was also there.
14       Q.   Approximately how many people were in that room aside from the
15    people from Koritnik?
16       A.   I don't know.  I didn't count them.  But as far as I could see,
17    given the kind of lighting that there was, there were some ten people
18    there.
19       Q.   At this point in time, did you have your shoes on?
20       A.   Yes, I had the traditional peasant shoes.
21       Q.   Were you able to tell whether or not the floor was wet?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   And was the floor wet?
24       A.   Yes, the carpets were wet, because something had been sprinkled
25    over them.  I don't know what it was.  I know that we were suffocating,

 1    but I don't know exactly what kind of product it was.  I cannot describe
 2    it for you.
 3       Q.   Had you ever smelled anything like that before in your life, or
 4    something similar?
 5       A.   No.  No, I had not.
 6            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, may I suggest we pause there.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Very well.  We'll adjourn now until 11.30.
 8                          --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.
 9                          --- On resuming at 11.33 a.m.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome.
11            MR. GROOME:
12       Q.   Witness 13, when we took the break, you were describing some of
13    the features of the room in the Omeragic house.  I want to ask you, were
14    there any lights on in the house at the time you were in it this evening?
15       A.   Yes, there was some light coming from the other side, the other
16    side of the street.
17       Q.   Now, this light, was this inside the house or outside the house?
18       A.   Outside the house.  There was street lighting, and this light
19    reached us, so you could see after all.
20       Q.   And was this light that you are referring to now, was it from
21    Pionirska Street or another street?
22       A.   The name of the street was Glavica, the settlement of Glavica, the
23    neighbourhood of Glavica from where the light was coming.
24       Q.   Can you describe where that is in relation to the creek that
25    you've talked about earlier today?

 1       A.   To the left of Adem Omeragic's house.
 2       Q.   Can you approximate for us how far away this street is from the
 3    Omeragic house?
 4       A.   I don't know whether it was about a hundred metres or less,
 5    because there was a whole settlement there.
 6       Q.   Were there any lights inside the room that you were in at this
 7    time?
 8       A.   There was no light in the room but only coming from the street
 9    lighting.
10       Q.   Now, you've described a strong smell and suffocating from this
11    smell, earlier today.  What did you do in response to that smell?
12       A.   Because of this strong smell, which was unpleasant, with my child,
13    I went up to the window stepping on people's legs, pushing my way through
14    to get some fresh air.
15       Q.   How many windows were in the house that you can recall?
16       A.   I remember well that there were two windows.
17       Q.   And when you refer to your child, are you referring to VG38?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   Did there come a time when the entire group from Koritnik was in
20    that room?
21       A.   All of us who were together were in those rooms, except for the
22    people who had got there before us.  They were forced there.  I don't know
23    how to put it.
24       Q.   Can you estimate for us approximately in total what was the number
25    of people in that room.

 1       A.  All of us that were there from the village of (redacted), those who
 2    joined us from Sase, there were between 70 and 75, plus the people that
 3    were already there in Adem Omeragic's room.  I didn't count them, but
 4    there were ...
 5       Q.   Did you complete your answer?  The last thing that was interpreted
 6    was:  "I didn't count them, but there were ..."
 7       A.   About ten were there for sure, because they were sitting on the
 8    sofa.  So judging by the light, there were about ten, maybe even more of
 9    them.
10       Q.   Now, after all the people were inside this room, was the door
11    closed?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   And can you describe for us what happened after the door to this
14    room was closed?
15       A.   When the door was closed, the people started crying.  Mr. Mitar
16    Vasiljevic left and we stayed in the house, so that people were crying,
17    shouting, saying, "Pray to God."  We awaited what destiny would bring.
18       Q.   And how long did you wait?
19       A.   An hour, maybe an hour and a half.  I don't know whether it was
20    that much.  And then they came again.
21       Q.   Can you describe for us what happened when they came again?  And
22    I'd ask you to begin by telling us who came again.
23       A.   Mitar Vasiljevic, Milan Lukic.  I saw them when they opened the
24    door.  And he held in his hand -- that is, Milan Lukic held some sort of a
25    device.  He said, "Light it and put it down next to the door."  And this

 1    exploded, and immediately the carpets caught fire and the flames started
 2    rising.
 3       Q.   What happened then?
 4       A.   When the room was set on fire, two people jumped out of the
 5    window.  I thought it was someone else, but in fact it was a witness.  She
 6    will come here and tell you.  I don't want to name her.  Then another
 7    person followed, another witness who was here.  They were shooting.  They
 8    left from below the window.  Mitar Vasiljevic came with a flashlight,
 9    lighting up the window, and Milan Lukic was shooting.
10            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I'm just going to ask, would the usher
11    please open up the pseudonym sheet on the desk for the witness.
12       Q.   I want to take you back to the time when you referred to the door
13    being opened.  I'd ask you to describe what you observed at that time.
14       A.   When the door opened, I noticed again that this device had been
15    lighted and put down on the ground next to the floor -- next to the door
16    on the inside.
17       Q.   And who was holding this device?
18       A.   Milan Lukic.
19       Q.   And can you describe this device for us?
20       A.   It's like this, roughly this size, with a kind of fuse on top.
21    And it was burning, and he put it down.
22       Q.   Had you ever seen a device like this before?
23       A.   No, I hadn't seen it, but -- but I reckon it was a kind of bomb.
24       Q.   And who, if anyone, was with Milan Lukic at this time?
25       A.   There was Mitar Vasiljevic.

 1       Q.   Anyone else?
 2       A.   Well, Bosko Djuric, most probably he was there too.  But just
 3    then, it was Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic.
 4       Q.   And where was Mitar Vasiljevic in relation to the door of the
 5    Omeragic house?
 6       A.   Just then, both of them were at the door.  But when VG18 jumped
 7    out of the window and VG84, at that moment they went underneath the
 8    windows of the Omeragic house.
 9       Q.   I want to ask you a few more questions about what happened at the
10    door before we move to that portion of your testimony.  Can you describe
11    for us in detail what you observed Mitar Vasiljevic do at the time you saw
12    him by the open door?
13       A.   He was lighting the place with a flashlight.
14       Q.   Were you able to tell if he was armed?
15       A.   Yes, he did have.
16       Q.   And do you recall what position -- are you able to tell us what he
17    was armed with?
18       A.   They were short, small rifles, short butts.
19       Q.   And do you recall the manner in which he was holding that rifle?
20       A.   In his hand.
21       Q.   And in which direction was it pointed?
22       A.   He was holding his rifle in his hand, pointed towards the door.
23       Q.   At this time, were you able to see Milan Lukic's face?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   Was there anything obstructing your view of his face?

 1       A.   No.
 2       Q.   Were you able to see Mitar Vasiljevic's face?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   And was there anything obstructing your view of his face?
 5       A.   No.
 6       Q.   Was there sufficient light at that time to see his face?
 7       A.   Well, I could see well.  There was light from the street lamp, and
 8    I could see well.
 9       Q.   Did you hear -- this device that was lit and placed on the floor.
10    Did you hear it explode?
11       A.   Well, at that same moment, the rooms started burning, the carpets
12    were in flames, the people were crying.  I was next to the window.
13       Q.   And did you hear an explosion?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   How much time, can you tell us, transpired between the time that
16    Milan Lukic lit this device and -- I'm sorry.  How much time transpired
17    between the time this device was lit and the time you heard an explosion?
18       A.   I don't know whether it could have been a minute, maybe less,
19    before it exploded.
20       Q.   And you described the carpet catching fire.  Did the entire carpet
21    catch fire or only part of it?
22       A.   Yes, all of it.
23       Q.   The people that were in the room at this time, would you
24    characterise them as being crowded together, or not crowded?
25       A.   Yes, certainly, it was crowded, because the room was small, and

 1    there were a lot of us, so that I could hardly reach the window to be able
 2    to jump out.
 3       Q.   Now, the flames that came from the carpet, can you describe for us
 4    the height of those flames.  Using a part of the body as a reference, how
 5    high did they come?
 6       A.   It was so big a flame that it reached the ceiling of that room.
 7       Q.   Did people's clothes catch fire?
 8       A.   Yes, of course.
 9       Q.   Now, you've described Witness VG18 and VG84 going out the window
10    of the house.  Can you describe for us in greater detail which window of
11    the house you saw that -- them jump from?
12       A.   The left window, the one I jumped out of following them.
13       Q.   Where would that window be in relation to the door?
14       A.   From the door, to the left of the door.
15       Q.   Would it be the window that is closest to the door or furthest
16    from the door?
17       A.   It was a bit away from the door, but not much.
18       Q.   Who went out of the window first?
19       A.   VG18 and VG84.
20       Q.   Did you see anybody else go out of the window at that point?
21       A.   No.
22       Q.   What did you observe after they jumped out of the window?
23       A.   After that, when they were shooting out the window and when VG18
24    and VG84 had jumped out, then they turned their rifle towards the right
25    window, and then VG38 jumped out.

 1       Q.   And how much time went between the time that VG84 -- I'm sorry --
 2    VG18 jumped out and VG38 jumped out?
 3       A.   Well, they were shooting at the right window.  It wasn't long
 4    after that, three or four seconds perhaps.  And then immediatelyVG38
 5    jumped out.
 6       Q.   What happened after VG38 jumped out?
 7       A.   They were shooting, Milan Lukic, at VG38, and Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic
 8    was lighting up with his flashlight.
 9       Q.   Was there anybody else outside at that time?
10       A.   I saw Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic and Milan Lukic.
11       Q.   What did you do?
12       A.   I waited for about two or three minutes for them to turn to the
13    right window.  And in the general chaos, people were running from one wall
14    to another, taking off their shoes.  So I jumped out the left window in
15    front of both of them.  They weren't far away from me, about three or four
16    steps only, Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic and Milan Lukic.
17       Q.   Before you jumped out of the window, were you injured in any way
18    prior to jumping out of the window?
19       A.   Yes, in my left leg, above the knee.
20       Q.   And how were you injured?
21       A.   I had a penetrating wound.
22       Q.   Do you know what that was from?
23       A.   Gunshot wound.
24       Q.   That's in your leg?
25       A.   When I was about to jump out of the window, I was wounded,

 1    probably with a shrapnel which went through my leg which ricocheted from
 2    the wall and went through my leg.
 3       Q.   Were you burned at all before you jumped out of the window?
 4       A.   At that moment, I didn't even feel the wound in my left leg in the
 5    fear I felt.
 6       Q.   Can you describe what you remember seeing as you jumped out of the
 7    window?
 8       A.   When I jumped out the window, about -- in about three or four
 9    steps, I reached Mr. Milan Lukic and Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic, so they shot at
10    me in my left arm, here, this side, so that my whole body went numb.  I
11    thought that the eleventh hour had come.  I rushed towards the creek and
12    hid against the tree.
13       Q.   Can you describe for us who shot you, or do you know who shot you?
14       A.   It was Milan Lukic, and Mitar Vasiljevic was holding the
15    flashlight.
16       Q.   And did Mitar Vasiljevic shine this flashlight on you as you
17    jumped out of the window?
18       A.   Yes, yes.  There was the flame coming from the door catching
19    people.  And as I jumped out, there was the shooting and the flashlight.
20    So I decided -- to be killed or to burn, so I decided to be killed rather
21    than burning.
22       Q.   How far was Milan Lukic from the edge of the house?
23       A.   Three or four steps away.  They were next to one another.
24       Q.   What happened after you were shot?
25       A.   I ran down to the creek, and I collected myself for a bit.  I saw

 1    my head was okay.  I realized my arm was wounded, so I held it with the
 2    other arm, and I went down the creek.  About 50 metres from Adem
 3    Omeragic's house, I reached -- I sat in the water.
 4       Q.   Did they follow you?
 5       A.   I didn't see them following me, but I decided to go downstream.
 6    Surely no one would follow me.  And I sat in that water for about two
 7    hours while the house was burning and the screaming could be heard.
 8       Q.   Could you describe for us what you remember about the condition of
 9    your left arm at this time?
10       A.   I remember, as I went down the creek, that the arm was bleeding.
11    Of course there was the sewage not far away, and I sort of held on to a
12    tree.  There's a metre- or a metre-and-a-half-high wall leading to this
13    sewer, so I stayed there.
14       Q.   And approximately how far are you away from the Omeragic house at
15    this point in time?
16       A.   Fifty metres, not more than that.
17       Q.   At what point in time did you realise that you had been injured in
18    your leg as well?
19       A.   I realised I was injured in my leg when I arrived in Kosovo
20    Polje.  And I had stinging in my leg, and I couldn't move one of my arms,
21    and I realised that the area was painful.
22       Q.   From the time that you're in the water by the creek, from that
23    position could you see the Omeragic house?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   And could you tell us what you saw during the time you were there?

 1       A.   I saw the flames.  I saw that the fire was still on.  They were
 2    shooting; Milan Lukic was.  I could hear screams of people who were still
 3    in the fire, burning.  I could hear their cries.
 4       Q.   Were you able to smell anything?
 5       A.   Yes, I was.  Of course I could smell burned skin.  And on the
 6    following day, as I was in the sewage, could I actually feel the smell.
 7    It smelled like roasted meat.
 8       Q.   You said that you were watching this for approximately two hours.
 9    Can you tell us, during that two hours, how long did the screams last?
10       A.   The people were crying and screaming, the carpets were on fire,
11    and the house was on fire for about two hours.  And the last thing I could
12    hear was the voice of a child who was 10 years old, Aida Kurspahic, who
13    said her last words, and she said, "Mommy, save me."
14       Q.   Did you know where your own son was at this point in time?
15       A.   No.
16       Q.   Did you know whether or not he escaped the house?
17       A.   I knew that he had escaped before me, because we were wondering
18    what to do if the house is set on fire or if they come back to kill us
19    all.  We said that we would jump out, no matter what happened.  And I went
20    over to the window, and I was thinking about what to do and what might
21    happen.
22       Q.   After he jumped -- you testified earlier that you saw him jump out
23    of the window.  After he jumped out of the window, did you see where he
24    went?
25       A.   We were next to each other while we were still at the window.  He

 1    jumped out first, and I jumped out after he did.
 2       Q.   After you watched the house burn for two hours, what did you do?
 3       A.   After that, I followed the creek and I took shelter in that
 4    sewage.  I didn't know where to go, and I stayed there for three days in
 5    the canal.
 6       Q.   During those three days in the sewage canal, did you see any other
 7    survivors of the fire?
 8       A.   I didn't see them.  I didn't know who survived.  But it was later
 9    on that I learned from their families that they had survived, Edim
10    Kurspahic and Hasib Kurspahic.
11       Q.   Were you able to get anything to eat while you remained there for
12    three days?
13       A.   No.  I lost consciousness three times, I was so hungry.  But then
14    as I lay down, the water would trickle down on my head, and that helped me
15    regain consciousness.
16       Q.   Could you describe for us the condition of your injuries at this
17    point in time?
18       A.   At that time, the condition of my injuries was very bad.  I looked
19    terrible.  I even had worms all over my body.  Wherever there was any
20    blood on my body, there were also worms.  I didn't have anything to
21    bandage my wounds.  There was nothing I could do alone, so I was in a very
22    bad shape.
23       Q.   Did there come a time when you eventually left the sewage canal?
24       A.   I got out of the sewage canal on the third night.  That is what I
25    guess, because I didn't have a watch.  It could have been around 11.00

 1    p.m.  And I managed to get out.  I wasn't able to go back, and I actually
 2    didn't have enough strength to go the other way.  So there was some
 3    rubbish in the canal, and I put those boxes one on top of another.  The
 4    canal was some 500 metres long and it leads to the Drina.  So I stepped on
 5    those crates that I found there and managed to get out of the canal.
 6    After I got out, I found an onion and I ate that onion, red onion, but it
 7    burnt my stomach.  I plucked some plums that were still green and I ate
 8    those too, and I was trying to figure out where to go.
 9       Q.   Where did you go?
10       A.   I went in the direction of Kosovo Polje because the local people,
11    the residents who lived there, had remained behind.  But there were also
12    other people who had come from elsewhere, people who had fled from their
13    houses, and they were all staying in Kosovo Polje.  So I thought that I'd
14    better go there and stay with them, and if I shouldn't find them, I could
15    continue towards the Drina.
16       Q.   And can you describe for us how you got from this canal to Kosovo
17    Polje?
18       A.   After I got out of the canal, I followed the woods, and I was
19    walking slightly above the road.  I didn't follow the road, the main road,
20    the asphalt road.  I didn't dare.  I was hiding in the bushes, and I
21    passed by the area where the new bridge was -- had been constructed,
22    towards Crni Vrh.  And I passed by that area.  There used to be a
23    slaughterhouse there before the war, and I passed one of their guards
24    there.
25       Q.   Did the guard see you?

 1       A.   No.
 2       Q.   Did you --
 3       A.   In one of the creeks above the slaughterhouse, there were some
 4    dogs, and they started barking.  The guard felt something.  He realised
 5    that the dogs were about to attack someone, so he switched off his
 6    flashlight.
 7       Q.   Did you continue in the direction of Kosovo Polje?
 8       A.   Yes.  I crawled through the grass, through the meadow so he
 9    wouldn't notice me, and I crossed the road at the junction for Vilina
10    Vlas.  There is a house there, a building, resident house, and I passed
11    that area and finally reached the fields of Kosovo Polje, the property of
12    the people living in Kosovo Polje.
13       Q.   Did you arrive in Kosovo Polje on the same day that you left the
14    canal, or the same night?
15       A.   I arrived on the same night.  I couldn't tell you exactly what
16    time it was, but it must have been 11.00 p.m.  I was waiting for the
17    situation to calm down a little bit, and I reached the porch of Mustafa
18    Kos's house, and I lie down a little bit.
19       Q.   At the time that you lied down on that porch, had you met
20    anybody living in Kosovo Polje?
21       A.   At that time, I didn't see anyone.  However, in the early morning
22    hours, people started getting up.
23       Q.   Did you ask any of these people for help?
24       A.   When I saw them getting up and going to their barns and yards --
25    actually, getting up from there, because they did not dare sleep in their

 1    own houses, so they were staying in their barns.  So I approached one man
 2    there, and I asked if there was anyone who could bandage my wounds.  The
 3    man could not recognise me.  I was in a very bad shape, dishevelled.  I
 4    had traces of soot on my face from the fire that happened in that house.
 5    So he asked me, did you pass by this area a few days ago?  And when I told
 6    him I did, he understood what had happened.
 7       Q.   Without telling us his name, did you know him previously?
 8       A.   I knew him as being one of the locals.  But at that moment, I just
 9    couldn't remember his name.  I just realised that he was a local resident
10    of that village, that he was a Muslim, too, because I was afraid that the
11    local population might have abandoned that village as well.  So I didn't
12    dare come out right away.
13       Q.   I'm going to ask you to look at that sheet of paper in front of
14    you and ask you, did you meet one of the people listed on the bottom
15    portion of that sheet in Kosovo Polje at this time?  And if you do, I
16    would ask you to refer to them by number.
17       A.   This number here, 81.  She was the one who came out and bandaged
18    my wounds, helped me change my clothes.  She could see the wounds on my
19    body, and they helped me.
20       Q.   How long did you remain in Kosovo Polje?
21       A.   I remained in Kosovo Polje with them for another two days.
22    Because they were also confused.  They didn't know what to do, whether to
23    remain in their houses or not.  Rasim Huskovic went to see Stanimir
24    Pecikoza to ask him where they should go.  I was still hiding.  I didn't
25    dare come out.  So when he came from Stanimir Pecikoza, people asked him

 1    what Stanimir had told him.  He said at one point that the women and
 2    children should move out, whereas the men should remain and work in the
 3    fields, continue working in the fields.
 4       Q.   When you left Kosovo Polje, where did you go?
 5       A.   When the time came for us to leave Kosovo Polje, Stanimir Pecikoza
 6    told us on the second day that we should not go there.  That's what he
 7    said to Rasim Huskovic.  Stanko had been killed, and he said do not come
 8    out in the open, try and find shelter somewhere, go into hiding.  He said
 9    Milan Lukic had killed him on the road to Uzice and further on to
10    Belgrade.
11       Q.   Where did you go when you left Kosovo Polje?
12       A.   The men left.  After he told them to go into hiding and to
13    disappear, they crossed the river.  And around 7.00 p.m., they come back
14    to take the elderly women and children by boat to the other side of the
15    river, and that is how I crossed over to the left bank of the Drina.
16       Q.   How did the men cross over the river?
17       A.   They used large tires, tractor tires, to cross the river and other
18    things, anything they could get hold of to cross the water.
19       Q.   Did there come a time when you were eventually able to see a
20    doctor?
21       A.   I managed to find a doctor when I arrived in (redacted), the
22    village of Jelacici, and I went to see a doctor in Crni Vrh.
23       Q.   Did you receive any other medical treatment for your treatment
24    around this period of time?
25       A.   No, only the bandages that [redacted] applied, but that was all,

 1    while we were there together.
 2       Q.   Did there come a time when you went to Gorazde?
 3       A.   When I went to see the doctor, he told me that I should go to
 4    Gorazde as soon as possible to see someone there because my wound was in a
 5    very bad condition.  It had festered, and I thought that was the end of
 6    me.  And when I finally reached Gorazde, I was admitted into hospital
 7    there.
 8       Q.   And how long did you remain in the hospital for treatment of your
 9    injuries?
10       A.   I stayed there for about 25 days, because there was shortage of
11    space in the hospital.  There were much worse cases than mine.  There were
12    a lot of wounded.  So after a while, I left the hospital.  And when I was
13    in Medzedza, I still changed bandages on my wounds.
14       Q.   When did you first learn that your son had survived that night?
15       A.   I didn't know what had happened to him for quite a while, for
16    about five months or more.  I didn't know that he was alive.
17       Q.   And when was the next time after this night that you saw your son
18    again?
19       A.   I saw him five years later.
20       Q.   I'm going to ask you to describe for the Chamber:  Do you have
21    lasting effects from the injuries that you suffered that night?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   Can you describe what they are?
24       A.   One of the consequences is the pain in my arm, because this area
25    here was damaged.  I often have cramps in my neck and, consequently,

 1    headaches.
 2       Q.   The injury you have in your leg, did you also receive treatment
 3    for that leg or for that injury?
 4       A.   Yes, I was treated for that as well.  In Kosovo Polje, they put
 5    bandages on my wound, they treated it with some herbs and brandy.  And
 6    then I received other treatment in Gorazde as well.
 7       Q.   And have the events of this night affected you in any other way
 8    since then?
 9       A.   Well, yes, yes, they did.
10       Q.   And how is that?
11       A.   How shall I put it?  I often have anxiety, anxiety attacks,
12    fears.
13            MR. GROOME:  I'm going to ask that a black-and-white copy of 17.3,
14    Prosecution 17.3, be placed on the desk in front of the witness.
15       Q.   Witness 13, I'm going to ask you to make certain marks on this
16    piece of paper.  I'm going to ask that you do it with the fine-point red
17    pen that's to your right.  And the first mark I'm going to ask you to do
18    is to put "VG13" at the very bottom of that paper to indicate that it's
19    you that's made these markings.
20       A.   [Marks]
21       Q.   I'm going to ask you to put the number "1" on the roof of the
22    house you described as belonging to Jusuf Memic.
23       A.   [Marks]
24       Q.   I'm going to ask you to put the number "2" on the roof of the
25    house that you described as belonging to Mujo Memic.

 1       A.   [Marks]
 2       Q.   I'm going to ask you to put the number "3" on the house you've
 3    described as being set on fire.
 4       A.   [Marks]
 5       Q.   Now, in your testimony, you talked about a source of light coming
 6    from a street lamp.  I'm going to ask you, as best you're able, to show us
 7    where that is.  And I'd ask you to indicate that by using the first letter
 8    of the Bosnian word for "light," "S."
 9       A.   [Marks]
10       Q.   And I'd ask you to draw an arrow to indicate the direction in
11    which the light was shining.
12       A.   [Marks]
13       Q.   Now, in your testimony here today, you've mentioned seven
14    different times that you saw Mitar Vasiljevic on that day.  In your
15    testimony, you said that you saw him with a piece of paper.  Do you recall
16    that testimony?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   I would ask you to put "MV1" to indicate where he was at the time
19    you saw that.
20       A.   [Marks]
21       Q.   You described his presence when several men were taken to bury
22    some other men.  I'd ask you to put "MV2" to indicate where he was when
23    you made that observation.
24       A.   [Marks]
25       Q.   You mentioned in your testimony a time when Mr. Vasiljevic came to

 1    the house in the company of Milan Lukic.  I would ask you to put "MV3" to
 2    indicate where he was that time that you observed him.
 3       A.   [Marks]
 4       Q.   You next testified that you saw Mitar Vasiljevic with a torch or
 5    flashlight.  I would ask you to put "MV4" to indicate where he was the
 6    first time you saw him with the flashlight or torch.
 7       A.   [Marks]
 8       Q.   You've also testified that you walked past him on your way to the
 9    Omeragic house.  I would ask you to indicate that location by placing
10    "MV5."
11       A.   [Marks]
12       Q.   Next, you testified seeing him when Milan Lukic lit this device.
13    I'd ask you to put "MV6" to show where he was at that point in time.
14       A.   [Marks]
15       Q.   And, finally, you testified that you saw him as you jumped out of
16    the window.  Would you please put "MV7" to indicate where he was at that
17    point in time.
18       A.   [Marks]
19            MR. GROOME:  I would ask that that now be placed on the ELMO and
20    that the witness be handed the pointer.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome, this is going to provide the same problem
22    as the last few have.  The red may show up when you see the photograph in
23    the flesh, as it were, but it never shows up on this.
24            I had asked you, in relation to a previous one of these, where
25    there were a lot of numbers marked, that you should get hold of the

 1    exhibit and somehow mark it up more closely or clearly on some other
 2    document and then reproduce it so that we've got it.  It would help, when
 3    we finally get this one into evidence, if we also had a sheet of paper
 4    which indicated what the 11 different markings are.
 5            MR. GROOME:  In addition to the printed record, you would like a
 6    summary of that record?
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, you have to go through the transcript to find
 8    it.  If we're looking at photographs later, it would be far better to have
 9    attached to it a sheet of paper with all those numbers, what they are
10    meant to be, a document that we can actually see where the markings are.
11            MR. GROOME:  We'll provide that, Your Honour.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
13            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I would propose -- I know there's a
14    problem with the ELMO.  It doesn't enable us to see very clearly.  I will
15    ask the witness to quickly point out the different marks she's made, and I
16    will speak with the court deputy about furnishing a colour copy of all of
17    these exhibits to the Chamber.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  That would be very helpful, that she does it now.
19    But we'll have to get the video to see what it was, you see.
20            MR. GROOME:  I'll work with the court deputy to provide colour
21    copies.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you very much.  And of course Mr. Domazet
23    should get a copy.
24            MR. GROOME:  Yes, of course.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.

 1            MR. GROOME:
 2       Q.   I would ask you to take the pointer.  Because it's difficult for
 3    us to see the marks on the television, I'm going to ask you to point out
 4    some of the markings that you've made, using the pointer you've just been
 5    handed.  I will ask you to keep your hands away -- Witness 13, in order to
 6    preserve your identity, you have to sit back in your chair.  Okay?
 7       A.   Mm-hmm.
 8       Q.   I will ask you just to reach with the pointer, and then I will
 9    just go through one by one the items you've marked with the pen and ask
10    you to point them out with the pointer.  I'd ask you to point to the house
11    of Jusuf Memic that you marked with the number "1."
12       A.   [Indicates]
13       Q.   I'd ask you to point to the house of Mujo Memic that you marked
14    with the number "2."
15       A.   [Indicates]
16       Q.   I'd ask you to point to the house of Mr. Omeragic that you
17    indicated with the number "3."
18       A.   [Indicates]
19       Q.   And now I'd ask you to indicate where you wrote the letter "S" to
20    indicate where you saw light coming from from the street.  And I think
21    we'll have to move the picture up a little bit on the ELMO.
22       A.   [Indicates]
23       Q.   Now I'd ask you to point where you marked "MV1" at the time that
24    you saw Mr. Vasiljevic when he had this piece of paper.
25       A.   [Indicates]

 1       Q.   I'd ask you now to show us where you marked "MV2," where you saw
 2    him at the time that men were taken to do some burials.
 3       A.   [Indicates]
 4       Q.   Now I'd ask you to indicate "MV3," where you saw Mr. Vasiljevic in
 5    the company of Milan Lukic for the first time.
 6       A.   [Indicates]
 7       Q.   Now I'd ask you to indicate where you saw -- where you marked
 8    "MV4," the first time you saw Mr. Vasiljevic with the flashlight.
 9       A.   [Indicates]
10       Q.   I'd now ask you to show us where you marked "MV5" at the point in
11    time when you walked past Mr. Vasiljevic.
12       A.   [Indicates]
13       Q.   I'd ask you now to show us where you marked "MV6," where
14    Mr. Vasiljevic was at the time Milan Lukic lit this device.
15       A.   [Indicates]
16       Q.   And finally I'd ask you to indicate where "MV7" is, where
17    Mr. Vasiljevic was at the time you jumped out of the window.
18       A.   [Indicates]
19            MR. GROOME:  Thank you.  Your Honour, at this time I would tender
20    into evidence Prosecution Number 17-3-VG13.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  Any objection, Mr. Domazet?
22            MR. DOMAZET:  No, Your Honour.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  That will be Exhibit P17.3-VG13.
24            MR. GROOME:  I'd now ask that a black-and-white copy of
25    Exhibit 17.7 be placed on the desk in front of the witness.

 1       Q.   Madam, I'd ask you to again -- I'd ask you to begin by writing
 2    with the red pen "VG13" on the bottom of this photograph to indicate you
 3    are the person who's made these markings.
 4       A.   [Marks].
 5       Q.   I would now ask you to circle and place the number "13" inside
 6    that circle to indicate the window that you jumped out of, if that's
 7    indicated on this photograph.
 8       A.   [Marks]
 9       Q.   I would now ask you to put the letters "MV" to show us where
10    Mr. Vasiljevic was at the time you jumped out of that window.
11       A.   [Marks]
12       Q.   I would now ask you to put the initials "ML" to indicate where
13    Mr. Milan Lukic was at the time you jumped out of that window.
14       A.   [Marks]
15       Q.   And when you are finished that, I would ask that the usher place
16    that on the ELMO.  Once again, I would ask the witness be given the
17    pointer.
18            I would ask you with the pointer to indicate where you marked
19     "13," the window that you jumped out of.
20       A.   [Indicates]
21       Q.   I would now ask you to indicate where you marked "MV," the place
22    where you saw Mitar Vasiljevic at the time you jumped out of the window.
23       A.   [Indicates]
24       Q.   And finally, I would ask you to indicate where you marked "ML,"
25    where you say Mr. Lukic was at the time you jumped out of the window.

 1       A.   [Indicates]
 2       Q.   Thank you.
 3            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, at this time I would tender that as
 4    Exhibit 17.7-VG13.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Any objections, Mr. Domazet?
 6            MR. DOMAZET: No, Your Honour.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  That would be Exhibit Number 17.7-VG13.
 8            MR. GROOME:
 9       Q.   Witness VG13, would I be correct in saying that you knew you were
10    related to most of the victims in the Omeragic house that night?
11       A.   I think so, yes.
12       Q.   Approximately how many members of your family were lost that
13    night?
14       A.   There were seven of them.
15            MR. GROOME:  I'm going to ask that the witness be shown
16    Prosecution Document Number 150.  I would note that the first two pages
17    are in English, and the third page is a B/C/S translation of the first
18    two.
19            JUDGE HUNT:  And I hope you will also note, Mr. Groome, there is
20    no challenge to the evidence of two previous witnesses in relation to
21    these lists.
22            MR. GROOME:  This is a different list.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  Is it?  Is it more detailed?
24            MR. GROOME:  There are some different people on this list.
25            I would ask that the witness be shown page number 3 of this

 1    exhibit or document.
 2       Q.   I would ask you to review the names on this page.  Let us know
 3    when you are finished.
 4            Are you finished?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   Are the 56 names contained in this document people that you know
 7    or know to have been in the fire that night?
 8       A.   They were, all of them, except for six of them.
 9       Q.   Which six?  Are you saying that six of these people were not in
10    the fire that night?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   Which six on this list of 56 were not in the fire that night?
13       A.   Kurspahic, Hasib, because he, too, escaped.  Edhem Kurspahic, but
14    he died.  Then VG18 was not there, VG84.  And these others, so that I
15    shouldn't name them.
16       Q.   I would ask -- the names that you have mentioned and the VG
17    numbers, those names are not on this list.  I would ask you of this list,
18    are there any people on this list - and if you would refer to them by the
19    number in front of their name - that were not in the fire that night?
20       A.   Oh, no, no.
21       Q.   Of the names that are numbered 1 through 56, have you ever seen
22    any of these people after the 14th of June, 1992?
23       A.   No.
24            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, at this time I would tender that
25    document --

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Any objection, Mr. Domazet?
 2            MR. DOMAZET:  No, Your Honour.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Exhibit P150, and it will be under seal.
 4            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, for purposes of that exhibit, it has
 5    been sanitised to a point where I don't think it is necessary for it to be
 6    place under seal.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Except that she has said that she was related to a
 8    great number of them.  I think it should stay under seal.
 9            MR. GROOME:  Okay.  I have no objections to that, Your Honour.
10            The next exhibit I would ask to be shown to the witness is a
11    12-part exhibit, 58.1 through 58.12.  I would ask that 58.1 be placed on
12    the ELMO.
13       Q.   I would ask, Witness VG13, do you recognise who is depicted in
14    58.1?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   Who is that?
17       A.   Jasmina Vila.
18       Q.   Is she the woman you referred to earlier in your testimony as
19    coming from Musici and being taken out by Milan Lukic from the Memic
20    house?
21       A.   Yes.
22            MR. GROOME:  I would ask that 58.2 be placed on the ELMO.
23       Q.   Do you recognise the older woman in this picture?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   And who is it?

 1       A.   Rabija Sadikovic.
 2            MR. GROOME:  I would ask that 58.3 be placed on the ELMO.  And I
 3    would ask that the witness be given a pointer.
 4       Q.   I would ask you to point out the different people on this
 5    photograph.  Without telling us your relationship to any of these people,
 6    would you please tell us who they are.
 7       A.   Osman Kurspahic; Hasan, he died; his wife, Ajka; daughter-in-law
 8    Ismeta; granddaughter, Aida; and Almir, grandson, Osman's grandson.
 9       Q.   Of the people in this picture, which ones died in the fire that
10    night?
11       A.   All of them.
12       Q.   At the time this picture was taken, was Ismeta Kurspahic pregnant?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   Did that child die in the fire?
15       A.   He died.  He was two years old.  His name was Vahid.
16            MR. GROOME:  I would ask that 58.4 be placed on the ELMO.
17       Q.   I would ask for you to identify any victims that are depicted in
18    this picture.
19       A.   Yes, again, Osman Kurspahic; his wife, Ajka; Osman's sister,
20    Zineta; and grandson-- again, his grandson.
21       Q.   Which of these people died in the fire that night?
22       A.   His sister is the only one who didn't die that night.
23            MR. GROOME:  I would ask that 58.5 be placed on the ELMO.
24       Q.   Do you recognise who was in this picture?
25       A.   Yes.

 1       Q.   And who is it?
 2       A.   (redacted), from the village of Crnca.
 3       Q.   Is this the man that Mitar Vasiljevic gave a piece of paper to?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5            MR. GROOME:  I would ask that the witness be shown 58.6.
 6       Q.   Are there any victims of the fire in this picture?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   What is the name of that person?
 9       A.   Ifeta Kurspahic.
10       Q.   Is she also one of the women that Milan Lukic took from the house
11    of Jusuf Memic?
12       A.   Yes.
13            MR. GROOME:  I would ask that 58.7 be placed on the ELMO.
14       Q.   Are some of the people in this photo victims of the fire?
15       A.   Mujesira Kurspahic died, Eniz Kurspahic's wife.
16       Q.   Aside from her, did anybody else in this picture die that night?
17       A.   Only Mujesira.  These are her brothers.  They did not, nor did her
18    husband.  He didn't either.
19            MR. GROOME:  I ask that 58.8 be placed on the ELMO.
20       Q.   Do you recognise this photograph?
21       A.   Yes.  Bula Kurspahic.
22       Q.   Did she die that night?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   I would ask that you be shown 58.9.
25            Are any of the people depicted in this photograph victims?

 1       A.   Djehva Kurspahic and her son, Ismet, died.  This is her husband,
 2    Fehrat Kurspahic.
 3            MR. GROOME:  I would ask that 58.10 be placed on the ELMO.
 4       Q.   Are any of the people depicted in this photograph victims of the
 5    fire?
 6       A.   Hasib Kurspahic, yes --
 7       Q.   You may finish, Witness 13.  I apologise.
 8       A.   And his daughter Ada.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  If you would like to take a break, madam.  It's
10    nearly the lunch break anyway.  Or are you ready to go on?
11            MR. GROOME:  There are two more photographs that I would like you
12    to look at.  We can do that, as the Judge suggests, now or later.
13            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I can.  I can, yes.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Are you sure?
15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm sure.
16            MR. GROOME:  I'd ask that 58.11 be placed on the ELMO.
17       Q.   Are some of the victims depicted in this photograph?
18       A.   This one did not die.  Hasib was there.  He did.  These others
19    didn't either.  And these did, were victims.
20       Q.   And can you tell us the names of just the victims, please?
21       A.   Hajrija Kurspahic, an old woman, Hasan Kurspahic's mother; his
22    wife, Fata Kurspahic, Hasib's wife; Ramiza Kurspahic, Becar Kurspahic's
23    wife.
24            MR. GROOME:  I'd ask now that the witness be shown the final
25    photograph, which is 58.12.

 1       A.   Kada Sehic and Rasim.
 2       Q.   And was one of these people a victim that night?
 3       A.   Rasim Sehic was taken away before his wife, Kada, got killed in
 4    the fire.
 5            MR. GROOME:  Thank you, Witness VG13.
 6            Your Honour, I have no further questions.
 7            I'm sorry, Your Honour.  At this time I would tender into evidence
 8    Exhibits 58.1 through 58.12.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Any objection, Mr. Domazet?
10            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] No, Your Honour, I have no
11    objection, though I do note that these exhibits were on the ELMO next to
12    the witness when she was indicating their names, and the names are
13    indicated on the documents themselves.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Is there some challenge to her identification?
15            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] No.
16            JUDGE HUNT:  I would have thought --
17            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Even if there hadn't been the names,
18    I know my neighbours.  And as for the gentleman who put this question to
19    me, I see him for the first time now.  But if I was to see him five years
20    later, I would still recognise him, though my brain is functioning in
21    spite of all that I have been through, as I have told you, in the way I've
22    told you.
23            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you, madam.
24            Mr. Groome, I don't know why they have to be put in this way.
25    Surely if there's to be no dispute, they could have been just tendered.

 1    It really is unnecessary to put a witness through this sort of thing.
 2    Anyway, it will be Exhibit P58, 1 to 12.
 3            Now, is that the end of evidence-in-chief?
 4            MR. GROOME:  Of this witness, Your Honour, yes.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  I think we'll come back at 2.30, Mr. Domazet.  We'll
 6    adjourn now until 2.30.

 3            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet.
 4            MR. DOMAZET:  [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.
 5                          Cross-examined by Mr. Domazet:
 6       Q.   Madam, good afternoon.
 7       A.   Good afternoon.
 8       Q.   I should like to ask you several questions concerning the events
 9    of the 14th of June, 1992, on Sunday morning.
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   You said that several days prior to that event, that there had
12    been some incursions into your village and that they were looking for men
13    and weapons but that the men were no longer there.  On the 14th of June,
14    when you left the village, that is, women, children and the elderly, were
15    men still in the village or had they already left the village?
16       A.   Let me tell you, sir.  The men who were absent from their homes
17    and for whom they searched were no longer there.  Just women, children and
18    the elderly.
19       Q.   Madam, you spoke about the fact that they were looking for them.
20    Is it because they already suspected that they had gone to the woods to
21    join what you called "the Green Berets," that is, some kind of army that
22    would be their enemy?
23       A.   Yes, they had escaped to the woods to save themselves, not to join
24    any army.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  Just a moment.  Madam, because you and counsel are

 1    both speaking the same language, there is a problem for the interpreters
 2    being able to keep up with you.  You'll notice that Mr. Domazet pauses for
 3    a moment before he asks you a question.  You should pause before you
 4    answer the question so that the interpreters, who are giving us your
 5    answers in English and French, can keep up with us.  Do you understand
 6    that?
 7            THE WITNESS:  [In English] Okay.
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Yes, Mr. Domazet.
 9            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation]
10       Q.   If I understood you correctly, Dusan Grujic was the one who
11    escorted your column to Greben.
12       A.   Dusan Grujic, my neighbour, yes, he was the one who accompanied us
13    all the way to Greben.
14       Q.   And Lipovac, Milorad or Micun, was the one who accompanied you
15    after Greben?
16       A.   Yes, Milorad, and his nickname is "Micun."  That's how people
17    called him.
18       Q.   Did any of you ask Lipovac to escort your group, or was it
19    something he did on his own or pursuant to somebody's order?
20       A.   He volunteered, when he came to our village, to tell us to get
21    ready for the journey, that the buses would come to take us there.  And
22    since the buses didn't show up, they said that they would accompany us.
23       Q.   Yes, but that had taken place several days prior to that.
24    However, on this day in Greben, you saw Lipovac while passing through the
25    village; is that right?

 1       A.   Yes.  Milorad Lipovac has a house near the road, and we knew each
 2    other as neighbours.  He used to work in the Varda company in Visegrad.
 3       Q.   Well, at the time you passed by his house and saw him, did any one
 4    of you ask him to accompany you, or did he offer to escort you on his
 5    own?
 6       A.   When we gathered at Greben, Dusan Grujic told us that the buses
 7    would arrive.  And it was at that moment that Milorad Lipovac came to us,
 8    and he said that the buses would arrive by 9.00.  However, no buses showed
 9    up, so he said that he would accompany us so that we wouldn't go there
10    alone, that he would act as some kind of security, of course with a rifle
11    in his hand.  He carried a rifle.
12       Q.   What about Dusan Grujic?  Did he go back or did he continue with
13    you?
14       A.   Dusan Grujic went as far as Banja.
15       Q.   How far did Lipovac accompany you?
16       A.   Up to the Rzav bridge, and we lost him there.
17       Q.   While outside the new hotel in Visegrad, you said that there was a
18    man, Borjo Perzevic.  You said that he addressed you while you were in
19    front of the hotel.  Do you remember whether the individual in question
20    was wearing a uniform at that time or not?
21       A.   Yes, he was.  The individual was wearing a uniform.  He also had a
22    black cap on his head with the Serbian cockade on his cap.
23       Q.   Let me move on, madam, to the events which occurred in Pionirska
24    Street.
25       A.   Yes.

 1       Q.   You said you had arrived at the Memic's house and that you stayed
 2    in one of those houses.  After a while, after you had changed your clothes
 3    and had a cup of coffee, Mitar arrived bringing a kind of certificate.
 4    That was the first time that you saw him on that day; is that correct?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   At that time, were you accompanied by the individual whom you
 7    identified as (redacted) from the village of Sase?  Was he with you at
 8    that time?
 9       A.   Yes, he was.  We were all there together, not only Mujo.
10       Q.   Madam, when you say that you were all there together, you are
11    referring to all of you who had come from (redacted) and Sase?
12       A.   Yes, of course, to all of us.
13       Q.   In which of these two houses did you stay at that time?
14       A.   There were three families in Mujo Memic's house, and the others
15    were in Jusuf Memic's house.  The houses are next to each other.
16       Q.   So you were not in one and the same house, all of you, as you have
17    indicated a moment ago?  That was actually my question.
18       A.   We were in Mujo Memic's house, that is, Jusuf's son's house, and
19    he brought this certificate with several words written on it.  He gave
20    that piece of paper to Mujo, since he knew Mujo very well, like everybody
21    else.  So the three -- those three families, including myself, were all
22    there in Mujo Memic's house -- on the porch of Mujo Memic's house.
23       Q.   When you say "on the porch," you mean that you were outside the
24    house, that is, in front of the house?  You were not inside the house.
25    You were on this porch or terrace.  Is that correct?

 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   Is this porch visible from Pionirska Street?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   You have mentioned three families.  Was (redacted) amongst
 5    them?  Was he with you?
 6       A.   (redacted) was about to join us in Mujo Memic's house because
 7    he wanted to ask thing of Alija Kurspahic.
 8       Q.   At the moment Mitar arrived; is that how it was at that particular
 9    moment?
10       A.   Yes, yes.  He saw him then, at that moment.
11       Q.   At the moment they saw each other?  Did they talk before Mitar
12    actually entered the house where you were with the piece of paper?
13       A.   Yes, they greeted each other in the usual manner, and it was at
14    that moment that he gave him the piece of paper.
15       Q.   So he gave him the piece of paper in the street between the two
16    houses at the moment Mujo was on his way to this other house.  Am I
17    correct in understanding your answer?
18       A.   Yes, not in the street, but at the entrance to the porch in front
19    of the street.
20       Q.   So Mujo took this piece of paper.  Did he continue on his way to
21    the other house, or did he go back to the first house from where he had
22    gone to your house?
23       A.   Yes, Mujo took the piece of paper, and he came to us.  He was
24    holding the paper like this, and he wanted us to read what was written on
25    it.

 1       Q.   At that moment, had Mitar already left, or was he still there?
 2       A.   At that moment, he was maybe still standing there.  He stayed for
 3    another five minutes or so.  He told us that we should not be afraid.  And
 4    after that, he left.  He went down the street.
 5       Q.   Was it Mujo who read what was written on the piece of paper, or
 6    did you personally read what was written on it?
 7       A.   Mujo was showing the piece of paper to all of us, and I could
 8    personally read it because I was standing next to Mujo. [redacted]
 9    [redacted].
10       Q.   Was the text handwritten or typed out?
11       A.   Handwritten.
12       Q.   And what was written on it was something to the effect that
13    nothing would happen to you; is that correct?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Are you aware that before that, prior to that encounter and the
16    handing over of the paper, that Mujo and Mitar had already seen each other
17    on the street, that they had already met before that?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   I'm referring to that particular day and that particular arrival.
20    Do we understand each other?
21       A.   Yes.  Mitar brought him a glass of brandy for them to drink it
22    together.
23       Q.   So prior to that event, they had already seen each other and they
24    had had a brandy together.  Did you perhaps see the glass or a bottle in
25    Mitar's hands?

 1       A.   Yes.  It was a very small bottle, not a big one; half-a-litre
 2    bottle.  This was taking place in front of the house, between the two
 3    houses, near a shed where they kept wood.
 4       Q.   And just one more question concerning this issue.  So before the
 5    certificate was given to him, they had already been together, and Mitar
 6    was holding a half-a-litre bottle in his hand and he offered Mujo some
 7    brandy to drink; is that correct?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   And just one additional detail so that we don't have to go back to
10    that.  Madam, you've had a list in front of you today, a list that you
11    made yourself of persons who were there on that day.  And if you remember,
12    the name of "Mujo Jasarevic" figures somewhere at the end of the list.  Is
13    that a mistake, or is it really (redacted) that we're talking about
14    there?
15       A.   It's not a mistake concerning (redacted), because Mujo
16    Jasarevic was also there.  That man is alive.
17       Q.   So it was (redacted) who was with you, and he is the
18    individual you have just spoken about?
19       A.   Yes.  And he used to work in -- as a carpenter in the Varda
20    company.
21       Q.   Concerning the incident involving those men who were taken to bury
22    some dead bodies, do you remember whether that event took place before
23    Mitar came and brought the certificate or after?
24       A.   The certificate was brought by Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic after, and
25    those men went away to bury the bodies before that.

 1       Q.   So that particular event, those men going away to bury the dead,
 2    had taken place before Mitar came to bring you this piece of paper, the
 3    certificate.  Since you have confirmed that it was the first time that you
 4    saw him, could you tell us, please, once again, at the time those men were
 5    taken away, who were the individuals who had come to take them away and
 6    whether Mitar was with them at all?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   What do you mean when you say "yes"?  That Mitar was with them?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   If that was so, then I can conclude that you had seen him before
11    he brought the certificate.  And you have just indicated, as you indicated
12    before, that that was actually the first time that you saw him that day?
13       A.   Yes.  He came with those men, who were some kind of policemen, to
14    take those people to Nezuci to bury the dead, Safet and his wife who were
15    buried at the cemetery in Straziste.
16       Q.   Were those men taken by the police or someone else; do you know
17    that?  Did you see that or did you perhaps hear about that from other
18    people?
19       A.   We saw it.  It's not something that I heard from others.
20       Q.   Madam, you gave a statement in 1998 for the first time, when you
21    gave a statement to the investigator of the Tribunal in the month of
22    February, the 12th and the 13th of February, 1998.  Do you remember that
23    statement?
24       A.   Yes, I do.
25       Q.   Let me read you a portion of that statement, and I should like you

 1    to confirm whether that is indeed what you stated and whether there is any
 2    difference in what you have testified about.  Page 519, last paragraph,
 3    for the benefit of the interpreters to whom I have distributed both the
 4    English and the B/C/S version of the statement.  So the relevant portion
 5    reads as follows:
 6            "At one point, two Serb men came to the house.  I did not see
 7    them, so I do not know who they were.  I heard that they had come.  They
 8    took away Hasan Becar and Edhem Kurspahic to bury a man, Safet, last name
 9    unknown, and his wife, a veterinarian and his wife."  That is, the two of
10    them.  "I heard from Becar and Edhem that they buried the bodies in
11    Straziste cemetery.  Later on, they took away Alija Kurspahic, Medo
12    Kurspahic, and Redzo Memisevic.  This group was taken to Nezuci to bury
13    some men who had been killed there."
14            And then there is a sentence here which is not relevant here:
15            "There were seven men with us in that group who were elderly.  All
16    the younger men had fled into the woods."
17            And then the text goes on:
18            "Mitar Vasiljevic came to the house sometime after the men taken
19    for the burial were brought back.  He told us not to worry, that we would
20    be taken in the morning, that we would be taken to Kladanj in the
21    morning."
22            Madam, you have just heard this statement.  You make no mention of
23    any certificate.  You don't say anything about having seen any such piece
24    of paper or a certificate.  Do you remember that statement?  Is this
25    correct, what you stated here in your statement?

 1       A.   Yes.  Mitar Vasiljevic brought a piece of paper on which he had
 2    written that we shouldn't be afraid of anything.  And when these men were
 3    taken to bury the dead, he was standing behind their back for show.  And
 4    everything else, I may have mixed it up a little.  But consider that I
 5    went through, it's good that I'm still in my right mind.  I saw him well.
 6    I saw him standing there.  I'm sure of that.
 7       Q.   Yes, madam.  But it says here that these persons came before Mitar
 8    Vasiljevic came for the first time and that they brought those men back
 9    before he came.  That is what it says in this statement.  Is that right
10    and did you say that?
11       A.   Yes, the men were brought back.  And when they came from those
12    places, they started crying, saying that none of us would survive, and
13    asked Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic how he and Lukic quarreled in town and how he
14    chased Hana Kurspahic to kill her, who worked in the municipality.
15       Q.   Excuse me, madam, but please answer my questions.
16       A.   I'm answering exactly as I know.
17       Q.   My question was whether what I read out is your statement given in
18    1998 and whether it is correct.
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   So Mitar Vasiljevic came to the house for the first time when
21    these men were brought back after the burial?
22       A.   And he came before, when they were about to go.
23       Q.   Well, then, your statement is not correct, madam, the one you gave
24    in 1998, if what you are saying now is correct.  Or maybe you didn't say
25    that.  My question is:  Did you say this, and is it correct?

 1       A.   I think my statement is correct.  I'm quite sure of that, because
 2    I don't wish to blame anyone for something he didn't do, nor do I want to
 3    accuse anyone differently from what I actually experienced and saw.
 4            Your Honour, is it -- it doesn't matter who were the victims,
 5    whether it was Muslims or Serbs.  If I had been present, I would come to
 6    tell the truth, but I wouldn't put additional charges on anyone.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, may I suggest the easier way around
 8    this, because your questions are open to misinterpretation.  What you want
 9    her to agree is she had not mentioned in her statement this business of
10    the certificate.
11            Now, isn't that the easy way, rather than asking her, really at a
12    longer level, the statement and asking her whether that was correct?  She
13    says that is correct, and you say it's incomplete.  So the issue is
14    whether she gave any reference in her statement to this certificate.
15            Now, that's a very simple question, and you should ask it, if I
16    may suggest, and we will get on a lot more quickly.
17            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] I agree, Your Honour.  But the
18    question of the certificate was raised because when I quoted from the
19    statement, we see that she made no mention of the certificate in the
20    statement.  But I asked her this because of this other fact, because it
21    was for the first time today that she said that Mitar Vasiljevic was with
22    the men who came to take away these men to bury the dead people.  And in
23    the statement, she put it quite differently.  And that's why I asked her
24    about it.  And after that, I asked her about the certificate as well.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  But look, Mr. Domazet, if you read to me something

 1    that I said yesterday, part of it, I would yes, that's quite correct.  If
 2    I had said today something in addition to that, it isn't an incorrect
 3    statement that I made yesterday but it's an incomplete one.
 4            Now, what you are seeking to achieve here, as I understand it, is
 5    that there is no reference in that statement, the one statement she has
 6    given to the Prosecutor, to the certificate and to your client being with
 7    these men when they either came or went.  I've forgotten which.  But it's
 8    the absence of something in her statement you want to prove.  Now, you can
 9    either say to her "Did you refer to this at the time you gave your
10    statement to the OTP?"  If she says yes, then you can take her through the
11    statement.  If she says no, then the Prosecution will no doubt agree that
12    it's not in the statement.  Then we can get on.
13            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.  I think
14    that the witness has answered my question, but I can ask her again.
15       Q.   In your statement in 1998, did you say that Mitar Vasiljevic was
16    there when these men were taken to bury the dead people?
17       A.   Yes, I'm sure he was there.
18       Q.   My question is whether that can be found in your statement.
19       A.   I know that he was there and that he came with those men.  They
20    picked them up, went off, did the job they were ordered to do, came back,
21    and Mr. Vasiljevic was there.
22            JUDGE HUNT:  I think, Mr. Domazet, you are at issue with the
23    witness.  Let's move on, please.
24            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Thank you.
25       Q.   After Mitar left -- so the first following occasion that you saw

 1    him was when?
 2       A.   When he came for the men and when he brought that certificate.
 3       Q.   After that certificate that you said he gave and after having a
 4    drink, you said he left.  Now, when did he come the next time, if he came?
 5       A.   Yes, he came.  He came when they wanted to collect our money and
 6    gold.
 7       Q.   Did he enter the house at all, the house in which you were
 8    searched?
 9       A.   Milan came in, Milan Lukic, and he stood in the doorway.  And
10    there were others, too, Bosko Djuric and others around the house.
11       Q.   My question is:  Did you say that to the investigator when you
12    made your statement in 1998?
13       A.   Yes, as far as I can remember.  And I was in my right mind, and
14    that I told him all this.
15       Q.   No, you didn't mention him at all, madam.  I think that the
16    Prosecutor will agree with that.  But in any event, we have that statement
17    of yours here with us.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, the issue is whether it's recorded in
19    the statement.  I'm not sure whether it's whether she told him or not, and
20    that's a very simple issue.  The witness says she thinks she told him.
21    You can obtain from the Prosecutor an assent that it does not appear in
22    the statement, and we're left, then, with what the real issue here is.
23    I'm sorry to keep interrupting, but this seems to be taking so long when
24    it can be dealt with so simply.  And you'll get every bit of the effect
25    you want from it.

 1            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.
 2       Q.   My next question is:  When you were -- when you are talking about
 3    being taken from one house to the other house, the Omeragic house, you
 4    said today that Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic were there.  My question,
 5    again, is:  Can that be found in your statement to the investigator?  Did
 6    you say that to the investigator of the Tribunal?
 7       A.   Yes.  I'm sure I said everything I saw.  I may have even forgotten
 8    something, and I'll be sorry for not having remembered the whole truth to
 9    tell you about it.
10       Q.   Talking about that, did you, perhaps, forget?  And I'm reminding
11    you of a person called Sredoje Lukic.  Did you mention him today in your
12    examination-in-chief?
13       A.   No, his turn didn't come to mention him, but he was there because
14    Sredoje Lukic worked in the police.
15       Q.   Did you know him well?
16       A.   Yes, I knew him well.
17       Q.   You never mentioned him once today.  Does that mean that he didn't
18    take part in any one of these incidents that you told us about?
19       A.   Yes, he did take part, but I didn't mention all my neighbours
20    either who attacked our village and who were there.  Because what I am
21    saying, I personally went through all this, I suffered through all of it.
22    And these horrors, there are so many things.  I can't tell their Honours
23    about everything.  But it's up to you to ask me.  Of course, that is your
24    right.  And I apologise.
25       Q.   Madam, if you didn't mention your neighbours, perhaps in this

 1    particular case it's not of essential importance.  But it is very
 2    important if you are saying today that Milan Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic
 3    took part in all these events, whereas earlier on, you said it was Milan
 4    Lukic and Sredoje Lukic.  This is a very important discrepancy.
 5            So my question is:  Could it not have been Sredoje Lukic whom you
 6    omitted to mention but instead of him, you have been mentioning Mitar
 7    Vasiljevic going from the plunder, the looting, and the burning itself?
 8       A.   All three of them were there.  There wasn't just one, but all
 9    three of them were there.  And Bosko Djuric as well even.  And you can ask
10    me anything else you're interested in.  Please do so.
11       Q.   I am interested, in particular, in Mitar Vasiljevic.  In your
12    testimony today, you mentioned five different incidents in which he
13    appears; whereas in your previous statement, you mentioned him only once,
14    before the certificate; then you mention no certificate; then again in
15    connection with the fire.
16            So let me ask you about what happened when you were being moved
17    from the Memic house to the Omeragic house.  If I understood you
18    correctly, Mitar Vasiljevic went with the first group with a flashlight in
19    one hand to light the way.  Is that right?
20       A.   Yes, he didn't go in front of the group, but he went in front of
21    us so that we could freely cross.  And there was light from the other
22    street, so I could see quite well.  Therefore, it wasn't the Uzice Corps
23    that attacked me or our village, nor was it they who looted us or stripped
24    us; it was our neighbours who did all this to us.
25       Q.   Madam, that is precisely why we are trying to establish exactly

 1    who did what.  If I understood you correctly, the light that was coming
 2    from the direction you mentioned was sufficient to light up the whole
 3    area, and you were able to see well the space between the two houses?
 4       A.   Yes, I am quite sure I saw well.
 5       Q.   Did -- were all these people carrying flashlights, or was it just
 6    Mitar who had a flashlight, a torch?
 7       A.   Mr. Mitar was carrying the torch in his hand and also a rifle
 8    should Milan Lukic run short, because Milan Lukic had two sets of
 9    bullets.  I saw that extremely well, though I was terrified and
10    depressive.  But Mr. Vasiljevic was carrying a torch to light up the area
11    when they were shooting at the windows so he could see better as we jumped
12    out.
13       Q.   The next time you saw Mitar, it was next to the door, you said,
14    next to the door of this room that people were entering?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   And you mentioned an incident with your mother-in-law?
17       A.   Yes, whom he threw from the doorway into the house. [redacted] 
18    [redacted].
19       Q.   Did you mention that, as well as the fact that he was on guard at
20    the door, in your statement to the investigator?
21       A.   I mentioned everything except for a girl, Hasa Kurspahic's --
22    Hasan Kurspahic's daughter, and I omitted to list her.  And I mentioned my
23    mother-in-law first.
24       Q.   In that room, inside, as you described it, it was extremely
25    crowded, wasn't it?

 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   When you entered that room, did you immediately take up a certain
 3    position, or were you moving around the room while you were inside?
 4       A.   I entered the room.  I felt the stench, something that was choking
 5    me.  I took my child by the hand, and I pushed my way to reach the
 6    window.  I had to jump over people, step on their legs, and they were
 7    saying, "Take care, you're hurting me, move away," but I did everything to
 8    get some fresh air near the window.
 9       Q.   And that was when you approached the first window, the window
10    closest to the door?
11       A.   Yes, to the left.  Both windows are on the left-hand side.
12       Q.   And you were next to that window through which you later jumped;
13    is that right?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Do you remember what was on the windows?
16       A.   Yes.  There was no glass panes.  They were broken earlier.  But
17    there was something -- some kind of a curtain, a piece of cloth,
18    something, a rag, a small piece of material.
19       Q.   Does this apply to both windows?
20       A.   The other one, no, it had nothing on it.
21       Q.   So there was no glass on either of the windows, whereas on the
22    window that you were standing next to was some sort of a curtain; is that
23    right?  Do I understand you right?
24       A.   On this window through which I jumped, there was a piece of
25    curtain.  And on the other one, there was nothing.  And I didn't pass by

 1    that other window because there were these two windows next to one
 2    another, like this.
 3       Q.   And everything you described you saw that evening, in the room or
 4    outside the room, you saw from the position you held next to the window;
 5    is that right?
 6       A.   Yes.  It's a small room.  There's a door, one window, the second
 7    window, the walls.
 8       Q.   When you jumped out the window, madam, as you told us today, Milan
 9    Lukic shot at you, who was a couple of steps away from you; is that right?
10       A.   Yes, and Mitar Vasiljevic.  They were together, one next to the
11    other.
12       Q.   Yes, you told us that.  Did he open a burst of fire at you or
13    individual shots?  Can you remember that?
14       A.   I didn't count whether it was a burst of fire or not.  He started
15    shooting, he wounded me, and I fell down the slope to the creek.
16       Q.   Madam, when you reached Kosovo Polje and spent a few days there,
17    did you leave Kosovo Polje that evening with another group of people or
18    was that on the day when you learnt of the death of Stanko Pecikoza?
19       A.   Stanko Pecikoza's funeral took place on Saturday, and on Saturday
20    evening the men came with boats from the left bank of the Drina to
21    transport us.  Actually, nobody knew I had fled there.  I was hiding there
22    in the ground so that nobody would learn about me.  And I crossed with
23    these people from Kosovo Polje by boat across the Drina, because that is
24    where I was born, actually.  My village is there, the other side of the
25    Drina.  And Stanko's funeral was on Saturday.

 1       Q.   Do I understand you right that on the day of Stanko Pecikoza's
 2    funeral, you crossed the Drina, the evening after the funeral?
 3       A.   Let's say today was my funeral and tonight we went across.
 4       Q.   Did you see that funeral, at least from a distance, from the spot
 5    where you were?
 6       A.   Stanko Pecikoza lived close by.  There was just the road
 7    separating the Muslims from the Serbs in Kosovo Polje.  Their cemetery was
 8    just behind their village.  It wasn't far, and of course you could see
 9    it.  There weren't that many of them.  They were wailing.  In any event,
10    he was killed because Pecikoza -- his relatives said that Milan Lukic had
11    killed him on the road to Belgrade and Uzice.
12       Q.   I understood that quite well.  But my question was:  Did you see
13    that there was a funeral going on?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Thank you.
16       A.   Yes, quite certainly there was a funeral.
17       Q.   Once you crossed the Drina, that is, the evening of the day Stanko
18    Pecikoza was buried, you went to Jelacici and spent a few days there; is
19    that right?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   After that, you went to Crni Vrh or to Gorazde, to the hospital
22    straight away?
23       A.   I didn't go to Gorazde immediately.  I first went to see a doctor
24    to dress my wounds, to give me some first aid, because - I apologise - I
25    stank worse than a toilet, because my life was at risk because of this

 1    arm, because of all the blood that I had lost.  So I went to Crni Vrh, and
 2    at night we went by foot all night through the woods to reach Gorazde and
 3    the hospital there.
 4       Q.   And you spent about 25 days in Gorazde?
 5       A.   Yes, something like that.
 6       Q.   After you left the hospital in Gorazde, where did you go?
 7       A.   I went to Medzedza.  I was there for a time because I couldn't go
 8    back to my native village, because the people had already started fleeing
 9    the village.  So from Medzedza, I went to Gorazde.  From Gorazde, my arm
10    was improving, and then I went to another hospital.
11       Q.   Do you remember when you arrived in Medzedza?  Would it be some
12    time at the end of July, judging by what you have told us?
13       A.   Well, yes, July, beginning of August.
14       Q.   Was there any other fire in Visegrad?  Did you notice any other
15    fire in Visegrad while you were there?
16       A.   Yes, at Bikavac, where a house burned down in which there were
17    about perhaps 80 people, and one witness survived.  I don't know where he
18    is, and I wouldn't name him anyway.
19       Q.   My question was whether you saw that fire.  Were you still in
20    Visegrad when that happened?
21       A.   Yes.  I was in the sewage canal when this happened at Bikavac.
22    And in that canal the stench was choking me from those people.  And when I
23    and the survivor met in Medzedza, we had a short talk, because she
24    couldn't speak, and she told me how it all happened.
25       Q.   May I take it that this was a few days after what happened in the

 1    house of Omeragic?
 2       A.   As I had this encounter with this person, so this was the
 3    following night after our experience.
 4       Q.   So -- no.  Two nights after the Omeragic fire?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   Madam, did you know the individual by the name of "Susnjar" well?
 7       A.   Milan Susnjar, yes, [redacted] 
 8    [redacted]
 9    [redacted]
10       Q.   During that period of time, did he have a beard?
11       A.   When he came to take -- to make us take our clothes off, he did
12    not have a beard.  As for before that, I don't know.
13       Q.   Did he have a moustache, by any chance?
14       A.   Yes, he did have a moustache, a black moustache.  And he was dark,
15    of medium height.
16       Q.   Was that the individual whom you saw on that night in Pionirska
17    Street?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   When you described Mitar Vasiljevic, you said that he was wearing
20    a black suit and a black hat; is that correct?
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   Do you remember what kind of footwear he had?
23       A.   He was barefoot when he came to us, and he had some ribbons on his
24    hat.
25       Q.   When you saw him on the first occasion, he was barefoot?

 1       A.   When he came, I didn't pay much attention.  But then he came
 2    barefoot.
 3       Q.   That evening, were you still able to observe that he was barefoot
 4    or not?
 5       A.   You mean when they marched us from one house to another?  No, I
 6    didn't pay attention to his feet.  I couldn't see whether he was
 7    barefoot.  But I know that he was wearing a hat, as before, as this time
 8    before.
 9       Q.   You said you knew Sredoje Lukic very well.  You did not mention
10    him, although you mentioned him in your prior statement 16 times.  In
11    response to one of my questions, you said that he also took part in these
12    events.  Because of a very important fact concerning Mitar's involvement
13    in the events, I have to ask you once again whether at the time this group
14    arrived, the group who looted and took away the young women, did Mitar
15    Vasiljevic leave before that?  Did he leave before their arrival?
16       A.   Now you want me to say that Mitar wasn't there at all?
17       Q.   All I want to do is to remove certain doubt as to his presence
18    there, because you stated something different in your statement given to
19    the investigator.  I have to ask you whether you remember that you stated
20    in the statement to the investigator that Mitar had already left and that
21    it was after his departure that Sredoje Lukic arrived, and then you went
22    on to give their description --
23    A.  Mitar Vasiljevic left after he had given the certificate to (redacted)
24    (redacted).  And during the plunder and the mistreatment, they were all
25    there again.

 1       Q.   Yes, but you did not state that in your statement to the
 2    investigator.  Or do you wish to have a look at the statement?  Do you
 3    remember?  Do you remember having stated there that only Milan and Sredoje
 4    Lukic took you from the Memic house to the Omeragic house, where they
 5    locked you up, and after which you said disappeared?
 6       A.   But could you then explain to me who it was who was holding the
 7    flashlight when Milan Lukic was shooting at those who were jumping out of
 8    the window?  I didn't see Sredoje carrying a flashlight.  It was
 9    Mr. Vasiljevic.
10       Q.   Yes, it is true that is what you stated in your statement given to
11    the investigator, that he was holding a flashlight while you were jumping
12    out of the window.  However, half an hour before that, you mentioned only
13    the two other individuals.  Do you agree with me that you stated in your
14    statement to the investigator that it was Milan Lukic and Sredoje Lukic
15    who locked you up in that room and left you there, and it was only after
16    that they came again together with Mitar, who was holding a flashlight?
17       A.   That Sredoje Lukic was the one who took us to Omeragic house?  No,
18    no, because I personally saw Mitar Vasiljevic standing at the door.  He
19    was not far from me, the way you are now.
20       Q.   Madam, speaking of the lighting, you said that the area was very
21    well lit from the street lights.  Why, according to you, did they use
22    flashlights?  Was it because the visibility was not very good?  Why was it
23    that somebody wanted to point a flashlight at you?
24       A.   You know very well what I'm talking about.  There was some
25    lighting.  However, there were no lights in the house where we were kept.

 1    So they wanted to see those who were jumping out of the window so that
 2    Milan Lukic could shoot them.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  Madam, may I remind you to pause before you give your
 4    answer.  You came straight in then, and it was very hard for the
 5    interpreters to keep up with you.  We want to hear what you say, but we'll
 6    lose it if you don't give us that pause.
 7            Yes, Mr. Domazet.
 8            THE WITNESS:  [Interpretation] I'm sorry.  I got a little upset.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  We can understand that, madam, but we are just trying
10    to make sure we get all of your evidence into the transcript.  We
11    understand that you are very involved in all of this, but we do ask you to
12    keep in mind the need to pause before your answers.
13            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I have attempted
14    through my questions and some quotes to obtain -- to elicit an answer from
15    the witness concerning this prior statement that she gave and which I
16    considered to be very significant.  And in view of the responses that I
17    received, regardless of the position that we should try with the
18    Prosecutor to find an agreement, the number of discrepancies is such that
19    I think it would be in the interest of justice for this statement to be
20    admitted into evidence.
21            I should like you to accept the possibility of the witness
22    identifying her signature on the statement, and I would like to tender the
23    statement into evidence as a Defence exhibit in this case.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  You may certainly ask her that question, and then
25    we'll worry about whether it goes in as an exhibit.

 1            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] We have both the B/C/S and the
 2    English version of the statement given to the investigator.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm sorry, have you asked her?  I have not heard
 4    you.  Have you asked her whether that's her signature?
 5            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honour, the witness has the
 6    statement in front of her.
 7       Q.   And, madam, I would like you to have a look at the statement and
 8    confirm whether this is your signature on the statement which is in front
 9    of you.
10            Have you had a look at the statement, madam?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   Is that your statement, the one that you gave to the investigator
13    in 1998?
14       A.   Yes, it is.
15            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] I would like to tender the statement
16    into evidence as a Defence exhibit.  Number D4, I believe.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome.
18            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, the Prosecution would object.  I believe
19    Mr. Domazet has had ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness
20    regarding the contents of this statement.  If the Court is inclined to
21    accept this into evidence -- this witness has made three prior
22    statements.  I think in the interest of fairness to this witness, all
23    three should be before the Court.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  When you say he has had ample opportunity to
25    cross-examine the witness, it may be because of the nature of the

 1    questions asked, to which I've already drawn attention that they were
 2    ambiguous, but he has attempted to obtain her assent to whether or not she
 3    had mentioned things in the statements -- through her statement, which she
 4    said yes.  Now, the fact that they are not in this statement may not be an
 5    answer to it if she has given other statements.  If she has mentioned them
 6    in other statements, then you would be entitled to get the other
 7    statements into evidence.
 8            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  In that case, I would withdraw my
 9    objection.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  Very well.  It will be Exhibit D4.
11            Have we got a date of it?  It's 12th and 13th of February, 1998.
12    That is Exhibit D4.
13            You understand, though, Mr. Domazet, that will probably make
14    admissible any other statements she has made where she has mentioned these
15    things.
16            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour.  I have no problem
17    with that, with any other statement given by the witness to be tendered.
18            May I continue?
19            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, please.
20            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Thank you.
21       Q.   Madam, did you ever give a statement to the MUP, to the
22    authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, any official statement concerning
23    these events?
24       A.   Yes, I did.
25       Q.   Do you remember when that was?

 1       A.   Well, I was still in hospital when the doctors asked me about what
 2    I had gone through, because of the shape I was in.  And I told them what
 3    had happened to me.  Then some journalists came, and I told them my story.
 4       Q.   You told your story to journalists, or to official authorities of
 5    the police, or some other state body?
 6       A.   Both to the journalists and to the MUP officials, to whom I also
 7    gave a statement.
 8       Q.   So there's probably a statement of yours in the MUP in Gorazde,
 9    because it was at the time you were in hospital in Gorazde.  Is that
10    correct?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   As regards the interview, was it an interview that you gave to the
13    Sarajevo television in 1992?
14       A.   Yes, I also gave an interview in Sarajevo.
15       Q.   Madam, do you remember that day in Pionirska Street?  Did you
16    see -- witness, have a look at your list VG78 and VG101.  Did you see them
17    on that day?
18       A.   These people were not with us in Pionirska Street, no.
19       Q.   When you say, madam, that they were not with you, does it mean
20    that they were not in the Memic house while you were still there?
21       A.   Yes.
22            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Thank you, madam.  This concludes my
23    examination of the witness, Your Honour.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Groome.
25                          Re-examined by Mr. Groome:
 1       Q.   Witness 13, I want to draw your attention back to the point in
 2    time when you testified on cross-examination about Mr. Vasiljevic
 3    approaching (redacted) with a glass of brandy.  Do you recall your
 4    testimony on that matter?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   Approximately how long was Mr. Vasiljevic -- were Mr. Vasiljevic
 7    and (redacted) together at the time that you saw Mr. Vasiljevic with
 8    the glass of brandy?
 9       A.   It all happened in passing.
10       Q.   Can you approximate in minutes how long it took?
11       A.   Three or four minutes altogether.  "Hello.  Hello.  Here's
12    something for you to drink."  And they left.
13            MR. GROOME:  I'm going to ask that the following document be
14    marked as Prosecution Document 59.1 and that a copy be shown to the
15    witness.
16            JUDGE HUNT:  Are you going to introduce this in some way to us?
17            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.  The English is at the back of it,
18    Your Honour.  59.1 is the Bosnian version, B/C/S version, and 59.2 is the
19    English version.
20            JUDGE HUNT:  How does this arise out of cross-examination?
21            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, there's been numerous questions and even
22    the introduction of a statement regarding what this witness did not say.
23    This is a prior statement of the witness taken -- the first statement
24    taken after the events of the 14th of June, and we will be seeking to
25    introduce it as a prior consistent statement.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, if you can establish that.  It doesn't appear
 2    to be so on its face, but you go ahead.
 3            MR. GROOME:
 4       Q.   Witness 13, I would ask you to take a look at Prosecution
 5    Document Number 59.1 and refer you to the third page which says the
 6    number "114" on the bottom.  I'd ask you to read that.
 7       A.   You want me to read it aloud or --
 8       Q.   No.  If you read it to yourself, please.  And in particular, I
 9    would refer you to page 115, the second-from-the-last paragraph.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  You see, this is the very sort of problem that I can
11    foresee here, Mr. Groome.  You are entitled to get into evidence
12    statements that she has made where she's referred to the matters which
13    she's alleged not to have included within Exhibit D4.  It may be that
14    there is something here, but a quick read through doesn't suggest it.  It
15    certainly demonstrates that she has blamed Mr. Vasiljevic as a perpetrator
16    for the fire, but that's not what she is being cross-examined about here.
17    She's being cross-examined about three or four, and maybe more, specific
18    matters that she's referred to in her evidence which were not in
19    Exhibit D.
20            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  You can't have sort of a blunderbuss approach to this
22    in re-examination.  You are entitled to show that the three or four or
23    more matters that she is alleged not to have included within Exhibit D and
24    which from everything you've demonstrated so far she did not include
25    within Exhibit D, that she has included in some other prior statement to

 1    meet an allegation of recent invention.  That's what this is all about.
 2            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, now this statement, unless it has something in
 4    it which demonstrates she has, on a prior occasion, made a statement in
 5    which she's included one of those three or four matters, this is
 6    irrelevant.
 7            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I know that the Court has just been
 8    presented with this, and it's a little difficult to understand at first
 9    glance, but if you look throughout the beginning of the statement, the
10    witness is referring to "they," "they," "they," and mentions some of the
11    incidents which counsel is now saying she omitted in this previous
12    statement.  The last paragraph of the statement, she refers to or
13    identified who they are, and one of those people is Mitar Vasiljevic.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, that does not impress me in the slightest,
15    frankly, I have to say.  We will need to go through the particular matters
16    that she was alleged not to have referred to.  But I mean there's matters
17    of timing, for example, as to whether Mr. Vasiljevic was there when the
18    men were sent off to bury the dead people and whether he was there at the
19    time that they were moved from one house to the other.  Now, I don't see
20    any reference to any of that here.
21            MR. GROOME:  If I could just refer the Court to the first
22    paragraph in the statement, it says:  "They moved us over to the house of
23    Adem Omeragic."
24            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes, but who are "they"?
25            MR. GROOME:  The point, Your Honour, would be on the last

 1    paragraph, she identifies who they are, and Mitar Vasiljevic is one of
 2    those people.
 3            JUDGE HUNT:  It depends what she means by "perpetrators."  If she
 4    means being involved in the fire, she's clearly made that statement in
 5    Exhibit D.
 6            MR. GROOME:  I would just ask that I be permitted to ask the
 7    witness to clarify.
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, that's hardly presenting a prior consistent
 9    statement if it has to be interpreted.  You can have a go, Mr. Groome, but
10    it just doesn't seem to me to get within anywhere near to what you are
11    entitled to do in re-examination.  But you give it a go and see how you
12    go.  But an interpretation by her now doesn't seem to carry very much
13    weight as to what was intended in this document, if this was in fact her
14    document, which isn't clear on the face of it.
15            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour, and I recognise that the ultimate
16    interpretation of the value of this is going to be for the Chamber to
17    decide.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, it's got to have some value before it becomes
19    admissible.
20            MR. GROOME:
21       Q.   Witness 13 --
22            JUDGE HUNT:  Wait a minute.  Mr. Domazet is on his feet.
23            Yes, Mr. Domazet.
24            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I arose immediately,
25    because as far as I understand, Mr. Groome would like to tender this as

 1    part of his redirect information by stating that this was the particular
 2    piece of information which was given by this witness.  But this is not
 3    something that we can see from this statement.
 4            Moreover, I don't see this witness as being identified as the
 5    person who gave the statement.  Quite the contrary.  Three other
 6    individuals, who are not here today, are mentioned.  Nowhere in this
 7    statement, at the beginning, at the heading, nor at the end of the
 8    statement, is it stated that this is what this particular witness said.  I
 9    don't think that this can be the subject of additional examination.  The
10    statement was signed by some official in charge of the gathering of
11    information, and then we have a name, and that is not this witness.  So I
12    don't think this can be tendered into evidence as an exhibit, nor can it
13    be the basis -- the foundation for additional examination of the witness.
14            JUDGE HUNT:  If you had been listening, Mr. Domazet, you would
15    have heard me say exactly that myself.  Where is it her document?
16            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, if someone were to read the transcript
17    of this Tribunal, her name would appear nowhere in it.  It may be a very
18    reasonable measure that was taken to protect the identity of the very few
19    survivors of this.  I just believe that the Prosecution is entitled to
20    inquire in this area.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  No, no.  Look, Mr. Groome, where is there any
22    indication that she was a party to this document at all?
23            MR. GROOME:  This was provided to Defence counsel in discovery
24    as --
25            JUDGE HUNT:  Please, you just answer my question.  Where does this

 1    document demonstrate that she had played any part in it at all?
 2            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, the content of the document is clear
 3    that it's her or it may be her.  Her name does not appear on this
 4    document.  I will admit that.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Are you going to suggest that she was the only
 6    participant in this document?  Because otherwise you cannot ascribe any
 7    particular part of it to her.
 8            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I believe I'm entitled to ask her --
 9    she's already testified on cross-examination that she has given a
10    statement to the MUP in this matter.  I believe I'm entitled to ask her:
11    Does she recognise this as that statement?  She may very well say, no, she
12    doesn't.  If she does, then I'll sit down.  But both Defence counsel and
13    myself have always operated on the assumption or belief that this was a
14    prior statement of hers, and it was provided in discovery as such.
15            JUDGE HUNT:  So that the reference to "I" means that it is a
16    statement taken by the MUP, is it?
17            MR. GROOME:  Your Honour, I feel uncomfortable being put in a
18    position of interpreting what the word "I" means.  There are other facts
19    within this statement; for example, the reference to the 13-year-old son.
20    We heard from the son yesterday and this morning, who describes his age
21    for the --
22            JUDGE HUNT:  Please, don't try and interpret it yourself.  I want
23    to know what you know.  I know we don't have a jury, so we don't have a
24    concern about, in the end, just rejecting it, but I don't want this to
25    proceed on some form of guesswork, Mr. Groome.

 1            MR. GROOME:  No, Your Honour.  I think the best way to eliminate
 2    guesswork is to ask the witness what she knows about this document that's
 3    before her now.
 4            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, let's deal with that in the morning.  But I
 5    think what you're going to have to do is to go through some care in the
 6    cross-examination, make out those parts of it where Mr. Domazet has
 7    suggested - and there has been no response to the contrary from you - that
 8    there were various statements she has made in her evidence here that were
 9    not in the statement which she gave which is now Exhibit D.  Now, those
10    are the only matters that you are entitled to raise in re-examination.
11    Otherwise, it's not re-examination; it's something completely new.
12            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  And then you're going to have to work out where they
14    are in this statement.  And as I say, I have not yet myself seen any.
15    Now, it may be that you've not had the opportunity of considering it, but
16    I would prefer that you took some time and worked out where, in this
17    statement, there is a reference to any of the matters that have been
18    omitted from Exhibit D.  And then, and then only, we're interested in
19    whether this is her statement.
20            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  They are the two points, and they are both equally
22    important.  So may I suggest you do that overnight, and then if this is
23    her document and it does deal with those matters, not just in a global
24    sense like in the last paragraph or second-to-last paragraph, then it
25    would become admissible in re-examination.

 1            MR. GROOME:  Yes, Your Honour, I'll do that.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  All right.  Then we'll just leave it for the moment,
 3    and we'll resume again at 9.30 in the morning.
 4                          --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at
 5                          4.06 p.m., to be reconvened on Wednesday,
 6                          the 3rd day of October, 2001, at 9.30 a.m.
