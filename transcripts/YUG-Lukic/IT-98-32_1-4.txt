 2                          [Status Conference]
 3                          [Open session]
 4                          --- Upon commencing at 9.15 a.m.
 5                          [The accused entered court]
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  Call the case, please.
 7            THE REGISTRAR:  [Interpretation] Case IT-98-32-PT, the Prosecutor
 8    versus Mitar Vasiljevic.
 9            JUDGE HUNT:  Appearances.
10            Ms. Korner.
11            MS. KORNER:  Joanna Korner, representing the Prosecution together
12    with Dermot Groome.
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
14            Mr. Domazet.
15            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Vladimir Domazet.  I represent Mitar
16    Vasiljevic.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
18            Mr. Vasiljevic, are you able to hear the proceedings in a language
19    which you understand?
20                          [The accused stands up]
21            JUDGE HUNT:  I'll ask the question again now that you have your
22    earphones on.  Are you able to hear the proceedings in a language which
23    you understand?
24            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honours.
25            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.  Sit down, please.

 1                          [The accused sits down]
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  This is a Status Conference called in accordance with
 3    the provisions of Rule 65 bis.
 4            Yes, Ms. Korner.
 5            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, we're here.  I don't know what matters
 6    Your Honours wish to be addressed on at the moment.
 7            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, there's very little that we can do because the
 8    position about when this case will be heard and by whom will not be
 9    resolved until late next month at the elections.  But it seems to be
10    proceeding with the -- we now have a pre-trial brief, but I think it would
11    be unwise to make any further orders in relation to that at this stage.
12    It's no good having all the parties absolutely ready and then having to
13    wait a couple of months before the trial commences.
14            We do have a motion from you, though, for a medical examination.
15    Is this by consent?
16            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, I have spoken to Mr. Domazet this
17    morning.  We were aware, may I say, that he didn't object, but we thought
18    that we had better do it formally by way of written motion.  I have spoken
19    again to Mr. Domazet this morning who has very helpfully told us that he
20    has no objection.
21            JUDGE HUNT:  I think it has to be something more than that, I'm
22    afraid, because, you see, we are compelling the accused to testify against
23    himself.
24            MS. KORNER:  Well, the Rule which we looked at -- yes, Your
25    Honour, Rule 74 bis --

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Yes.
 2            MS. KORNER:  -- "... may, at the request of a party, order a
 3    medical, psychiatric or psychological examination of the accused."  I
 4    don't actually see anything in the Rule that says there has to be anything
 5    more.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  The Rules don't overcome the Statute, though.  The
 7    Statute says, in perfectly clear language, that the accused is entitled to
 8    the minimum guarantee of not being compelled to testify against himself.
 9            MS. KORNER:  Yes.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm not suggesting that it can't be done by consent.
11    It clearly can.  From the attitude that the accused, through Mr. Domazet,
12    has previously expressed about this alibi matter, they obviously are very
13    confident and they probably will consent.  But I think it has to be by
14    consent and not merely, "do not object."  You can see that this may arise
15    later, and I'd like to get the procedural parts of it straight.
16            MS. KORNER:  Yes.  Your Honour, in our submission, it would be
17    rather like the taking of fingerprints.
18            JUDGE HUNT:  Precisely, and that is something which a Statute is
19    required; indeed, a hotly-disputed legality even to some Statutes,
20    certainly in my country.
21            MS. KORNER:  Yes.  Your Honour, it's the same in my jurisdiction,
22    but there are Statutes which say that fingerprints may be taken, and if
23    there is a refusal, there can be the forced taking of fingerprints, but --
24            JUDGE HUNT:  My point is, I think, a fairly simple one; the
25    Appeals Chamber has said that the Rules are subject to the Statute and

 1    that the Plenary meeting of the Judges cannot enact the law through the
 2    medium of the Rules so that the Rules can only be procedural, and
 3    certainly you may make an application.  But if there was an objection, I
 4    do not understand how you could possibly succeed in light of Article 21 of
 5    the Statute.
 6            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, I don't know whether Your Honour wants
 7    to hear argument on this at this stage.
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  May I suggest that we deal with it in a very much
 9    straightforward way.  I'll ask Mr. Domazet.
10            MS. KORNER:  Certainly.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  Mr. Domazet, does your client consent to this
12    examination?  As I understand it, it's in order to demonstrate whether he
13    was indeed the patient who was in hospital at the time shown in the
14    medical records, and you have, as I understand it, been very cooperative
15    in enabling all the tests necessary to ascertain the validity of those
16    records, and this is the next step.  But I take the view myself that we do
17    need a consent from your client to such an examination, X-rays and blood
18    tests.
19            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.
20            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Yes, Mr. President.  Personally,
21    I've gone through these documents, and I'm sure that Mr. Mitar Vasiljevic
22    was at the hospital and he was there since the 14th of June, 1992, and I
23    have not objected -- I did not object to all the examinations required for
24    the reason that I have just received this morning in my locker this
25    document, but I have not had the opportunity to speak with my client

 1    Mr. Vasiljevic about the fact.
 2            Personally, I'm not opposed to that, and I've said so to
 3    Ms. Korner this morning.  However, maybe it would be better if I could
 4    have the opportunity to talk to my client and then I could tell you if we
 5    object or not to this examination.
 6            JUDGE HUNT:  But, Mr. Domazet, I want something more than a mere
 7    absence of objection.  What we need is your client's consent to having
 8    these examinations.
 9            Now, certainly I think it would be very advisable for you to speak
10    to your client, and whilst you are here today, this would be the
11    opportunity to do so, but I don't want any documents subsequently filed
12    merely to say that your client does not object.  We want the words that he
13    consents to it, if that be the case.  If he does not, then Ms. Korner
14    apparently has some argument which may overcome it, but I think that this
15    will be the most direct and straightforward way of disposing of it if we
16    can.  And if Ms. Korner wants to argue that, notwithstanding the absence 
17    of such a consent, the Prosecution is still entitled to have the accused 
18    testify against himself, then we'll hear that argument, or perhaps it can 
19    be done in writing.
20            So would you please arrange to have this conference with your
21    client today and, if possible, file some document today so that the matter
22    can be disposed of, hopefully without any further ado.  But, otherwise, we
23    will await what you have to say in that document.
24            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] Yes, Mr. President.  I agree with
25    your proposal.  I'll comply.

 1            JUDGE HUNT:  Thank you.
 2            Now, is there anything else that the Prosecution wants to raise,
 3    Ms. Korner?  I don't want there to be some constitutional argument that
 4    goes up to the Appeals Chamber on a matter like this if we can avoid it.
 5    I'm not being obstructive, I hasten to add, but I am concerned that I, at
 6    least, comply with the terms of the Statute.
 7            MS. KORNER:   Yes.  I am aware from other cases that Your Honour
 8    takes the view that certain matters may be seen to be compelling a person
 9    to give evidence against themselves.
10            JUDGE HUNT:  You say that --
11            MS. KORNER:  I don't --
12            JUDGE HUNT:  You say that in terms which suggest that you don't
13    believe that anybody else does, but I'll take that.
14            MS. KORNER:  I wouldn't want to start 2001 off by disagreeing with
15    Your Honour.
16            JUDGE HUNT:  But it is, I think, a matter of some importance.  I
17    have been involved in a lot of litigation dealing with this sort of thing,
18    and there are some very real problems involved in it if it has to be
19    argued.  That's all I can say.  I think that in most of the cases I have
20    argued, I ended up losing.
21            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, may I say that I don't think from what,
22    as Your Honour has already remarked, has been the attitude throughout of
23    Mr. Domazet and Mr. Vasiljevic there is likely to be a problem.
24            JUDGE HUNT:  That's right.  That's why I would rather deal with it
25    in that sort of a way rather than have to deal with it as a matter of some

 1    constitutional importance to the Statute.
 2            MS. KORNER:  Your Honour, the only other matter, and I appreciate
 3    the problems there are about setting a date or even deciding how this case
 4    is going to be heard because of the administrative changes that may or may
 5    not happen in this building, but I don't know whether Your Honour is able
 6    to assist on this:  In the light of the fact that in Your Honour's list
 7    there are two cases awaiting trial, if not a third, I think --
 8            JUDGE HUNT:  There is a third but it's a long way away somewhere.
 9            MS. KORNER:  Yes.  It's a long way down the list.  Is Your Honour
10    able to give any indication, given that this case is a great deal shorter
11    on any showing than the other case, whether it is this case that is likely
12    to be taken first?
13            JUDGE HUNT:  Well, let me explain it to you this way:  Sometime at
14    the end of February or early in March, we will know who has and who has
15    not been re-elected.  There are a number Judges who are not standing for
16    re-election anyway, and the President has discussed this with the Bureau
17    in an endeavour to determine what these Judges can be put to in their
18    remaining time.  It is a very short case, this, in the sense that it will
19    probably be over and done with in two, two and a half months, I would
20    think, and it seems an ideal case to be given to three of the Judges who
21    are not standing for re-election so that they can dispose of it by the end
22    of the year.
23            Now, it is, of all the cases which are ready or almost ready for
24    trial, this is clearly the best case for that purpose, and I rather
25    suspect that may happen.

 1            What is going to happen, and this is anticipated will happen, when
 2    ad hoc Judges come on stream in the middle of the year, whichever Trial
 3    Chamber has just finished a case or is just about to finish a case will be
 4    split up into two or perhaps three subChambers or divisions, with a
 5    permanent Judge and two ad hoc Judges or two permanent Judges and an ad
 6    hoc Judge.  Those Judges will be then given the work that is remaining in
 7    that Trial Chamber's list and any others that are ready for hearing.
 8            I rather suspect that if we are the ones -- if Trial Chamber II is
 9    the one which is going to be split up, that Brdjanin and Talic will be
10    taken by one of those divisions --
11            MS. KORNER:  Yes.
12            JUDGE HUNT:  -- and it will be dealt with in that way.  If we are
13    not the Trial Chamber that's split up, then we will be starting Brdjanin
14    and Talic at the conclusion of the current Krnojelac case, provided that
15    we're all re-elected.
16            MS. KORNER:  Yes.
17            JUDGE HUNT:  You see the state of indecision we're in.
18            MS. KORNER:  Yes.
19            JUDGE HUNT:  It's a funny position to be in, to be subject to
20    election as Judges, I can tell you, and I have found it quite strange.
21            Nevertheless, we are in the situation where we just cannot
22    finalise any judicial arrangements for the rest of this year until we
23    know.  That is why the United Nations agreed to move the elections to an
24    earlier spot than they usually are.
25            MS. KORNER:  I'm very grateful to Your Honour.  That is of some

 1    assistance.
 2            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm afraid you'll have to share the indecision with
 3    us, Ms. Korner.
 4            MS. KORNER:  Thank you very much.
 5            JUDGE HUNT:  Now, Mr. Domazet, are there any matters you want to
 6    raise in terms of the Rule about the matter -- about the case, about your
 7    client's well-being, et cetera?
 8            MR. DOMAZET: [Interpretation] No, Mr. President, nothing, nothing
 9    related to the Status Conference and the issues that ought to be raised
10    during the Status Conference.  Nothing.
11            JUDGE HUNT:  I'm very grateful to you.
12            If there's nothing else, we'll adjourn.  The next matter starting
13    in this courtroom starts at 10.00.
14                          --- Whereupon the Status Conference adjourned at
15                          9.30 a.m.
