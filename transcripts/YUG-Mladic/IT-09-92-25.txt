 21   MR. ERIC OSTBERG, MR. MARK HARMON and MR. TERREE BOWERS appeared
 22   on behalf of the Prosecution
 23   (Open Session) 
 24   (10.00 a.m.)
 25   THE PRESIDING JUDGE [In translation]:  Can everybody hear me? Counsel for 

  1   the Prosecution, can you hear me?  The Registrar, can you hear me?  
  2   The public gallery, can you all hear me?  The Court is in session and 
  3   we will complete by the closing arguments of the Prosecution.  You 
  4   have the floor.
  5   MR. BOWERS:  Good morning, your Honours.  We have some additional exhibits 
  6   to submit before the closing argument. First of all, at the Court's 
  7   request, we have compiled the transcripts from Rule 61 hearings and 
  8   the Tadic case, including various testimonies from the Tadic trial 
  9   itself, and the statements from Dr. James Gow, the military and 
 10   historical expert; called both in Rule 61 hearings and in the Tadic 
 11   case.
 12   		We also have some correspondence to submit to the Court 
 13   regarding the issue of noncompliance with the warrants of arrests.  
 14   The exhibits from the Rule 61 and Tadic trial will be Exhibits 66 
 15   through 75.  Exhibits 76 through 81 comprises correspondence, these 
 16   are faxes sent by President Antonio Cassese to President Milosevic 
 17   regarding various incidents when both Mladic and Karadzic were in the 
 18   Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  It shows the chronology of 
 19   non-response by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  It also contains 
 20   many warnings that they need to comply with their obligations and 
 21   failure to comply would result in a certification to the Security 
 22   Council of failure to effect the arrests on Mladic and Karadzic.  So 
 23   that correspondence is also being presented.
 24   		We would like to tender these to the Court.
 25   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  The evidence has been accepted.  Please take note, 

  1   Registrar, and add them to the Court records, thank you. 
  2   MR. BOWERS:  Your Honours, that is the conclusion of our evidentiary 
  3   submissions.  Thank you.
  4   MR. HARMON:  Thank you, your Honours.  May it please the Court. Because 
  5   arrest warrants against Dr. Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have not been 
  6   executed and because those men remain fugitives from international 
  7   justice, this extraordinary procedural hearing was convened.
  8   		A Rule 61 hearing is not intended to be a trial in absentia.  
  9   It is a hearing to satisfy your Honours that there are reasonable 
 10   grounds for believing that both of the accused have committed any or 
 11   all of the crimes alleged in the respective indictments and, if 
 12   satisfied, to take steps necessary to secure the eventual appearance 
 13   of Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic before this Tribunal so that they 
 14   might stand trial for the monstrous crimes each is alleged to have 
 15   committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 16   		It has often been repeated that a Rule 61 hearing is an 
 17   opportunity to give the victims voice. Perhaps, but because this is 
 18   not a trial, these voices can only be heard as pleas to this court and 
 19   to the world that Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic be immediately 
 20   arrested and brought to justice; that the victims can only be heard in 
 21   a procedural hearing is an insult to the thousands of victims who have 
 22   suffered so cruelly in this war.
 23   		This insult has now been compounded by the hollow and cynical 
 24   gesture of Dr. Karadzic sending his lawyers to The Hague to complain 
 25   about his arrest warrants and asking that they be allowed to 

  1   participate in this hearing while he hides in the Republika Srpska.  
  2   It is true, your Honours, that the victims want an opportunity to be 
  3   heard, but they want an opportunity after Dr. Karadzic and General 
  4   Mladic have been arrested and are  sitting in this court in the 
  5   defendant's dock.  Then and only then, your Honours, will the victims 
  6   truly have voice.  Then and only then, your Honours, will the victims 
  7   truly have justice.
  8   		Before reviewing the evidence, I would like to emphasise that 
  9   my remarks today are directed at the individual criminal 
 10   responsibility of Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic alone and not at the 
 11   Serbian people.  We have not indicted the Serbian people for these 
 12   crimes.  Indeed, according to the testimony of Mayor Kupusovic, 
 13   victims of the siege of Sarajevo included 40,000 Bosnian Serbs.
 14   		The demonization of groups of people -- Muslims, Croats, Serbs 
 15   -- has contributed to the terrible carnage and destruction in the 
 16   former Yugoslavia.  This phenomenon is a disease of the spirit which, 
 17   if unchecked, will sow the seeds of future strife and conflict in that 
 18   part of the world.  We are repelled by notions of collective guilt, 
 19   and by our two indictments of Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic, we 
 20   accuse, in unequivocal terms, two individuals whom we allege are two 
 21   of the persons who instigated, planned and ordered the genocide and 
 22   the "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and Herzegovina, crimes which have 
 23   shocked the conscience of the world.
 24   		As you have heard during these past seven days, war and 
 25   darkness descended upon Bosnia and Herzegovina, a culturally rich and 

  1   diverse land, and the toll on human lives has been enormous.  As the 
  2   evidence in this hearing has demonstrated, much of the violence was 
  3   specifically targeted against Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats, as 
  4   well as their cultural heritage. In municipality after municipality, 
  5   people were killed regardless of whether they were combatants or not. 
  6    Frequent targets of violence were women and children, the elderly and 
  7    even the infirm.  Precious cultural sites, whether centuries old 
  8   mosques, schools and libraries, were systematically destroyed for no 
  9   other reason than to eradicate traces of cultural identity.  The fury 
 10   and cruelty of many of these attacks was limited only by the 
 11   perpetrator's inability to imagine darker deeds.
 12   		The two men accused in these indictments were the most 
 13   powerful leaders in the Republika Srpska when these crimes were 
 14   committed and they remain so today.
 15   		The first of the accused is Dr. Radovan Karadzic.  As you have 
 16   heard from our evidence, Dr. Karadzic was the President of the Serbian 
 17   Democratic Party, the Serbian Nationalist Party that played such a 
 18   prominent role in the events leading up to and during the war.  Under 
 19   his leadership, the SDS was highly centralised and had, as its main 
 20   political goals, the complete equality of the Serbs in Bosnia and 
 21   Herzegovina, and remaining in a Federal Yugoslavia.
 22   		In the events leading up to the war, the SDS set up an 
 23   elaborate and efficient communication system and a shadow government 
 24   -- a state within a state.  Once the war started, the SDS, with the 
 25   assistance of the JNA, seized power in the various municipalities 

  1   throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and established a Bosnian Serb 
  2   government that became known as the Republika Srpska.
  3   		Dr. Karadzic became the President of that government on May 
  4   12th 1992, and many of his close associates in the SDS assumed leading 
  5   roles in it as well.  The same day he became President, the Bosnian 
  6   Serb constitution was amended to read that the President was the 
  7   Commander and Chief of the Army. Other legal instruments which were 
  8   promulgated shortly  thereafter granted him power over the police.  
  9   These legal instruments are significant because, together with the 
 10   constitution, they gave Dr. Karadzic complete authority and control 
 11   over all the official Bosnian Serb forces in time of war.
 12   		Eight days after becoming President, he created a unified 
 13   command for the Bosnian Serb Army and police.  This meant that 
 14   information about all aspects of the conflict flowed directly up and 
 15   down the chain of command.  Throughout the war, Dr. Karadzic, as the 
 16   supreme Commander, has unabashedly backed the actions of his army and 
 17   his police.
 18   		Our evidence shows that both as the head of the SDS and as the 
 19   President of the Republika Srpska, Dr. Karadzic's power has been 
 20   pervasive.  As he said in a February 12th 1996 interview, and I quote, 
 21   "I am absolutely fully involved. Everything concerning the Serb 
 22   Republic is in my hands".
 23            This can be best illustrated by some of the evidence that we 
 24   presented during this hearing, including the testimony of Mayor 
 25   Kupusovic who said that Dr. Karadzic removed the head of the SDS party 

  1   in Sarajevo for endorsing publicly, along with other local political 
  2   leaders, the idea that Sarajevo would remain a multi-ethnic city.  On 
  3   a larger scale, there has been testimony that Dr. Karadzic signed 
  4   numerous agreements, such as the cessation of hostilities agreement in 
  5   December 1994.
  6   		General Ratko Mladic is the second person accused in these 
  7   indictments.
  8   		After the JNA "officially withdrew" from Bosnia and 
  9   Herzegovina on 19th May 1992, the BSA, Bosnian Serb Army, replaced it. 
 10    This transformation of the Yugoslav National Army into the Bosnian 
 11   Serb Army amounted to nothing more than  changing the letterhead on 
 12   the stationery, and General Mladic, a career JNA officer, fit 
 13   comfortably      at its helm.  Upon learning that the JNA was going to 
 14   withdraw, he immediately started to establish his own command 
 15   structure and he personally selected the members of the main staff as 
 16   well as the Corps Commanders.  He has effectively controlled the 
 17   Bosnian Serb Army throughout the war, although he has deferred to Dr. 
 18   Karadzic as the overall leader of the Republika Srpska.
 19   		During this public hearing, we have presented only a small 
 20   portion of our evidence against Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic; to 
 21   have presented it all during this hearing would have been imprudent 
 22   and would have only inured to the benefit of these fugitives from 
 23   justice, both of whom remain ensconced in their Balkan sanctuaries.  
 24   They deserve no such benefit.
 25   		I would now like to turn to some of the evidence that we have 

  1   presented in support of Part I of the indictment of July 25th 1995.
  2   		In a speech he delivered before the Assembly of Bosnia and 
  3   Herzegovina on 14th/15th October 1991 regarding moves toward 
  4   independence by the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr. 
  5   Karadzic predicted the outcome the SDS was setting in motion.  He 
  6   said, "I beg you to take this seriously; this is not good what you are 
  7   doing.  This is the same highway to hell and misery taken by Slovenia 
  8   and Croatia.  Beware!  You will drive Bosnia-Herzegovina to hell and 
  9   the Muslim people may vanish.  In a war, Muslims are defenceless".
 10   		His predictions came to pass.
 11   		The Office of the Prosecutor has conducted focused 
 12   investigations in the municipalities of Prijedor, Bosanski Samac, 
 13   Brcko, Foca, Vlasenica and Srebrenica and these  investigations have 
 14   confirmed a ruthless and determined policy of persecution, directed at 
 15   Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats, on national, ethnic, political and 
 16   religious grounds and resulting in their total or almost total 
 17   elimination in many of the municipalities across the territory of what 
 18   is now the "Republika Srpska".
 19   		From 1992 to 1995, in what is now the "Republika Srpska", the 
 20   military and police forces under the direct command and control of the 
 21   accused engaged in a pattern of conduct that included the unlawful 
 22   confinement, killing, beating, torture, rape and deportation of 
 23   civilians.  This pattern, euphemistically referred to as "ethnic 
 24   cleansing", was refined again and again in village after village, city 
 25   after city and municipality after municipality in Bosnia and 

  1   Herzegovina until it culminated in the hideous events that surrounded 
  2   the Bosnian Serb takeover of Srebrenica in July 1995.
  3   		Turning to an indispensable instrument of "ethnic cleansing" 
  4   described in the indictment, I would like to focus on the Bosnian-Serb 
  5   detention facilities, such as Omarska and Keraterm, camps which 
  6   stunned the world because they were horrific reminders of the worst 
  7   atrocities that occurred during the Second World War.
  8   		In late August 1992, representatives of the Thompson 
  9   Commission, a Commission established by the conference on security and 
 10   co-operation in Europe, travelled to the former Yugoslavia and 
 11   directly observed the conditions in detention facilities of the 
 12   parties to the conflict.  Two of their significant conclusions were 
 13   that the majority of detainees, and I quote ,"were not taking part in 
 14   hostilities but were seen as enemies due to their ethnic origin", and 
 15   that the acknowledged  leaders exercised effective control over 
 16   personnel running the detention camps.
 17   		Our exhaustive investigations into these camps have reach the 
 18   same conclusions and have resulted in certain counts contained in the 
 19   indictment that you are considering.
 20   		Our investigations have shown that these camps were 
 21   established and operated by the SDS, military and police personnel who 
 22   were under the direct control and authority of Dr. Karadzic and 
 23   General Mladic or both and that conditions in these camps, whether 
 24   located in Foca municipality in the east, the Brcko municipality in 
 25   the north, or the Prijedor municipality in the west, were abominable.

  1   		Food rations and hygienic conditions in the camps were grossly 
  2   inadequate.  You may recall the film that we presented as Exhibit 29, 
  3   clip 3, showing the emaciated and malnourished detainees about whom 
  4   Dr. Karadzic said, and I quote, "They were a few very skinny guys who 
  5   will never look better.  When I was 30, I too looked like them".  
  6   Torture and murder were commonplace in the Bosnian Serb camps and 
  7   women as well as young girls in them were frequently raped and 
  8   subjected to repeated and perverse forms of sexual assault.  In short, 
  9   the acts committed in these camps were genocidal and were intended to 
 10   destroy, in whole or in part, the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat 
 11   detainees being held in them.
 12   		Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic were certainly well aware of 
 13   what was occurring in these camps.  Their subordinates established and 
 14   ran the camps and many of Dr. Karadzic's closest associates, including 
 15   Velibor Ostojic and Petko Cancar, visited them as did senior SDS 
 16   officials in other areas.
 17   		What occurred in these camps, your Honours, was not,  as Dr. 
 18   Karadzic said in February 1996, "Muslim propaganda", but what was 
 19   criminal conduct on an immense and systematic scale.
 20   		Of course, the detention facilities that I have been 
 21   discussing were not the only instruments of "ethnic cleansing". Our 
 22   indictment describes others, including the widespread and systematic 
 23   deportations of non-Serbs, the unlawful destruction of their homes and 
 24   businesses and the confiscation of their personal and real property by 
 25   personnel under the direction and control of Dr. Karadzic and General 

  1   Mladic.  We have presented evidence to your Honours about these 
  2   portions of the indictment in our original submission at the time of 
  3   the confirmation hearing.  Because of the time constraints of this 
  4   hearing, I will not detail that evidence and will rely on what is 
  5   contained in our original submission.
  6   		I believe that the evidence submitted to you clearly supports 
  7   the charges of genocide and crimes against humanity that are contained 
  8   in Part I of the indictment.
  9   		Now I would like to turn to the charges contained in Part II 
 10   of the indictment which allege that Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic 
 11   individually and in concert with others planned, ordered, instigated 
 12   or otherwise aided and abetted in a systematic campaign of deliberate 
 13   targeting of civilians by Bosnian Serb Army snipers or failed to take 
 14   reasonable and necessary steps to prevent such acts or punish the 
 15   perpetrators thereof.
 16   		This grisly campaign endured for about four years and claimed 
 17   the lives of hundreds of people, regardless of whether they were men 
 18   or women, infants or the elderly and regardless of whether they were 
 19   Sarajevans of Muslim, Serb or Croat descent.
 20   		Sarajevo sits in a bowl surrounded by high mountains.  The 
 21   Bosnian Serb Army occupied these mountains and from these 
 22   promontories, as you have seen from our evidence, it was not difficult 
 23   to see into the besieged city.  Bosnian Serb Army snipers, with their 
 24   highly specialised weapons equipped with powerful optical scopes, had 
 25   clear shots at their victims below who were quite obviously 

  1   non-cambatants.
  2   		This indictment contains a partial list of the dead and the 
  3   wounded, a list that on its face illustrates the cruelty and the 
  4   wantonness of this campaign and a list that needs to be read directly 
  5   to Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic when they, and not just their 
  6   lawyers, are in this courtroom, for they are the men whom we allege 
  7   ordered this slaughter of these innocents.
  8   		Let me read from that list.  Killed, Elma Jakupovic, aged 2, 
  9   Elvedina Colic, aged 4, Nermina Omerovic, aged 11. Continuing with the 
 10   list of killed, Sada Pohara aged 19, Marko Stupar, aged 64.  Turning 
 11   to the list of wounded:  a boy, aged 2, a girl aged 8, a boy aged 5, a 
 12   boy aged 7, a female aged 71, a female aged 72, a female aged 73.
 13   		Dr. Karadzic treated Sarajevo and the lives
 14   of its citizens like his personal plaything.  You may recall the film that 
 15   we introduced into evidence showing Dr. Karadzic standing with the 
 16   Russian poet Limonov above the city like a Lord proudly surveying his 
 17   domain.  His utter and complete disdain for the lives of the people of 
 18   Sarajevo was shown when he, like a proud father showing a son a new 
 19   toy, invited the poet Limonov to fire a high-powered sniper weapon 
 20   into the beseiged city and Limonov did so.  Perhaps, your Honours, it 
 21   was one of Limonov's shots that killed one of the victims named in 
 22   this indictment.
 23   		This protracted sniping campaign terrorised every  citizen of 
 24   that fair city and transformed mundane, daily tasks into life 
 25   threatening adventures.  Taking a tram ride in Sarajevo or going out 

  1   to obtain food and water or merely stepping out on to one's porch for 
  2   a breath of fresh air was akin to playing dice with the grim reaper.  
  3   There were days that you lost the toss and simply did not return home.
  4   		Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic were fully aware that their 
  5   snipers were killing civilians.  In Exhibit No. 65, Mr. Kofi Annan, 
  6   the Under Secretary General for peace-keeping operations of the United 
  7   Nations, states, and I quote, "Complaints regarding the actions of the 
  8   Bosnian Serb forces and adherents were frequently delivered, both 
  9   orally and in writing, to Dr. Karadzic by UNPF/UNPROFOR 
 10   representatives at the highest levels.  Such communications included 
 11   complaints about ... sniping ... in Sarajevo".
 12   		There can be no doubt that both Dr. Karadzic, the Supreme 
 13   Commander, and General Mladic, the Commander of the Army, could have 
 14   stopped this killing whenever they wanted.  As you have heard, Dr. 
 15   Karadzic and General Mladic signed numerous agreements relating to 
 16   Sarajevo, including cease-fire agreements and anti-sniping agreements. 
 17    After they were signed, sniping stopped as quickly as water from a 
 18   tap when its spigot is turned off.  Both of the accused had the power 
 19   to turn off this spigot, but they chose to leave it on through most of 
 20   the siege.
 21   		We believe that the evidence we have presented to you is more 
 22   than sufficient to support the charges contained in this part of the 
 23   indictment.
 24   		I will now turn to the changes contained in Part III of the 
 25   indictment, the taking of UN peacekeepers as hostage and their use as 

  1   human shields between 26th May 1995 and 19th June  1995.
  2   		The evidence in support of these charges is very 
  3   straightforward.  Following NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
  4   military sites on 25th and 26th May, Bosnian Serb Army personnel 
  5   detained 284 peacekeepers and used some of them as human shields in 
  6   order to prevent further air strikes.
  7   		Captain Patrick Rechner, a Canadian United Nations military 
  8   observer who was taken hostage and handcuffed to a lightening rod next 
  9   to an ammunition bunker by Bosnian Serb soldiers with the obvious 
 10   consent of Dr. Karadzic and members of his government, testified about 
 11   his experiences as a hostage and about his conversations with the vice 
 12   president of the Republika Srpska, Nikola Koljevic, related to these 
 13   blatant violations of international law.
 14   		He said that Koljevic readily acknowledged that hostage taking 
 15   was an approved policy of the government implemented to deter NATO air 
 16   strikes.  He said it was akin to electric-convulsive therapy.
 17   		Our evidence shows that on two earlier occasions, in April 
 18   1994 and in November 1994, the Bosnian Serb Army took United Nations 
 19   military observers hostage.  At the time Dr. Karadzic and General 
 20   Mladic ordered hostages taken and used as human shields, they were 
 21   fully aware that such conduct was a gross violation of international 
 22   law.
 23   		This is clearly illustrated by Exhibit 65, the statement of 
 24   Under Secretary Kofi Annan, who states that Dr. Karadzic personally 
 25   represented the Bosnian Serbs in protracted negotiations with the 

  1   United Nations relating to the earlier April 1994 hostage taking 
  2   crisis.
  3   		This was not a situation where Dr. Karadzic and  General 
  4   Mladic were ignorant of their obligations under international law.  It 
  5   was, like the other counts in the indictment, a case where they chose 
  6   simply to ignore their legal and moral obligations in order to achieve 
  7   their political and ideological goals.
  8   		We believe, your Honours, that we have presented sufficient 
  9   evidence to support these counts of the indictment.
 10   		I will now turn my attention to the second indictment that is 
 11   before you for your consideration, the indictment of 16th November 
 12   1995, that charges Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic with genocide, 
 13   crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war 
 14   for the events relating to the takeover of Srebrenica in July 1995.
 15   		The takeover of Srebrenica darkly mirrored all that had 
 16   preceded it.  As Judge Riad so eloquently stated in his opinion 
 17   confirming this indictment, the evidence submitted to him described, 
 18   and I quote "scenes from hell, written on the darkest pages of human 
 19   history".
 20            We allege that Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic and the forces 
 21   under their direct control are responsible for creating those scenes.
 22   		After the war erupted in Eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina in 
 23   1992, forces under the control of Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic 
 24   attacked Muslim communities in and around Srebrenica, resulting in a 
 25   massive exodus of Muslim refugees to Srebrenica.

  1   		Thereafter, the Security Council of the United Nations adopted 
  2   resolution 819, in which it demanded that all parties to the conflict 
  3   in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, treat Srebrenica and its 
  4   surroundings as a "safe area" which should be  free from any armed 
  5   attack or any other hostile act.  Subsequent resolutions reaffirmed 
  6   resolution 819.
  7   		In implementing these resolutions, the United Nations assigned 
  8   a token United Nations force of peacekeepers -- a single Battalion -- 
  9   inside the "safe area" of Srebrenica.  Their mandate was to 
 10   demilitarise the safe area, to monitor compliance with the cease-fire 
 11   and to support the provision of humanitarian aid.
 12   		Although UN peacekeepers performed their duties admirably 
 13   under what were extremely difficult circumstances, the enclave was 
 14   never entirely demilitarised.
 15   		The actual Bosnian Serb invasion of Srebrenica began on July 
 16   6th 1995 but, in reality, the siege of the enclave started in April of 
 17   that same year when the Bosnian Serb Army did not allow supplies and 
 18   humanitarian aid into the enclave. Colonel Karremans referred to this 
 19   as "convoy terror".  As a result of this blockade, basic necessities 
 20   which were required to sustain the civilian population were quickly 
 21   reduced to desperate levels.
 22   		The Bosnian Serb Army blockade had deleterious consequences 
 23   for the peacekeepers as well.  When soldiers of the UN Battalion 
 24   completed their tours of duty and returned home to the Netherlands, 
 25   replacements for them were prevented from entering the enclave and 

  1   what started out as a largely symbolic force of 600 UN soldiers in 
  2   January 1995 was reduced to about 420 soldiers when the Bosnian Serb 
  3   attack on Srebrenica began.
  4   		Of these 420 soldiers, less than half of them were infantry 
  5   troops.  The Dutch United Nations soldiers were equipped with light 
  6   weapons, an insufficient amount of workable anti-tank weaponry and had 
  7   only 16 per cent of their ammunition  allotment at the time the attack 
  8   began.
  9   		In truth and in fact, when the invasion started the Dutch 
 10   Battalion was undermanned, lightly armed, poorly supplied and 
 11   eventually not backed up by airpower in their and the Srebrenicians' 
 12   greatest hour of need.  General Mladic knew this when he selected his 
 13   moment to destroy the enclave.
 14   		For his assault, General Mladic amassed a force of 
 15   approximately 3,000 heavily armed soldiers equipped with the best war 
 16   materiel and equipment in the Bosnian-Serb arsenal, including tanks, 
 17   multiple-rocket launchers, heavy artillery and mounted anti-aircraft 
 18   guns.  The invasion of the enclave advanced quickly with General 
 19   Mladic's forces attacking and overrunning the UN observation posts 
 20   that ringed the enclave, thereby effectively blinding the UN 
 21   peacekeeping operation.
 22   		Bosnian Serb troops captured approximately 55 United Nations 
 23   peacekeepers, stole their weapons, their vehicles, their flak jackets 
 24   and their blue helmets and held them hostage, an illegal but 
 25   successful tactic General Mladic had perfected a month and a half 

  1   earlier.  These 55 hostages, all infantrymen, represented about 25 per 
  2   cent of the available United Nations infantry strength in the enclave.
  3   		Bosnian Serb forces advanced quickly into the enclave creating 
  4   panic amongst the civilian population.  They had good reason to fear 
  5   General Mladic for, as he said in a film clip that we introduced into 
  6   evidence, and I quote, "The time has come to take revenge on the Turks 
  7   in this region".  Many civilians fled to the UN compound in 
  8   Srebrenica, but the Bosnian Serb Army shelled it, killing and wounding 
  9   many of the refugees.  Panic ensued and thousands of civilians fled to 
 10   the UN compound in Potocari. 
 11   		By 11th July, approximately 25,000 refugees, mostly women and 
 12   children and a small percentage of men, gathered in the sweltering 
 13   summer heat in and around the UN compound in Potocari.  There was 
 14   insufficient food, water, medical and sanitary facilities for this 
 15   teeming mass of frightened refugees.  The scene was one of utter panic 
 16   and indescribable despair.  People died, babies were born, children 
 17   were separated and lost from their mothers and some people committed 
 18   suicide.
 19   		Air strikes, which had been repeatedly called for by Colonel 
 20   Karremans, were late in coming and when they did, they were pinprick 
 21   strikes which were utterly insufficient to protect those within the 
 22   enclave.
 23   		They succeeded only in enraging General Mladic and he 
 24   communicated with the Dutch UN base in Potocari and threatened to 
 25   bombard with his heavy artillery the refugees who were gathered around 

  1   the UN compound and threatened to kill the UN peacekeepers he was 
  2   holding hostage if the airstrikes continued.  These were not idle 
  3   threats, given his earlier shelling of the refugees at the UN compound 
  4   in Srebrenica. There were no further airstrikes.
  5   		On the 11th of July, two other significant events occurred. 
  6   The first was the flight of approximately 15,000 men and boys in a 
  7   large column through the woods in the direction of Tuzla, and the 
  8   second was a set of two meetings held in Bratunac between General 
  9   Mladic and Colonel Karremans.
 10   		Colonel Karremans testified that he was summoned to Bratunac 
 11   for a meeting with Bosnian Serb Army representatives and there he met 
 12   General Mladic for the first time.  Also present at that meeting was 
 13   General Zivanovic, the head of the Drina Corps, a Corps of the Bosnian 
 14   Serb Army that figured  prominently in the invasion of the safe area 
 15   and in the atrocities that followed.
 16   		Colonel Karremans testified that during these two meetings 
 17   with General Mladic, General Mladic said, and I quote, "That the fate 
 18   of the Muslims lay in his hands".  He also said that if the Muslims 
 19   surrendered their weapons, they would be treated as prisoners of war, 
 20   according to the Geneva Conventions; that they must "survive or 
 21   disappear"; and he again threatened to shell the UN compound and the 
 22   women and children around it if Bosnian soldiers should fire at his 
 23   troops.  He also said that the UN was incapable of guaranteeing the 
 24   existence of the safe area.
 25   		The following morning, General Mladic and Colonel Karremans 

  1   met a third time in Bratunac.  General Mladic repeated his previous 
  2   demands and told the Bosnian Muslim representatives who were present 
  3   that nobody would be hurt and that there was no reason to be afraid or 
  4   to panic because he always kept his word.  Then, ominously, he said 
  5   that he wanted to see all men between the ages of 16 and 60.  When 
  6   Colonel Karremans asked why, General Mladic said he wanted to track 
  7   down war criminals. Within hours of that meeting General Mladic and 
  8   the Bosnian-Serb Army arrived in Potocari.  Throughout the 12th and 
  9   13th of July Muslim men were separated from their families and taken 
 10   to various locations in and around Potocari, out of the sight of UN 
 11   peacekeepers, where Bosnian Serb soldiers summarily executed them, 
 12   while General Mladic strutted in the area falsely reassuring the 
 13   refugees that nothing would happen be to them. It is hard to imagine a 
 14   more callous and calculated deception.
 15   		You have seen a film clip of General Mladic perpetrating this 
 16   ruse, a ruse, I might add, that was taking  place within earshot of 
 17   where Bosnian Serb soldiers had already started their murderous binge.
 18   		Between the afternoon of 12th July and the early evening of 
 19   the following day approximately 25,000 refugees, mostly women and 
 20   children, were deported from Srebrenica.  Most of the male refugees 
 21   were deported as well, but their fate was different.  Their fate was 
 22   death.  Their murderers were soldiers and police under the command and 
 23   control of Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic.  Within three days of July 
 24   11th to July 13th the entire Muslim population of the enclave had 
 25   either fled, been deported or been killed.  The pattern of ethnic 

  1   cleansing previously perfected by the forces of Dr. Karadzic and 
  2   General Mladic in the municipalities of Prijedor, Bosanski Samac, 
  3   Brcko, Foca and Vlasenica achieved morbid perfection in Srebrenica.
  4   		Now turning my attention to the thousands of men and boys who 
  5   had fled in the direction of Tuzla, a steel cordon of tanks, 
  6   anti-aircraft guns, amoured personnel carriers and soldiers lined up 
  7   every 20 metres awaited them along the Bratunac-Milici Road.  About a 
  8   third of this column evaded or fought its way past the trap line, 
  9   while the others were not so fortunate.  They were captured or 
 10   surrendered to the Bosnian Serb Army by the thousands.  As you saw in 
 11   Exhibit No. 3, clip 2, a film that we presented to you, many were 
 12   lured from the woods by the entreaties of their fellow Muslims who had 
 13   been capture and who, at gunpoint, urged them to surrender.  Others 
 14   who surrendered to the Bosnian-Serb Army were lured from the woods by 
 15   a false sense of security created by the presence Bosnian-Serb Army 
 16   soldiers dressed in stolen UN uniforms or driving stolen and clearly 
 17   marked UN vehicles.  All who surrendered were clearly Hors de Combat 
 18   and all were clearly  entitled to the protections of international 
 19   law.
 20   		Those whom the Bosnian-Serb Army did not kill on the spot were 
 21   taken to various collections centres, such as the ones located in 
 22   Bratunac, Nova Kasaba, Kravica and Sandici.  Both Mr. Ruez and Witness 
 23   A testified that General Mladic visited many of the sites where 
 24   thousands of unarmed Muslim men and boys were being held by the 
 25   Bosnian-Serb Army.  His message was always the same: "Hello, 

  1   neighbours", followed by reassuring words that they would soon be 
  2   exchanged, words that ensured their pacification while they proceeded 
  3   ineluctably to their doom.
  4   		General Mladic and Dr. Karadzic have emphatically denied that 
  5   these massacres occurred and have repeatedly claimed that this is 
  6   nothing more than violent Muslim propaganda.  These are bald-face lies 
  7   calculated to deceive the Serbian people and to deceive the world.  As 
  8   General Mladic said to Colonel Karremans, "The fate of the Muslims lay 
  9   in his hands."
 10   		We have presented to you evidence as to their fate. We have 
 11   presented the remarkable account of Witness A, a man who survived to 
 12   bear witness about a mass execution which took over a thousand lives 
 13   and, but for the grace of God, would have taken his.  Witness A 
 14   testified that he was amongst a group of Muslim prisoners who had been 
 15   separated from their wives and families in Potocari when General 
 16   Mladic approached to within 3 to 4 metres from him and introduced 
 17   himself by saying: "Good day to you, neighbour.  Do you know who I am? 
 18    I am General Mladic." He then informed them that they were going to 
 19   be exchanged.
 20   		Witness A testified that he saw General Mladic five other 
 21   times over the course of the next two days, including at the large 
 22   school hall where he and countless victims were being detained by the 
 23   Bosnian-Serb Army.  At that location General  Mladic again appeared 
 24   and reassured them that they would be exchanged, and minutes later the 
 25   first trucks arrived to take the men to the killing fields.  Witness A 

  1   was taken to this field and after a fusillade he fell to the ground 
  2   and feigned death.  Whilst there he saw General Mladic conferring with 
  3   his subordinates, the executioners of Lazete.  His identification of 
  4   General Mladic at this killing field was certain and unequivocal.
  5   		We have also presented the testimony of Drazen Erdermovic, a 
  6   member of the 10th Sabotage Detachment, a special Reconnaissance Unit 
  7   that was directly attached to General Mladic's main staff in Han 
  8   Pijesak.
  9   		Mr. Erdemovic's unit entered the city of Srebrenica on 11th 
 10   July and met no resistance.  Their orders were to direct civilians to 
 11   a nearby stadium and not to hurt anyone and the few elderly civilians 
 12   they encountered were directed to the stadium. However, when they 
 13   encountered an unarmed man who was of fighting age, Lieutenant 
 14   Pelemis, Mr. Erdermovic's Commanding Officer, ordered one of his men 
 15   to cut the victim's throat. After the victim was murdered, his body 
 16   was left in plain view where other civilians undoubtedly saw it.  The 
 17   slaughter had begun.
 18   		Five days later on 16th July 1995 Mr. Erdemovic and members of 
 19   his unit were taken to a farm in nearby Pilica by a Lieutenant 
 20   Colonel, and two military policemen from the Drina Corps for a special 
 21   assignment.  At the farm he and members of his unit were ordered to 
 22   execute bus loads of unarmed Muslim boys and men from Srebrenica, and 
 23   they and members of the Bratunac Brigade who later joined them did so, 
 24   killing approximately 1,200 men and boys who ranged in age from 17 to 
 25    65.  Mr. Erdemovic said he spoke with one of the victims and was told 

  1   that the victims were brought to the farm believing that they were 
  2   being taken to a prisoner exchange.
  3   		The killings described by Mr. Erdemovic have been confirmed, 
  4   your Honours, by Exhibit 53 which is an aerial photograph taken the 
  5   day after the executions and showing the presence of countless bodies.
  6   		Mr. Erdemovic also testified that the same Lieutenant Colonel 
  7   from the Drina Corps who led them to the farm near Pilica returned 
  8   later in the day and ordered them to kill another 500 people from 
  9   Srebrenica who were in a hall in Pilica, but that he and certain 
 10   members of his unit refused to kill any longer.  These executions, 
 11   however, were willingly carried out by Bosnian-Serb soldiers from 
 12   Bratunac.
 13   		During this hearing we also introduced into evidence a film 
 14   showing the separation of men from women in Potocari, and showing men 
 15   surrendering along the Bratunac-Milici Road.  Many of these men, all 
 16   of whom are seen alive in Bosnian Serb custody, have been identified 
 17   by Pasaga Mesic, the Police Chief from Tuzla who testified on Friday. 
 18    All but two of those who have been identified are missing.
 19   		We have presented the testimony of Mr. Ruez, the lead 
 20   investigator of the Srebrenica inquiry, who has detailed for you the 
 21   results of countless witness and survivor interviews and his 
 22   preliminary findings of various massacre and mass grave sites. 
 23   Preliminary field investigations of these sites, which have been 
 24   conducted by the Office of the Prosecutor, have resulted in the 
 25   discovery of bodies dressed in civilian clothes, skulls with bullet 

  1   holes in them and bodies with their hands tied behind their backs. 
  2   		Can we have Exhibit 33 shown on the screen, your Honour?  
  3   Shown on the screen is Exhibit 33 which clearly shows hands that are 
  4   bound by what Mr. Ruez believed was possibly a shoe lace.  These 
  5   preliminary findings at these sites, your Honours, confirm the 
  6   terrible deeds that are described in the indictment.
  7   		The genocidal acts described in the indictment before you were 
  8   planned in advance, efficiently organised and executed by the 
  9   Bosnian-Serb Army.  After revelations of these massacres came to the 
 10   attention of the world, the Bosnian-Serb Army has been systematically 
 11   excavating sites where they buried thousands of their helpless victims 
 12   in order to conceal their heinous acts and in order to obstruct 
 13   justice.
 14   		In that regard, your Honours, we have presented you with some 
 15   of our evidence of this systematic cover-up.  Exhibit 58, your 
 16   Honours, which is an aerial image taken at the execution site 
 17   described by Mr. Erdemovic, shows these graves sites being dug up.  
 18   Exhibit No. 44, your Honours, taken of grave sites near Tatar, 
 19   Bratunac taken on 30th October 1995, again show these bodies being 
 20   removed and the sites being tampered with.
 21   		My eloquent colleague, Mr. Ostberg, said in his opening 
 22   statement that he would not hesitate to include Srebrenica amongst the 
 23   names of Lidice, Katayn Forest, Oradour and Kragujevac.  Truer words 
 24   have never been spoken.
 25   		We believe, your Honours, that we have presented in our 

  1   original submissions and during this hearing evidence that is more 
  2   than sufficient to show that there are reasonable grounds for 
  3   believing that Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic have committed 
  4   genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of  the Geneva 
  5   Conventions and violations of the laws or customs of war as set forth 
  6   in the two indictments which are before you.
  7   		Today both Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic remain fugitives 
  8   from international justice.  As we approach the first anniversary of 
  9   these tragic massacres, massacres that annihilated a generation of 
 10   Srebenicians and left thousands of widows and orphans, the resulting 
 11   toll of human misery is not only felt today but will be felt for 
 12   generations to come.  In the Balkans, a part of the world where 
 13   history is never forgotten, where the pain of centuries old battles is 
 14   still palpable, Dr. Karadzic's and General Mladic's perfidious and 
 15   cowardly deeds will long be remembered.  What should not be remembered 
 16   as well is that the world had the ability to bring these two alleged 
 17   architects of genocide to justice and did nothing.  It will haunt the 
 18   victims and it will shame us all. We are, therefore, respectfully 
 19   requesting this Honourable Court to issue international arrest 
 20   warrants for Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic.
 21   		Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic remain at liberty today, in no 
 22   small measure due to the failure of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
 23   to arrest them and transfer them to The Hague.  Because the Federal 
 24   Republic of Yugoslavia has given them succour and refuge, we are 
 25   respectively requesting that this Trial Chamber certify to the 

  1   President of the Tribunal that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has 
  2   failed to comply with its obligations under Article 29 of the Statute. 
  3    We recommend that the President of the Tribunal notify the Security 
  4   Council of this refusal to co-operate.
  5   		That concludes my remarks this morning, your Honours. Thank 
  6   you very much. 
  7   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, Mr. Harmon.  So this concludes the full 
  8   presentation of the public charges brought against Dr. Karadzic and 
  9   Ratko Mladic, charges as outlined in the two indictments as confirmed 
 10   in July by Judge Jorda and in November 1995 by Judge Riad.
 11   		Trial Chamber One and the Tribunal is going to proceed with 
 12   its deliberations, and on 11th July the decision will be handed down, 
 13   that is on Thursday, 11th July.
 14      (The hearing adjourned until Thursday, 11th July 1996)
