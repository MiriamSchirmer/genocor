            MR GOLDSTONE:  Your Honours, I appear, together with the
                Deputy Prosecutor, Mr Blewitt, and the senior trial
                attorney, Mr Niemann.
            JUDGE McDONALD:   The appearance by the Amicus Curiae?
            MADAM VIDOVIC: (original in Bosnian):  Vasvija Vidovic.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  We are having a problem.
            MR GOLDSTONE:  There is no English translation from the
                Serbo-Croat.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  Will Mr Prosecutor now present his
                Application?
            MR GOLDSTONE:  Your Honour, with your Honour's leave I will
                ask Mr Blewitt to present the Application on our
                behalf.
            MR BLEWITT:   Your Honour, last week this Tribunal's other
                Trial Chamber granted an application by the Prosecutor
                relating to the deferral by the Government of the
                Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of its investigations
                and prosecutions into alleged crimes committed by
                Bosnian Croat forces against the civilian population of
                the Lasva River Valley in Central Bosnia.
                      The present application before this Trial Chamber
                is a proposal by the Prosecutor for the Government of
                the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to defer other
                investigations and prosecutions to the Tribunal.  On
                             0001

                this occasion, the Prosecutor is seeking to have the
                Bosnian Government's investigations into the alleged
                criminal activities of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic
                and Mico Stanisic transferred to the Tribunal.
                      This particular deferral application is in
                conformity with the Prosecutor's policy to investigate
                the individual criminal responsibility of persons in
                positions of superior authority and control.  This
                policy includes the investigation of individuals who
                gave the unlawful orders to commit crimes over which
                this Tribunal has jurisdiction.  The policy also
                includes the investigation of criminality based on the
                doctrine of command responsibility, which, in the
                context of this case, refers to the investigation of
                persons in positions of superior authority who fail or
                failed to prevent the criminal behaviour or to deter the
                unlawful behaviour of their subordinates.  This imputed
                responsibility applies if the person in superior
                authority knew or had reason to know that the
                subordinates were about to commit or had committed
                crimes and yet failed to take the necessary and
                reasonable steps to prevent the commission of such
                crimes or to punish those who had committed them.
                      I would now like to just outline the extent of the
                Prosecutor's investigation in this particular case.
                             0002

                      When the Office of the Prosecutor became
                operational in mid-1994, a significant focus of the
                initial investigations involved persons in positions of
                authority who were responsible for serious violations of
                international humanitarian law in the former
                Yugoslavia.  This is still the current situation, and
                will continue to be the case.
                      In relation to allegations that such serious
                violations have been committed by Bosnian Serbs in
                Bosnia and Herzegovina, the investigations by the Office
                of the Prosecutor have concentrated on the individual
                criminal responsibility of the leadership of the Bosnian
                Serb administration in Pale.
                      In relation to these investigations, the
                Prosecutor is investigating a wide range of allegations
                covering offences within the competence of the Tribunal,
                including genocide, serious offences against civilians,
                such as murder, rape, torture and other acts of cruelty,
                as well as the destruction of cultural and historical
                property and monuments.  These same offences are also
                being investigated by the authorities of the Government
                of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but I will
                deal with that issue later in these submissions.  In all
                of the Tribunal's investigations involving allegations
                against Bosnian Serbs, the alleged criminal
                             0003

                responsibility of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic has
                been a central focus from the outset, and in more recent
                times, the investigations have included Mico Stanisic.
                      The Prosecutor has already issued indictments
                against other individuals for genocide, murder, rape,
                mistreatment of civilians, torture and other offences
                arising from the operation of detention camps and from
                attacks on unarmed civilians.  In relation to these
                indictments, the Prosecutor is further examining the
                individual criminal responsibilities for those crimes of
                persons in leadership positions, including Radovan
                Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic.
                      One significant investigation being undertaken by
                the Prosecutor, but which at this stage has not resulted
                in the issue of indictments, relates to the protracted
                siege of Sarajevo, where allegations include past and
                continuing unlawful shelling and sniping incidents.  As
                a result of such incidents, many thousands of civilians
                have been killed and injured.  Non-military buildings,
                such as hospitals and cultural structures, have also
                been unlawfully targeted.  In particular, the Prosecutor
                is investigating the alleged deliberate and systematic
                sniping campaign directed against the civilian
                population, including the elderly and young children, as
                well as the commission of sexual assaults, other attacks
                             0004

                on civilians (for example, whilst travelling in trams,
                standing in bread lines and attending funerals).  Other
                alleged offences being investigated by the Prosecutor
                relate to the unlawful attacks upon members of
                humanitarian agencies, the United Nations peacekeeping
                forces, humanitarian aid convoys and manned aircraft at
                Sarajevo Airport.  In the Sarajevo investigation, the
                Prosecutor is examining the individual criminal
                responsibility of persons in leadership positions, in
                particular Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
                      It is stated in the schedule attached to the
                Prosecutor's application in this case that "Radovan
                Karadzic was born on 19th June 1945 in the municipality
                of Savnik of the Republic of Montenegro.  He is, by
                profession, a psychiatrist, who worked in the
                Neuro-psychiatric Clinic of the University Medical
                Centre in Sarajevo.  He was a founding member, and
                President, of the Serbian Democratic Party, of what was
                then the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
                After the first multi-party elections in the Republic,
                Radovan Karadzic emerged as the leader of the dominant
                political party among the Bosnian Serbs and played an
                active part in the national political life of the
                country, emphasising Serbian nationalist sentiments.
                Radovan Karadzic is one of the main architects of that
                             0005

                party's political programme involving extreme
                nationalist and ethnic policies and objectives.  Radovan
                Karadzic became the first President of the Bosnian Serb
                administration in Pale.  The constitution of this
                administration provides that the President commands its
                armed forces.  Radovan Karadzic exercises his power and
                control from Pale, a town near Sarajevo.  Radovan
                Karadzic has acted as, and has been dealt with
                internationally as, the President of the Bosnian Serb
                administration in Pale.  In that capacity, Radovan
                Karadzic has, amongst other things, participated in
                international negotiations and has personally made
                agreements on such matters as ceasefires and
                humanitarian relief that have, in fact, been
                implemented."
                      In relation to the suspect Ratko Mladic, he was
                born in 1943 in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
                He is a career military officer and gained his first
                command in 1965.  In the summer of 1991, he was
                appointed to command the 9th Corps of the Yugoslav
                People's Army, otherwise known as the JNA.  This was in
                the Knin area of the Republic of Croatia.  Subsequently,
                he assumed command of the forces of the Second Military
                District of the JNA, which effectively became the
                Bosnian Serb Army.  In that capacity he has negotiated,
                             0006

                among other things, ceasefire and prisoner exchange
                agreements that have in fact been implemented.
                      Both Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have been
                appraised repeatedly, through international media
                reports, reports of governments and non-governmental
                organisations, and through reports and resolutions of
                the United Nations and other international
                organisations, of the criminal acts amounting to
                violations of international humanitarian law allegedly
                committed by forces under their control.  Part of the
                Prosecutor's investigations involves the apparent
                failure of these two suspects to take the necessary and
                reasonable steps to prevent or repress the commission of
                such crimes or to punish those who have committed them.
                      The third suspect named in the Prosecutor's
                application, Mico Stanisic, was born on 30th June 1954
                near Pale in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  He
                was the first Minister of Internal Affairs of the
                Bosnian Serb administration in Pale, and in that
                capacity he was responsible for the regular and special
                police forces at both the regional and local level in
                the territory which was under Bosnian Serb control.  The
                Prosecutor's investigations involve allegations that
                those police forces were actively involved in organising
                a campaign of terror against the non-Serbian population
                             0007

                of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
                      I would now like, your Honours, to turn to the
                investigations which are currently being undertaken by
                the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and
                Herzegovina.
                      The Schedule attached to the Prosecutor's
                application in this matter sets out the nature of the
                investigations being conducted by the Government of the
                Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which involves
                investigations into war crimes and violations of the
                Criminal Law of the Republic, including genocide, war
                crimes against the civilian population and the
                destruction of cultural and historical monuments.  A
                number of the persons are named in these investigations,
                including Radovan Karadzic, the president of the Bosnian
                Serb administration in Pale; Ratko Mladic, the military
                commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces; and Mico
                Stanisic, the former minister of internal affairs of
                that administration.  National warrants of arrest have
                been issued in respect of these named suspects, which
                authorise the detention of the suspects in custody for a
                period of one month to enable the Bosnian Government's
                investigations to continue.
                      I would now like to address the Trial Chamber in
                relation to the reasons for the present application.
                             0008

                Firstly, there is no contest that the national
                investigations and criminal proceedings have been
                instituted against Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and
                Mico Stanisic by the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
                for crimes alleged to have taken place in its
                territory.  In our submission, these national
                investigations and criminal proceedings involve issues
                closely related to, or otherwise involve, significant
                factual or legal questions which may have implications
                for investigations or prosecutions before this Tribunal.
                      Secondly, the Prosecutor of this Tribunal is
                currently conducting investigations into crimes within
                the jurisdiction of the Tribunal that have taken place
                within the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and
                Herzegovina in which Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and
                Mico Stanisic are suspects.  These investigations, as I
                mentioned earlier, commenced in mid-1994.
                      Thirdly, the Minister of Justice of the Bosnian
                Government has proposed, in a letter dated 12th December
                1994, that the Tribunal take over the investigation of
                Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.  Further, in their
                written submissions, which were filed with the Registrar
                of this Tribunal on Monday, 8th May 1995, the Bosnian
                Government has again proposed that its own
                investigations be deferred to the Tribunal, stating that
                             0009

                it does not oppose the issue of a formal request for the
                deferral of all investigations and criminal proceedings
                in respect of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico
                Stanisic.
                      The fourth reason:  it is stated in paragraph 11
                of those written submissions of the Government of the
                Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that in the absence
                of a formal request for deferral that Government intends
                to pursue its investigations of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko
                Mladic and Mico Stanisic, and will proceed to trial.  It
                is submitted that, from the Tribunal's point of view,
                this would be undesirable and not in the interests of
                justice.
                      In any event, it is submitted, your Honours, that
                this Tribunal is the proper forum to try the suspects
                nominated in the present application, particularly
                having regard to the gravity of the crimes under
                investigation by the Prosecutor.
                      The fifth reason, your Honours, is that the
                Prosecutor of this Tribunal, we submit, is in a better
                position to approach witnesses living in other countries
                and to conduct interviews outside the borders of the
                Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and this is an
                additional reason for a deferral in this case.
                      Sixthly, it is submitted that a related reason for
                             0010

                granting the present application is that many of the
                important witness who are located outside the Republic
                of Bosnia and Herzegovina may be reluctant to return or
                to travel to Bosnia to testify in a national trial, and
                accordingly the Office of the Prosecutor is in a better
                position to collect evidence and to complete the
                investigations and to present that evidence before the
                Tribunal.
                      Further, it is submitted that the deferral of the
                Bosnian Government's investigation in respect of
                Karadzic, Mladic and Stanisic is likely to encourage or
                enable governments, non-governmental agencies and other
                sources to furnish evidence and information to the
                Tribunal that has thus far not been provided.  Following
                the announcement of the two deferral applications, the
                attitude of some governments and non-governmental
                organisations have become more positive towards the
                Tribunal.
                      Your Honours, there are several significant
                implications for the investigations being undertaken by
                the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as any subsequent
                proceedings before this Tribunal if the Government of
                the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina continues
                investigations which are similar to those being
                conducted by the Office of the Prosecutor.  In this
                             0011

                regard, it is submitted that the Prosecutor's
                investigations, which have not been completed, could be
                severely and significantly prejudiced if the
                investigations and prosecutions being undertaken by the
                Bosnian Government continue.
                      Your Honours, it is likely that considerable
                confusion may result amongst witnesses and co-operating
                organisations or governments concerning the scope and
                authority of parallel investigations being undertaken by
                the Tribunal and the Bosnian Government.  In this
                regard, there are different rules and confidentiality
                protections which govern the two investigations.  Of
                greater concern, however, is the undue burden which is
                placed on witnesses who are interviewed by different
                investigating bodies, on different occasions, and the
                resulting possibility of compromising the credibility of
                witnesses due to the inadvertent creation of multiple
                statements.  It is relevant to mention in this regard
                that almost all of the statements being taken by the
                Office of the Prosecutor require the services of
                interpreters, and this is an added circumstance which
                could bring about apparent inconsistencies between
                statements taken by the Prosecutor' investigators on the
                one hand and by the Bosnian investigators on the other.
                This burden on witnesses who are interviewed on multiple
                             0012

                occasions is particularly relevant to witnesses who have
                suffered trauma and who may be at physical risk as a
                result of their co-operation.  Witnesses faced with
                these burdens could, in fact, refuse to co-operate with
                any investigating body at all.
                      Separate investigations are also likely to lead to
                evidentiary problems which may result from different
                investigative procedures such as those concerning the
                collection and preservation of evidence, the taking of
                statements and the questioning of suspects.
                      A third implication for the Tribunal, your
                Honours, is that, if the Government of the Republic of
                Bosnia and Herzegovina proceeds to trial before our
                investigations are completed, it is likely that there
                may be a number of legal issues which could have
                implications for those investigations and for any
                prosecutions before the Tribunal.  These legal
                implications were also raised in last week's deferral
                application by the Prosecutor, and they include the
                principle of non-bis-in-idem, which may arise, pursuant
                to Article 10(2) of the Statute of the Tribunal, if
                Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic stand
                trial in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
                      The fourth implication, your Honours, is if the
                persons nominated as suspects in this application stand
                             0013

                trial in the courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there may
                be legal implications for the Tribunal, by reason of the
                fact that crucial witnesses, who will be required to
                testify before the Tribunal, will be exposed to greater
                risks if their identities and the evidence they can give
                has already been made public in a public national trial.
                      The fifth implication, your Honours, is that
                witnesses may be reluctant, or at least significantly
                inconvenienced, if required to testify in a subsequent
                trial before this Tribunal after they have already given
                evidence before a national court.
                      Further, there may also be a risk that important
                evidence, which is being retained for use in a trial in
                a national court in a war zone within the Republic of
                Bosnia and Herzegovina, could be damaged or destroyed
                before it can be secured for use before this Tribunal.
                      Finally, international publicity, which would
                result from a trial in absentia or otherwise in a
                national court, may create a perception of prejudice in
                the minds of the accused, or the public, and may have
                implications for a fair trial before the Tribunal.
                      I submit, on behalf of the Prosecutor, that the
                present application is in full compliance with the
                provisions of the Tribunal's Statute and Rules and that
                the national investigations and criminal proceedings in
                             0014

                question involve issues closely related to, or otherwise
                involve significant factual or legal questions which may
                have implications for investigations or prosecutions
                before the Tribunal.
                      If your Honours are satisfied that a deferral in
                relation to this present application is appropriate,
                having regard to the matters that have been submitted on
                behalf of the Prosecutor, then pursuant to Rule 10 of
                the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure and Evidence, we
                propose that the Trial Chamber issue a formal request to
                the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
                in the following terms, namely:
                      (A) In respect of serious violations of
                international humanitarian law over which this Tribunal
                has jurisdiction, as specified in Articles 2, 3, 4 and 5
                of the Tribunal Statute, that the courts of the Republic
                of Bosnia and Herzegovina defer to the competence of the
                Tribunal in regard to their investigations and criminal
                proceedings involving Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and
                Mico Stanisic; and
                      (B) In regard to all such investigations of
                Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic, the
                Tribunal requests that the Government of the Republic of
                Bosnia and Herzegovina forward to the Tribunal the
                results of the said investigations and copies of the
                             0015

                court's records and judgments, if any.
                      They are my submissions, if it please the Court.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  Thank you very much, Mr Blewitt.  I
                think I have just only one point to clear, and I think
                it is in relation to essential interests in the
                application, because you opened your application with a
                statement that the significant focus of your
                investigation is to go against persons in positions of
                authority.
            MR BLEWITT:   Yes, your Honour.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  Since last August you said that, when
                you started.  It would appear that, in the exercise of
                your right to primacy, this is also of essential
                interest, and you have now relied only on our Rules 9(3)
                for the proposition which you have made, not necessarily
                on 1 and 2, which might not be applicable.
            MR BLEWITT:   Yes, your Honour.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  Because a lot of your reasons appear to
                be legal implications that might arise if the
                investigations were carried out in a jurisdiction other
                than your own, and, in fact, it would be better for you
                to take it over and then conclude the investigation.
                This is the essential focus of your practice here.
            MR BLEWITT:   Indeed, your Honour.  That is, in fact, the
                only basis upon which this application is based, under
                             0016

                Rule 9(3), your Honour.  There is no evidence or
                information before the Prosecutor's Office which would
                indicate that sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) have any
                application at all.  In fact, the investigations being
                undertaken by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina
                themselves relate to crimes of genocide and war crimes,
                so that I do not think it could be said, your Honour,
                that those investigations could be characterised as
                crimes of an ordinary nature.
                      Secondly, your Honour, there is certainly nothing
                to indicate that the investigations being undertaken by
                the Bosnian Government are in any way impartial, or lack
                impartiality, I should say, so that what your Honour
                says is correct, that the sole basis of the Prosecutor's
                application is under Rule 9(3).
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  I call on the Amicus Curiae to make her
                submission.
            MADAM VIDOVIC: (original in Bosnian):  The Government of the
                Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has instituted
                national investigations and criminal proceedings against
                Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  Excuse me, there are some technical
                problems.
            MADAM VIDOVIC: (original in Bosnian):  National
                investigations and criminal proceedings have been
                             0017

                instituted against Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and
                Mico Stanisic by the Government of the Republic of
                Bosnia and Herzegovina in respect of war crimes and
                violations of the Criminal Law of the Republic,
                including genocide (Article 141), war crimes against the
                civilian population (Article 142) and destruction of
                cultural and historical monuments (Article 151), alleged
                to have taken place in its territory.
                      The Republic is aware that the Prosecutor of the
                International Criminal Tribunal is currently conducting
                investigations into crimes within the jurisdiction of
                the Tribunal that have taken place within its territory
                of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in which
                Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic are
                suspects.
                      Further, the Republic is aware that national
                investigations and criminal proceedings involve issues
                closely related to, or other otherwise involve,
                significant factual or legal questions which may have
                implications for investigations or prosecutions before
                the Tribunal.
                      The Republic proposes that its investigations of
                Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic be
                deferred to the Tribunal.
                      The Republic is fully conversant of the
                             0018

                application being brought by the Prosecutor of the
                Tribunal for deferral of the Government's investigations
                and criminal proceedings in respect of Radovan Karadzic,
                Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic.
                      The Republic believes that the contents of the
                said application and attached schedule dated the 21st of
                April 1995 are true.
                      The Republic does not oppose the issue of a formal
                request by the Trial Chamber for the deferral of all
                investigations and criminal proceedings in respect of
                Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic.
                      The Republic will lend its full support to the
                work of the Tribunal and, to the extent that this is
                legally possible, comply with requests made by the
                Tribunal and its Prosecution authority within their
                competence.
                      If the Tribunal addresses to the Republic a formal
                request for "deferral" of the criminal proceedings
                presently underway against Radovan Karadzic, Ratko
                Mladic and Mico Stanisic in respect of war crimes and
                violations of the criminal law of the Republic,
                including genocide, war crimes against the civilian
                population and destruction of cultural and historical
                monuments, which are currently being conducted by the
                Government, the competent Republic authorities will make
                             0019

                available to the Tribunal all knowledge which has been
                gathered in investigations which have been carried out
                as well as any which may be gathered in the future,
                together with copies of the court's records and
                judgments, if any.
                      The Ministry of the Interior of the Republic has
                issued national warrants of arrest for Radovan Karadzic,
                Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic for the purposes of the
                investigation.
                      The Republic, in the absence of a formal request
                for deferral issued by the Tribunal, intends to pursue
                its investigation of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and
                Mico Stanisic and will proceed to trial.  Thank you.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  Thank you very much, Amicus Curiae.
                You have submitted that you have already issued warrants
                of arrest pursuant to the investigations against the
                three principal actors.  Does that justify the stage of
                investigations you have already reached?
            MADAM VIDOVIC: (original in Bosnian):  Yes, indeed, your
                Honour, and in accordance with our legislation, which is
                slightly different from the Rules of this Tribunal, I
                can, if need be, present some explanation on this topic,
                if you believe that this is necessary.  Indeed,
                according to our criminal legislation, if, following
                judiciary investigation, the Prosecutor in this case --
                             0020

                this would be the Superior Prosecutor of Sarajevo --
                believes that there are grounds to believe that a person
                has committed a crime, the Superior Prosecutor can then
                issue a warrant for arrest if he believes that there is
                doubt as to the grounds for believing this person is
                suspect, or that there are sufficient grounds they can
                issue a warrant for arrest.  In this case, it seems that
                the suspicion has grounds, is founded, and, therefore,
                based on the findings thus far, the suspects which we
                could not bring before our own instances, nonetheless
                justify the issuance of warrants for arrest that were
                then given to Interpol.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  There appears to be two grades of
                applications in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There is one before
                the Higher Court, and there is also the one before the
                District Military Tribunal.  Are both of them directed
                towards the same thing or two different things?
            MADAM VIDOVIC: (original in Bosnian):  No.  According to our
                legislation, because the crimes were perpetrated in war
                time, as concerns certain of these crimes, the
                jurisdiction was that of the Military Tribunal.  This
                means that at that time -- and I emphasise "at that
                time" -- the Military Tribunal had jurisdiction, whereas
                for other crimes the Superior Tribunal of Sarajevo had
                jurisdiction.
                             0021

                      As regards the present case, investigations are
                not only under way regarding these three suspects, but
                also concerning other suspects as well.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  Very well, thank you.  Thank you very
                much.
            JUDGE JORDA: (original in French):  Thank you,
                Mr President.  I would like to address my questions to
                the Prosecutor and to Amicus Curiae.  First, to the
                Prosecutor, since he must demonstrate, in accordance
                with Article 9, the relationship between the
                investigations being conducted in the Republic of
                Bosnia-Herzegovina and his own investigations -- and
                this you have done, for which I thank you --  I wish to
                ask you whether the investigations conducted by your
                Office are the same as those being conducted by the
                judiciary authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina?  May I add
                to my question, in your application you talk about three
                investigations that are very specific:  the protracted
                seizure of Sarajevo, offences or attacks on humanitarian
                agencies and on elements of UNPROFOR.  Are the only
                investigations that are common with those of the
                Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, these that are
                mentioned, or are there other investigations as well as
                those that are concurrently being conducted?
            MR BLEWITT:   If your Honour pleases, the investigations
                             0022

                being undertaken by the Prosecutor's Office in many ways
                overlaps that being undertaken by the Government of the
                Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The crimes which
                your Honour has just mentioned, namely the siege of
                Sarajevo, the attacks on humanitarian aid convoys, and
                the United Nations peacekeeping forces, when I was
                mentioning those, your Honour, they, in fact, relate to
                the investigation into the siege of Sarajevo.
                      The Prosecutor's investigation, as it relates to
                the investigation of the Bosnian Serb leadership, is
                certainly not restricted to the investigations of the
                siege of Sarajevo, but is related to the entire
                criminality that has occurred throughout the Republic.
                      Your Honour should be aware that indictments have
                already been issued in relation to crimes committed by
                people in the Prijedor area and the Vlasenica area.  The
                Prosecutor has also announced publicly that we are
                investigating crimes in relation to the events in
                Bosanski Samac.  They are but a few, your Honour, and,
                in fact, the Prosecutor's investigations are extensive.
                      The investigations being undertaken by the Bosnian
                Government are also aimed at persons in positions of
                command responsibility.  That is the same focus of the
                investigations being undertaken by the Prosecutor's
                Office, and to that extent, your Honour, both
                             0023

                investigations do overlap, and it is for that primary
                reason that we are seeking deferral in this particular
                case.
            JUDGE JORDA: (original in French):  Thank you, Prosecutor.
                Does this mean that in the other investigations, even
                those for which you have presented indictments, you will
                extend those investigations to those persons in
                positions of authority?
            MR BLEWITT:   Yes, your Honour, most definitely.
            JUDGE JORDA: (original in French):  I would like to ask an
                additional question, Prosecutor, before turning to
                Amicus Curiae.  The requested deferral is based and
                grounded on the preservation of evidence and the need to
                ensure the security of the witnesses' testimony.  Can
                you tell us if, in concert, in collaboration with the
                Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, these measures have
                already been taken to protect these witnesses, who must
                be known in the course of the investigations conducted
                by Bosnia and Herzegovina?
            MR BLEWITT:   Your Honour, to the extent that is possible
                and feasible, all steps have, in fact, been taken in
                co-operation with the Bosnian Government to protect any
                witnesses that are likely to give evidence in any
                Prosecution before this Tribunal.
            JUDGE JORDA: (original in French):  Thank you.  With your
                             0024

                permission, Mr President, I would like to ask a question
                to Amicus Curiae.  Do you agree with the presentation
                made by the Prosecutor of what qualifies or
                characterizes the authority of the three suspects, or do
                you have any other information which you can contribute,
                particularly as regards the Bosnian Serb
                administration?
            MADAM VIDOVIC: (original in Bosnian):  I am in full
                agreement with the presentation made by the Prosecutor,
                your Honour.  I might add that all acts perpetrated on
                the territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina was
                done according to a plan that was designed and approved
                by the three suspects.
            JUDGE KARIBI-WHYTE:  This is the end of this session.  The
                Tribunal will rise now and assemble at 10.00 am tomorrow
                to deliver a decision.
            (10.50)
                                (Tribunal adjourned)
