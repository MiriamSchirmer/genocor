  1   THE PRESIDING JUDGE [In translation]:  First question, can everyone hear 
  2   me?  Mr. Harmon, can you hear me?  Can you hear me, counsel for the 
  3   Prosecution?
  4   MR. HARMON:  Yes.
  5   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Great.  Can the Registry hear me? Interpreters can 
  6   hear me?  Everybody can hear what is going on.  The visitors' gallery? 
  7    Everyone can hear what is going on?  No technical problem?  Fellow 
  8   Judges hear me?  Terrific.  Now, Mr. Harmon, we can proceed with 
  9   Colonel Karremans' testimony and I would ask the usher to bring him 
 10   in.
 11   MR. HARMON:  Thank you, your Honour.
 12                     COLONEL THOMAS KARREMANS, recalled.
 13   		Examined by MR. HARMON, continued.
 14   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Colonel Karremans, good morning. You can hear me?
 15   THE WITNESS:  Yes, I can, your Honour.
 16   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Fine, so we shall resume with your testimony.  You 
 17   have been called by the Prosecution in the case of the Prosecution 
 18   against Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.  Please proceed.
 19   MR. HARMON:  Thank you, your Honour.  Colonel Karremans, yesterday you 
 20   described the Bosnian Serb Army blockade that slowly strangled the 
 21   enclave as a convoy of terror. What effect did this have on the 
 22   occupants in the enclave?
 23   A.   I would like to stipulate some things which I have said yesterday 
 24   concerning the circumstances, I must say the miserable circumstances, 
 25   for the inhabitants of the  enclave, but also for my own Battalion.  

  1   That could explain something on the circumstances up to 6th July. 
  2   Those, let us say, miserable circumstances in April, May and June were 
  3   caused, what I said yesterday, by refusing the incoming convoys, 
  4   either for the battalion or by UNHCR for the refugees.  Thus, we had 
  5   to do with a strangulation of the enclave or, so to call, an 
  6   isolation, a total blockade.
  7   		That meant for the population, for instance, that their 
  8   situation was poorer than poor.  There was starvation for the 
  9   refugees.  Some died by the starvation.  There was no medical 
 10   treatment at all for the population, no doctors, no dentists, no 
 11   medicines. The Medicine sans Frontieres, MSF, was not able to fulfil 
 12   its job in the local hospital.  We could not do anything about 
 13   infrastructure to support the local authorities like housing, like 
 14   generators, power and electricity and water supply for the 
 15   population.
 16   		It ended up, for instance, that hundreds of inhabitants of the 
 17   enclave lived literally on the garbage collection point.  There was 
 18   no travel allowed both for the population and for the Battalion.  
 19   What was agreed in the beginning in 1993, so-called freedom of 
 20   movement, there was no freedom of movement at all.
 21   		Our conclusion for the inhabitants, the population of enclave, 
 22   was that the situation was hopeless, inhuman and a lot of suffering 
 23   for the people.
 24   		On the other side, for the Battalion, I would like to describe 
 25   that a little bit too, if I may, and I use a couple of parameters 

  1   which I also put in my reports for  the higher echelons and also for 
  2   my national authorities.  In the first place, the logistics, I have 
  3   told you, your Honours, a little bit about that yesterday on the 
  4   diesel, the lack of diesel which implied that we have to live in the 
  5   dark with my Battalion for a couple of months.  We had no electricity 
  6   for water, for heating and the weather conditions in those days till 
  7   the end of May were extreme, a lot of rain day after day, so we 
  8   cannot use our vehicles, on one side, because of a lack of fuel, but 
  9   on the other side, the roads we had in the enclave we could not use 
 10   them.
 11   		Because of the lack of diesel, we had to patrol by foot with 
 12   all the consequences of the mines all over the area.  There was no 
 13   possibility of resupplying my observation posts and that is why we 
 14   used horses from the locals.  What I said before, there was no 
 15   heating especially under those extreme weather conditions.  We had no 
 16   medicines.  We had no spare parts, we had no engineer equipment and 
 17   no food except our combat rations and we lived on combat rations a 
 18   long time.  We called that at the end a "logistical regime".
 19   		Then on my own personnel, the soldiers, I had a lack of 
 20   personnel because they could not enter the enclave as of 26th April. 
 21    They got no mail from home. There was no freedom of movement.  We 
 22   could not leave the enclave.  We could not enter the enclave.  The 
 23   third parameter were the operations.  We have adjusted the orders for 
 24   the Battalion several times (and I explained that yesterday) from 
 25   eight observations posts to 12 and even 13 at the end, patrolling by 

  1   foot instead of using  armoured personnel carriers.  We made 
  2   contingency plans as of, let us say, the air strikes in Pale at the 
  3   end of May.  Contingency plans were for the observation posts one 
  4   hour notice, and one hour notice meant that the soldiers on an 
  5   observation post after an order should leave the observation post 
  6   within an hour.  That was 24 hours a day, the time we have been 
  7   there.
  8   		Humanitarian support, I just explained that to you, we were 
  9   not able to support the population within the enclave.  One of the 
 10   other parameters was the psychological effect on the soldiers, but 
 11   also on the population, the morale of the Battalion but also from the 
 12   population.  The terrain conditions were bad and the weather 
 13   conditions were even badder.  That ended up with 25th May that I 
 14   informed in a long report to all the higher echelons and to the 
 15   national authorities that I was not able to fulfil my mission any 
 16   longer.  That meant the end of the mission, period.
 17   		Then we started with making all improvisations. Using those 
 18   improvisations, we could handle the mission more or less until 6th 
 19   July.
 20   Q.  Colonel Karremans, based on the Bosnian Serb blockade and its effects 
 21   as well as the capture of 55 of your soldiers by the Bosnian Serb 
 22   Army, did you feel you had the means to fulfil your mission?
 23   A.   Not at the end.  In the beginning, when we started in January, I 
 24   could fulfil the mission based on the mandate, based on what I had, 
 25   personnel, equipment, the incoming convoys, but at the end of my stay 

  1   over there, the answer is no. 
  2   Q.   Now I would like to turn your attention to the actual invasion 
  3   itself.  What was the effect on the civilian population once the 
  4   invasion started?
  5   A.  As you know, your Honours, the invasion started on 6th July.  It 
  6   started with heavy fighting in the southern part of the enclave in the 
  7   direct vicinity of OP Fox Trot, and by shelling the city of Srebrenica 
  8   itself, the compounds and some other observation posts, but actually 
  9   it started in the south.
 10   		In the southern part of the enclave, there was the so-called 
 11   Swedish shelter project, a lot of housing built under Swedish 
 12   authorities.  In that Swedish shelter project there used to live about 
 13   3,000 refugees.  As soon as the attacks started in the southern part, 
 14   all those refugees flew in the northern direction towards the city of 
 15   Srebrenica.  You can imagine there was panic, chaos in those days, 
 16   what I explained before, no food and there was no way to give them 
 17   houses in Srebrenica itself -- panic, I must say.
 18   Q.  Where did the people flee to?
 19   A.   They flee to Srebrenica.
 20   Q.  Did they flee to the UN compound in Srebrenica?
 21   A.   Not in the beginning.  That was, I think, on 10th, on the Monday, and 
 22   of course at the last day, on Tuesday 11th.
 23   Q.  How many refugees were in and around the UN compound in Srebrenica?
 24   A.   I do not know exactly, but that must be hundreds at the compound and 
 25   maybe thousands around it.  They were all guarded together. 

  1   Q.  What happened to those refugees in the compound around Srebrenica?
  2   A.   Do I have to refer to the 11th, the last day?
  3   Q.  Please.
  4   A.   Because at that day and the days before Srebrenica itself was already 
  5   shelled quite some times and at the 11th, well, while all those 
  6   refugees were guarded together, at least most of them, the BSA started 
  7   shelling the city.  It started shelling the compound of Srebrenica 
  8   itself and that ended up with a lot of wounded persons, death.  Also, 
  9   in the morning and on the morning of the 11th, we already evacuated 
 10   the local hospital and we brought all the wounded persons to the 
 11   compound of Potocari.
 12   		As soon as the shelling started in the afternoon of the 11th, 
 13   just before the air strikes or during the air attacks, all the 
 14   refugees flee into the direction of Potocari, in the northern 
 15   direction, to the compound of Battalion staff and staff company.
 16   Q.  So, Colonel Karremans, some of the BSA artillery shells landed in and 
 17   around the UN compound itself in Srebrenica; is that correct?
 18   A.   That is correct, sir.
 19   Q.  Did that cause civilian casualties?
 20   A.   That caused civilian casualties.
 21   Q.  You mentioned as a result of the attacks on the city of Srebrenica 
 22   itself there was a large exodus of civilians that fled to Potocari; is 
 23   that correct?
 24   A.   That is correct.
 25   Q.  Did the refugees who fled from the UN compound in  Srebrenica flee to 

  1   the UN compound in Potocari?
  2   A.   Yes, they did.
  3   Q.  Approximately, how many people gathered in and around the UN compound 
  4   in Potocari?
  5   A.   It is just an estimation, of course, but we were forced to split up 
  6   the group of refugees because there were so many thousands.  We put, 
  7   let us put it that way, or "invited" is a better word, we invited 
  8   about 4,000 to 5,000 refugees within our own compound of Potocari and 
  9   then it was completely full, filled up, with refugees and our own 
 10   personnel.  Then we had another 15,000 to 20,000 persons still outside 
 11   of the compound of Potocari and we used two or three shelled factories 
 12   just in the vicinity of the compound of Potocari.
 13   Q.  What was the percentage of women to men in the 25,000 refugees that 
 14   you say congregated in and around the compound?
 15   A.   About those 25,000 refugees, most of them were women, children and 
 16   elderly people.  I think, and that is what I have stated before, there 
 17   were about two to three per cent men between 16 and 60.
 18   Q.  Could you please describe the general conditions that were present in 
 19   and around the compound?
 20   A.   Yes, I can.  The general conditions from the people, the refugees, it 
 21   is what I explained before, was poorer than poor.  They had not had 
 22   food and water supplies during the six days war over there.  They were 
 23   in a very bad condition, and we had no means to supply them, only by 
 24   the water we had left into our own compound and some food and some 
 25   medicines left, but the general condition  of the people was 

  1   miserable, more than miserable.
  2   Q.  Amongst those 25,000 refugees, were there some pregnant women who were 
  3   delivering their babies?
  4   A.   Yes, there were, what I heard later on, there were five pregnant 
  5   women with their little babies.  What I heard was that one man hung 
  6   himself during the stay over there and life was, let us say, going on 
  7   during the two days that we had all those refugees around us.
  8   Q.  OK.  Now I would like to turn your attention to air strikes.  Can you 
  9   please describe those air strikes to the court?
 10   A.   Yes, I can.  As everybody knows, I have asked several times for air 
 11   strikes, looking to the mandate, the mandate which asked in the 
 12   beginning of the establishing or the establishment of the safe areas 
 13   of Srebrenica and Zepa and Gorazde, that one needed about 40,000 
 14   soldiers for that, and that was diminished after negotiations to about 
 15   8,000; that they changed the mandate in that sense that they combined 
 16   it with air strikes or, let us say, close air support, air support in 
 17   general.
 18   		That was one of the parts of the mandate, and that was what I 
 19   am referring to, that as soon as the attacks started on 6th, I asked 
 20   for a close air support because one of OPs was attacked, UN troops 
 21   were attacked, the city of Srebrenica had been shelled.  There was no 
 22   close air support available on the days that I have asked for that, 
 23   except at the last day, on the 11th, on the Tuesday.  I have asked 
 24   that in the very early morning. I expected that at 6 o'clock.  I had 
 25   a meeting during the night from Monday to Tuesday with the local 

  1   authorities  and the military authorities.  We discussed that even, 
  2   and told them that we expected air strikes or close air support in 
  3   the very early morning on 11th.  That did not come.  It did not show 
  4   up.
  5   		Afternoon, about 2 o'clock, the air strikes started.  It had 
  6   no effect on the population.  It had no effect on the mission of the 
  7   Battalion because everybody knows that the air strikes or close air 
  8   support was too late and too little.  It had an effect on the way 
  9   General Mladic reacted.
 10   Q.  Before I get to that point, let me just clarify one point with you, 
 11   Colonel Karremans, was it your understanding when you were the 
 12   Commanding Officer of the Dutch BAT unit in Srebrenica that air 
 13   support was supposed to be a significant part of the protection 
 14   measures available to you and to the population of Srebrenica; is that 
 15   correct?
 16   A.   That is correct, it was.
 17   Q.  OK.  You mentioned that there were air strikes and that they were too 
 18   little, too late, is that your testimony?
 19   A.   Yes.
 20   Q.  What effect did those air strikes have on General Mladic?
 21   A.   The effect was that through the hijacked soldiers, about 30 in 
 22   Bratunac, on one of the BSA kasserns over there, Mladic or one of his 
 23   officers used the communications equipment of the vehicles over there, 
 24   and ordered me to stop immediately using air support; and if that was 
 25   not the case, if I was not able to stop that  immediately, he should 

  1   use all this weaponry -- that is what he told -- to shell the compound 
  2   of Potocari, to shell the refugees within and around the compound and 
  3   kill the 30 hijacked soldiers.
  4   Q.  Did General Mladic have the ability to deliver on those threats?
  5   A.   He could, he had the ability, because he had guarded a lot of 
  6   weaponry around the compound on top of the hills like mortars, two 
  7   main bell tanks, artillery and, what I explained already yesterday, 
  8   the multiple launch rocket system from different types, all in direct 
  9   side or direct direction of the compound and he could use that.
 10   Q.  In fact, he had already used that on the UN compound in Srebrenica?
 11   A.   Yes, he did.
 12   Q.  I would like to turn to another topic now, Colonel Karremans, and that 
 13   is meetings you had with General Mladic.  Can you explain the 
 14   circumstances of your first meeting with General Mladic and explain 
 15   when it occurred and where it occurred?
 16   A.   Yes, sir.  The first meeting I had with General Mladic was on Tuesday 
 17   night at half past 8.  I was notified by my OPs room, they got a 
 18   message, again through the same communication systems, that I had to 
 19   show up in Bratunac for a meeting.  I did not know what kind of 
 20   meeting that should be, but I expected with somebody from the BSA, 
 21   maybe Colonel Vukovic or Nikolic, or whatsoever.
 22   		I was not before in Bratunac, but my LO liaison officers had a 
 23   couple of times been there talking about  trade, about military 
 24   options with the BSA, so they came with me, two liaison officers.  We 
 25   went to the hotel in Bratunac and there was a crowd of military 

  1   persons all in combat wear, gear, and clothes.  There I met for the 
  2   first time General Mladic.  I did not know that he was there.  I have 
  3   not met him before, not in life, and there was also General 
  4   Zivanovic, the Corps Commander of the Drina Corps.  We were all 
  5   standing there at half past 8.
  6   		There were a lot of press around, television, and General 
  7   Mladic started accusing me of all things what happened in the last six 
  8   days, that I was responsible for the air strikes or the air support, 
  9   killed some of his people, soldiers, that my soldiers had tried to 
 10   kill him because of shooting at him, that we were not able to disarm 
 11   the BiH forces within the enclave and so forth and so forth.
 12   Q.  While he was addressing you was he speaking calmly?
 13   A.   No, he was shouting more or less.
 14   Q.  Then what happened?
 15   A.   Then we got our famous glass in our hands, water.
 16   Q.  Would you describe how that occurred?
 17   A.   Yes, we just got a glass of something in our hand and did not toast 
 18   with that, but the circumstances were, if you can imagine, bad at that 
 19   time because we too did not sleep for five nights and had not had 
 20   hardly no food, no water, lived in shelters and bunkers.  So we were 
 21   all, let us say, not well for the meeting like that.
 22   Q.  Was there a camera crew present at the meeting?
 23   A.   There was a camera crew present and they put everything on tape. 
 24   Q.  After the glass was put in your hand, were pictures taken of you and 
 25   other Dutch officers?

  1   A.   Yes.
  2   Q.  How long did that meeting last, Colonel Karremans?
  3   A.   Not too long.  I think three three-quarters of an hour.  I was able 
  4   to explain the poor situation of the refugees which I did.  I asked 
  5   him for supply of food, water, medicines, and then he said to me, "You 
  6   will have to, you should return for a second meeting at half past 11 
  7   just before midnight", I should take with me a representative of the 
  8   refugees, if it was possible, one of the civil authorities of the 
  9   opstina.  That was it.
 10   Q.  What did you then do?
 11   A.   Then we went back to -- we left the hotel in Bratunac and drove back 
 12   to the compound.  The first thing I did there, I had a quick talk with 
 13   my Deputy Battalion Commander and were desperately looking for a 
 14   representative of the refugees.  One of my officers knew and he saw 
 15   him, that the head or the director of the secondary school of 
 16   Srebrenica was amongst the refugees within the compound of Potocari.  
 17   We found him and we explained the situation, that I have had a meeting 
 18   with General Mladic and that he ordered, more or less, me to bring 
 19   with me for a second meeting one of the representatives, a 
 20   representative of the refugees, and asked him if he was willing to go 
 21   with me to that meeting, and he was.
 22   Q.  Did you then return to Bratunac that evening?
 23   A.   I returned to Bratunac that evening just before midnight, with my 
 24   same two liaison officers and with  Mr. Mandzic.  Mr. Malic was the 
 25   representative.

  1   Q.  Who were the representatives of the Bosnian Serb Army at that meeting?
  2   A.   The second meeting?
  3   Q.  Yes.
  4   A.   More or less the same which I met in the first meeting, General 
  5   Mladic, General Zivanovic, there was an interpreter, which I referred 
  6   already to yesterday, Mr. Petr, a couple of BSA officers and one or 
  7   two civilians who I did not know.
  8   Q.  At that second meeting did you request permission for convoys to pass 
  9   through and ask permission for some form of relief for the refugees 
 10   who were in and around your compound?
 11   A.   Yes, I did.
 12   Q.  Would you please describe that second meeting?
 13   A.   The second meeting was a little bit more friendlier than the first 
 14   one, I must say, and I was able to explain again the very bad 
 15   circumstances and the situation in and around the compound concerning 
 16   the refugees.  Again I asked for support on medicines, water supplies, 
 17   food. The wounded, I had about 100 wounded persons in the field 
 18   dressing station, all in shelters.  He made note of my requests 
 19   without saying if he could do something about it.
 20   		Then he started with his demands in, let us say, a kind of 
 21   monologue.  He asked me and also the representative of the refugees, 
 22   Mr. Mandzic, that all Bosnian soldiers should lay down their weapons 
 23   and deliver those weapons in the hands of the BSA.  He said  that he 
 24   had a clear attitude towards the BiH soldiers, survive or disappear.
 25   		He asked me and the representative to come back the next 

  1   morning at 10.00 to have a third meeting.  He promised that there 
  2   will be a cease-fire which I had asked for until 10 o'clock the next 
  3   morning, Wednesday, and if there will not be any support of the BiH 
  4   in delivering their weapons, action should be taken by him by again 
  5   shelling what he stated before of the compound and the refugees.
  6   		He told something about Mr. Izetbegovic, the President of the 
  7   Muslim people in Sarajevo, that he killed more Serb people during the 
  8   last years than the Bosnian Serb Army did.  He stated that he was not 
  9   willing to use power against women and children.
 10   		He asked me if Naser Oric -- Naser Oric was, let us say, the 
 11   commanding officer of BiH forces -- if he could show up, I mean, if I 
 12   could take him with him for the next meeting.  I explained to him 
 13   that we have not seen Naser Oric since April.  He has not been back 
 14   in the enclave since April.
 15   		He stated that he was prepared to take over the about 100 or 
 16   110 wounded persons, and he guaranteed that if he had taken over or 
 17   should have taken over the wounded, he guaranteed that they would 
 18   have the same treatment as what is normal for treating the wounded, 
 19   according to the Conventions of Geneva, Geneva Conventions.  Again he 
 20   stated or said or demanded that we should come back the next morning 
 21   with a delegation of the people, a delegation of the refugees, and if 
 22   it was  possible, the civilian and military authorities from the 
 23   enclave.
 24   		Again he stated that handing over the weapons by BiH soldiers 
 25   would mean survival of them; "If they should keep their weapons", he 

  1   said, "that will be their death".  He stated that if BiH soldiers 
  2   should hand over their weapons, that they will be treated according to 
  3   the Geneva Conventions, and he stated at the end that the destiny of 
  4   the Muslim people was in his hands.
  5   Q.  Did he also make any statement with regard to whether NATO or the UN 
  6   were capable of guaranteeing the existence of the safe area?
  7   A.   Yes, he quoted some words on that subject, but that he already did in 
  8   the first meeting.  I would like to say a meeting, between brackets, 
  9   he stated that UN forces in general were not able to fulfil, let us 
 10   say, the arrangements made by the cease-fire agreement and the UN 
 11   resolutions as of 1993.  I refer to the demilitarisation of the 
 12   enclave.  He said that in the first meeting and also in the second 
 13   meeting that "Your United Nations forces were not able to fulfil their 
 14   mission".
 15   Q.  After that second meeting did you return to the UN compound in 
 16   Potocari?
 17   A.   Yes, sir.  We did return in the middle of the night  -- I think that 
 18   meeting lasted one-and-a-half hours in total -- went back to the 
 19   compound of Potocari.  I had a telephone call with sector north-east; 
 20   told him what happened that day, what happened during those two 
 21   meetings, what was the demanded by General Mladic.  Then we started 
 22   looking for more representatives to have them  prepared for the 
 23   meeting on the next morning.
 24   		I had a long talk again with my deputy, with some officers of 
 25   the Battalion staff, how to find those specific persons and at the end 

  1   we found them, we found a woman and one other person.  So I had next 
  2   morning three persons for the committee of refugees.
  3   Q.  So the next morning there was a third meeting, is that correct, 
  4   Colonel Karremans?
  5   A.   Yes.
  6   Q.  Where did that take place?
  7   A.   The third meeting took place again in Bratunac, the same hotel.
  8   Q.  Approximately, what time did that meeting take place?
  9   A.   10.30.
 10   Q.  Can you describe the circumstances of that meeting?
 11   A.   Yes.  It was more or less as the second one.  The same persons, at 
 12   least most of them, which I met in the second meeting and there were 
 13   some civilians as well attended that meeting.  I did not know them.  
 14   They were introduced, but I cannot remember which jobs they had. They 
 15   were all from Bratunac and Zvornik.  He started welcoming myself and 
 16   the liaison officers and also the committee of three persons.
 17   Q.  When you say "he" are you referring to General Mladic?
 18   A.   General Mladic, yes.  Then the two other, let us say, the new 
 19   representatives were able to introduce themselves shortly, started 
 20   with the woman.  She made some statements, very clear statements, 
 21   towards General Mladic about the very poor, bad, miserable 
 22   circumstances of all  the refugees; that refugees were not responsible 
 23   for what happened in the enclave during the last two or three years 
 24   and that women and children were not responsible for those things 
 25   which have happened.  She was the representative of all women and 

  1   children.  They were all civilians and no military and no politicians.
  2   		Also, the men introduced themselves and he asked for help and 
  3   he said and stated, not blaming the refugees, and that they need a 
  4   lot of things which I have already stated, had already stated before, 
  5   like medicines, food, water and other supplies.  He said that neither 
  6   he nor my Battalion staff or myself were able to make contact with 
  7   the Bosnian government during that night to ask for specific points 
  8   for that third meeting, which meant that he was not able to lean on 
  9   mandates or on other things to explain to General Mladic.
 10   		After those statements of the two other representatives and 
 11   Mr. Mandzic was already invited to tell something about himself during 
 12   the second meeting, the day before, General Mladic started his 
 13   monologue.
 14   Q.  Will you describe that monologue, please?
 15   A.   It was a very long monologue.  He started with a piece of history.  
 16   In 1992, that the Bosnian Army, the Bosnian soldiers -- and he blamed 
 17   Oric specially for that  -- that they killed a lot of Bosnian-Serb 
 18   families, soldiers, civilians, that they attacked a lot of villages in 
 19   the surroundings of the city of Srebrenica, devastated a lot of 
 20   villages and that, according to that and what happened in 1993, as 
 21   soon as those safe havens or safe areas had been established, that the 
 22   destiny of poor  people was in the hands of the Bosnian Serbs.  That 
 23   was one of his other statements, he said it was too late for help, 
 24   help either by the Bosnian government or by the UN troops.
 25   		He said that there was a lot of misery in the last years, that 

  1   the BiH forces within the enclave had murdered a lot around the 
  2   enclave by raids looking for food, revenge, looking for revenge, 
  3   terror.
  4   		He stated that he was willing to assist refugees, those 25,000 
  5   refugees, but that he needed assistance, assistance by the local 
  6   civilian and military authorities, from which I already explained 
  7   that they were not available at the moment, not within that group of 
  8   25,000 refugees.
  9   		He again said regarding the BiH forces, the same expression as 
 10   the day before, "survive or disappear".  He again requested to the 
 11   BiH forces to hand over their weapons, even criminals amongst them 
 12   could hand over their weapons.
 13   		The second subject he stated was that the guarded population 
 14   in and around the compound had the choice either to stay in 
 15   Srebrenica or to be evacuated, to be evacuated to Serbia, to the 
 16   Bosnian territory around Tuzla, or even to foreign countries.  He 
 17   said that the whole former, at that moment, former safe area had been 
 18   encircled by his forces and that fightings should stop. We could hear 
 19   that during the night before and the day that there were still fights 
 20   and attacks going on.
 21   		He stated that he was not able to assist the refugees as long 
 22   as fights were going on.  He stated that  BiH forces could hand over 
 23   their weapons in the presence of UN forces, UNPROFOR, he stated in 
 24   general.  I think he meant Dutch BAT.
 25   		He stated that he was willing to assist with the evacuation.  

  1   That was the first time in the third meeting that he used the word 
  2   "evacuation".  Then he stated that there used to be a good life in 
  3   and around Srebrenica and in and around the vicinity of Srebrenica, 
  4   and that he liked to have the same situation, that good life before 
  5   1992, that he would like to have that situation back.
  6   		He said that, looking back or referring to that lecture in 
  7   history, he did not like to kill what happened in 1992 and 1993.  He, 
  8   as a professional soldier, had no joy in killing either civilians or 
  9   military.  Again, he offered his help and the committee of refugees 
 10   should think that over, think about how they could assist in the 
 11   evacuation.
 12   		He asked for our basic needs, I mean, what did we use, what 
 13   did the refugees use, concerning food, water, medicines, medical 
 14   support and so forth.  He asked again how many refugees there were and 
 15   we answered again 25,000, around 25,000.  The committee stated that 
 16   most of the refugees liked to go to their family and be guarded 
 17   together with their husbands, and he stated that nobody should be 
 18   forced to be evacuated.  On the other hand, he said that if NATO air 
 19   strikes or air support should be the case in other areas in Bosnia, 
 20   that he should use his weaponry again and taking sanctions.
 21   Q.  Can you explain what he meant by that?
 22   A.   The same what he said or stated in the first meeting  and before the 
 23   first meeting, that if air strikes should occur again, that he should 
 24   shell, let us say, the compound and the refugees in and around the 
 25   compound.

  1   		He said he would like to see all the men between 17 and 60.  I 
  2   asked him, and also both the men in the delegation, "What for?"  His 
  3   answer was that he would like to see all those persons because he 
  4   said, he stated, there were a lot of war criminals amongst them and 
  5   he would like to speak with them.
  6   		Again, he asked if we were able to come in contact with 
  7   soldiers whom Mladic knew.  He was referring, of course, to Naser 
  8   Oric, which I explained him before that he was not available, and 
  9   some other persons, let us say, the commanding officers of the BiH 
 10   within the enclave. Again I told him that there were no BiH soldiers 
 11   available at the moment.  So, there was no possibility to look for 
 12   him because we were guarded together with all the refugees in a very, 
 13   very small area.  I mean, the compound and the two or three factories 
 14   just in the vicinity of it and we lost our eyes and ears in the rest 
 15   of the enclave.  So we were not able to pick up those military 
 16   representatives.
 17   		Then he stated in his monologue that the BiH soldiers had only 
 18   24 hours to hand over all the weapons. After that statement, he asked 
 19   some very specific conditions of the refugees.  He stated that if he 
 20   was able to assist, he preferred in a kind of priority to look for 
 21   the weak persons first, for the wounded persons, and later on the 
 22   rest of the refugees, women and children.  He said that nobody should 
 23   be hurt and that  co-ordination and co-operation with UNPROFOR, Dutch 
 24   BAT in particular, was one of his priorities.
 25   		What I just stated, that he mentioned "evacuation" during his 

  1   monologue for the first time, he asked for diesel for the evacuation. 
  2    You can imagine that I started laughing a little bit because he was 
  3   exactly aware of what I had for diesel; there was none, nothing, nil, 
  4   and that I was not able to support him by giving him diesel.  He said 
  5   that his forces, BSA forces, will give escort during the evacuation.  
  6   I said, "No, if there should be an evacuation anyway that my own 
  7   Battalion should escort the evacuation".  Then I explained to him in 
  8   which way I should execute that.
  9   Q.  What was your proposal to General Mladic?
 10   A.   My proposal was to put on every vehicle one soldier, not knowing how 
 11   many vehicles that was.  As soon as the evacuation started the same 
 12   day, at 3 o'clock -- I think we come to that?
 13   Q.  We will come to that a little later in your testimony.
 14   A.   Yes, I was unable to do that.  I was unable to put on each vehicle 
 15   one soldier.  Then he said that, and it was quite a remarkable 
 16   expression, that Allah will not help, was not able to help, and Mladic 
 17   could.  He gave his word.  He said to the commission not to be in 
 18   panic, not to be afraid, and asked them to send that message to the 
 19   refugees.
 20   		I have asked again when that was possible, what happened or 
 21   what should happen with the men between 17 and 60.  He again said or 
 22   stated that there were quite  some war criminals amongst them, and 
 23   that he liked to investigate person by person what they have done and 
 24   what kind of persons those were.
 25   		At the end of that meeting, all of a sudden, he started 

  1   something to tell about the evacuation again, and he proposed, let us 
  2   say it in that way, he proposed, that Kladanj should be the point for 
  3   evacuation.  Kladanj is a small village just on the border between 
  4   Bosnian-Serb territory and the Bosnian territory around Tuzla.  In 
  5   fact, Kladanj is the first Muslim city in that area.
  6   		Repeated, he repeated that within 24 hours all soldiers of the 
  7   BiH, even in uniform or not in uniform, even war criminals amongst 
  8   the BiH forces, could hand over and should hand over the weapons.  He 
  9   said, "It is better to live than to die".
 10   		Then he referred to something what I said again, what I have 
 11   said already yesterday or explained yesterday, that he knew 
 12   everything what was going on in the enclave, what happened in the 
 13   enclave day by day, and that he had persons in the enclave who 
 14   informed, who informed them every day.  So he was well aware of what 
 15   was going on.
 16   		Then he showed to us at the end of the meeting a book, there 
 17   was a book of the opstina, a book in which marriages were assigned by 
 18   people, marriage, and that the last marriage was on 29th June.  He 
 19   had as a piece of remembrance, I presume, a thing from, let us say, 
 20   the entry of the opstina.
 21   		He ended with something to say to the woman of the committee, 
 22   that she was a fine woman, that she was open,  or had been open, in 
 23   the way of statements towards Mladic, and he did not say anything to 
 24   both male representatives.  Last but not least, he asked us, urged us, 
 25   finding contact with the BiH forces and to convince them to hand over 

  1   their weapons within 24 hours.  That was, I think, the whole meeting.
  2   Q.  What time did the meeting end, Colonel Karremans?
  3   A.   I think about noonish, about 12 o'clock, because at 12.30 I had a 
  4   meeting in the compound with the committee.
  5   Q.  What time did the first transports arrive to take the refugees away 
  6   from the compound?
  7   A.   He said during the third meeting, I forgot that to say, that the 
  8   evacuation should start about 1.00, but it was not well organised in 
  9   the beginning, or efficiently organised, so the evacuation started at 
 10   3 o'clock.
 11   Q.  So three hours from the conclusion of your meeting with General Mladic 
 12   transport arrived inside in and around Potocari to start take refugees 
 13   away?
 14   A.   That is correct.
 15   Q.  What type of transport arrived?
 16   A.   A lot of buses, I think 20 or 30, vans, big lorries and small 
 17   military vehicles.  I think the first evacuation was about between 40 
 18   and 50 vehicles and that was also, let us say, one of my decision 
 19   points to change from one soldier at every vehicle to what we have 
 20   done later on, put two vehicles with officers to escort the 
 21   evacuations.
 22   Q.  So, as a result of the number of vehicles, you realised that you did 
 23   not have enough troops to put on one soldier per vehicle to accompany 
 24   the convoy; is that  correct?
 25   A.   That is correct, sir.

  1   Q.  So did you formulate another solution?
  2   A.   We formulated, indeed, another solution.
  3   Q.  Describe that solution, please.
  4   A.   That solution was that we should escort each convoy by two vehicles, 
  5   two jeeps, seater jeeps; in every jeep one officer or non-commissioned 
  6   officer and a driver with communications up to Kladanj and then they 
  7   should return and pick up, let us say, the next evacuation.
  8   Q.  What happened to those escort vehicles?
  9   A.   In the first escort or in the first evacuation, I put my personnel 
 10   officer, a captain, and one of the liaison officers.  They managed to 
 11   go with all the persons in that convoy to cross the border in the area 
 12   of Kladanj. The vehicles left in the convoy returning to Srebrenica 
 13   which disappeared and that happened with the other vehicles during the 
 14   next evacuations too, and totally or in total 14.  They were just 
 15   picked up en route either by BSA forces or irregular forces.
 16   Q.  So I understand clearly, the first escort vehicle made it to Kladanj, 
 17   is that correct, or made it to a point shortly -----
 18   A.   Six kilometres ---
 19   Q.  From Kladanj?
 20   A.   -- from Kladanj because there was a barricade, a barricade, between 
 21   the two borders and that meant that all refugees and later on also 
 22   wounded persons were forced to walk, struggle, I might say, the last 
 23   six kilometres to the border of Kladanj. 
 24   Q.  Did any other of your escort vehicles make it to Kladanj?
 25   A.   Some of them in the beginning ---

  1   Q.  OK.
  2   A.   -- but they did not return.
  3   Q.  OK.  So, what happened to those vehicles?
  4   A.   They were hijacked, stolen.
  5   Q.  What happened to the equipment that was used by the soldiers who 
  6   participated in those escorts?
  7   A.   The same, weaponry, their personal weapons were stolen, helmet, flack 
  8   jackets, private belongings were stolen.
  9   Q.  What was the consequence of losing those vehicles in relation to the 
 10   convoys that left your compound?
 11   A.   The consequences were, I think, three-fold.  In the first place, 
 12   again we changed the way of escorting those convoys by putting en 
 13   route, and the route was about 50 kilometres, four different points, 
 14   let us say, contact points, so that the vehicles standing there on 
 15   fixed points could see convoys passing, counting the amount of 
 16   vehicles.
 17   		What we did in the beginning as soon as a convoy left, let us 
 18   say, the road in front of the compound, we counted the amount of 
 19   vehicles and gave that to the first fixed post, so they could have a 
 20   look and to control if the same amount of vehicles were still in that 
 21   convoy.
 22   		The second thing we did is that I ordered troops just outside 
 23   the compound to work either in groups armed with their helmet and 
 24   flack jackets or if they work individually, like the soldiers, the 
 25   doctors, etc., that  they should work just in a t-shirt without 

  1   helmet, without flack jacket and without weapon.
  2   Q.  Why did you do that?
  3   A.   Because in the beginning, especially for individuals working between 
  4   the refugees, they have been stolen from the BSA soldiers around, 
  5   there were not so many.  They stole the helmet, personal weapons and 
  6   flack jackets, just by pointing a weapon on the head of the soldiers 
  7   and said, "I would like to have it, give it to me".  They did not do 
  8   that when groups were working outside, then they did not do it.
  9   Q.  Did you again see General Mladic on 12th July?
 10   A.   That was on Wednesday, yes.  On the moment that the first convoy 
 11   arrived, let us say, the empty vehicles, and turned around in front of 
 12   the compound, and the first refugees were escorted to all those buses, 
 13   vans and military vehicles.  General Mladic appeared with his own 
 14   vehicle and all his officers around him and some bodyguards, of 
 15   course, and the press was there available too.  They made all nice 
 16   pictures of him and what was going on over there -- a lot of 
 17   publicity.
 18   Q.  Did you have any conversations with General Mladic on this fourth 
 19   meeting with him?
 20   A.   I had a short conversation with him about the evacuation, about what 
 21   he stated in the morning, that first priority should be the wounded 
 22   persons which he had stated, "Yes, that is correct, we should do 
 23   something about it.  Bring them over to the hospital in Bratunac". 
 24   Then I said, "No, we do not do that, they stay here at the compound in 
 25   our own hands or they should be sent or  brought to NORMEDBAT Corps", 

  1   that is the Norwegian medical Company in Tuzla, "escorted by either 
  2   the Norwegian company or by the International Red Cross".
  3   Q.  What was his reaction?
  4   A.   None.
  5   Q.  Please continue your description of the fourth meeting with General 
  6   Mladic?
  7   A.   He was so busy during his stay there with the press and impressing 
  8   his soldiers and the officers around him and talking to some refugees 
  9   that I had hardly no chance to talk with him longer than, I think, 
 10   those five minutes and that was it.
 11   Q.  When was your next contact with General Mladic?
 12   A.   The next contact was the next morning, on Thursday, Thursday morning.
 13   Q.  Where did that take place?
 14   A.   Again in front of the compound just on the opposite of the gate, main 
 15   gate -- again a short meeting.  There was no press available or 
 16   present, I must say.  He had only a Colonel Jankovic with him and 
 17   Major Nikolic, both officers of the BSA and, of course, his 
 18   interpreter, Petr, and some bodyguards.
 19   		He offered me, that was on that Thursday morning, offered me 
 20   that we could go or leave the compound with vehicles after or during 
 21   the evacuation of all the refugees.
 22   Q.  In other words, that the Dutch Battalion could evacuate?
 23   A.   Itself.
 24   Q.  Is that correct? 
 25   A.   Yes, that is correct.

  1   Q.  What was your response?
  2   A.   I told them that I did not like the idea of leaving the compound 
  3   because of a couple of subjects.  One of the subjects was that I still 
  4   had some military on OP Alpha, one of the observation posts was still 
  5   occupied.  The officers and the soldiers from the day before escorting 
  6   the convoys were still underway, I missed them.
  7   Q.  In other words, they were still missing?
  8   A.   They were still missing.  I was faced at that moment with 55 wounded 
  9   civilians within the compound, and I referred to the talk we had 
 10   before, that I like to bring them over either by NORMEDBAT Corps or by 
 11   the International Red Cross; that I had my Bosnian local workers on 
 12   the compound, I mean, interpreters from the Battalion, interpreters 
 13   from the United Nations military observers which I had on the 
 14   compound, that I had all the people of the MSF, Medicine sans 
 15   Frontieres, with me on the compound and that if we leave, we leave 
 16   altogether but after some arrangements concerning the wounded persons 
 17   had been made.  That was my answer.  He agreed with that and that is 
 18   why I stayed in the compound.
 19   Q.  Were there any other significant matters discussed at that meeting or 
 20   did that conclude the meeting?
 21   A.   That concluded the meeting.
 22   Q.  By the end of 13th July, had all the refugees been deported from the 
 23   Potocari compound area?
 24   A.   Yes, sir.  I will look at my notebook.  At 1600 on Thursday, the last 
 25   refugee was gone outside the compound, and then one started with the 

  1   evacuation of the 4,000 to  5,000 refugees which were able to stay 
  2   within the compound.  It started at 1600 and it finished about 7 
  3   o'clock.  That was in three hours.
  4   Q.  At the end of that, at 7 o'clock, then there were no further refugees 
  5   in and Potocari; is that correct?
  6   A.   No, there were no further refugees in and around Srebrenica -- I mean 
  7   the compound at Potocari.
  8   Q.  When was the next time you saw General Mladic?
  9   A.   The next time when I saw General Mladic was on the day of our 
 10   departure, on 21st July.  It was on the Friday morning.  We had eight 
 11   days to prepare our own, let us say, departure, to rest.  On Friday, 
 12   the day after the evacuation, all of a sudden a convoy with food, a 
 13   lot of food, a lot of diesel was accepted and came to the Potocari 
 14   area.  So, then we had, from that day we had food enough, diesel 
 15   enough, medicines, and we had eight days to recover from what happened 
 16   in the weeks before. I saw General Mladic on the Friday and he invited 
 17   me through his, I think it was, Colonel Jankovic that came to the 
 18   compound that morning on Friday morning or Petr, the interpreter.  He 
 19   said that I was invited with my liaison officers to that same hotel in 
 20   Bratunac where I had my three meetings.
 21   Q.  What happened?
 22   A.   We drove to that hotel -- it was one vehicle -- with my liaison 
 23   officers.  There was General Mladic with a crowd of officers, most of 
 24   them I knew already from the meetings.  My own -- that is not the 
 25   right expression. The Chief of Staff of BiH command, General Nikolaj, 

  1   was there, a Dutch General, and his military assistant.  They  offered 
  2   us a breakfast and we had some talks over a couple of things, about 
  3   the weaponry.  I asked him again what happened with my weaponry and 
  4   that I would like to have it back.
  5   		I knew already that we should leave at noon towards the 
  6   Serbian territory and then the way up to Zagreb. Again I asked, 
  7   "Where are all my vehicles?  I would like to have them back with me". 
  8    Then he said after some general things, but I have forgotten those, 
  9   that he would like to visit the compound, look to our own convoys, 
 10   how we did that, the vehicles.  He asked me to have a talk with the 
 11   soldiers and that that should occur at 11 o'clock, whether that was 
 12   possible in the time frame. It was not possible.
 13   		So I told General Mladic that it was not such a good idea 
 14   talking to soldiers, not such a good idea visiting the compound, but 
 15   he insisted in visiting the compound.  He said, "OK, I will not be 
 16   there at 11 o'clock.  I will be there escorted by the Chief of Staff 
 17   of BH command at 11.30".
 18   		I left the hotel.  We went back to the compound of Potocari.  
 19   I had a quick talk with my deputy, seeing everything was arranged for 
 20   our own travel with everything which has been left.  That was the 
 21   case, and I asked my deputy, "Are we able to start at noon?"  He 
 22   said, yes, he could.  I told him that General Mladic would come.  He 
 23   said, "OK".
 24   		We went back to the gate and he was already there before half 
 25   past 11.  He was held up by the commander of the guard, a very broad 

  1   Sergeant.  He could not go around  that Sergeant.  He was held up.  
  2   General Mladic had a quick talk with him and then it was half past 
  3   11.
  4   		I took him with me to my own briefing room within the 
  5   compound, had a quick talk -- I think 20 minutes -- about some general 
  6   things and then I asked him two specific questions.  One question was, 
  7   "What will happen with my equipment?"  I told him what equipment I 
  8   lost during the last two weeks.  All my field vehicles, the amoured 
  9   personnel carriers, a lot of personal arms, machine guns, the 
 10   equipment of most of the observation posts.  That was the first 
 11   question.
 12   Q.  What was his response?
 13   A.   His response was that he should sort that out.  He was in contact 
 14   with his Ministry of Internal Affairs and they should do that in close 
 15   combination or co-ordination, let us say, with BH command.  He 
 16   referred to the presence of the Chief of Staff of BH command.
 17   		My second question, which I can remember asking him, was, just 
 18   a general one, I asked him what should happen or should have happened 
 19   if during the stay of United Nations troops in the safe areas of 
 20   Gorazde, Zepa and especially, of course, Srebrenica, what will happen 
 21   if BH soldiers were disarmed totally, completely demilitarised, if 
 22   they should not have executed raids outside the compound -- outside 
 23   the enclave, if both civilian and military authorities should live 
 24   according to the 1993 regulations, arrangements, and cease-fire 
 25   regulations.  Then he answered that he, at least that was his answer, 

  1   he would not have thought about attacking the enclave. 
  2   		He said it with a smile, more or less, and that was also more 
  3   or less the end of our discussion there in the briefing room.  Then we 
  4   went outside to the entry of the compound, gate, main gate of the 
  5   compound.  The guards were changed.  My guards went back to their 
  6   company. Everybody in their vehicles and exactly at noon we started 
  7   leaving the compound.
  8   Q.  Colonel Karremans, thank you very much.  I have no further questions. 
  9    Your Honours, I have concluded my examination of Colonel Karremans.
 10   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Harmon. Let me look at 
 11   fellow Judges.  Judge Odio Benito, I do believe you have some 
 12   questions.  Please proceed.
 13   		   Examined by the Court
 14   JUDGE ODIO BENITO:  Colonel Karremans, after leaving Srebrenica and 
 15   Potocari, where did the refugees go in these convoys, buses and trucks 
 16   you have explained?
 17   A.   Your Honour, all refugees which I explained left the safe area of 
 18   Srebrenica within an amazing short time -- that was Wednesday 
 19   afternoon and Thursday, the whole day  -- and they have been evacuated 
 20   to the Kladanj area, the one, the first, let us say, Muslim city in 
 21   the Tuzla area.
 22   Q.  To the confrontation line?
 23   A.   To the confrontation line, exactly.
 24   Q.  Do you know what happened to them during the travel?
 25   A.   No, because they stayed in vehicles.  That was one of the things I 

  1   would like to do in the beginning, to put a soldier per vehicle, to 
  2   have a look what was going on in buses or trucks.  They did not inform 
  3   me what was going  on in buses because we did not have any use for 
  4   that. The only thing we could do, and that was the second option, just 
  5   escorting those big group of vehicles, convoys, by two cars in the 
  6   beginning.
  7   Q.  But your vehicles and cars were stolen by the Bosnian-Serb Army?
  8   A.   Yes, your Honour.
  9   Q.  What did your soldiers do after that?
 10   A.   Do you mean the soldiers?
 11   Q.  Yes, because you had soldiers in those vehicles and they lost the 
 12   vehicles, the helmet, everything, but what did they do?
 13   A.   They were guarded together during that night, the night of Wednesday 
 14   and Thursday, by the Bosnian Serb Army, or the irregular part of it, I 
 15   do not know exactly.  They were guarded together, I think 12, in 
 16   total, or 14 officers and soldiers.  They stayed over night two times. 
 17    Some were along that route, the route from Bratunac to Kladanj.  They 
 18   were fed by the Bosnian-Serb Army.  They could shelter, for their own 
 19   protection, they said.  On Friday they returned through Bratunac to my 
 20   compound.
 21   Q.  Did you or any of your soldiers see Bosnian Serb soldiers beating, 
 22   killing, raping he refugees in or around Potocari in those factories 
 23   you mentioned?
 24   A.   Yes, your Honour, they did.  In some cases, refugees had been beaten 
 25   and as soon as one of my soldiers noticed that, they stopped with it. 

  1    I got two reports from my soldiers on Thursday after I met General 
  2   Mladic; one report referring to an execution of one man and a second  
  3   report about an execution of nine men from which they found the 
  4   bodies.
  5   MR. HARMON:  Your Honour, we will be presenting evidence in regard to both 
  6   of those incidents described by Colonel Karremans.
  7   JUDGE ODIO BENITO:  Thank you.  (To the witness):  Did you ever ask 
  8   General Mladic during your meetings what happened to the people, 
  9   refugees?
 10   A.   No, because the last meeting I had with him was on 21st.  That was 
 11   eight days later on.  We were not aware of what happened with the 
 12   refugees.  I mean, in general, I know -- I knew that they were all 
 13   evacuated to Kladanj area and afterwards picked up by the Pakistani 
 14   Battalion and by the International Red Cross, by the Norwegian medical 
 15   Company.  They build tents, shelters, supply points for the refugees. 
 16    A part of them has been transported to the air base of Tuzla and 
 17   other parts of the amount of refugees were transported to other 
 18   facilities.  That is the only thing I knew, and I did not discuss that 
 19   with General Mladic at all.
 20   Q.  Would you say, Colonel, that you received adequate support you asked 
 21   for from your superiors?  During those difficult days before the fall 
 22   of Srebrenica, you told us that you asked for support.
 23   A.   Yes.
 24   Q.  Did you receive that support?
 25   A.   Your Honour, I can expand on that days and days, of course.  That is 

  1   why I was lucky that I could explain yesterday and in the beginning of 
  2   the morning what happened with the inhabitants in the enclave, the  
  3   refugees and with my soldiers.
  4   		We had our daily SITREPs, our daily situation reports, in 
  5   which we wrote everything what happened that day, what we need for 
  6   supplies.  Besides that, I reported at different times, several times, 
  7   I must say, on the level of north-east command in Tuzla and the BH 
  8   command in Sarajevo, what I needed to fulfil my mission.  I was 
  9   specific in that, exactly what we needed, medicines and food, diesel, 
 10   etc.  I asked for support many, many times during our stay over there. 
 11    I know that there have been many discussions on all levels, above the 
 12   level of the Battalion, sitting there with the population isolated in 
 13   an enclave like Srebrenica, but we did not get any support at all.
 14   Q.  I am going to ask you a last question and ask for your personal 
 15   opinion, Colonel.  Looking back, would you say that the United Nations 
 16   and NATO did its best to help people to save their lives?
 17   A.   On the one hand, yes, if we should have had our freedom of movement 
 18   which was one of the points of the NATO, United Nations resolutions of 
 19   1993, and we could travel forth and back to the safe areas, in 
 20   general, and to Srebrenica, in particular, for my Battalion but also 
 21   for the International Red Cross, the other non-governmental 
 22   organisations like the MSF, the UNHCR, and we were able to assist, 
 23   help, the refugees, I think the answer is yes; but because of the 
 24   strangulation and because of the isolation and not having had support 
 25   at all, then the answer is no.

  1   Q.  Strangulation and isolation ordered by General  Mladic?
  2   A.   Yes, your Honour.
  3   JUDGE ODIO BENITO:  Thank you, Colonel.  No further questions.
  4   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you.  I now ask my other fellow Judge if he 
  5   has any questions?
  6   JUDGE RIAD:  Colonel Karremans, throughout these, perhaps, five meetings 
  7   you had with General Mladic, did he ever take into consideration your 
  8   demands or was it always, as you said, a monologue and he did not 
  9   respond to any of your objections or claims?
 10   A.   I have had, let us say, three major meetings with him but meetings 
 11   between brackets because, in my opinion, a meeting is two directions. 
 12    A monologue is not a meeting.  Indeed, those were monologues.  In the 
 13   second meeting, I was able to explain the bad situation and he made 
 14   even notes of that and that was it.
 15   		In the third meeting, on Wednesday morning, the woman and the 
 16   other men of the committee could make their statements.  They made 
 17   note of it and that was it.  So, the conclusion, only monologues, no 
 18   two-way negotiations.  He did listen to my requests, if I may say so, 
 19   but did not support them at all.  He had his own line in negotiating 
 20   or in telling what he would like to tell, and what he would like to 
 21   do.
 22   Q.  Did you express any disapproval of his method of separating men, as 
 23   you said, between 16 and I think 60 or 65 from women and children?  
 24   Did you object to that?
 25   A.   Yes, I did, your Honour.  I objected to that already in the meeting 

  1   when he said that, by asking, "What is the  meaning of that?"  His 
  2   explanation was what I stated before, he would like to have the men 
  3   between 16 and 60 to look if there were war criminals amongst them.  
  4   Maybe he thought that all the Bosnian soldiers were war criminals.  He 
  5   did not explain what he would like to do with them except that he 
  6   wants to speak with them all.
  7   Q.  Did he ask you for information about these people, to give him any 
  8   kind of indication where they are and who they are?
  9   A.   No, your Honour, he did not.
 10   Q.  He did not?
 11   A.   No, I did not.
 12   Q.  So there was absolutely no way of knowing about them through your 
 13   Battalion?
 14   A.   No, your Honour.
 15   Q.  In your last meeting with him, you said it was on Friday morning, by 
 16   that time it seems that you had already known about the executions you 
 17   mentioned.  Were you aware of everything that was happening and the 
 18   way the refugees fleeing away were treated?
 19   A.   No, I think not at all.  The information in those days confirmed the 
 20   information about, let us say, the military side of what was going on 
 21   in the Battalion, resupplying, what has had to be done before our own 
 22   evacuation, if I may say so, and last things, what happened during our 
 23   week that we stayed there and negotiations between some of the 
 24   officers of my Battalion staff and some of the BSA soldiers on wounded 
 25   persons -- I had still one of the Colonel surgeons in Bratunac in the 

  1   hospital, to look what was going on with the wounded  persons over 
  2   there.  We had discussions about the diesel because on that Friday 
  3   after the evacuations I got a lot of diesel; what we should do with 
  4   medicines and food. They were more or less the subjects we discussed 
  5   in a couple of, let us say, small meetings, not with General Mladic 
  6   (because I have not seen him after the evacuation), but with his 
  7   officers.  I think that was it.
  8   Q.  But did you include any mention, not to say protest, against the 
  9   executions or the things you heard about in this last meeting you had 
 10   with him, and what was his response if you did?
 11   A.   I have not protested in the last meeting because I even did not 
 12   expect that meeting.  I was not aware of that, because we became a 
 13   message through our communication systems, the OPs room, that had to 
 14   show up, let us put it that way, again in the Bratunac Hotel; and 
 15   sitting with his whole crowd over there we had, he was again a little 
 16   bit monologue-ing, and asked me how the Battalion was and how we were 
 17   doing and if we were prepared to move and ready to go.  There was 
 18   hardly no opportunity to evaluate, let us put it in that way, what 
 19   happened in all the weeks and days before.  To be frank, I have not 
 20   thought about the idea of asking him what happened with the refugees.
 21   Q.  According to you, he was present all the time and he was aware of all 
 22   that was happening?
 23   A.   He was present during the six days there of the attack and invasion 
 24   of the enclave -- at least I presume.  He was present during the 
 25   evacuation.  He has been there two times, which I explained, and if he 

  1   was  not there, he was in the hotel in Bratunac which he used as 
  2   command post and the kassern in Bratunac which he used as command post 
  3   for, let us say, the other things he had to do concerning Gorazde, 
  4   Zepa, and I do not know what.
  5   		After my last meeting with him, a short meeting on that 
  6   Thursday morning, I have not seen him before, or if I have not seen 
  7   him afterwards, except that I got some orders from the higher echelon 
  8   about our own travel to either the Kladanj/Tuzla area or to Zagreb.  
  9   That was still a point of discussion on the higher echelons.  One 
 10   asked me if could, let us say, come in contact with General Mladic, 
 11   to discuss that, because nobody had contact with him since the 
 12   evacuation, nobody from the higher commands.
 13   		So I got, let us say, some notes by fax, made a small letter 
 14   about it and sent that to his interpreter, Petr, who lived in 
 15   Bratunac with the request to hand it over to General Mladic and ask 
 16   for a response.  I got a response, I think, on Friday, the same 
 17   Friday, when the first convoys with food and diesel came in.  That 
 18   was the only contact on paper I had with him.
 19   		In his reply or in his answer he said, "Yes, I will take your 
 20   requests concerning your leave whenever that should occur and your 
 21   requests on the lost equipment", he said "lost equipment", not "stolen 
 22   equipment", he will take that into consideration, and asked me to have 
 23   patience.  He should have a meeting with General Smith on Sunday and I 
 24   think that occurred on the 19th, and in that meeting he should discuss 
 25   the leave of Dutch BAT, and then he should come back, let us say, to 

  1   make all the  arrangements for our leave.
  2   Q.  You speak of evacuation and you mentioned that several times he asked 
  3   you to assist in this evacuation; that means really the deportation of 
  4   the people of Srebrenica to the Bosniak site.  This deportation, 
  5   although you did not assist, was very highly organised. You said that 
  6   buses came and everything was very minutely organised.  So, this was 
  7   the headquarters of Mladic who did it?
  8   A.   Yes, your Honour.  It was -- I think he ordered that himself and what 
  9   I stated before during many briefings and also hoping that everything 
 10   was prepared, preplanned in advance.  Also, the massive crowd of buses 
 11   and vehicles, and I always use an example in northern western 
 12   countries, if you like to have 30 or 40 buses, then you have a 
 13   challenge, but in a country like former Yugoslavia or 
 14   Bosnia-Herzegovina, to gather there 30 or 40 buses you are not able to 
 15   do that in one day.  That must be preplanned a long time before.  So, 
 16   he had a plan and he executed that plan more or less minute by minute 
 17   or day by day.  He ordered for the evacuation.  He asked for 
 18   assistance of the Battalion but not more than -- you will hear that 
 19   from the next, I think, witnesses -- assist the people to go to the 
 20   buses, prevail or prevent, I must say, panic, chaos and supplying the 
 21   refugees as much as I could with water, food and medicines -- at least 
 22   what I have left over.  That is the only assistance I could give.
 23   Q.  You mentioned that 55 soldiers were taken into custody by the Serbs, I 
 24   think it was on 6th July.  How  were they treated and how long did 
 25   they stay?

  1   A.   Your Honour, that was not on 6th July.  On 6th July, on the Thursday, 
  2   let us say, the invasion started, the attacks, or, yes, the attacks 
  3   started, and the fights between both parties.  In the southern part of 
  4   the enclave also by shelling compounds and the city of Srebrenica 
  5   itself.  It ended up on Saturday, two and a half days later, on the 
  6   retreat of OP Fox Trot when one of my soldiers died.
  7   		After that, let us say, Saturday afternoon and Sunday and 
  8   Monday, he picked or he attacked a lot of observation posts by using 
  9   force, weapons and soldiers, encircled them and circled them and take 
 10   the soldiers hostage and took them with them.  He guarded at the end 
 11   55 of my soldiers at two points, one in Bratunac, in the northern part 
 12   of, I say north of the enclave, and one in Simici, south of the 
 13   enclave.  At the end, after the evacuation, they were guarded 
 14   together, all 55.  I had a talk with them, not with all 55, but with 
 15   the 30 persons staying in Bratunac.  I asked in the first meeting I 
 16   had with General Mladic if I was able or allowed to speak with them.  
 17   "Yes", he said, "you are able to do that, you are allowed to do that". 
 18    I had a small talk with the soldiers, asked them if they were treated 
 19   well.  They said "yes", they were treated reasonably well.  That same 
 20   applied which I heard later on already being back in Netherlands to 
 21   the other 25 soldiers from Simici.
 22   Q.  You mentioned several times that you raised the matter to the higher 
 23   echelons, your higher echelons.  Was there a prompt response or did 
 24   they leave you just to  your fate?
 25   A.   Looking to the circumstances in that time and knowing that both 

  1   commanding officers of the north east command and BH command were not 
  2   available, so I had to do with both Chief of Staffs, my direct 
  3   superior was, of course, the Commanding Officer of north east command 
  4   in Tuzla. What I did is, on every time when I think it was necessary 
  5   in shelters and in my own offices or in the communication centre of 
  6   the Battalion staff, I had direct communications with either north 
  7   east command or BH command.
  8   		We did report, we did make our reports verbally, at least I 
  9   did it -- it was one of my responsibilities -- to the higher echelons 
 10   and we did it every day at 6 o'clock by the daily situation reports 
 11   on paper, by fax.
 12   		The conclusion, my direct superior in Tuzla, but also the 
 13   command in Sarajevo, were well aware of what was going on and what 
 14   happened minute by minute in the enclave, every day of our stay over 
 15   there.  Again, asking support, logistical support, in the weeks before 
 16   or even which I have stated before, close air support, no.  The 
 17   support was worse.
 18   Q.  I would like to ask you also, in one of the meetings and you mentioned 
 19   Major Nikolic, he stated that all Muslims should leave Bosnia?
 20   A.   Yes, your Honour.
 21   Q.  That was at an official meeting?
 22   A.   That was -- no.  We had a sequence of meetings with both parties, not 
 23   together.  We tried to have them together around the negotiation 
 24   table; my predecessor  did, he was not able to that, one or two times. 
 25    We were not because of the quarrels, because of the fights, over and 

  1   over.  So we had every week a fixed meeting with the civil 
  2   authorities, with the military authorities, within the enclave and 
  3   also with, let us say, the Commanding Officer of the Chief of Staff of 
  4   the BiH forces.
  5   		We should have a meeting, a fixed meeting, every weeks with 
  6   the BSA outside, either on OP Echo or on OP Papa, but that was not 
  7   the case.  Meetings with the BSA was always when we liked to have 
  8   that or when they liked to have it, very irregularly, and it was one 
  9   of those irregular meetings that I was involved somewhere in the 
 10   middle of February, if I can remember, that I met Major Nikolic and 
 11   it was at that meeting that he stated what I said yesterday, about 
 12   Muslims killed half Assembly during Second World War etc. and that he 
 13   hated Muslims and, in his opinion, the Muslims should leave the 
 14   complete territory of Bosnia.
 15   JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much, Colonel.
 16   THE WITNESS:  You are welcome.
 17   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  I have some very short questions I would like to put 
 18   to you:  the troops you talked about, where did they come from?  What 
 19   was their composition? You talked about the fresh troops that arrived?
 20   A.   Yes, your Honour.  We were -- no.  Around the safe area of Srebrenica 
 21   there were three brigades, the so-called Skalani Brigade in the south, 
 22   the Bratunac Brigade in the north and a third Brigade in the west. 
 23   Those Brigades belonged to the regular army of the BSA, the regular 
 24   Drina Corps, but those three Brigades  consisted of elderly soldiers, 
 25   soldiers from that area, an area where they belonged.  As soon as on 

  1   6th July the invasion started or, let us say, the attack on the 
  2   enclave started which, General Mladic stated later on, he used three 
  3   new Brigades, one in the south and one in the east and he had one in 
  4   reserve in the north.
  5   		That means that he did not use the regular forces around the 
  6   safe area of Srebrenica.  He especially used other forces which we 
  7   have noticed two days before 6th July.  In Bratunac, there were a lot 
  8   of battle noise and there was a lot of noise about moving tanks, 
  9   artillery, military vehicles -- all those moves which we have reported 
 10   on a regular basis and in our daily SITREPs.
 11   Q.  Thank you.  Do you think there were any militia, fresh people, fresh 
 12   militia, in these forces?
 13   A.   Yes.  Your Honour, what I have heard, just I have heard, I have not 
 14   noticed that myself, that the so-called Arkan Brigade was involved as 
 15   well.  That was a Brigade with, let us say, special forces from the 
 16   BSA but, personally, I have not seen them during those six days and 
 17   during, let us say, the evacuation of refugees.  That could be 
 18   possible.
 19   Q.  The evacuation with the Dutch Battalion, was it possible in the plan 
 20   with your superior, was the Dutch Battalion asked to provide that 
 21   assistance?
 22   A.   Do you mean the assistance, your Honour, for the evacuation of the 
 23   refugees?
 24   Q.  I am talking about the evacuation.  You have talked about a meeting 
 25   with General Mladic, I think it was the second or third, I cannot 

  1   remember, where all of a sudden  he said that had you to proceed with 
  2   the evacuation. That seems it was not tackled during your first or 
  3   second meeting in Bratunac.  So, I had the impression that you were 
  4   not surprised; you knew that there might be an evacuation or did you 
  5   decide, as the superior, that the evacuation would take place?
  6   A.   During the first two meetings, I did not have a clue what was going 
  7   on about the destiny of the refugees. Knowing that we had about 25,000 
  8   refugees in and around the compound, one of my major points was to ask 
  9   support as much as I could get from the BSA, what I stated before, 
 10   food, water, medicines, a good arrangement for my wounded, for the 
 11   wounded refugees, about 100 or 110. That is what I have asked for 
 12   during the meetings, the first meetings, with General Mladic.
 13   		In his third meeting, he started to talk about evacuation, and 
 14   that was a surprise for me as well.  We arranged a committee of the 
 15   refugees to co-operate with them about what should be done or what 
 16   should we do on the circumstances under which those refugees were 
 17   there in and around our compound, what could we do as much as 
 18   possible and we needed a committee for that, to talk about it.  I 
 19   used that committee -- I mean in a nice sense of using it -- I asked 
 20   them if they could assist me as much as possible, at least to respond 
 21   on the questions and they, that committee, went with me to the third 
 22   meeting.  That was the meeting in which General Mladic stated or told 
 23   about the evacuation.
 24   		I was as much surprised as everybody was because the meeting 
 25   was at the end of the Wednesday morning and  at 3 o'clock Wednesday 

  1   afternoon the evacuation started already.  So I was confronted with 
  2   something new, an evacuation of 25,000 persons.  Then you have to 
  3   think quickly -----
  4   Q.  Sorry, sorry.  I heard what you said, but what I am trying to find 
  5   out, faced with that surprise, you were surprised, you said, the 
  6   refugee committee is surprised; did you have adequate time to ask your 
  7   hierarchical structure whether you could proceed in such a way or did 
  8   you have sufficient freedom to decide?
  9   A.   I had no time to -- I had time to inform my higher echelons which I 
 10   have done, which I did.  I asked several times for what could I do, 
 11   how could you assist me, what should I do?  No answer on that.  There 
 12   was no policy in that either.  So I could, let us say, do what was the 
 13   best thing to do at the moment and knowing what time was left between 
 14   that third meeting, and 1 o'clock was mentioned by Mladic that the 
 15   evacuation should start, that we were complete surprised, everybody, 
 16   that such a thing could happen and that he already had organised such 
 17   an evacuation.
 18   		I was not able to do anything about it, and that was why we 
 19   decided -- I decided in the beginning -- to put on every bus or 
 20   whatsoever a soldier.  That was the least thing I could do, and assist 
 21   the refugees as much as possible going to buses by giving them food, 
 22   water and medical care and look for them during the evacuation.
 23   Q.  Thank.  My final question:  if you talk about the list, we talked 
 24   yesterday to the investigator from the Prosecutor.  It seems that 
 25   there was a list of men in an  age range which I did not quite 

  1   understand.  Can you very quickly tell us what happened with this list 
  2   of men, what was their age and what happened?
  3   A.   We had, as you know, your Honour, 25,000 persons in and around the 
  4   enclave, almost all women, children and elderly people.  We estimated 
  5   about two to three per cent men, men between 16 and 60, more or less, 
  6   and we did not know how many men there were -- in general, we knew -- 
  7   how many men there were outside the compound.  We have asked through 
  8   the interpreters and through the committee if it was possible to note 
  9   or, yes, set on a piece of paper all the names of those persons, male 
 10   persons, between 16 and 60 within the compound.
 11   		There was no time left to do that for all the other persons.  
 12   There is one person who has asked me in the past, "Why have you not 
 13   put the names of all the refugees on a piece of paper?"  You can 
 14   imagine, your Honours, that that is not possible.  What we have done 
 15   is we have put the names of men within the compound on a list, and 
 16   what I can remember, 239.  There were about 70 which did not like that 
 17   and they have not done that.  We have done that on purpose because we 
 18   like to know what could have happened with those persons.  What 
 19   happened with the list, the lists have been faxed to Tuzla and to 
 20   Zagreb.
 21   Q.  Fine.  Colonel, the Tribunal would like to thank you for your 
 22   testimony.  Last question?
 23   JUDGE RIAD:  Colonel, did by any chance General Mladic's office get hold 
 24   of this list?
 25   A.   I am not sure about the answer I should give now, because there are 

  1   two possible answers, and maybe one of the witnesses after me could 
  2   answer that question.  There are two possible answers.  One said or 
  3   has stated that one of my officers offered or handed over that list to 
  4   one of the BSA officers at the gate.  Some others said, no, that was 
  5   not the case.  I am still at this moment not aware of what was going 
  6   on with the list towards the BSA.  I do not know.  I cannot answer the 
  7   question, do or does the BSA, or did the BSA receive that list of 
  8   persons?  I do not know.
  9   Q.  Did you ask the officer?
 10   A.   No.
 11   JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
 12   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Prosecutor, based on the numerous questions we put 
 13   and once again thank you, Colonel Karremans, to have spent so much 
 14   time with us.  But do you have any wish to add any supplementary 
 15   questions or not?
 16   MR. HARMON:  I do not, your Honour.
 17   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Fine.  Colonel, in this Mladic/Karadzic case, we 
 18   have finished with your testimony and we will now finish until 2.30.
 19   (12.10 p.m.)
 20   		          (Luncheon Adjournment)
 21   (2.30 p.m.)

 12   		  Examined by MR. OSTBERG
 13   Q.  Lieutenant Koster, would you please state your full name and spell it 
 14   for the record?
 15   A.   My last name is Koster, I spell K-O-S-T-E-R.
 16   Q.  Thank you.  What is your present occupation?
 17   A.   I am a logistic officer and an infantry soldier.
 18   Q.  In the Dutch Army?
 19   A.   In the Dutch Army, that is correct.
 20   Q.  Have you been serving with the United Nations?
 21   A.   Yes, I did.
 22   Q.  Would you please tell the court where and when?
 23   A.   I served in Srebrenica and that was January 1995 till July '95.
 24   Q.  When did you start, you say?
 25   A.   In January.

  1   Q.  In January.  Was Colonel Karremans your Commanding Officer?
  2   A.   Yes, he was.
  3   Q.  What was your position with the Dutch Battalion?
  4   A.   My position was to be the Logistics Officer of the  Battalion.
  5   Q.  Just give us the outline of your duties in that position?
  6   A.   Well, I had to manage all logistic affairs, although we had few means 
  7   and, well, that meant very strict planning and distributing our 
  8   logistic affairs.
  9   Q.  Where in the chain of command were you placed in that position?
 10   A.   I was a staff officer and my direct Commander, my Logistic Commander 
 11   was Major Franken.
 12   Q.  Thank you.  Were you on duty in the beginning of July 1995?
 13   A.   Yes, I was.
 14   Q.  Where?
 15   A.   I was on duty in Potocari, inside the compound.
 16   Q.  Inside the compound, so your working place was inside the compound 
 17   mostly?
 18   A.   Most of the time, yes.
 19   Q.  OK.  You were there even on 11th July 1995?
 20   A.   Yes, I was also outside the compound then, yes.
 21   Q.  Will you tell us about what happened after the fall of Srebrenica when 
 22   refugees started to arrive in Potocari?
 23   A.   Yes, it was on 12th, sorry, it was on 11th July, we were ordered to 
 24   go outside and to form a unit to receive the refugees, so we went 
 25   outside and made a hole in the fence from where we could guide the 

  1   refugees towards the compound.
  2   		When we were posted outside, approximately at 1500 hours the 
  3   refugees arrived in a few and small groups at  first and, well, most 
  4   of them were women and children and older women and older men.  They 
  5   were terrified, they were afraid, looking for help, and when we were 
  6   there, well, we could not tell them what to do at that point.
  7   Q.  You said that you formed a unit to take care of the incoming refugees. 
  8    How big was that unit?
  9   A.   Well, approximately 30 men at first.
 10   Q.  Were you in command of these 30 men?
 11   A.   Yes, I was.
 12   Q.  You said you opened a hole in the fence?
 13   A.   Yes.
 14   Q.  Is that the way you led them into the compound?
 15   A.   Yes, we were not allowed to let them in by the main gate.
 16   Q.  Why?
 17   A.   Because of the road which led from Srebrenica to Potocari was 
 18   constantly on the direct sight, in direct fire from the Serbs.  For 
 19   example, when the days before, when we left the compound by vehicle, 
 20   we were fired upon with mortar fire and that kind of thing.  So, it 
 21   was better for the people to take another route and another way to the 
 22   compound which was more covered by trees and buildings.
 23   Q.  They opened that hole in the fence?
 24   A.   Yes.
 25   Q.  When people started to arrive, the first ones who arrived, did you 

  1   show them all in into the compound?
  2   A.   No, we were not allowed at first.  We first showed them the way to 
  3   the large buildings of a former bus station where bus repair and bus 
  4   maintenance was done,  and we told them to take cover inside of these 
  5   buildings.
  6   Q.  When you are saying that you were not allowed, allowed by whom?
  7   A.   By my Commander.
  8   Q.  Commander?
  9   A.   Yes.
 10   Q.  What was the kind of shelter you gave them?
 11   A.   Sorry?
 12   Q.  What kind of shelter did you give them?
 13   A.   The big buildings of the former bus station.
 14   Q.  Outside the compound?
 15   A.   It was outside the compound, yes.
 16   Q.  Then when did they start entering the compound?
 17   A.   Well, that was later on that day when the total amount of people was 
 18   going to be a big crowd, we were ordered to let the people through the 
 19   compound in small groups of 25 persons, and send them through the hole 
 20   in the fence to the compound.
 21   Q.  How did these people arrive?
 22   A.   Well, like I said before, at first in small groups, later on there 
 23   was one big mass of people coming down the road from Srebrenica to 
 24   Potocari and, well, they came with a big noise, women crying, children 
 25   screaming, children also crying.  Well, people were in terror.  They 

  1   came down the road towards our position.
  2   Q.  On foot?
  3   A.   On foot, yes.  When we could receive them, we just only could tell 
  4   them to wait and to stay at our position.  We could not tell them what 
  5   to do and they were keeping asking these questions from, you know, 
  6   "What  are we going to do?" or "What are the plans for now?" They were 
  7   very much afraid of what was going on with them, what was going to 
  8   happen with them, but we could not tell them, so .....  They were 
  9   -----
 10   Q.  Had they walked the way from the city of Srebrenica?
 11   A.   Most of them.  There were several vehicles from the compound in 
 12   Srebrenica to the compound in Potocari carrying some wounded, but when 
 13   they started to move, not wounded people picked their places and also 
 14   in every spot of the vehicle where they could hang on, they got a 
 15   place.
 16   Q.  When you are talking about these vehicles, were they the UN vehicles?
 17   A.   Yes, they were our UN vehicles, yes, trucks.
 18   Q.  No other means of transportation like buses or trucks for these 
 19   fleeing people?
 20   A.   Well, some APCs for medical aid.  Those APCs were also carrying some 
 21   kind of wounded people and some healthy people towards our position 
 22   and moving people toward the compound, yes.
 23   Q.  They started coming in small groups and then they grew more and more?
 24   A.   Yes.
 25   Q.  Can you make estimations, looking at what time they started and then 

  1   how they slowly encompassed a big crowd of people?
  2   A.   Yes, well, I was ordered to make a rough counting of the people 
  3   constantly.  Well, it started by with 10 people, then hundreds of 
  4   people and then even more thousands of people.  Well, it started 
  5   approximately,  they started coming around about 1500 hours and, well, 
  6   until late in the evening it stopped.  So, for example, the road had a 
  7   diameter of six metres and was fully crowded with people, most of them 
  8   women, children and older men.
  9   Q.  When you said you started to count them, did you do that yourself?
 10   A.   Yes, and later on that day I compared with my colleagues to make a 
 11   rough counting of the total number of people and we came to a number 
 12   of approximately 15,000 people.
 13   Q.  15,000 people?
 14   A.   15,000 people, yes.
 15   Q.  How many of them were led into or brought into the compound?
 16   A.   Well, on top of the 15,000 there were 4,000 to 5,000 people let into 
 17   the compound.  So, at the end of the day, there were 15,000 outside 
 18   the compound and 4,00 to 5,000 people inside the compound.
 19   Q.  We are talking now about 11th July?
 20   A.   Yes.
 21   Q.  Did they stop coming in the evening?
 22   A.   Yes, they stopped and there were -- the crowds stopped.  There were a 
 23   few people coming down the road still, but the big mass, the big mass 
 24   of people, the big crowd, stopped coming towards our position, yes, 
 25   and it was fully filled with people.

  1   Q.  What did 30 soldiers do to care for these people?
  2   A.   Well, during the day I ordered for some reinforcements because we 
  3   could not stand any longer to  hold the people.  We had some 
  4   interpreters to make it clear for them what to do and, well, what we 
  5   were doing down there was the best we could; give them some medical 
  6   help, telling them that we would guide them and escort them and guard 
  7   them and protect them for the best we could.  Well, whether it was 
  8   help, any help needed, we were there.
  9   Q.  That with 30 persons?
 10   A.   Well, I ordered some reinforcements, so later on that day I guess it 
 11   would be 50 to 60 men outside.
 12   Q.  What kind of medical support could you give them?
 13   A.   Mainly first aid.
 14   Q.  Like bandages and things like that?
 15   A.   If we had some, yes, some bandages.  There were several wounded men 
 16   and women, also women giving birth to children at our place.  We also 
 17   had some assistance from MSF.
 18   Q.  MSF is?
 19   A.   Medicine sans Frontieres.  So, the wounded we could give them only 
 20   the first aid because we did not have more means outside, also inside 
 21   the compound.
 22   Q.  What about giving them food and drink then?
 23   A.   Well, outside it was impossible for us to do because we had so scarce 
 24   means of food rations and all that, so we could not give them any food 
 25   outside the compound. From what I have learned later on is that we 

  1   made a soup of food rations mixed, mingled with water for the people 
  2   inside the compound.  Outside the compound, some people were carrying 
  3   jerry cans and bottles of water, carrying water with them.  Nearby our 
  4   position, there was a small  well where people could get some water, 
  5   so that was -- it was needed because it was tremendously hot that day, 
  6   so water was a very needed factor over there.
  7   Q.  So the people inside could get some soup to eat or drink, but outside 
  8   could you give them anything at all, apart from the water from the 
  9   well?
 10   A.   Yes, that is correct.
 11   Q.  Could you paint the picture of what it looked like when night fall 
 12   came?  What did it look like in and around the compound then?
 13   A.   Well, it was like being on a scene.  It was a little bit 
 14   surrealistic.  Being outside, these people, I slept outside, also my 
 15   men slept outside.  We did some patrolling that night.  We had some 
 16   posts to protect them.  Well, the big noise stopped, all the 
 17   screaming, etc. and all the shouting and crying stopped during the 
 18   night, although little children kept crying on and the noise 
 19   decreased, so ... but it was very surrealistic being there.
 20   Q.  Were there any attacks from the Bosnian Serb Army or any soldiers or 
 21   units attacking this amount of people?
 22   A.   Well, not in person but we were fired upon with mortar fire during 
 23   the day.  Well, the shelling was not among the people, well, it was 
 24   very close, close firing, approximately 50 metres from our position, 
 25   among the houses nearby our position the explosions of the grenades 

  1   and the mortar grenades came down, yes.
  2   Q.  But these crowds of people were not shelled or fired at directly?
  3   A.   Not directly, no.  No. 
  4   Q.  Then you said you had some 30 people and some reinforcements; what 
  5   about the rest of the personnel of the Dutch Battalion?  Where were 
  6   they deployed during this time?  What I want to know is how many 
  7   persons, how many soldiers, of the Battalion in total were present in 
  8   Potocari when this flood of refugees arrived?
  9   A.   Well, it should be approximately 200 men, I guess.
 10   Q.  200 men?
 11   A.   Yes, I guess.
 12   Q.  Where were the rest of the Battalion deployed?
 13   A.   They were assigned to the OPs.
 14   Q.  These are?
 15   A.   Observation posts.
 16   Q.  Observation posts?
 17   A.   Yes.  Also, part of them were located in the compound of Srebrenica, 
 18   but most of these men and women were supply forces, so they were not 
 19   fighter men, they were not infantrymen.
 20   Q.  But the ones you are talking about in Potocari were fighting men, 
 21   infantry soldiers?
 22   A.   A few of them, yes, but most of them were supply forces.
 23   Q.  Most of them were supply forces.  Were any of your personnel taken 
 24   hostage or assaulted during this day, the 11th?
 25   A.   No, not on 11th.

  1   Q.  OK.  Could any of you have any rest the night between 11th and 12th 
  2   July last year?
  3   A.   Well, for me personally, no.  For the most of them, I guess not 
  4   because you were busy helping people, doing  some patrolling outside 
  5   the compound among the people. Well, maybe you could get an hour or 
  6   two sleep, but, well, it was not such a rest.  You could not rest very 
  7   well.
  8   Q.  Will you then turn your attention to the following day and give us an 
  9   account of what happened on 12th July 1995?
 10   A.   Well, in the morning it was relatively quietly.  The people, well, 
 11   they woke up and started asking questions about what was going on, and 
 12   what we were planning to do and what the Serbs were planning to do, so 
 13   we could not tell.
 14   		We carried on giving them medical aid; still wounded people 
 15   came down to our position, asking for a doctor, asking for medical 
 16   help; still women were looking for their children like the day before 
 17   because they lost their children in the big crowd of people; also 
 18   children looking for their families and that kind of things.  That 
 19   carried on all morning and also the sun also appeared again, so it 
 20   became tremendously hot again that day. Later on that day, 
 21   approximately at 1300 hours ---
 22   Q.  At what time?
 23   A.   -- 1300 hours, yes, we heard a noise of tanks and APCs, and I heard 
 24   by radio that there was a tank and an APC coming down the road toward 
 25   the compound.  So the people, well, there was panic and the people 

  1   were scared and they ran down to the south of our location, and so we 
  2   had to wait what was going on then and wait for the Serbs to make a 
  3   move.
  4   Q.  OK. 
  5   A.   When they did they came to our position and also to the compound.
  6   Q.  You are talking about the army, the Bosnian Serb Army?
  7   A.   That is correct, yes.  They came to our position and we made a 
  8   demarcation line of some red and white tape over the road and, well, 
  9   they stayed behind the tape. Some of them asked for the commanding 
 10   officer at my location, so that was me, and he introduced himself and 
 11   so did I.  I cannot remember his name.
 12   		I asked him what he was planning to do and he did not tell me. 
 13    Well, after that he turned his back on me and went down to his 
 14   forces.  At that time there were, well, approximately 20 to 30 Serbian 
 15   soldiers at our position at the road.  Well, their action was just 
 16   walking around looking at the people, also shouting at the people, 
 17   asking questions.  I had an interpreter next to me so he could 
 18   translate what they were saying.
 19   Q.  Could you give us an example of what they said to the people?
 20   A.   Well, most of the times they were mocking at them, and doing that it 
 21   was a very odd situation because they sat down on the ground and 
 22   started to begin singing, and they also -- they actually did not make 
 23   a move.  They were just staying over there at their location behind 
 24   the red and white tape probably, I do not know what to do. So we just 
 25   could stay there and wait what they were going to do.

  1   Q.  Then what happened?
  2   A.   Later on that day, Major Nikolic came down also to my  position and 
  3   he introduced himself.
  4   Q.  Did you know him beforehand?
  5   A.   Yes, I recognised him from photos in the Operations room.  Well, he 
  6   wanted to have a look among the people and he wanted to walk through 
  7   to the other end of our location.  At that time it was reported from 
  8   my southern post, which was the last units of the Bravo Company, that 
  9   also at their location some Serbian soldiers arrived.
 10   		Well, we escorted the Major Nikolic with our liaison officer 
 11   and an observer and he walked down through the people.  After that, he 
 12   returned and also the situation stayed the same for a couple of hours 
 13   probably.  Then one of the commanders came to my position and told me 
 14   that he would bring a vehicle loaded with bread for the people, and 
 15   that we should make way for this vehicle and it really appeared and 
 16   then they started to give bread to the people.  They also had a camera 
 17   team accompanying them and the camera team, well, they were filming 
 18   while they were giving bread to the people.
 19   Q.  How many people did get some bread?  Did they have something for 
 20   everybody?
 21   A.   No, not at all.  There was a very small truck and, well, they were 
 22   throwing the bread and giving the bread to the people.  My interpreter 
 23   told me while they were doing that they were shouting at the people 
 24   again and mocking of them and calling them names.
 25   		Well, the vehicle returned for one more time also loaded with 

  1   bread, and also a fire truck came down to our position to give the 
  2   people some water and, well, one by one women were allowed to leave 
  3   the crowd and to fill up  their bottles with water.  Everything was 
  4   filmed by the Serbs.  Then the fire truck disappeared again.
  5   		Later on that day, should be approximately at 1600 hours, more 
  6   troops came down to our position, more vehicles, more jeeps, more 
  7   civilian vehicles.  At one time my interpreter told me that he thought 
  8   he had seen General Mladic, and General Mladic came to my position. He 
  9   introduced himself and so did I.  He asked me who was the commander in 
 10   charge.  I asked him what he was planning to do.  Well, at first, he 
 11   did not tell me nothing and he walked right through our line of tape 
 12   and towards the people.  At that time, of course, I reported to my 
 13   commanding officer and I was told that I should send Mladic to the 
 14   compound, to Colonel Karremans, so he could talk to him, but he would 
 15   not do so.
 16   Q.  He would not?
 17   A.   No.
 18   Q.  Who would not, Mladic?
 19   A.   General Mladic, no.
 20   Q.  So you asked him to go and talk to the commanding officer?
 21   A.   Yes, several times.
 22   Q.  He said no?
 23   A.   He said, "No, I am doing what I please to do and I am in charge here 
 24   and nobody tells me what to do, and I am outside here, and you will 
 25   see what is going to happen". He told us to co-operate or else there 

  1   would be -- we were, you know, told to co-operate with him; we would 
  2   be best off by co-operating.
  3   Q.  You said "or else", did he -----
  4    A.  No, we would be best off by co-operating.  Those were the words said.
  5   Q.  Yes.  Go on with the story, please.
  6   A.   Then he went to the people and he spoke to the people not to be 
  7   afraid; he should, he would take care of them. He was talking to 
  8   little children accompanied by a filming team, a camera team.  I was 
  9   constantly protesting that he should go to the compound.  While doing 
 10   that, some buses arrived and I reported that.  Then I asked him again 
 11   what he was going to do and he was irritated, and he told me that he 
 12   would evacuate the people to another place.  At once some of the 
 13   Serbian soldiers pulled down several of my men.
 14   Q.  What did they do?
 15   A.   They pulled down and pulled away several of my men who were holding 
 16   the civilians and, well, the Serbs told the civilians to go to the 
 17   buses, to get inside the buses.  Well, at that time the situation was 
 18   taken out of our hands and we could only escort the people and provide 
 19   any harm of the people and they were fully in charge at that time.
 20   Q.  How many Bosnian Serb troops were present then, in your estimation?
 21   A.   Well, I estimated approximately 40, 50 men and, well, they were still 
 22   coming up, more men, men with dogs, all that kind of thing.
 23   Q.  You were outnumbered?
 24   A.   Yes, we were severely outnumbered, yes, that is true.
 25   Q.  OK, please go on.

  1   A.   Then I was told to escort the people and to provide  any harming of 
  2   the people, and we could not do anything else than just escorting 
  3   them, and the Serbs took over and they pushed the people to go to the 
  4   buses and they kept on doing that till the buses were fully stuffed 
  5   with people.  They were putting far more people inside the bus than 
  6   normally is usual.  The buses drove away.  Then we had to stop the 
  7   people again and we had to wait till other transport arrived at our 
  8   location.
  9   Q.  Did you in any way convoy or send somebody with the buses when they 
 10   went away?
 11   A.   Yes.
 12   Q.  Tell us about that.
 13   A.   I learned later that we escorted the buses and the trucks by sending 
 14   some of our men with a jeep driving in front with the buses.  But, 
 15   well, the first transport, well, they succeeded escorting them and the 
 16   other transports, well, the jeeps were taken away from us and so we 
 17   could not escort them any more.
 18   Q.  By the Serbian soldiers?
 19   A.   Yes.
 20   Q.  Bosnian Serb soldiers, yes.  Was any separation of sexes taking place 
 21   before they were loaded on buses?
 22   A.   Yes, well, they were looking for men, older men, well, men of 
 23   fighting age, potential fighting men.  They were separating them from 
 24   their families and from the rest of the people.  Well, they kept on 
 25   doing that the whole time.

  1   Q.  What happened to these men who were separated from their families?  
  2   Where did they go?
  3   A.   They put them inside of a house and, from what I have  seen, they 
  4   were just sitting there and waiting.  Their personal belongings were 
  5   taken away and put outside of the house and I only saw these men 
  6   waiting.  As far as we could, we were protesting against it, but we 
  7   were, as you said before, outnumbered so we could not be at all 
  8   places.
  9   Q.  Of course.  What about General Mladic, was he present when these 
 10   things went on?
 11   A.   Well, I lost sight of him.  When the first buses started to drive 
 12   away, I lost sight of him.
 13   Q.  This transportation of people started, as I remember as you said, 
 14   about 1600?
 15   A.   That was the time when General Mladic arrived ---
 16   Q.  When he arrived.
 17   A.   -- and, well, it should not be more than half hour or an hour later 
 18   when the buses arrived and drove away.
 19   Q.  How many bus loads of people left Potocari this day, 12th?
 20   A.   I did not count them at all, but, well, they started  -- sorry, they 
 21   ended up when night fell.
 22   Q.  With night fall they stopped?
 23   A.   Yes.
 24   Q.  Do you have any idea how many bus loads that was?  Do you have any 
 25   idea how many people left on the first day?

  1   A.   No.
  2   Q.  Half, a third, no idea?
  3   A.   No, I have no estimation.
  4   Q.  You can make no estimation.  They stopped at night fall, you said?
  5   A.   Yes. 
  6   Q.  Still then people were inside and outside the compound?
  7   A.   Yes, that is correct.
  8   Q.  Was anybody taken out of the compound on this first day and put on the 
  9   buses or was that people from outside?
 10   A.   From what I know, there were people from outside the compound because 
 11   I was there.  I do not know if people from inside the compound were 
 12   taken outside because I could not see it from my position.
 13   Q.  You could not see it?
 14   A.   I do not know that.
 15   Q.  OK.  Then night came; can you tell us something about what happened 
 16   during the night?
 17   A.   Yes.  We were told by the Serbs that we had to clear the road and to 
 18   join the people on the terrain in front of the former bus station.
 19   Q.  Clear the road from the refugees?
 20   A.   Yes.  The road should stay open because they told us there could be 
 21   some transport moving to Srebrenica and from Srebrenica to Potocari.  
 22   Well, we collected the people at that point and we stayed there 
 23   patrolling during the night and the Serbs, they left.  Some of them 
 24   came back during the night and they were taking our arms, and also our 
 25   vests and helmets and equipment.

  1   Q.  Could you describe in what way they did that?
  2   A.   Well, they joined, they formed groups of three or four men and then 
  3   they walked up to a UN soldier and told him to give away his weapon 
  4   and his bulletproof vest and his helmet and his equipment and when he 
  5   refused that, he was forced to do so. 
  6   Q.  At gun point?
  7   A.   I personally at gun point, yes.
  8   Q.  How many of your soldiers did lose their equipment in this way?
  9   A.   I do not know.  Many of them.
 10   Q.  Many out of these 30, 40 soldiers?
 11   A.   Yes, that is correct.
 12   Q.  The majority?
 13   A.   The majority, yes.
 14   Q.  That went on during the night?
 15   A.   Yes, in the beginning of the night.  Later on that night they 
 16   disappeared and I did not know where they went.  We were alone with 
 17   these people and then they were very, very quiet.  Well, we kept on 
 18   patrolling during the night and, well, helping some sick people and 
 19   also again wounded people who still asked for doctors, for medical 
 20   help, and we had a doctor outside our position -- well, till the 
 21   morning came.
 22   Q.  OK.  Then we arrive at 13th July.  I will now ask you to tell the 
 23   court what happened on that day.
 24   A.   On 13th, well, we put down four APCs on the road to make some of the 
 25   -----

  1   Q.  APCs stands for the -----
  2   A.   Armoured personnel carrier.
  3   Q.  Armoured personnel carrier -- armoured?
  4   A.   Armoured, yes, sorry -- to make some of them an artificial gate so we 
  5   could guide the people in a better way.  Then, at approximately 700 
  6   hours, the buses arrived and half an hour later the Serbs arrived, and 
  7   then there were more and more troops coming down to our position and  
  8   when -----
  9   Q.  Again an estimation, if you can, how many troops?
 10   A.   At least 50, 60 of them.  Again they start again to pull away my men 
 11   and to put the people inside of the buses and the trucks and that 
 12   carried on during the day.
 13   Q.  Any attacks on you or your personnel during the day?
 14   A.   No.
 15   Q.  Shooting?
 16   A.   No.
 17   Q.  Nothing?
 18   A.   We heard some shooting on the west side of the compound coming from 
 19   houses and that kind of thing, but not in my position, there was no 
 20   shooting.
 21   Q.  Did this separation type of handling, this thing, did that go on even 
 22   this day?  Did they separate men from the rest of their families or 
 23   was that only on the first day?
 24   A.   No, it still went on that day and, for example, we saw a 19 year old 
 25   boy being separated from his family and, well, we protested against it 

  1   and the Serbian soldier, he was impressed, and let the boy go to the 
  2   buses, but they carried on separating the men, yes.
  3   Q.  That went on this the 13th July all day?
  4   A.   From what I have seen, yes.
  5   Q.  When was the place emptied of refugees or everybody evacuated, when 
  6   was that?
  7   A.   I will have to look it up, one moment, please.  It was on 13th July.
  8   Q.  13th July?
  9   A.   Yes.
 10   Q.  What time of the day, can you recall that? 
 11   A.   Well, to be approximately, at 1800 hours.  I had to do my report at 
 12   the compound and get some food and a few hours of sleep, two hours, 
 13   and it was at 1600 hours when I reported to duty in the Operations 
 14   room it was at 1830.  I was told it was not necessary any more because 
 15   all the people had gone.
 16   Q.  All of them.
 17   A.   All of them had gone.
 18   Q.  Even the people who were in the compound?
 19   A.   Yes, except the wounded people.
 20   Q.  Except of the wounded people?
 21   A.   Yes.
 22   Q.  They left the wounded people?  What about the men who were separated? 
 23    Were they still around or were they gone also?
 24   A.   They were also gone.
 25   Q.  Did you see them go?

  1   A.   No, because I was on the compound asleep.
  2   Q.  Did you see when the people were taken from that compound into the 
  3   buses?
  4   A.   No, I did not see.
  5   Q.  You did not see that.  Did you see or hear any violence during the 
  6   13th?  Was there any shooting then or other kinds of violence?
  7   A.   No, not in person.  We heard several single shots, like I told you 
  8   before, and all we did hear some rumours, it was on 12th July, while I 
  9   was reporting at the compound, we heard some rumours from people 
 10   inside the compound that there was a place where they had seen eight 
 11   or nine bodies laying down on the ground and on 13th July  two 
 12   colleagues of me and I investigated that place.
 13   Q.  Was that in the vicinity of the compound -- outside the compound -----
 14   A.   Well, it was approximately, well, 500 metres away from the compound.
 15   Q.  What did you find?
 16   A.   When we came down to that place, we saw nine bodies laying in a field 
 17   near to a river.  We went up to that location and we took pictures.  
 18   We did not actually investigate the bodies, but we saw seven of them 
 19   lying down on the ground with their face down to the ground; two of 
 20   them were lying on their sides, on their back. They had, well, the 
 21   seven of them had a shot in the back, in the middle of the back, and 
 22   we took pictures and we also found some papers.  The bodies, they were 
 23   dressed in civilian clothes and, from what I could see and could make 
 24   of it, they were men.
 25   Q.  You did these findings on 13th July?

  1   A.   Yes.
  2   Q.  Did you hear some shooting you could relate to that incident, to these 
  3   people's death?
  4   A.   I only heard the several single shots during the day, so that is only 
  5   what I have heard.
  6   Q.  Did you see other killed people around?
  7   A.   Yes, that was in the morning, one man who hanged himself on the 
  8   ceiling of a small building, but he was already dead when we released 
  9   him from the rope.
 10   Q.  Any other incidents of that kind?
 11   A.   No.
 12   Q.  So by the evening of 13th the place was empty, there  were no refugees 
 13   any more?
 14   A.   Outside the compound, inside also, no, except the wounded people.
 15   Q.  The wounded people.  Did you see General Mladic more than these times 
 16   on the 12th that you talked about?
 17   A.   Yes, during the night on 12th and on the 13th, during that night, I 
 18   saw him passing by our position sitting in a jeep and he moved up to 
 19   Srebrenica, and later on that night he moved back towards Potocari.
 20   Q.  So you saw him twice during that night?
 21   A.   Sorry?
 22   Q.  You saw him twice during that night?
 23   A.   Yes, that is correct.
 24   Q.  But he did not stop?
 25   A.   No.

  1   Q.  You did not talk to him?
  2   A.   He just drove on.
  3   Q.  OK.  Then when only the wounded people were left, what happened then? 
  4    What did you do in the coming days?
  5   A.   Well, for me, personally, I picked up my job again as logistics 
  6   officer and doing the things requested and waiting for us to leave the 
  7   enclave, and we were making preparations for leaving the enclave 
  8   because we did not know if we could leave with all our equipment or 
  9   just by taking our personal belongings and then leave the compound.  
 10   So I took up my old job.
 11   Q.  As a logistics officer, you can certainly tell us how much equipment 
 12   did you lose during these days?
 13   A.   Well, I do not know the exact numbers and figures. We lose weapons, 
 14   we did lose some jeeps. 
 15   Q.  How many jeeps?
 16   A.   I do not know the exact figures.
 17   Q.  Can you make an estimate?
 18   A.   No.
 19   Q.  You cannot.
 20   A.   APCs, we lost APCs, and we lost, well, equipment, soldiers' equipment 
 21   and bulletproof vests and helmets.
 22   Q.  When did you leave?  When did the Battalion leave Srebrenica?
 23   A.   It was on 21st, on Friday, July.
 24   Q.  The week after?
 25   A.   A week after that, yes.

  1   MR. OSTBERG:  Thank you very much.  Your Honours, I have concluded my 
  2   examination.
  3   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, Mr. Ostberg.  Fellow Judges, you have a 
  4   question, please proceed.
  5   		    Examined by the Court
  6   JUDGE ODIO BENITO:  Thank you.  Lieutenant Koster, you talk of 15,000 
  7   people coming from Srebrenica to Potocari looking for help, mostly, 
  8   you said, they were women and children and elderly people; is that 
  9   correct?
 10   A.   That is correct.
 11   Q.  Were you expecting this exodus from Srebrenica?
 12   A.   I am sorry.  Can you repeat the question?
 13   Q.  Were you in Potocari, you and your team, expecting this exodus from 
 14   Srebrenica?
 15   A.   Yes, we were outside there to receive the refugees, yes, and we had 
 16   expected to come refugees to our position.  That was why we were 
 17   posted outside.
 18   Q.  Were you prepared for receiving them? 
 19   A.   No -- just being there and being posted there and doing the best we 
 20   can, but we did not have the equipment or medical equipment or even 
 21   enough food to receive them.
 22   Q.  Had you, your team, asked for help to your superiors or to the 
 23   superior command or NATO or UNPROFOR to face this emergency?
 24   A.   I did not, no.
 25   Q.  Did you receive any additional support for help before or after 11th 

  1   July?
  2   A.   No.
  3   Q.  What happened with these people, women, children, elderly, wounded 
  4   people when the Bosnian Serb soldiers arrived?
  5   A.   Well, sorry, you are only talking now about the wounded people?
  6   Q.  About the women, children, elderly people in Potocari coming from 
  7   Srebrenica when the soldiers Serb soldiers arrived.
  8   A.   Well, they were afraid and they were not harmed or anything by the 
  9   Serbian people, from what I could see, outside the compound.  Well, 
 10   later on, the periods we were outside, they were put inside of the 
 11   buses and evacuated from my position.
 12   Q.  Did you hear about massacres committed by Serb soldiers against 
 13   Muslims in and around Srebrenica, Potocari, Bratunac at that time?
 14   A.   No, I only learned on the Wednesday that there was a position -- 
 15   there was a rumour about eight or nine bodies.
 16   Q.  After those days have you heard about massacres  committed?
 17   A.   No, only when I returned in the news.
 18   Q.  Did Colonel Karremans or anyone else say "no" to General Mladic when 
 19   he ordered the evacuation of the refugees?
 20   A.   I do not know that because they already started it when I was 
 21   reporting it, so the situation was completely taken out of their hands 
 22   outside.
 23   Q.  But the refugees were under your support, under the UN support, under 
 24   the protection?
 25   A.   That is correct.

  1   Q.  So did you or your superior try to avoid that the refugees were taken 
  2   out in any way?
  3   A.   It was not possible to do it because we were outnumbered and we were 
  4   pulled away, and then the Serbs, they pushed the people and shouted at 
  5   the people to go to the buses now, but to get inside these buses so 
  6   being outnumbered we could not do anything at that time.
  7   JUDGE ODIO BENITO:  I see.  Thank you.  No further questions.
  8   JUDGE RIAD:  Lieutenant Kosta, you just said that you were outnumbered, 
  9   completely outnumbered.  In fact, you were in a state of helplessness 
 10   completely?
 11   A.   Yes, that is correct.
 12   Q.  Were you at any moment threatened?
 13   A.   In person?
 14   Q.  No, the whole group in your capacity, you and your colleagues?
 15   A.   No, we were just told to co-operate and that would be the best for 
 16   us. 
 17   Q.  Yes, yes, "best for us" means that something would be worst; if there 
 18   is something best, then something can be worst.  You mentioned that 
 19   Mladic himself told you, you had better co-operate, you are all right, 
 20   and then he told you, "You will see what is going to happen"; is that 
 21   right?
 22   A.   I am sorry, I did not understand the question.
 23   Q.  Mladic, among his visits, he told you, "You are going to see what will 
 24   happen".  You mentioned that from your notes.
 25   A.   I still do not understand the question.  I am sorry.

  1   Q.  What did Mladic tell you?
  2   A.   OK.  Yes, he told me that and later on he told me that he was going 
  3   to evacuate the people of Srebrenica.
  4   Q.  Yes.
  5   A.   Yes.
  6   Q.  Then you mentioned that you saw them separate men in fighting age from 
  7   the others?
  8   A.   Yes, that is correct.
  9   Q.  Yes.  Did you protest or anything?
 10   A.   Yes, we did.
 11   Q.  You did and what was the reaction to your protest?
 12   A.   Well, sometimes they let the men go with their families and their 
 13   wives and, well, at the places we were  -- we could not protest or 
 14   where we were not located, well, we could not do a thing.
 15   Q.  Did they pick them just at random or did they have a list in their 
 16   hands?
 17   A.   No, just at random.
 18   Q.  Because there was a list of 200 and something people  which nobody 
 19   knew if it was given to them or not.  Do you have any idea about that?
 20   A.   I know about that list, yes, and it was made on the compound, at the 
 21   compound.
 22   Q.  I beg your pardon?
 23   A.   That list was made just to make sure and to inform the Serbs that we 
 24   were watching them ---
 25   Q.  Yes.

  1   A.   -- and keeping everything under control about what they were going to 
  2   do with the men, and so by that list we were also protecting them, so 
  3   we were checking them.
  4   Q.  So this list was made by your men, by the officers?
  5   A.   No.
  6   Q.  No?
  7   A.   It was not.  It was made by a committee of the refugees inside of the 
  8   compound and -----
  9   Q.  And given to you?
 10   A.   No, not to me.
 11   Q.  I mean, to -----
 12   A.   My commanding officer?
 13   Q.  Yes.
 14   A.   From what I know, it was not given to the Serbs.
 15   Q.  You do not know if it was given to the Serbs or not?
 16   A.   From what I know, it was not given to the Serbs.
 17   JUDGE RIAD:  It was not.  Thank you very much.
 18   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Lieutenant, on the basis of what we have heard, 
 19   apparently, there are some vehicles from the Battalion that escorted 
 20   the jeeps, some jeeps that escorted the vehicles, so you did you have 
 21   some jeeps that went along with the convoys.  I take it that those  
 22   jeeps came back, at least some of them came back, so you had a chance 
 23   to see some of your men before you left the compound.  What did your 
 24   men tell you about what happened and were they aware of the events?
 25   A.   I only learnt from that when we left the enclave. Before that, I was 

  1   constantly being outside until the 13th and I did not know what was 
  2   going on during these escorts.
  3   Q.  Because the jeeps that were doing the escorting did not leave 
  4   Potocari?
  5   A.   Some of them were already taken away at our main gate and, well, that 
  6   is what they told me while I was doing my reports.  Well, at least one 
  7   of them made it through and hat was the first transport, but that is 
  8   something I learned later when I left the enclave.
  9   Q.  When soldiers came back, because there was a gathering before you left 
 10   the enclave, what did people say to one another?  What did soldiers 
 11   say?  Did anybody tell you anything?  Did they know nothing?
 12   A.   No.
 13   Q.  Nothing was said?
 14   A.   No.
 15   Q.  They did not say anything about what they might have seen?  They did 
 16   not see anything?
 17   A.   No, because I was not speaking to them.  I was too busy at that time 
 18   doing my job as a logistics officer, so I do not know anything about 
 19   that.  I am sorry.
 20   Q.  Fine.  You got together on a regular basis with the reports about the 
 21   meetings with General Mladic, or was there a compartmentalisation 
 22   between the different levels  of command?
 23   A.   Can the interpreter repeat the question, please?
 24   Q.  Did you have any input about the meetings with General Mladic or was 
 25   there no information tricking down at the various levels?

  1   A.   No, I did not know what was going on.  I did not know the exact 
  2   details of the meetings with General Mladic.
  3   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you.  Mr. Ostberg, we have no further 
  4   questions for the witness.  So, we could have the usher show the 
  5   witness out?  Lieutenant, the Tribunal would like to thank you for 
  6   your testimony which you provided on behalf of the Prosecution.  Then 
  7   the Prosecution can show in the next witness.
  8   THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

 10   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Just to organise our proceedings, we are going to 
 11   spend one hour listening to the next witness and then we shall proceed 
 12   to a recess at about 4.30.  So, Mr. Bowers, once the witness comes in, 
 13   please do proceed.
 14   MR. BOWERS:  Thank you, your Honour.  At this time the Prosecution would 
 15   call Corporal Groenewegen to the stand, please.
 16   		     CORPORAL GROENEWEGEN, called.
 17   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We will be going through the interpreter.  Can you 
 18   hear, madam?  Can you hear me?  Can the interpreter hear the English 
 19   interpretation?  Can you hear the interpretation?
 20   THE INTERPRETER:  Yes, thank you.
 21   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  So, first, you will ask the witness  to read out the 
 22   declaration, the solemn declaration.
 23   THE WITNESS:  I hereby declare to speak the truth, the truth and nothing 
 24   but the truth.
 25   		        (The witness was sworn)

  1   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you.  Please be seated. Mr. Bowers?

 18   guard on foot, just being in the enclave occupying the enclave.
 19   Q.  You have used the initials "OP", does that refer to observation posts?
 20   A.   That is correct.
 21   Q.  You were serving as an infantrymen at one of the observation posts; is 
 22   that correct? 
 23   A.   That is correct.
 24   Q.  Could you just tell the court, as an infantryman assigned to an 
 25   observation post, what were your daily assignments?  What types of 

  1   things did you do?
  2   A.   Well, my work consisted of patrols of the OP itself.
  3   Q.  Were there different types of patrols that you would undertake?
  4   A.   That is correct.
  5   Q.  Could you describe those, please?
  6   A.   There were two kinds of patrols, border patrol, social patrol.
  7   Q.  What were the differences in these two patrols?
  8   A.   The social patrols were to have certain contact with the people and

 11   MR. BOWERS:  Your Honour, at this time if we could have Exhibit 60, the

 24   A.   This is November.
 25   Q.  Thank you.  In the first months of 1995 when you arrived at Potocari, 

  1   what was it like serving at these observation posts?
  2   A.   Well, it was quite attractive; the day consisted of patrolling, being 
  3   on guard, resting, a patrol every other day, so we did not really have 
  4   very much to do.
  5   Q.  Did you encounter any resistance or antagonism from the Bosnian Serb 
  6   Army in the vicinity of your patrols?
  7   A.   No.
  8   Q.  At some point later in your tour of duty did the situation begin to 
  9   change?
 10   A.   That is correct.  That was the last month.
 11   Q.  What happened in the last month?
 12   A.   It started with a complete discontinuation of convoys, hence we could 
 13   not continue our work because of lack of fuel, food.
 14   Q.  In late June/early July of 1995 which observation post were you 
 15   assigned to?
 16   A.   OP Mike.
 17   Q.  Could you describe for the court what started happening in the 
 18   vicinity of OP Mike with regard to conduct of the Bosnian Serb Army in 
 19   the vicinity of the observation post?
 20   A.   Well, from the Serb positions that we could see from our position, we 
 21   saw people, soldiers, who made signals towards us that we had to leave 
 22   the OP in the area. 
 23   Q.  When did they start making these types of gestures?
 24   A.   Do you mean time?

  7   Q.  Did they yell anything that you could hear from across the way?
  8   A.   Positive.
  9   Q.  What types of things could you hear?

 14   A.   10 to 15 minutes.
 15   Q.  Did it occur on more than one day?

  4   Q.  Was there any other interference the next day when you resumed your 
  5   work?

  7   firing.  Towards the afternoon, I was taken down, down to the 
  8   compound.
  9   Q.  You returned to the compound because it was your turn, as far as a 
 10   rotation of duty, to return to the Potocari area; is that correct?

  1   A.   On the nearest mountain close to OP Papa.
  2   Q.  Could you determine what the targets were?
  3   A.   No precise targets, most probably just provocation, so that the 
  4   people, the population, would not move.
  5   Q.  OK.  Thank you.  After you returned to the Potocari compound, at some 
  6   point refugees started arriving from the Srebrenica compound; is that 
  7   correct?
  8   A.   That is on July 11th, in the morning.
  9   Q.  Was Bravo Company also travelling with some of the refugees?
 10   A.   Yes, we saw a very big group of refugees and then an increasing 
 11   number of Bravo Company people.
 12   Q.  Did you have any responsibilities with regard to receiving this exodus 
 13   of refugees from the Srebrenica area?
 14   A.   That is correct.
 15   Q.  What were your responsibilities?
 16   A.   I started to form a line from the compound to receive the people as 
 17   best as possible and to move them in that direction.
 18   Q.  How many soldiers were stationed outside the compound in this 
 19   receiving line?
 20   A.   Approximately 30 to 50 men.
 21   Q.  Once you were assigned to this receiving line, did you stay out

  4   refugees arrived, just briefly state for the court what shape the 
  5   refugees were in and some of the sights that you saw?
  6   A.   The purpose was to see to it that the refugees that arrived, they had 
  7   to be led towards the compound, but it became clear very quickly that 
  8   we could not have everybody moved, go there.  So the rest of the 
  9   people had to remain outside.  As much as possible we placed them in 
 10   the factories, in the buildings, in the vicinity.  It was very 
 11   chaotic.
 12   Q.  Did the wounded get some sort of priority as far as being allowed into 
 13   the compound?
 14   A.   That is correct.  Women and children, as far as possible, were helped

 23   influx of refugees?

 25   of water.  We tried to bring them as much as possible. 

  1   Q.  You have stated that the refugees arrived approximately on June (sic) 
  2   11th.  What happened the next day -- I am sorry, July 12th?
  3   A.   July 12th, Serbs started evacuating refugees.
  4   Q.  Were you out on the receiving line when the first soldiers arrived 
  5   into Potocari?
  6   A.   That is correct.

  8   A.   Afternoon.
  9   Q.  That was on July 12th?
 10   A.   Yes.
 11   Q.  From which direction did this first group of soldiers arrive?
 12   A.   From OP Papa.
 13   Q.  Could we have Exhibit 60 so that the Corporal can point that out on

 15   from?
 16   A.   (The witness indicated on the map).
 17   Q.  OK, so they are coming from the south to the north?

 22   A.   That is correct.
 23   Q.  OK.  Is there a main road that enters into Potocari?
 24   A.   Indeed, there was one.  There was just one entry, the enclave, and 
 25   that was at Potocari, OP Papa.

  1   Q.  Would you describe for the court what type of soldiers these were that 
  2   first arrived?
  3   A.   These were not -- those are soldiers that did not  wear the regular 
  4   clothing; all kinds of camouflage clothing and head wear.
  5   Q.  How were they armed?
  6   A.   Heavily.
  7   Q.  Were they armed in a standard military way or did they appear to have 
  8   more weaponry than is normal for a standard soldier?
  9   A.   It is probably at random, whatever they wanted to bring along.
 10   Q.  When this first group of soldiers arrived into Potocari, did you see 
 11   or hear any firing?
 12   A.   That is correct.
 13   Q.  Where was that occurring?
 14   A.   Mainly along the sides of the enclave.
 15   Q.  Would that be up in the hills surrounding the Potocari village?
 16   A.   That is correct.  I could not see any further than that.

 22   A.   I cannot answer.
 23   Q.  I am sorry?
 24   THE INTERPRETER:  Could you repeat your answer?
 25   THE WITNESS:  I cannot give you an exact answer.  It  would be an 

  1   estimate.
  2   MR. BOWERS:  OK.  Can you give an estimate?
  3   A.   From the moment the soldiers arrived until night fall.
  4   Q.  After this first group arrived were there other soldiers that came 
  5   later?
  6   A.   That is correct.
  7   Q.  Approximately, how long after the first group arrived did this second 
  8   group of soldiers come to Potocari?
  9   A.   10 to 15 minutes.
 10   Q.  Would you describe this second group of soldiers for the court, 
 11   please?
 12   A.   Sort of more uniformly dressed; almost all of them had the same 
 13   uniform, plus camera crews.
 14   Q.  Were there any soldiers with dogs?
 15   A.   Not at that moment, no.
 16   Q.  OK.  The direction that the first group had come, was that the same 
 17   direction as the second group that arrived into Potocari?
 18   A.   That is correct.
 19   Q.  In your opinion, was there any way that this first group of heavily 
 20   armed soldiers could have entered the city of Potocari without the 
 21   knowledge of the second group that arrived?
 22   A.   No, it looked like that the heavily armed group would go first, to be 
 23   sure, and only after that the camera crews would follow, I mean, to 
 24   record everything.
 25   Q.  Did it appear that they were acting in co-ordination?

  1   A.   Yes.
  2   Q.  You mentioned camera crews.  What were camera crews  doing?

  4   equipment and photo cameras -- some men with photo cameras.

  6   of?

  8   arrived and surroundings.

 10   approximately how many refugees would be in the vicinity of the 
 11   compound at Potocari?

 13   Q.  Both.
 14   A.   Inside the compound about 2500, and outside the rest of the 
 15   population.
 16   Q.  Do you have an estimate of approximately how many were outside the 
 17   compound?
 18   A.   No.
 19   Q.  What happened with the refugees once the soldiers began arriving in 
 20   Potocari?
 21   A.   Before the evacuation actually started, the people were more or less 
 22   left alone.
 23   Q.  Did they appear to be concerned when the soldiers arrived?
 24   A.   Yes, you saw that.

  2   A.   I do not know.
  3   Q.  How did this evacuation proceed?  What type of  vehicles were used?

 14   Q.  At this point in time, on the morning of July 13th, did you start 
 15   seeing any type of separation effort?
 16   A.   That is correct.  As from that point in time, the men were separated 
 17   from the women.
 18   Q.  Who was doing this separation?
 19   A.   All the Serbs that were there in the vicinity.
 20   Q.  You watched this process at a fairly close range?
 21   A.   Yes, we were walking around in between.
 22   Q.  Would you describe for the court how the Serb soldiers would separate 
 23   a man from the crowd?
 24   A.   Mostly groups of three to four men.  A maximum of one or two men were 
 25   taken away.

  1   Q.  Was it always a situation where the armed Serb soldiers outnumbered 
  2   the men that they were taking out of the crowd or the group of men 
  3   that they were removing from the crowd?
  4   A.   That is correct.
  5   Q.  Did you see what happened to the men that were separated out of the 
  6   crowd? 
  7   A.   The men were taken to a house that was nearby until that floor was 
  8   full of people and then they were deported.
  9   Q.  Could you see into this particular house where the men were collected?
 10   A.   That is correct.
 11   Q.  Is that because part of the front wall was missing?
 12   A.   Yes.
 13   Q.  Did you observe this house throughout the day?
 14   A.   Yes, I was there all day but I did not constantly concentrate on the 
 15   house.
 16   Q.  During the course of the day, did you see men brought to the house and 
 17   then taken away from the house on a fairly regular basis?
 18   A.   That is correct.  As soon as the house was almost full, if you looked 
 19   up after some time you saw that it was empty again.
 20   Q.  On the afternoon of July 13th, did you witness a killing?
 21   A.   That is correct.
 22   Q.  Approximately what time of the day was that?
 23   A.   4 o'clock.
 24   MR. BOWERS:  Your Honour, at this point if we could have the lights 
 25   dimmed?  We have a brief video to show. I believe that is Exhibit 61.

  1   		  (Exhibit 61 was shown)
  2   		Corporal Groenewegen, do you recognise this area?
  3   A.   Yes.
  4   Q.  Do you recognise this house that is shown?
  5   A.   That is correct. 
  6   Q.  Is this in the vicinity where you were when you saw the killing?
  7   A.   That is correct.
  8   Q.  OK, that is fine.  Thank you.  Now if we could have Exhibit 62 which 
  9   is a still photo taken from this video put on the overhead?  Corporal, 
 10   if you could use this photograph and if we could move that up just a 
 11   little, please, and then use the pointer and describe to the court 
 12   where you were and what you saw?
 13   A.   That day I walked around, essentially, over here and this is the 
 14   house where I saw the murder being committed.
 15   Q.  Were there refugees in the general area here where you see the open 
 16   space with the grass?
 17   A.   It should not be there.  We were there in order to send them back so 
 18   that they would be sent back through the ordinary route.
 19   Q.  What did you see that day?  What happened?
 20   A.   From my position, the line where I was to keep people out who wanted 
 21   to move towards the buses, I saw that a group of Serb soldiers from 
 22   the crowd took one man, and then I did not take any notice of that any 
 23   more and then later on I heard shouting.  I responded, and it appeared 
 24   to be the same group with a man that they had taken along.
 25   Q.  OK, if I could stop you a for one second?

  1   A.   And after -----
  2   Q.  How many men took the individual out of the crowd?
  3   A.   Four.
  4   Q.  Were they soldiers, armed soldiers?
  5   A.   All four of them were armed, yes. 
  6   Q.  The man taken from the crowd, was he armed?
  7   A.   No.
  8   Q.  Did he resist in any way?
  9   A.   Impossible.  He probably knew what was going to happen.
 10   Q.  All right.  Continue and tell the court what you saw after he was 
 11   taken from the crowd.
 12   A.   At that moment he was taken from the crowd, I no longer took any 
 13   notice of them.  Later on, when I heard the shouting, I looked towards 
 14   them and I saw the same group, Serbs, with the man they had taken 
 15   along, and afterwards around the corner he was shot dead.
 16   Q.  When he was taken behind the house that appears on the still 
 17   photograph, did you hear shouting from that area?
 18   A.   Not really loud shouting, but noise, a lot of noise.
 19   Q.  When you heard the noise, you turned and what did you see when you 
 20   first looked behind the house?
 21   A.   From the position where I was standing, I saw that the men gestured 
 22   to the man they had captured, so to call, to face the wall.  The 
 23   soldiers themselves looked at one another for a second, as if they 
 24   were asking each other, who is going to do it.  One stepped out and he 
 25   was about a few metres behind the man and shot him with an AK.

  1   Q.  Could you tell from that distance where the bullet impacted?
  2   A.   That must have been the head itself.
  3   Q.  When the soldiers took the man from the crowd behind the house, were 
  4   there some other Serb soldiers in the  general vicinity?
  5   A.   Some of them working around -- walking around that could see it, yes.
  6   Q.  How many were also behind the house in addition to the men that were 
  7   responsible for extracting the individual from the crowd and shooting 
  8   him?
  9   A.   The time of the murder, two at that moment.
 10   Q.  From where you were standing across the way, you could hear the 
 11   gunshot; is that correct?
 12   A.   That is correct.
 13   Q.  Did the two soldiers standing behind the house react when the man was 
 14   shot?
 15   A.   At the moment of the shooting they looked up in that direction, but 
 16   then they resumed their own work quite quickly.
 17   Q.  After the man was shot, what did the soldiers responsible for the 
 18   shooting do?
 19   A.   The men disappeared behind some bushes very nearby.
 20   Q.  Did they drag the body of the person that had been shot?
 21   A.   Not at that moment, not when they disappeared behind the bushes and 
 22   not afterwards either.
 23   Q.  Do you know what happened to the body?
 24   A.   Negative.
 25   Q.  Did the soldier use a single round to shoot this individual?

  1   A.   Yes, a single round.
  2   Q.  During the rest of the day on July 13th, did you continue to hear 
  3   these single shots throughout the day?
  4   A.   That is correct. 
  5   Q.  Could you please tell the court how often during the course of July 
  6   13th you heard these single isolated shots?
  7   A.   Approximately 20 to 40 an hour.
  8   Q.  Could you determine approximately what area these shots originated?
  9   A.   Mainly from the house, the area with the houses.
 10   Q.  Would that be up away from where the crowd of refugees was being kept?
 11   A.   That is correct, a lot further, in the hills.
 12   Q.  In your opinion, were these single round being fired in any type of 
 13   combat situation?
 14   A.   Single shots.
 15   Q.  So that does not indicate any type of combat occurring, in your 
 16   opinion?
 17   A.   Negative.
 18   Q.  At the time you were hearing these single shots, I assume there were 
 19   Serb soldiers in the area?
 20   A.   That is correct.
 21   Q.  Did they exhibit any concern when these single shots would occur?
 22   A.   Negative.
 23   Q.  Corporal, can you recognise General Mladic?
 24   A.   Yes.
 25   Q.  How is it that you are able to recognise him?

  1   A.   From the briefings beforehand, news, the situation in general.
  2   Q.  Did you see General Mladic in Potocari?
  3   A.   That is correct.
  4   Q.  Approximately how many times? 
  5   A.   About four times.
  6   Q.  When was that that you saw General Mladic in Potocari?
  7   A.   On 13th July, throughout the day.
  8   Q.  Could you tell the court some of the things he was doing during the 
  9   course of the day?
 10   A.   I only saw him speaking to his own people and our own people.
 11   Q.  Did he appear to be in charge of the situation?
 12   A.   That is correct.
 13   Q.  The day, July 13th, that you saw General Mladic in Potocari, is that 
 14   the same day that you saw the Serb soldiers begin separating the 
 15   fighting aged men out from the crowd?
 16   A.   That is correct.
 17   Q.  The day you saw General Mladic is also the same day that you saw the 
 18   execution of the man behind the house; is that correct?
 19   A.   That is correct.
 20   Q.  It is also the same day that you heard the continuous repetition of 
 21   single shots being fired in the area beyond the refugees?
 22   A.   That is correct.
 23   Q.  You recall the video showed the road running in front of the house 
 24   where the execution occurred?
 25   A.   Yes.

  1   Q.  Is that the road that General Mladic would have travelled each time he 
  2   arrived in Potocari?
  3   A.   That is correct.
  4   MR. BOWERS:  We have no further questions, your Honour. 
  5   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, Prosecutor.  Do you have any questions or 
  6   do you have any questions?
  7   		          Examined by the Court
  8   JUDGE RIAD:  Corporal, you mentioned that you heard single shots 
  9   repeatedly till night fall.  Did you or did your Battalion enquire 
 10   what it was about?
 11   A.   We all had our own ideas about it, but nothing was done.
 12   Q.  "Nothing was done", do you mean that there was no protest or objection 
 13   or contact with the Serbs to ask them what it was about?
 14   A.   If we asked, then we did not get any reaction, so we did not get any 
 15   answers from them.
 16   Q.  When this execution was undertaken at your site, was there any 
 17   objection to it to the Serbians or did they draw your attention to 
 18   what they were doing?
 19   A.   At that moment it was so chaotic that we were all very busy and we 
 20   could not react as we would normally react.
 21   Q.  Did you have a chance to know why they selected a man like this man to 
 22   execute him in public?
 23   A.   Negative.
 24   JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much.
 25   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Thank you, Prosecutor.  I think we have finished 

  1   with this testimony.  The Tribunal would like to thank the Corporal 
  2   for his testimony which we have got through the Prosecution in this 
  3   present case. The Tribunal would also like to thank the interpreter so 
  4   that we could hear the testimony of the witness.  Could the usher 
  5   please accompany the witness out of the courtroom?
  6   		               (The witness withdrew)
  7   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Prosecutor, I suggest that we adjourn until 4.50.  
  8   The meeting is adjourned.
  9   (4.33 p.m.)
 10   		(The court adjourned for a short time).
 11   (4.50 p.m.)
 12   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Counsel for the Prosecution, Mr. Ostberg, you have 
 13   submitted an application to the Trial Chamber in connection with the 
 14   protection of a witness.  Now we today came out with an order on the 
 15   part of the Chamber and we have ordered that the name, address, 
 16   whereabouts and other identifying information concerning the person 
 17   previously identified by the pseudonym Witness A shall not be 
 18   disclosed to the public or to the media; that the name, address, 
 19   whereabouts and other identifying information concerning Witness A 
 20   shall be sealed and not included in any of the Tribunal's public 
 21   records; that the pseudonym Witness A shall be used whenever 
 22   referring to this witness in the Tribunal proceedings; that the 
 23   testimony of Witness A be presented using image altering devices; 
 24   that any discussions, should there be any, relative to the issue of 
 25   protective measures for pseudonym witnesses shall be held in closed 

  1   session; lastly, that the identity of Witness A also be protected 
  2   while he enters and leaves the courtroom, which means that at present 
  3   we have blocked off part of the room.  We will see whether there are 
  4   any other measures that need to be taken, and once we have seen to it 
  5   that we have all the protection required we can remove this here 
  6   blocking the view.
  7   		I would like to know from, Mr. Ostberg, whether there are any 
  8   other measures.  There should be an embargo, as it were, on the images 
  9   that are now broadcast live from our own channel that is available to 
 10   all television networks.  If you agree, I think we should, therefore, 
 11   for at least 15 minutes block out the images in case one of us has a 
 12   slip of the tongue.  What do you think of that, Mr. Ostberg?
 13   MR. OSTBERG:  Yes, that is also my opinion, your Honour. So I think this 
 14   delay also will take place.  Other measures I do not require.
 15   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  I see.  The Registrar would like to say something.  
 16   Please proceed.
 17   MR. BOS:  I would like to know for this last measure if the technical 
 18   booth is ready to have a video delay at this moment, because I am not 
 19   sure.  I think they are asking for a 10 minutes delay to install this 
 20   video delay, because they were not prepared for this.
 21   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  We shall, therefore, adjourn for 10 minutes.  So 
 22   that those following the proceedings will understand what the point 
 23   is, this is so that the protective measures taken work, because they 
 24   will not work if we do not delay by some 15 minutes the broadcast of 
 25   the images.  What you have to bear in mind is that the witness who is 

  1   going to be entering the room might himself in his account say things 
  2   that might reveal the disclose either of his identity or that of other 
  3   persons.  So it is not just in respect of this witness, but we also 
  4   want to protect other potential witnesses.  As I said, we shall 
  5   adjourn for 10 minutes.  I would ask the technical unit to do their 
  6   utmost so that we can proceed with the hearing.
  7   		(The court adjourned for a short time).
  8   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Counsel for the Prosecution, I want to ask you that 
  9   if the same clauses and measures are going to be valid for tomorrow 
 10   we have to have this delay in the transmission of our images also 
 11   tomorrow, so we must be prepared tomorrow.  So, we hope that this 
 12   information will be passed on to the technical facilities so that we 
 13   will not have a late start tomorrow morning.
 14   		You have the floor, Prosecutor.
 15   MR. OSTBERG:  Thank you, your Honour.  I call Witness A.
 16   		Witness A called.
 17   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Sir, first of all, can you hear me?  Take your time, 
 18   take your time.  Can you hear me?
 19   THE WITNESS:  [In translation] Yes, I do.
 20   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  The usher is going to give you a statement which you 
 21   must read standing up, if at all possible.  Please read it, sir.
 22   THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth, the whole 
 23   truth and nothing but the truth.
 24   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Sir, please be seated.  We can draw the curtains 
 25   up.  First of all, I would like to thank you for having come here, 

  1   for being prepared to come and give us your testimony.  We are fully 
  2   aware that this is something very difficult for you.  I and my 
  3   colleagues want to assure you that you can speak freely because you 
  4   are under the protection of this Tribunal.  It is an International 
  5   Tribunal. 
  6   		Now counsel for the Prosecution -- there seems to be no sound 
  7   in the public gallery.  Can the public gallery hear the Judge?  No.  
  8   Can you hear the Judge from the public gallery?
  9   		First of all, we also must bear in mind the public gallery.  
 10   Counsel for the Prosecution, do you hear me?  It seems there are some 
 11   technical sound problems. I nevertheless note that this has happened 
 12   once before. Each time we take protective measures for the witness it 
 13   seems that our system of protection does not work and we cannot have 
 14   the sound for the public gallery.  This has already happened in a 
 15   Rule 61
 16   hearing and I regret this very much.  We will not stay here inactive, so 
 17   once again I have to adjourn the hearing.
 18   		   (The hearing adjourned for a short time).
 19   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Can the public gallery hear me?  Is the sound 
 20   coming through?  Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed.
 21   		I just want to say that we are very appreciative that you have 
 22   come here.  We understand the difficulties it has for you.  You are 
 23   under the protection of the Tribunal.  Therefore, you can speak freely 
 24   without being worried at all.  Prosecutor, please proceed.
 25   MR. OSTBERG:  Thank you, your Honour.

  1   		          Examined by Mr. Ostberg.
  2   Q.  Will you tell us, sir, if you were present in Srebrenica when the town 
  3   fell to the Bosnian Serb Army?
  4   A.   Yes, I was.
  5   Q.  Would you tell us what day that was?
  6   A.   It was on 11th July '95. 
  7   Q.  Thank you.  Sir, I would like to ask you if you feel comfortable to 
  8   tell the Court what you experienced that day and the following three 
  9   days without having me guiding you through the events.  Are you 
 10   prepared to do that?
 11   A.   Yes, I am.
 12   Q.  Then please, sir, tell the Court what happened to you on 11th July and 
 13   the days to come, please?
 14   A.   On 11th July they came in the morning from the Civilian Defence to 
 15   our village and told us that the Serbs are attacking with armoured 
 16   vehicles from Zelen Yadar in the direction of Srebrenica.  So, we were 
 17   expecting, afraid and panicky, what will happen with Srebrenica.  We 
 18   listened to the news from Sarajevo wondering what might happen.  Until 
 19   about 2 o'clock in the afternoon two planes of NATO flew over.  We 
 20   heard detonations and knew that they were bombing.  Around 3 o'clock 
 21   we were listening to Sarajevo news, and they said that NATO planes 
 22   bombed armoured vehicles of the Serbian Army, that Srebrenica will not 
 23   fall, it will be protected, and so we relaxed a little and went after 
 24   our business.
 25   		Then towards the evening I saw people going from the village. 

  1    I was in the field collecting hay with my family.  I saw people 
  2   going from the village and my wife shouts: "Look at those people, 
  3   they are going", and we could see women and children and horses all 
  4   on the move. I told them: "Let's go home, something new must have 
  5   happened."  When I arrived home all in my village were ready to go 
  6   and they said: "What are you waiting for? Why  aren't you coming?  
  7   Don't you hear them say that Srebrenica fell and somebody has come 
  8   and told us to retreat, so women, children, elderly disabled should 
  9   go towards the UNPROFOR base in Potocarska Rijeka."
 10   		So with my family I entered the house.  We took the basic 
 11   necessities, some food and something, and we started around 8 o'clock 
 12   from my home.  We went down to Potocari and there on the way we saw 
 13   people sitting along the road.  We said: What's happening? Why don't 
 14   you go to the UNPROFOR compound?"  They answered: "They are not 
 15   letting us."  So with my family I spent the night on the grounds of a 
 16   factory called Mart 11th or Sacmar.  In the morning some went to 
 17   enquire what will happen, when will there be any transport, whether 
 18   there will be any transport, and they come back and say: "We no know 
 19   nothing.  We don't know who will provide the transport. You will see 
 20   when the vehicles come, then we shall take you."
 21   		So the afternoon arrived until the first vehicles came to take 
 22   people away.  So, with my family I set off towards those buses with 
 23   all those people.  This UNPROFOR had blocked the road because the 
 24   people were moving in a wide front, so they were not allowing those 
 25   people to move the whole width of the road.  They tried to narrow

  1   down the passage, so that they could enter the buses smoothly.
  2   		Passing by the UNPROFOR I saw some soldiers.  The distance 
  3   between UNPROFOR and buses was about 20 metres or so.  I saw some 
  4   soldiers also in camouflage uniforms and I saw they were all 
  5   UNPROFOR.  I could not  distinguish the clothes.  After all, I had 
  6   never seen very many of them until that time.  So I passed by this 
  7   human wall of UNPROFOR, and another man in a camouflage uniform of 
  8   UNPROFOR said: "Goran, hey, you old man", and then I realised it was 
  9   not an UNPROFOR man but a Serb soldier.  So he took me aside to the 
 10   left, towards the side of the road and there were a few more people 
 11   standing, and they kept separating.  When they separated us some 20 
 12   of us or so, they said, "Well, here, you go to a house so that you 
 13   don't stand on the road", and somebody asked: "Why are you separating 
 14   us?"  The answer was: "Well, don't ask.  You are being ordered and do 
 15   as you are told."
 16   		So we entered a house, the ground floor of the house.  The 
 17   house was still brick, I mean it was not completed.  We were there.  
 18   Then they brought another group there.  So, there were Serb soldiers 
 19   around us, on guard around us.  Then a Serb soldier said: "Do you 
 20   know Ratko Mladic?"  Some said they did know him.  He said: "Who 
 21   doesn't him will have an opportunity to meet him now."  After a short 
 22   while, and from the same direction that we approached that house, an 
 23   officer appeared in our sight and he was escorted by another three or 
 24   four soldiers.  They came to the entrance door there at the ground 
 25   floor.  He said, "Good day to you neighbours", and some answered and 

  1   said, "Good day to you."  He asked: "Do you know whom I am?" Some 
  2   were silent and some said: "Yes, we do."  He said: "I am a General of 
  3   the Serb Army, Ratko Mladic.  Those who do not know me, now have an 
  4   opportunity to see me."  Then he said: "See what  happened, what 
  5   befell your Srebrenica.  Even the NATO pact cannot save you.  All 
  6   their bombing of our forces was in vein.  They can do nothing to us. 
  7    Your Srebrenica fell today.  Tomorrow Zepa will fall.  Gorazde is 
  8   going to fall the next day and then Bihac's turn is next", and so on. 
  9    "Why have you followed Alija Izetbegovic?  Why didn't follow Fikret 
 10   Abdic?" Then I said: "I am not interested.  I could not care less 
 11   about Fikret Abdic or Alija Izetbegovic.  What we do care about is 
 12   why are you separating us from our families.  Why can't we go with 
 13   our families when we are all elderly and where we are not able-bodied 
 14   men?"  He said: "I need to separate some 180 of you because there are 
 15   so many of our Serbs in Tuzla and some 180 of them are kept captive 
 16   in Tuzla and then we shall exchange you."  So he left us and went 
 17   back the same way to the pavement.
 18   		They continued separating group by group.  Since not all men 
 19   could fit into the house, they were standing in front of the house.  
 20   Towards dusk those who were sitting in front of the house were then 
 21   ordered to stand up and start moving in front of all soldiers.  So 
 22   they got up and moved.  When they left we were then also ordered, 
 23   "Come out of the house and follow them."
 24   		So I came out and every 10 metres there was a Serb soldier 
 25   with an automatic rifle aiming at us.  He was shouting, "Quicker, 

  1   quicker, faster, faster", that is all they were saying.  So we 
  2   descended towards the top of the UNPROFOR compound.  There were two 
  3   buses there on the road.  In front of the buses there was a red 
  4   vehicle, and the last bus in the road was full of people.  So we  
  5   boarded the first bus.  Next to the first business Ratko Mladic was 
  6   standing together with those three or four men, soldiers, who 
  7   accompanying him.  So when we all boarded the bus he came closer to 
  8   the door of that bus and told the driver: "Close the door, follow the 
  9   red car and off you go."  So the driver closed the door of the bus 
 10   and the red vehicle started towards Bratunac.
 11   		The bus set off after the red vehicle and that is how we 
 12   arrived in Bratunac to a hangar.  That is where the bus stopped and 
 13   there we were met by some 10 or 15 Serb soldiers.  The door opened 
 14   and they ordered us to get off and enter the hangar.  We got off, 
 15   entered, sat down and after a little while we heard another vehicle 
 16   arriving, another group arrives.  All the same people from Potocarska 
 17   Rijeka were those who came.  So until this hangar was filled to 
 18   capacity and those Serb soldiers were at the door, they introduced 
 19   themselves. They said where they are from and said some were from 
 20   Serbian, from Valjevo, from Krupa, from Sabac, from Loznica.  Whether 
 21   they were or not I could not say, but at least that is how they 
 22   introduced themselves to us. Other were villagers from Bratunac.
 23   		So they enquired after their neighbours, Muslims who were 
 24   there: "Well, how come that you are here?  Well, are you all right?  
 25   Where is your father?  Where is your mother? Where are your 

  1   brothers?"  So I could so that they knew each other.  So this Muslim 
  2   asked them: "How are your people? Are they all right?"  So they were 
  3   engaging in these kinds of conversations.  Now when this warehouse 
  4   was full somebody on the outside said: "Twelve  of you have to go 
  5   tonight.  Well, you have been ordered. Is that clear?"  He said it in 
  6   a very harsh voice and they all in unison said, "Yes, sir".  Then the 
  7   silence fell and then with a torch lamp one came and went around us 
  8   and he asked: "Who is from Glogova?" There were a couple of people.  
  9   Then he would go again with his torch lamp around and he would pick 
 10   up one of them and would say, "You whom I have just lit with this 
 11   battery, come out then."  Then he would stand up and come out.  As he 
 12   would come out he would turn to the left from where we had come.  
 13   From there one could hear some blunt instruments how he was beaten.  
 14   Then he would start moaning, we could hear that, and then silence 
 15   would fall again.  Then he could come with the torch lamp again and 
 16   find, would light another and take him out and again we would hear 
 17   blows and we could hear moans.  When it would stop, then the next one 
 18   would come.  Some would be beaten and he would be brought in still 
 19   alive, brought by two men supporting him under his arm pits.  He 
 20   would bring him to the door and then one would shove him in the back 
 21   and throw him at us.  This person was beaten but still alive, so he 
 22   would be drawn or pulled to a corner.  That is what they did 
 23   throughout the night.  Sometimes they would make a short break and 
 24   would then go on.
 25   		So it went on until the morning.  When the day broke out 

  1   somebody said: "We don't have to keep them any longer, they're all 
  2   dead."  Then somebody said: "Well, if they are already dead, then 
  3   take them out."  So five of them are dead, some from beatings.  So 
  4   five dead people were then drawn, pulled out from that warehouse.  
  5   Then  they stopped killing and made a break.
  6   		Then we heard some vehicles, some freight vehicles, some heavy 
  7   vehicles approach the hangar.  Then a man came and said: "I need some 
  8   10 able men to do something for us."  Nobody volunteered.  He was 
  9   asking for volunteers but nobody volunteered.  Then he picked out 10 
 10   men.  He said, "You, you, you, you, you, come out."  Then went out.  
 11   Everybody was silent for a while.  All was quiet and then we heard 
 12   those vehicles starting their engines once again and leaving.  Those 
 13   10 did not return.
 14   		Then a tallish with black hair and said: "Let's see your 
 15   belongings.  What have you got?  Come up with them here." So some 
 16   people asked: "What do you want us to take off?"  They said: "All 
 17   that you've got, bags, papers, watches", and so on and so forth.  So 
 18   we all turned them over.  Then he asked for money.  He said: "Money, 
 19   all the money." "What money?"  He said: "All kinds of money, but 
 20   basically marks."  So what we had we began passing them from hand to 
 21   hand, including German marks.  When he collected all that he left.
 22   		Then they started bringing water because we had asked for 
 23   water.  Then they started bringing water to us to drink.  We asked 
 24   also to go to the loo and we also were permitted to go to the loo.  
 25   But they told us: "Listen, when you come out of this door you turn to 

  1   the right, and there is a room and that's where you go, but coming 
  2   out you have also to look to the right.  If anyone is to look 
  3   leftward he will never enter the hangar alive again.  When you come 
  4   back from the loo then you have to look leftward."  That is how they 
  5   started going out.  I also went out around 9 o'clock perhaps, and 
  6   they had already started taking people out and killing them again.  I 
  7   could hear some screaming.  When we went to the WC to the right and 
  8   then to the left they said "toilet" and that is where we went.  So as 
  9   I came out I looked to the side taking out, and I saw three or four 
 10   men standing side by side, the one in front holding an automatic 
 11   rifle and ordered:  "Come to me, come to me."  This man who was 
 12   between those two, as he was coming up a man with an iron rod hit him 
 13   on the head.  So he fell and from the right-hand side another one hit 
 14   them with an axe on the back.  This had a sharp edge and the axe hit 
 15   him and was there and he was down as a worm squirming.  I turned my 
 16   head to the left then and they went on doing that until about 4 
 17   o'clock.
 18   		Then vehicles were heard, some heavy vehicles, arriving and 
 19   then they again picked out 10 to go to do something for them.  Again 
 20   10 went out.  It was very quiet.  Then later on again those vehicles 
 21   left from that hangar.
 22   		Then Ratko Mladic appeared at the door and we all started: 
 23   "Why do you keep us here?  Why do you kill us here?  Why don't you 
 24   take us away?"  He said: "Well, we could not arrange for the exchange 
 25   to carry out.  If we could have organised the exchange so quickly all 

  1   this would not have happened.  Some of you are exchanged and now you 
  2   are going to Kalesija for exchange.  Except that one has to count you 
  3   all to see how many of you are there, so that I can provide the 
  4   transport for all of you."  One of us stood up and counted us all and 
  5   told  him: "We are 296 of us here."  He said: "Now I will provide 
  6   transport for all of you."  He left.  Then we could again hear 
  7   vehicles arriving there.  They were arriving and then one said: 
  8   "Well, come now, one by one the buses are here, so you are leaving." 
  9    So we stood up and went out of the hangar.  As we were coming out of 
 10   the hangar we could see that the concrete was wet, that it was 
 11   washed.  When I came out I saw six buses standing. So, I boarded the 
 12   bus of Centrotrans from Sarajevo.  So we all boarded buses.  There 
 13   there was also one Serb soldier in every bus standing by the driver. 
 14    The door closed and Ratko Mladic appeared on the left-hand side. 
 15   Some 10 to 15 Serb soldiers were also gathered round him, and he was 
 16   talking to them.  He was telling them something but I could not hear 
 17   what he was saying to them because we were closed in that bus.  So he 
 18   gave them some orders and then he left and we were still there in 
 19   those buses.  We asked the driver: "What are we waiting for? Why 
 20   aren't we on our way?"  He said: "I don't know. I was simply given 
 21   the orders to come here and where we are going or whatever, I don't 
 22   know."
 23   		So we waited until it was dark.  When the darkness fell the 
 24   buses set off towards Serbia towards the Drina. We reached the bridge 
 25   across the Drina, but we did not cross it.  We were moving through 

  1   Bosnia along the left bank of the Drina.  We arrived at Drinjaca and 
  2   there we were for about two hours in Drinjaca and then we continued 
  3   towards Zvornik.  We passed through Zvornik and when we arrived in 
  4   Karaka near that aluminium plant or alumina plant we turned to the 
  5   left.  For how long  I cannot say exactly.  We arrived at a school, a 
  6   gym, and there the buses stopped.  There we were met by some 15 Serb 
  7   soldiers, and we were ordered off the buses.  We did and entered the 
  8   hall.  It was empty.  There was no one there.  It was a basketball 
  9   hall.  It was a hall where basketball could be played.
 10   		We stayed there.  Then later vehicles could be heard again and 
 11   a group came in, another group of people.  When it dawned ----
 12   MR. OSTBERG:  Please, sir.  Maybe this is a new night coming in and the 
 13   next day things happen again.  I think this would be, your Honours, a 
 14   proper moment to give the witness a break and we might continue to 
 15   listen to his story tomorrow morning.  Thank you so far.
 16   THE PRESIDING JUDGE:  Yes, I think on behalf of my colleagues I could 
 17   agree with you.  So we can have a break now.  The hearing is adjourned 
 18   and we will start tomorrow at 10 o'clock.
 19   (5.55 p.m.)
 20   		  (The court adjourned until the following day)
