          2                 [Further Appearance]
          3                 [Open session]
          4                 --- Upon commencing at 9.37 a.m.
          5                 [The accused entered court]
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          7  morning.  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  I believe
          8  that the interpreters can hear me.  Good morning to the
          9  interpreters, to the technical staff.
         10            Could we have the representatives, please,
         11  for the Office of the Prosecutor.
         12            MR. HARMON:  Good morning, Mr. President.
         13  Good morning Judge Riad, Judge Wald.  My name is Mark
         14  Harmon.  I'll be representing the Prosecutor's office
         15  this morning, and I am assisted by my colleague seated
         16  to my right, Mr. Peter McCloskey.
         17            Thank you.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         19  very much, Mr. Harmon.
         20            Appearances for the Defence, please.
         21            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
         22  Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  My name is
         23  Tomislav Visnjic, and I will act as Defence counsel at
         24  the hearing today for Mr. Krstic.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you

          1  very much.
          2            Mr. Registrar, would you give us the case
          3  number, please.
          4            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] This is case
          5  IT-98-33-PT, the Prosecutor versus Radislav Krstic.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
          7  As you see, we have a new composition of Judges in this
          8  Trial Chamber.  The Trial Chamber is composed of Judge
          9  Fouad Riad to my right, Judge Wald to my left, and
         10  myself as the Presiding Judge.
         11            I would like to take advantage of this
         12  opportunity to welcome Judge Wald and to tell her how
         13  pleased we are to have her working with us.  I myself
         14  have the honour and responsibility of presiding over
         15  this Trial Chamber.
         16            We are here today for the Initial Appearance
         17  of Mr. Krstic and we will, therefore, proceed in the
         18  following manner:  Before we read out the indictment or
         19  begin with the Initial Appearance, I would first like
         20  to confirm with the Prosecutor what I have seen of the
         21  amendments made to this indictment.
         22            I believe, Mr. Harmon, that the essential
         23  part of the amendments is the addition of Counts 7 and
         24  8, that is, expulsions and inhumane acts, and then
         25  there are several other small amendments.  It seems to

          1  me that these are amendments we already spoke about
          2  when we spoke about the former indictment.  For
          3  instance, there are amendments in the wording.  Instead
          4  of saying "the Drina Corps," one now says "the other
          5  Drina Corps" or "military personnel" was changed to
          6  "military" alone.
          7            There is also the introduction of a new
          8  paragraph relating to the military structure of the VRS
          9  military forces.  This is paragraph 14 to 14.15, and
         10  after the introduction of that new paragraph, the
         11  numbering has been changed.
         12            There are a few clarifications which were
         13  added.  For instance, the military VRS was explained as
         14  the Bratunac Brigade or a member of the Zvornik
         15  Engineering Brigade, and several clarifications
         16  relating to temporal circumstances, for instance, in
         17  paragraphs 24.5 and 24.6.
         18            Mr. Harmon, is that it?  Have I seen things
         19  correctly here?
         20            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, there are some
         21  additional changes that I can point out to the Court.
         22            This document constitutes a merger of the
         23  previous updated indictment, and Your Honour has
         24  correctly appointed out that the merger is principally
         25  found in paragraph 14; however, there are some

          1  additional changes which I would like to draw your
          2  attention to.
          3            For example, in paragraph 31, the indictment
          4  has been amended to add the sentence "e" in the crime
          5  against humanity.  There has been some additional
          6  changes that are found in various counts; that is, in
          7  the predicate paragraph to each of the counts where the
          8  Prosecutor realleges and reincorporates certain other
          9  paragraphs that are contained in the indictment, we
         10  have been more inclusive than less inclusive, and we
         11  have changed, in small part, some of the other
         12  paragraphs that are referenced to support the
         13  particular counts.
         14            That constitutes essentially, Mr. President
         15  and Your Honours, the amendments to this indictment.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         17  Mr. Harmon.
         18            I would like to turn to the Defence counsel,
         19  Mr. Visnjic.  Did I pronounce your name correctly?
         20  Visnjic, is it?
         21            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Yes,
         22  Mr. President.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] And ask you
         24  whether, within this framework, you feel that we should
         25  read out the entire amended indictment or whether you

          1  believe it is sufficient to read out the new counts and
          2  to ask Mr. Krstic whether he is pleading guilty or not
          3  guilty.
          4            What is your opinion, please?
          5            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          6  I think that my client and I have agreed that only the
          7  amended counts be read.  However, before that, I would
          8  like to raise a small point.  Actually, it is of a
          9  formal nature and it consists of the following:
         10            The accused and we, as the Defence, have been
         11  served a copy of the indictment in the English language
         12  and in the language of the accused, so he has
         13  understood it fully; however, we did not receive any
         14  decision on the confirmation of the indictment, in
         15  keeping with Rule 47(F).
         16            I don't want the hearing today to be
         17  postponed in any way; I would just like the registrar
         18  to confirm this to us, whether this has been
         19  confirmed.  Is that identical to the copy we received
         20  on the 27th of October, 1999?  And could we hear which
         21  Judge confirmed it and when.
         22            Thank you.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         24  Mr. Registrar, could you answer that question?
         25            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes, Your

          1  Honour.  The indictment was confirmed but I don't have
          2  the date right with me, but as quickly as possible I'll
          3  be able to give you the date or give Mr. Visnjic the
          4  date.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          6  Mr. Prosecutor, were the amendments really confirmed by
          7  the Judge?  Are you confirming what the registrar has
          8  just said that, in fact, the amendments were
          9  confirmed.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Yes, we confirm that,
         11  Mr. President.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So,
         13  Mr. Visnjic, you will receive the decision.  The
         14  registrar has already promised that he would give you
         15  the decision which was submitted, and the indictment
         16  was confirmed in respect to its amendments.  The
         17  registrar will give you the decision as soon as
         18  possible.
         19            Can we begin?
         20            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         21  could the registrar please give us the name of the
         22  Reviewing Judge who confirmed the indictment?  I don't
         23  have to go into all the reasons, but this would be a
         24  minimal requirement.  So please could we have the
         25  name?

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          2  Mr. Registrar, could you answer Mr. Visnjic's question,
          3  please?
          4            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes, Your
          5  Honour.  It was Judge Mumba.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] If I've
          7  understood you correctly, Mr. Visnjic, you agree to our
          8  reading out only the counts which represent additions
          9  and amendments to the indictment; is that correct?
         10            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] That's correct,
         11  Your Honour.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We are
         13  going to really begin our proceedings, the formal
         14  proceedings of the initial appearance, and I will ask
         15  Mr. Krstic to rise, please.
         16            Could you stand, please, Mr. Radislav
         17  Krstic.  Could you give us your name, your first name
         18  and your last name, please?
         19            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  I am
         20  Radislav Krstic.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Would you
         22  like to state something?
         23            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         24  I would like to kindly ask you, would it be possible
         25  for Mr. Krstic to answer these questions in a seated

          1  position, because he's an invalid, disabled person.
          2  It's very difficult for him to stand on his feet.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  Of
          4  course.  Of course.  Excuse me, Mr. Krstic.  Mr.
          5  Krstic, please be seated and then answer my questions.
          6  Excuse me.
          7            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Thank you very
          8  much.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me.
         10  Let me repeat myself.  Give us your names, please, your
         11  first and last name.
         12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes.  My name
         13  is Radislav Krstic.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Could we
         15  have your date and place of birth, please?
         16            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I was born on
         17  the 15th of February, 1948 in the village of Nezerici
         18  near Vlasenica.  It's in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Your
         20  profession and domicile before you came here?
         21            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm a
         22  professional soldier.  I'm a member of the army of
         23  Republika Srpska.  I lived in Sokolac in
         24  Bosnia-Herzegovina.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Krstic,

          1  who was your Defence counsel?
          2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] My Defence
          3  counsel is Mr. Nenad Petrusic and Mr. Visnjic.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Let me take
          5  advantage of this opportunity to ask you a question
          6  about the detention conditions and your medical
          7  condition.
          8            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] When I
          9  previously appeared in court on several occasions, I
         10  talked about my health condition.  The problems are the
         11  same.  My condition is unchanged.  I still have
         12  problems with my leg and all my other health problems.
         13            As for the conditions in the detention unit,
         14  they are the same as for all others.  My cell has
         15  somewhat been accommodated to meet my needs, my
         16  condition.  I have no objections whatsoever to the
         17  conduct of the management of the detention unit.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] The
         19  treatment -- were you given the treatment that you
         20  needed, Mr. Krstic?  Are you receiving the treatment
         21  that you need?
         22            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] There is
         23  therapy but it is inadequate in terms of my condition;
         24  that is to say, that a limb was amputated.  A prison
         25  hospital does not accommodate the needs of a disabled

          1  person of this nature.  Before I came here, I was
          2  constantly under a different kind of therapy, which was
          3  far, far more efficient.  That is how these subsequent
          4  problems came into beginning; for example, the phantom
          5  pain which is sometimes unbearable.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          7  Mr. Registrar, have measures been taken since the last
          8  Status Conference at the time that Mr. Krstic raised
          9  some questions, have measures been taken?  Could you
         10  answer -- in order to meet his needs?
         11            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes,
         12  Mr. President.  During the last Status Conference, the
         13  accused mentioned certain problems and the Registry
         14  made the necessary arrangements in order to respond to
         15  his request.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Therefore,
         17  the Registry will continue to take care of his
         18  concerns.
         19            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes,
         20  Mr. President.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I must now
         22  recall the text of the Statute and of the Rules which
         23  govern the Initial Appearance.  Would you read Rules 20
         24  and 21 of the Statute, and 62 of the Rules, please.
         25            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Article 21,

          1  "The Rights of the Accused."
          2            "1.  All persons shall be equal before the
          3  International Tribunal.
          4            "2.  In the determination of charges against

          6  hearing, subject to article 22 of the Statute.
          7            "3.  The accused shall be presumed innocent
          8  until proved guilty according to the provisions of the
          9  present Statute.
         10            "4.  In the determination of any change
         11  against the accused pursuant to the present Statute,
         12  the accused shall be entitled to the following minimum
         13  guarantees, in full equality:
         14            (a)  to be informed promptly and in detail in
         15  a language which he understands of the nature and cause
         16  of the charge against him;
         17            (b)  to have adequate time and facilities for
         18  the preparation of his defence and to communicate with

         24  legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal
         25  assistance assigned to him, in any case where the

          1  interests of justice so require, and without payment by
          2  him in any such case if he does not have sufficient
          3  means to pay for it;
          4            (e)  to examine, or have examined, the
          5  witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and
          6  examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same
          7  conditions as witnesses against him;
          8            (f)  to have the free assistance of an
          9  interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the
         10  language used in International Tribunal;
         11            (g)  not to be compelled to testify against
         12  himself or to confess guilt.

         14            The Trial Chamber shall read the indictment,
         15  satisfy itself that the rights of the accused are
         16  respected, confirm that the accused understands the
         17  indictment, and instruct the accused to enter a plea.
         18  The Trial Chamber shall then set the date for trial.
         19            Rule 62 of the Rules of Procedure and
         20  Evidence, "Initial Appearance of Accused."
         21            Upon transfer of an accused to the seat of
         22  the Tribunal, the President shall forthwith assign the
         23  case to a Trial Chamber.  The accused shall be brought
         24  before that Trial Chamber without delay, and shall be
         25  formally charged.  The Trial Chamber shall:

          1            (i)  satisfy itself that the right of the
          2  accused to counsel is respected;
          3            (ii)  read or have the indictment read to the
          4  accused in a language the accused speaks and
          5  understands, and satisfy itself that the accused
          6  understands the indictment;
          7            (iii)  inform the accuse that, within thirty
          8  days of the initial appearance, he or she will be
          9  called upon to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty on
         10  each count, but that, should the accused so request, he
         11  or she may immediately enter a plea of guilty or not
         12  guilty on more than one count;
         13            (iv)  if the accused fails to enter a plea at
         14  the initial or any further appearance, enter a plea of
         15  not guilty on the accused's behalf;
         16            (v)  in the case of a plea of not guilty,
         17  instruct the Registrar to set a date for trial;
         18            (vi)  in the case of a plea of guilty, act in
         19  accordance with Rule 62 bis;
         20            (vii)  instruct the Registrar to set such
         21  other dates as appropriate.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         23  very much, Mr. Registrar.
         24            Further to the provisions which have just
         25  been read out, I will now ask the Defence, that is,

          1  Mr. Visnjic, whether the amendments to the indictment
          2  were transmitted to Mr. Krstic and whether he
          3  understood the contents thereof.
          4            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          5  the amendments have been conveyed to Mr. Krstic and he
          6  understood all the additional counts in the
          7  indictment.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Krstic,
          9  you may remain seated.  Have you understood the
         10  contents of the amended indictment and was it given to
         11  you in your own language?
         12            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Yes, I
         13  understood it and I received it in my language.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I will now
         15  ask the registrar, with the agreement of the Defence,
         16  to read only Counts 7 and 8.
         17            Isn't that correct, Mr. Visnjic?
         18            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Yes,
         19  Mr. President.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         21  Mr. Registrar, please.
         22            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Counts 7 to 8
         23  (Deportation, Inhumane Acts).
         24            The Prosecutor re-alleges and reincorporates
         25  by reference paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 11, 24.1, 24.3, 24.4

          1  through 24.6, 24.8, 24.9, and 24.11 above.
          2            Beginning on 11 July 1995 and continuing
          3  through 13 July 1995, Radislav Krstic committed,
          4  planned, instigated, ordered, or otherwise aided and
          5  abetted the planning, preparation, or execution of a
          6  crime against humanity, that is, the deportation or
          7  forcible transfer of Bosnian Muslims from the
          8  Srebrenica enclave.
          9            By his respective acts and omissions
         10  described in paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 11, 24.1, 24.3 through
         11  24.6, 24.8, 24.9, and 24.11, Radislav Krstic
         12  committed:
         13            Count 7:  Deportation, a crime against
         14  humanity, punishable under Article 5(d), and 7(1) and
         15  7(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal.
         16            Alternatively,
         17            Count 8:  Inhumane acts (forcible transfer),
         18  a crime against humanity, punishable under Article
         19  5(i), and 7(1) and 7(3) of the Statute of the
         20  Tribunal.
         21            Dated this 27th day of October, 1999, at The
         22  Hague, the Netherlands.  Signed, the Prosecutor, Carla
         23  del Ponte.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Krstic,
         25  in respect of Count 7, deportation, do you plead guilty

          1  or not guilty?
          2            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation]
          3  Mr. President --
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You may
          5  remain seated when you answer.
          6            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I'm not
          7  guilty.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Count 8,
          9  inhumane acts, do you plead guilty or not guilty?
         10            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Not guilty.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         12  Mr. Registrar, you will note the plea of not guilty by
         13  Mr. Krstic.
         14            Just one moment, please.  Excuse me, but I
         15  realised that there was an amendment in Count 6,
         16  paragraph (e), that this is new.  I may have to read
         17  out that new element, and even though it is a
         18  formality, I think we have to ask Mr. Krstic so that
         19  things are clear.
         20            I will ask the registrar to read paragraph
         21  (e) of Count 6, that is, paragraph 29 and 31(e).
         22            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Count 6
         23  (Persecutions).
         24            The Prosecutor re-alleges and reincorporates
         25  by reference paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 11, and 22 through 26

          1  above.
          2            The crime of persecutions was perpetrated,
          3  executed, and carried out by or through the following
          4  means:
          5            (e) the deportation or forcible transfer of
          6  Bosnian Muslims from the Srebrenica enclave.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Krstic,
          8  this is a new addition to the amended indictment.  In
          9  respect of this element of Count 6, do you plead guilty
         10  or not guilty to Count 6?
         11            THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Not guilty.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Will you
         13  take note of this, Mr. Registrar, that is, the plea of
         14  not guilty to Count 6.
         15            Mr. Harmon, do you have a question?
         16            MR. HARMON:  No, I don't, Mr. President, but
         17  for the sake of absolute clarity, all of the predicate
         18  paragraphs to all of the counts had minor amendments in
         19  that they incorporated other paragraphs that were
         20  contained in the body of the indictment.  So in a
         21  technical sense, there has been an amendment to each of
         22  the counts merely by reincorporating more of the
         23  paragraphs.  So for the sake of clarity and
         24  transparency, I bring that to Your Honours' attention.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] What are

          1  the counts that you are suggesting be read out?
          2            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, there was a very
          3  small change in the predicate paragraph to Counts 1 and
          4  2; similarly, to Count 3; similarly, to Counts 4 and
          5  5.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] But these
          7  are not substantial modifications, are they?
          8            MR. HARMON:  They are not.  They essentially
          9  expand, if you will, the paragraphs that are identified
         10  as supporting the particular counts.  The Defence,
         11  Mr. President, has had in the previous indictment the
         12  paragraphs that are now referred to and incorporated
         13  into this new amended indictment.  What we did was we
         14  identified paragraphs that had been inadvertently
         15  omitted in the updated indictment; we captured them and
         16  incorporated them in the predicate paragraph now to
         17  each of the counts.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] But the
         19  Defence agreed that these were not substantive changes,
         20  and that's why we proceeded as we did; otherwise, we
         21  would have to read the entire indictment.
         22            MR. HARMON:  I'm completely satisfied,
         23  Mr. President, if the Defence is satisfied, to make
         24  that representation and accept those as not being
         25  necessary to reread the whole indictment.  I'm

          1  satisfied to proceed on that basis.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Once the
          3  Defence agreed to this procedure, I would say that the
          4  essential amendments were read out, were considered,
          5  and that includes the new counts, because there are
          6  some small amendments.  But in any case, I would like
          7  to have everything to be clear and to ask Mr. Visnjic
          8  for his opinion.
          9            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         10  I agree.  We have no objections.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] All right.
         12  We have had the formal Initial Appearance of Mr. Krstic
         13  in respect of the new counts, essentially 7 and 8.  We
         14  have read out Count 6, that is, paragraph 31(e), only
         15  so that things be clearer, but I believe the essential
         16  changes are contained in Counts 7 and 8.
         17            For the time being, we must only remind the
         18  Prosecutor of the obligations pursuant to Rule 62 of
         19  the Rules, but once we have made changes of legal
         20  characterisations, but that the facts do not change, I
         21  think that was the -- there was a legal
         22  classification.  But there are, in fact, no new facts,
         23  and this is why I think that there would be no point in
         24  recalling the allegations of the Prosecutor to give all
         25  supporting material to the Defence at the time of the

          1  confirmation, that is, the amended indictment, to ask
          2  how long the Prosecutor intends to take before giving
          3  the documents.
          4            I think once there's a legal
          5  classification -- I would like to ask the question of
          6  the parties.  Taking into account the fact that we have
          7  set a date for the Status Conference of the 6th and 8th
          8  of December, I would like to hear the opinion of the
          9  parties.
         10            Mr. Prosecutor.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President and Your Honours,
         12  we have proceeded in this case by providing to the
         13  Defence massive amounts of discovery; we continue to do
         14  so.  We will provide the Defence very shortly with the
         15  materials supporting the amended indictment.  We have
         16  provided him with expert reports; we have started
         17  providing him with expert reports in January of this
         18  year.  We are providing him today with another report
         19  of an expert.  So we are having a fulsome discovery and
         20  we are prepared -- on my conversations on the last
         21  occasion with Mr. Petrusic, once the amended indictment
         22  was presented to the accused, Mr. Petrusic,
         23  Mr. Visnjic, and I agreed to sit down and discuss what
         24  are the contested issues contained within this amended
         25  indictment, and we will attempt to resolve, as

          1  expeditiously as possible, and identify for the Court
          2  the issues that will be tried in this case.
          3            I think we are proceeding at a good pace.
          4  There's cooperation at this point in time in the case
          5  between the Defence and the Prosecutor's office.  I'm
          6  satisfied that we will make significant progress and we
          7  will make progress during the Status Conference on the
          8  6th through the 8th.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         10  Mr. Visnjic, what is your opinion?
         11            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         12  I fully agree with what my colleague, Mr. Harmon, said;
         13  however, as for the specific dates, the 7th and 8th of
         14  December, are concerned, I have to place a reservation
         15  on this, in view of the indictment itself and the
         16  points that we are contesting.  I can't state my views
         17  now because Mr. Petrusic is not here, so perhaps it is
         18  from that point of view that I'm placing a reservation,
         19  so to speak, on the dates, the 7th and 8th of
         20  December.  Perhaps we are going to object, and then
         21  depending on how this objection is resolved, we're
         22  going to continue our cooperation with the Office of
         23  the Prosecutor.
         24            Thank you.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]

          1  Mr. Visnjic, I believe that you spoke about the 7th and
          2  8th of December, but I think we had set the 6th and the
          3  8th.
          4            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Yes, possibly I
          5  made a mistake.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] As regards
          7  the organisation of the work, I suggest to the parties
          8  that we keep the date of the 6th and the 8th for the
          9  Status Conference, at which point we can go into a more
         10  in-depth analysis of all these questions.  It isn't
         11  necessary to set the date for the Status Conference now
         12  because they have already been set.  We will keep those
         13  dates, that is, the 6th and the 8th of December, and we
         14  will take advantage of that opportunity in order to see
         15  where things stand, according to the indications that I
         16  was given before as the Pre-Trial Judge when we had our
         17  last Status Conference.
         18            I don't know if you are in a position to
         19  submit to me a memo with a brief answer so that I can
         20  properly prepare the Status Conference for the 6th.  My
         21  idea was that at that time, through Mr. Olivier Fourmy,
         22  I had indicated that I would like, at least eight days
         23  before the date of the 6th, to have your opinions about
         24  the proposals, which I had made to you as the Pre-Trial
         25  Judge on the last occasion.  If you could do that, it

          1  would be better in terms of the efficiency of our
          2  work.  I say eight days, or five days.  It's not really
          3  a preemptory time period, it's not absolute.  But I
          4  will wait to hear from you so we can prepare for the
          5  Status Conference on the 6th of December.
          6            I don't know whether the parties have any
          7  comments to make.
          8            Mr. Harmon.
          9            MR. HARMON:  I only note for Your Honours'
         10  purpose that I will be leaving the country and I will
         11  not be back in the country until the 2nd of December,
         12  so it makes it difficult for me to communicate with my
         13  colleague.  Mr. McCloskey can obviously deal with this
         14  issue, but I will be out of the country for a week on
         15  an unavoidable personal commitment, and therefore the
         16  memo that Your Honour receives may not be as complete,
         17  I think, because I would like to very much participate
         18  in assisting this Chamber in resolving issues at the
         19  pre-trial level, but we will direct the memo to you
         20  nevertheless.  Thank you.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         22  from the perspective of efficiency, would you prefer
         23  that we keep only the 8th of December, or can we also
         24  keep the 6th, in which case we would work with
         25  Mr. McCloskey.

          1            MR. HARMON:  I'm satisfied to maintain the
          2  6th through the 8th.  I'll be back in time to work, and
          3  I think it is going to be work trying to resolve these
          4  issues, and I want to be a participant in those
          5  issues.  So I think the 6th, the 7th, and the 8th will
          6  give us a good start on resolving issues.  Thank you.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          8  Mr. Visnjic, do you agree with that?  Do you have any
          9  final comments you would like to make?
         10            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         11  I believe that the Defence is also going to have
         12  problems with time until then, so perhaps we are going
         13  to be a bit late with our memo, or perhaps it's not
         14  going to be as extensive as it would be otherwise.
         15            I'll be here until the 2nd, I think, so I
         16  won't be seeing Mr. Petrusic until the 3rd of December,
         17  so perhaps in advance I should explain to the Court
         18  that that which you will receive will not be as
         19  extensive and as qualitative as possible had things
         20  been usual.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] No.
         22  Perhaps I should be more clear.  I don't want a
         23  five-page memo and not a hundred pages, but just a
         24  short memo rather, a short memo in answering the
         25  questions I asked during the last Status Conference.

          1  I'm not talking about a hundred-page report.  I'm just
          2  talking about a very short report in which you would
          3  say what the position of the parties is in respect of
          4  the questions that I asked during the last Status
          5  Conference.  I think that's very simple.  There are no
          6  problems.  You don't have to prepare big case files
          7  with many appendices.  It's only general indications in
          8  respect of the answers to the questions that I asked,
          9  that's all.
         10            With that clarification, I think we can close
         11  the session, and we will see one another on the 6th of
         12  December.
         13            The court stands adjourned.
