          2                 [Open session]
          3                 [The witness entered court]
          4                 --- Upon commencing at 9.40 a.m.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          6  morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Good morning,
          7  technicians, interpreters; I believe they can hear me.
          8  Yes, I can hear you too.  Good morning, counsel for the
          9  Prosecution; good morning, counsel for the Defence;
         10  good morning, General Krstic.  I gather that the
         11  appearances are the same, and we will continue in
         12  hearing the case, the Prosecutor versus General
         13  Krstic.  Mr. Cayley will resume his examination.
         14            Good morning, Witness.  Let me just remind
         15  you that you are still under oath.
         16            Mr. Cayley, you have the floor.
         17            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Good
         18  morning, Your Honours; good morning, counsel.
         19                 WITNESS: DAVID VAASEN [Resumed]
         20                 Examined by Mr. Cayley:  [Cont'd]
         21       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, we finished yesterday on the
         22  night of the 12th of July, 1995.  You will recall you
         23  gave evidence yesterday about discovering a rape of a
         24  young woman in progress.
         25            I want now to move ahead further on in that

          1  evening.  I believe you kept on patrolling in and
          2  around the areas of the factories; is that correct?
          3       A.   Yes, sir.
          4       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges what else you
          5  saw and heard that night, that night of the 12th of
          6  July?
          7       A.   Well, that night was really awful because the
          8  noise up there was very strange.  You heard shooting
          9  around; you heard people screaming.  Another time, you
         10  heard shooting and you heard just like cowboys or
         11  wolves, people making noises like that.  It was very
         12  dark, and those refugees who were there were very
         13  scared.
         14       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, the shots that you heard,
         15  were they local shots or were they shots from far
         16  away?  Could you tell?
         17       A.   Well, they came from all around.
         18       Q.   Now, you're a professional soldier and you're
         19  used to hearing shooting.  Could you actually detect at
         20  all from the sound where any of the firing was
         21  happening?
         22       A.   Well, it was also in the hills, around our UN
         23  compound.  But you couldn't see anything.
         24       Q.   You said you heard shooting and then
         25  screaming and then the sound of people howling or, I

          1  think your exact words were, "just like cowboys or
          2  wolves, people making noises like that."  At the time,
          3  what did you think was happening?
          4       A.   Well, when I heard that, I got a real strange
          5  feeling that they were hunting people.
          6       Q.   When you say "hunting people," can you expand
          7  on that?  Can you explain to the Judges what you mean
          8  by that?
          9       A.   I mean Serb people hunting Muslim people.
         10       Q.   When they were hunting them, when they found
         11  them, what did you think they were doing to them at the
         12  time?  What were your thoughts at the time?
         13       A.   Well, after that you heard shots, so they
         14  were probably basically killing those people.
         15       Q.   Now, I think you patrolled all that night.
         16  Do you recall what you were wearing --
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   -- that night?
         19       A.   I was wearing my full armour; I had my weapon
         20  with me, my helmet, my body armour, my ammunition, the
         21  standard issue for a soldier.  That's what I had.
         22       Q.   Were you wearing anything that was coloured
         23  blue?
         24       A.   Yes, there was my helmet.
         25       Q.   Your helmet was coloured blue?

          1       A.   Yes, sir.
          2       Q.   Anything else?
          3       A.   No, sir.
          4       Q.   Did that equipment remain with you all night?
          5       A.   No, sir.
          6       Q.   What happened?  Can you tell what happened to
          7  the Judges?
          8       A.   Yes.  Later that night, there were some Serb
          9  soldiers and they took some equipment from my other
         10  fellow soldiers.  Later on, they approached me and they
         11  asked me to give up my weapon, my body armour, my
         12  helmet, and I said no.  Later on, they asked again and
         13  I said, again, no.  Then there was a Serb soldier who
         14  took his AK-47, he loaded his weapon, pointed it at my
         15  head and asked me again to give up all my stuff, all my
         16  equipment, otherwise I would be shot.  So I gave him my
         17  equipment, my weapon, my body armour, everything.
         18       Q.   Did that happen to anybody else that night?
         19       A.   Almost everybody who was staying out that
         20  night.
         21       Q.   Do you remember, if you can, how many Dutch
         22  soldiers that happened to?
         23       A.   Well, about 30 people, 30 soldiers.
         24       Q.   So 30 soldiers had all of their equipment
         25  stolen --

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   -- by the Bosnian Serb army.
          3       A.   Yes, sir.
          4       Q.   Let's move on to the next day, to the 13th of
          5  July of 1995.  What did you do that day, first thing in
          6  the morning; can you recall?
          7       A.   The first thing that I did was I went back to
          8  the base to get some food, and then I went back to the
          9  human barricade.  Because I was unarmed, I tried to get
         10  a weapon on the base.  They gave me a sidearm, a
         11  pistol.  And when I went out of the base, I thought to
         12  myself that I had better leave it on the base, because
         13  if I went out, they would probably steal it again.  So
         14  I left it right in front of the gate with a colleague
         15  of mine.  So I went without weapons or anything outside
         16  again.
         17       Q.   Now, you stated you went back to the human
         18  barricade.  Can you describe to the Judges what you saw
         19  taking place from your location there that day?
         20       A.   Later that day, early in the morning, the
         21  Serb soldiers were preparing to start the
         22  transportation again.  The buses and the trucks came,
         23  and the whole thing started all over again, the same as
         24  the day before.
         25       Q.   When you say "to start the transportation

          1  again," can you explain to the Judges what you mean by
          2  that?
          3       A.   I mean by that taking the women and children
          4  away, separating the men from the women again and
          5  children.  That's what happened.
          6       Q.   Now, when you compared the speed of the
          7  process that was happening on the 13th of July,
          8  compared to the 12th of July, which was faster?  Was it
          9  faster on the 12th or on the 13th, or was it the same
         10  speed?
         11       A.   No, on the 13th, it was faster.  They rushed
         12  through the whole thing.
         13       Q.   Now, did you see any VRS, members of the
         14  Bosnian Serb army, that you recognised that day?
         15       A.   Yes.  I showed yesterday a picture of a man
         16  who was sitting next to General Mladic, that man was
         17  also there.
         18            MR. CAYLEY:  For the sake of the record, if
         19  the witness could just be shown tab 11, which is
         20  Exhibit 28/13, 13.1, so that we can just be sure of
         21  that individual.
         22       Q.   We'll carry on so as not to waste any time.
         23  You were standing at a location, the human barricade,
         24  you said yesterday, very close to the White House.  Did
         25  you look over to the White House at all that day?

          1       A.   Yes, sir.
          2       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what you saw?
          3       A.   Well, they also rushed out the men, so all
          4  the men had to stay at the White House.  Some of them
          5  went also back inside the White House, Muslim
          6  soldiers -- Muslim men with Serb soldiers.  Some of
          7  them came out also beaten up, scars on their face,
          8  bruises on their face, on their arms.  But it was as
          9  extreme as the day before.
         10       Q.   Do you remember anything significant that you
         11  saw that day by the White House?  Did you hear anything
         12  by the White House that was significant that day?
         13       A.   Yes.  They took somebody outside, took him
         14  around behind the White House, two Serb soldiers who
         15  took a Muslim man outside the building, the White
         16  House, took him behind the White House.  Then I heard
         17  one single shot, and only those two Serb soldiers came
         18  back.
         19       Q.   If you could just look at the photograph
         20  that's on the ELMO next to you.  If the witness could
         21  be shown that photograph very quickly.  You mentioned a
         22  moment ago that that morning, the 13th of July, you saw
         23  a VRS officer, and I think you identified this
         24  gentleman yesterday.  Is this the same individual that
         25  you saw on the 13th?

          1       A.   This is the man [indicates].
          2       Q.   So that's Exhibit 13.1, and it's the
          3  individual on the right-hand side of General Mladic.
          4            Now, in terms of transportation of
          5  individuals, and you said you saw the transportation
          6  continuing on the 13th, was it only women and children
          7  that were transported on that day, or men, women, and
          8  children?  Do you recall?
          9       A.   Well, they took some buses from the normal
         10  transportation.  They took one or sometimes two buses.
         11  They drove to the White House, they put the men inside,
         12  and they drove away.  And about 15, 20 minutes later,
         13  they came back.
         14       Q.   When they came back, were the buses still
         15  full or were they empty?
         16       A.   No, they were empty.
         17       Q.   Now, do you recall what direction the buses
         18  drove in?
         19       A.   They went to Bratunac.
         20       Q.   Now, you saw these buses moving towards
         21  Bratunac, and you say that they came back 15 to 20
         22  minutes later.  Did you make any conclusion at the time
         23  about where those buses had been and stopped and
         24  dropped off the men and then returned from?
         25       A.   Well, I had the feeling that they were

          1  dropped off in Bratunac.
          2       Q.   Do you recall how many times that day that
          3  process took place?  And now I'm talking about the
          4  movement of men from Potocari by bus.  Do you recall
          5  how many busloads?
          6       A.   Not exactly.  I saw it a couple of times.
          7       Q.   When you say "a couple of times," do you mean
          8  more than twice, more than three times?
          9       A.   No.  More than three times, yes.
         10       Q.   But you can't recall now exactly how many?
         11       A.   No, sir.
         12       Q.   Do you recall approximately what time that
         13  day the transportation process stopped?
         14       A.   It was already in the evening, it was about
         15  9.00, 9.30.
         16       Q.   Would it be right to say that by that stage,
         17  there were no refugees, men, women or children, left in
         18  the Potocari area?
         19       A.   Well, I didn't see anybody anymore, no.
         20       Q.   Let's move to the next day, which is the 14th
         21  of July, 1995, and I think on that day you were
         22  assigned to go to Srebrenica to collect Dutch military
         23  equipment from the B Company compound.  Do you recall
         24  that?
         25       A.   Yes, sir.

          1       Q.   Can you tell the Judges about that journey
          2  from Potocari to Srebrenica?
          3       A.   Well, we had a new assignment that morning,
          4  to escort some soldiers from the B Company back to
          5  their own compound, to get their military stuff,
          6  equipment.  So we drove with them, and I saw some
          7  horrible things on the way back.
          8       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges what you saw
          9  on the road to Srebrenica?
         10       A.   It was -- I saw many bodies.  It started
         11  about 500, 600 metres, when we went out of the gate.
         12  To the left and right of the road, we saw dead people.
         13  They were already blue and purple because of the heat
         14  the day before.  Some of them were -- just died from
         15  dehydration, and some of them were also shot, you could
         16  see that.  That was a real awful face.
         17       Q.   Do you recall how many bodies you saw 500 to
         18  600 metres from the UN compound?
         19       A.   Well, it started with sometimes two,
         20  sometimes four, and the further we approached
         21  Srebrenica, the number of that went larger and larger.
         22       Q.   Do you remember how those bodies were
         23  dressed?  Were they in military clothing or in civilian
         24  clothing?
         25       A.   No, they were dressed in civilian clothes.

          1       Q.   Were they men only, or were they a mixture of
          2  men, women, and children?  Do you recall?  Do you have
          3  any recollection?
          4       A.   Well, most of them were older people.  Until
          5  we approached Srebrenica, we also found men, women,
          6  children, everything.
          7       Q.   So the bodies, as you were on the road to
          8  Srebrenica, were mostly older people.
          9       A.   Yes, sir.
         10       Q.   And as you approached Srebrenica, you say you
         11  found men, women, and children who were dead.
         12            I now just want to take to you the scene that
         13  you saw when you got into the centre of Srebrenica.
         14  Can you describe to the Judges what you saw when you
         15  got into the centre of town, near to where Bravo
         16  Company's compound was located?
         17       A.   When we approached the centre of Srebrenica,
         18  we call it the blackmarket, the Muslim people had their
         19  own blackmarket, it was full of bodies, body parts,
         20  lying on each other.  They were also blue, purple.
         21  Most of them were totally -- I'm sorry.  The face of it
         22  was not so good.
         23       Q.   Do you recall approximately how many bodies
         24  you saw in the centre of town?
         25       A.   About 40, 50 people.

          1       Q.   And, again, how were those bodies dressed, if
          2  you recall?
          3       A.   In civilian.
          4       Q.   And do you recall the sex of those bodies?
          5  Were they a mixture of men and women and children, or
          6  were they --
          7       A.   Most of them were women and children, some of
          8  them were older people, I saw also a few men.
          9       Q.   Now, after you'd collected the equipment from
         10  B Company, where did you go next?
         11       A.   We went back to the UN base in Potocari, and
         12  when we came back, they told us that we had to leave
         13  also as soon as possible.
         14       Q.   Do you recall when you left?
         15       A.   No, I'm sorry.  I forgot.
         16       Q.   How long after the 14th?  Was it a week or
         17  two weeks, approximately, or a few days?
         18       A.   Approximately a week.
         19       Q.   So approximately a week after the 14th --
         20       A.   Yes, sir.
         21       Q.   -- you left Potocari.  And where did you go
         22  after Potocari?
         23       A.   Well, we were the last group who went out
         24  because we had an agreement that we had -- that we
         25  could take our APCs, armoured personnel carriers, with

          1  us, and those groups were the last ones to leave the
          2  enclave, and that was no problem.  And when we
          3  approached the iron bridge, we stopped because we
          4  couldn't drive any longer with those APCs because they
          5  thought that we were doing some action against the Serb
          6  army.  The only thing we wanted was to go home.
          7       Q.   When you're talking about the iron bridge,
          8  you're talking about the bridge over the River Drina
          9  into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
         10       A.   Yes, sir.
         11       Q.   Well, to cut a long story short, I think you
         12  eventually made your way back through the Federal
         13  Republic, in to Croatia, and then to Zagreb; is that
         14  right?
         15       A.   Yes, sir.
         16       Q.   Then you flew back to the Netherlands?
         17       A.   Yes, sir.
         18       Q.   Finally, Corporal Vaasen, I mean, it's clear
         19  from your testimony that you were deeply affected by
         20  these terrible things that you saw, and I just would
         21  like to ask you if you could share with the Judges how
         22  you felt when you immediately got back home to your
         23  family and how you now deal with these images five
         24  years later.
         25       A.   Well, when I arrived at the airport in

          1  Holland, at Soesterberg, I was very happy in the first
          2  place that I was home, because I saw my family, my
          3  girlfriend back.  And later on that day, when I was
          4  home sitting with my parents, and everybody was gone,
          5  my relatives and friends and everybody, you start
          6  thinking about what you saw there.  And gladly I had
          7  some support of my father, because he's also a
          8  professional soldier, and I started to cry.  Later on,
          9  I totally freaked out, started to throw things through
         10  the house.  Even my own girlfriend couldn't understand
         11  what was going on up there.  And now, these days, I
         12  don't sleep that well.  Some days I do, some days I
         13  don't.  Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night,
         14  totally in a sweat.  And every time when I'm alone at
         15  home, I always think about what I saw up there.
         16  Sometimes I always speak with my colleagues, who also
         17  went up there, because the help you get here in
         18  Holland, well, they offer it, but it's not something
         19  you can put behind your back and forget.
         20       Q.   Thank you very much, Corporal Vaasen.
         21            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I have no further
         22  questions for the witness.  I can now offer him to the
         23  Defence for cross-examination.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         25  Mr. Cayley.
          1            Now, Corporal Vaasen, you will answer
          2  questions that will be -- that the Defence will ask
          3  you, but perhaps you would like a break.  Are you
          4  ready?  Do you wish a moment to recuperate, to regain
          5  your strength, or would you rather proceed with the
          6  cross-examination immediately?
          7            THE WITNESS:  I would like to proceed, Your
          8  Honour.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         10  At any rate here, take your time, if need be.
         11            Mr. Petrusic, I believe it is you who will
         12  conduct the cross-examination.  You have the floor.
         13            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
         14  Your Honour, my learned friends from the Prosecution.
         15                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         16       Q.   Good morning, Corporal Vaasen.  Before you
         17  arrived in the protected area in January 1995, you
         18  underwent special training here in the Netherlands,
         19  didn't you?
         20       A.   Yes, sir.
         21       Q.   And were you told then what formation of the
         22  army of the Republika Srpska was active, was present,
         23  in the territory where you were to be posted, that is,
         24  in Srebrenica?
         25       A.   Yes.  They told me of all the Serb units.

          1       Q.   But were you specifically told which Bosnian
          2  Serb army formation was holding that territory?
          3       A.   Well, first of all, we had training here in
          4  Holland, they showed those badges, and we also carried
          5  a small handpocket, a book, that if we saw Serb units
          6  who we couldn't identify, we could look it up in the
          7  book, and we always found it back.
          8            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          9  I'm sorry, but I need to go back to this question
         10  specifically.
         11       Q.   Was it said, were you told, which formation
         12  of the Bosnian Serb army was holding the territory at
         13  that time.
         14       A.   No, sir.  They didn't tell us.
         15       Q.   Were you informed about the existence of the
         16  Muslim units in that territory?
         17       A.   Yes, sir.  Later on, when we were in the
         18  enclave, we were informed that there was an 82nd Muslim
         19  Brigade, and there were also other units in the
         20  mountains who were under the command of a local
         21  commander.
         22       Q.   As part of the 82nd Brigade, is it?
         23       A.   Yes, sir.
         24       Q.   Would you know the name of the local
         25  commander of the 82nd Brigade?

          1       A.   Well, I only knew the name of the local
          2  commander where I was stationed at, at that location.
          3       Q.   Are you quite sure that it was the 82nd
          4  Brigade, or perhaps could it be some other unit?
          5       A.   No, sir, because we -- every time when we
          6  went on patrol, we also stopped Muslim soldiers who
          7  carried weapons.  We disarmed them, asked them which
          8  unit they were and why we had to take their weapons.
          9       Q.   When you arrived in your area of
         10  responsibility, were you aware that the area had been
         11  demilitarised?
         12       A.   Well, that was the meaning.
         13       Q.   So it was not demilitarised then.
         14       A.   Well, it was demilitarised, but it was very
         15  hard for us to find all the weapons of them.
         16       Q.   You, that is, your unit, how did you treat
         17  armed Muslim formations?  What was your attitude to
         18  them?
         19       A.   We had our standard, normal procedure.  We
         20  stopped them.  When they tried to run away, we went
         21  after them.  And it's just like in a police arrest; we
         22  disarmed them, we searched them.  After that, we take
         23  every weapon, ammunition, other kind of weapons that
         24  they carry, and later on they picked it up from the UN
         25  base and went to a barricade in Srebrenica.

          1       Q.   I didn't quite understand.  You said that
          2  later on they picked it up and went to a barricade in
          3  Srebrenica.  I don't really understand what you mean.
          4  What barricade?
          5       A.   I mean they had a weapon depot in Srebrenica,
          6  the UN soldiers, they had a weapon depot up there, so
          7  there were UN soldiers picking those weapons up, what
          8  we took away from the Muslim soldiers, and those
          9  soldiers, the UN soldiers, took those weapons to the
         10  weapon depot in Srebrenica.
         11       Q.   But Corporal Vaasen, during your stay there,
         12  or rather when -- during your stay there, how often did
         13  it happen, how many times did you have to request that
         14  they lay down their weapons?
         15       A.   Not many times.
         16       Q.   Could you be more specific, please?  Once?
         17  Twice?
         18       A.   My experience was only two times.
         19       Q.   You were at the observation point "M," OP-M.
         20       A.   Yes, sir.
         21       Q.   Beyond that OP, were there any fortified
         22  Muslim positions?
         23       A.   Not that I can recall.
         24       Q.   You told us about Captain Enwer yesterday, in
         25  yesterday's testimony.

          1       A.   Yes, sir.
          2       Q.   Was he a man from the area, from the village
          3  of Jaglici perhaps?
          4       A.   Yes, he was one of the people who lived in
          5  the village Jaglici.
          6       Q.   And the formations under his command were in
          7  that village, weren't they?
          8       A.   Yes, sir.
          9       Q.   Did they have their own positions?
         10       A.   No.  They always lived in the village, and
         11  sometimes they went up to look at us.
         12       Q.   This Captain Enwer was an officer.  Could you
         13  tell us what was the formation that was under his
         14  command?
         15       A.   Well, it was a local unit.  It was not so
         16  big; it was about approximately 15 or 20 men.
         17       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, you are a soldier, a
         18  professional soldier.  Do you think that a unit of 15
         19  to 20 people, to be commanded by a captain -- after
         20  all, a captain is a relatively high rank in every
         21  army -- so don't you think that to have a captain
         22  command such a small unit, which is not larger than a
         23  platoon, perhaps, that it is not too much, to have a
         24  captain?
         25       A.   Well, I don't know how they work in the

          1  Muslim army, so I can't answer that.
          2       Q.   Do you have any knowledge that on the 10th of
          3  July, in the vicinity of your OP, there was an armed
          4  clash between the members of the Muslim army
          5  themselves?
          6       A.   That was later on, when they started to
          7  attack the enclave.
          8       Q.   But the attack on the enclave began on the
          9  6th of July, didn't it?
         10       A.   Yes.
         11       Q.   So the 10th of July came later, and I asked
         12  you if it was the 10th of July or perhaps some other
         13  date.
         14       A.   I don't remember it anymore.
         15       Q.   Would you know why did this clash break out
         16  between the Muslim soldiers?  Do you know the reason
         17  for it?
         18       A.   Well, the only experience I had between those
         19  groups was only when I was captured in Jaglici.
         20       Q.   Were there any fatalities in that
         21  confrontation?
         22       A.   Yes, sir.
         23       Q.   Was there any pressure brought on you and
         24  your colleagues by Muslim commanders to take their
         25  families towards the base in Potocari?

          1       A.   No, there was no force.  We had an agreement
          2  with Captain Enwer, and we took those women and
          3  children back to the base with us.
          4       Q.   And some members of the Muslim army wanted to
          5  stay in Jaglici.
          6       A.   Yes, sir.
          7       Q.   Yesterday, you testified that there were
          8  several hundred Muslim soldiers in Jaglici.
          9       A.   No, not in Jaglici.  It was around the area.
         10       Q.   I apologise.  Lehovici.
         11       A.   Yes, sir.
         12       Q.   Several hundred.  Could you be more specific?
         13       A.   Well, I can't give you any numbers.  I'm
         14  sorry.
         15            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         16  I should like to show this witness his statement of the
         17  11th and 18th of November, 1999, which he gave to the
         18  investigators of the International Tribunal.
         19            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] This will be
         20  Exhibit D5.
         21            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         22       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, is this your signature on
         23  the first page?
         24       A.   Yes, sir.
         25       Q.   And this is your statement?

          1       A.   Yes, sir.
          2       Q.   On page 2, in the fifth paragraph on that
          3  page, fifth paragraph from the top, the fourth sentence
          4  says:  "I saw 1.000 to 1.500 Muslim soldiers near the
          5  village called Lehovici who were walking in the
          6  northerly direction."
          7       A.   Yes, sir.
          8       Q.   So is that the figure, the number of soldiers
          9  that you can't remember today?
         10       A.   Yes, sir.
         11       Q.   In your testimony yesterday, you said that
         12  Muslims gathered in Jaglici and that they were short of
         13  ammunition.
         14       A.   Yes, sir.
         15       Q.   You knew about that?
         16       A.   I didn't know.
         17       Q.   I don't understand.  You did not know whether
         18  they had enough ammunition?
         19       A.   When we were captured, then they told us
         20  about their weapons, their ammunition, and how much
         21  they had.
         22       Q.   Your platoon was held in captivity for three
         23  days, was it?
         24       A.   We were six members, and we were there for
         25  three days.

          1       Q.   And why were you captured?
          2       A.   It's the same thing that I said yesterday,
          3  because we were UN and, first of all, we were there for
          4  their protection, and also as a kind of shield.
          5       Q.   Would you know -- were you aware of some
          6  other cases of the capture of UN members by Muslim
          7  forces?
          8       A.   I don't know.
          9       Q.   When your OP was shelled, or rather when fire
         10  was opened on your OP, were there any -- did you suffer
         11  any casualties?
         12       A.   No, we didn't.
         13       Q.   And was your OP damaged in any way, that is,
         14  directly hit by a shell?
         15       A.   Yes, our OP was damaged.  The first shell of
         16  the mortar, it came in the defence wall of our OP.
         17       Q.   When you set off from Jaglici to Potocari,
         18  with the local population fleeing, could you tell us
         19  how many people were there all in all, that is, women,
         20  children, and everybody all told?  How many?
         21       A.   Well, we started with a small -- large
         22  group -- a small group, and the further we got to
         23  Potocari, the bigger the group went.  And later, we had
         24  some 900 or 1.000 [Realtime transcript read in error
         25  "9.000"] people with us, maybe more.

          1       Q.   So on your way between Jaglici and Potocari,
          2  you were being joined by more people, so that there
          3  were 900, 1.000 people.
          4       A.   Yes, and maybe more.
          5       Q.   Can you tell us how many men were among them?
          6       A.   Not many men.  Most of them were old.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me.  In the transcript,
          8  it said that there were 9.000 people with you.  You
          9  didn't say 9.000.
         10            [Realtime transcript read in error "JUDGE
         11            RODRIGUES:"]
         12            THE WITNESS:  No, I didn't say 9.000.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Then it has to be corrected in
         14  the transcript.  Thank you.
         15            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         16       Q.   On the 11th, you arrived in Potocari
         17  sometime, in some hour of the night, didn't you?
         18       A.   Yes, sir.
         19       Q.   On the night between the 11th and the 12th of
         20  July, did you then know anything, have any information
         21  about the situation in the base and outside it?
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me.
         23  I have to interrupt you.  It has to be corrected here
         24  because Judge Riad was the one who intervened, not
         25  Judge Rodrigues.

          1            Yes, you may continue, Mr. Petrusic.
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          3  Mr. President.
          4       Q.   Right.  So we've arrived at the 12th of July
          5  now, and I think I was not answered my previous
          6  question, I'm afraid, and that is, the night between
          7  the 11th and the 12th of the July, my question was
          8  whether the witness had any information about that
          9  night within and around the compound.
         10       A.   No, sir.
         11       Q.   On the 12th of July, when you came on duty or
         12  when you started your day's work, you saw Serb
         13  soldiers.
         14       A.   I don't know.
         15       Q.   Was it the first time that on the 12th of
         16  July you spotted Serb soldiers in that area?
         17       A.   Well, they came later.
         18       Q.   When did they arrive?
         19       A.   They arrived about, well, 3.00.
         20       Q.   You testified yesterday that you had spotted
         21  Arkan's Tigers there.
         22       A.   Yes, sir.  When the Serb army entered the
         23  enclave, there were also Arkan's Tigers.
         24       Q.   They had a typical insignia.
         25       A.   Yes, sir.

          1       Q.   With the following words, "Arkan's Tigers"
          2  written on it; am I right?
          3       A.   That's what they told me.
          4       Q.   In addition to Arkan's Tigers, you testified
          5  that there were also the Drina Wolves who were there.
          6  Can you tell us anything about other soldiers?  Judging
          7  by their insignia, were they any different from these
          8  two formations?
          9       A.   Yes, sir, because the Drina Wolves had a
         10  badge with a wolf and there were also regular soldiers,
         11  and they had regular badges.
         12       Q.   What do you mean by "regular badges"?
         13       A.   Well, we searched in our pocketbook, and it
         14  was a normal sign.
         15       Q.   Could you be more precise?
         16       A.   Well, the Arkan's Tigers -- excuse me, the --
         17       Q.   Excuse me.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I'm
         18  not referring to Arkan's Tigers or the Drina Wolves
         19  here.  I'm interested in other soldiers belonging to
         20  other units.  Could you be more precise as to the badge
         21  they were wearing?
         22       A.   Yes.  It was some kind of crown, and there
         23  were also the letters "HVO" on it.
         24       Q.   What about the soldiers that came in with
         25  dogs?  Did you notice their badges?

          1       A.   No, sir.
          2       Q.   Were there any police units, uniformed police
          3  units there?
          4       A.   I don't remember.
          5       Q.   Yesterday you stated in evidence that the two
          6  formations we mentioned went from house to house,
          7  looting them, taking property away, and so on and so
          8  forth.
          9            MR. CAYLEY:  Objection, Mr. President.  I
         10  recall that's not what the witness said yesterday, and
         11  I think it should be clear both for the purposes of the
         12  record and the witness.  The witness actually said
         13  yesterday, and I have it written in my notes, I recall
         14  from my notes, that it was the Drina Wolves who were
         15  actually clearing houses above the road.  I think the
         16  witness can clarify that for the Court, but I do not
         17  believe he said that Arkan's Tigers were clearing
         18  houses above the road.  But I think the witness can
         19  probably answer that question.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         21  Mr. Petrusic, how do you respond to this objection by
         22  Mr. Cayley?
         23            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Just a second,
         24  Your Honour.  Let me check it in my notes.  I should
         25  need probably more time for checking the record.  But I

          1  believe that Mr. Cayley is right.  Yes.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          3  Mr. Petrusic.
          4            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] In any case,
          5  we can solve this dilemma with a question.
          6       Q.   So was it only the Drina Wolves who looted
          7  the houses, or were there any other units in the area
          8  as well.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         10  Mr. Petrusic, you can ask that question of the
         11  witness.  He was referring to Drina Wolves.  You can
         12  also ask him whether there was any other formations as
         13  well.
         14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes.
         15       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, were there any other units
         16  looting those houses?
         17       A.   Not that I can recall anymore.
         18       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, those units, that is, the
         19  soldiers from those units, threw incendiary bullets and
         20  grenades in those houses.
         21       A.   Not all of the houses.
         22       Q.   You're a professional soldier and I'm a
         23  layperson in that respect, but I do have some knowledge
         24  about it.  As far as I know, when you throw an
         25  incendiary grenade, the whole area catches fire.  In

          1  this case, it would be the whole house.
          2       A.   Yes, sir.
          3       Q.   You stated yesterday, while you were shown
          4  Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/19, I should like to show you
          5  the same exhibit again, the same document, 5/19, and
          6  5/5.
          7            Mr. Vaasen, are these the houses that were
          8  broken into by Serb soldiers at the time?
          9       A.   Yes, sir.
         10       Q.   I think we can conclude that there is not a
         11  single burnt house here, in this particular area.
         12       A.   That is correct, but I don't know how old the
         13  picture is.
         14       Q.   This picture is a Prosecutor's Exhibit, and
         15  as far as I can tell, it was taken on the 7th of June,
         16  1996.
         17       A.   It's possible.
         18            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Could you
         19  please put Exhibit 5/5 on the ELMO, please.
         20       Q.   We have a broader picture of the area on this
         21  exhibit, but the locality is the same.  We can once
         22  again conclude that there are no burnt houses on this
         23  photograph.  Is that correct, Mr. Vaasen?  Would you
         24  agree with me?
         25       A.   That is correct, sir, but I don't know how

          1  old this picture is.
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] The Defence
          3  doesn't know either.
          4            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, if I can perhaps
          5  clarify a few matters.
          6            We're going to find out the exact dates.  I
          7  do know that 5/5 is a helicopter shot that was taken
          8  long, long, long after these events.  Mr. Petrusic, I'm
          9  sure, will also recall that when Mr. Ruez was
         10  testifying, he stated that in a number of these
         11  photographs that were taken where there is a date in
         12  the bottom right-hand corner, that they couldn't
         13  operate the date switches on the camera, and so that
         14  date may also be wrong.  And although this witness
         15  cannot testify, Mr. Petrusic, I'm sure, is also well
         16  aware that many buildings were rebuilt in all areas of
         17  Bosnia long after the events with which we're
         18  discussing have taken place.
         19            So for the purposes of the record, these are
         20  not contemporary photographs that were taken
         21  immediately -- at the time of the event or immediately
         22  thereafter, and I will find out from my colleagues the
         23  exact date when these photographs were taken.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         25  thank you, Mr. Cayley.  We are not going to open a

          1  debate here.  We're just hearing the evidence at this
          2  moment.  The witness is merely answering questions.
          3  But be that as it may, the Chamber is grateful for this
          4  clarification from you, Mr. Cayley.  There will be
          5  questions by the Judges as well with the purpose of
          6  elucidating the matter, this one and others.  Thank you
          7  very much, Mr. Cayley.
          8            Mr. Petrusic, you may continue.
          9            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         10  Mr. President.
         11       Q.   Mr. Vaasen, speaking of the houses, the ones
         12  that we have just seen on the ELMO, I should like to
         13  know whether you saw any civilians on that day, that
         14  is, before the incursion of Serb soldiers?
         15       A.   No, sir.
         16       Q.   Thank you.  You told us that you had seen
         17  Serb soldiers looting the houses, and you also said
         18  that they were shooting and that you saw them taking
         19  drugs, if I'm correct in understanding your evidence.
         20       A.   Yes, sir.
         21       Q.   Could you explain that to us a little bit?
         22  Maybe the information I have is somewhat different.
         23  Could you explain this particular situation to us?
         24  They were breaking into these houses, they were
         25  shooting, they were taking drugs, everything at the

          1  same time, or ...
          2       A.   No, not at the same time.  It was very
          3  clearly that the men who went inside, they came out
          4  with typewriters, telephones, and other stuff, I said
          5  that already yesterday, and they also -- I saw them
          6  take a lot of alcohol, we call it slivovitz.  They also
          7  offered that to some of us; we refused it.  Sometimes
          8  they took a break and started to drink and sniff
          9  cocaine.
         10       Q.   And you were there, in their immediate
         11  vicinity?
         12       A.   Yes, sir.  Our orders were to observe them.
         13       Q.   Did you have any orders to prevent them from
         14  engaging in these types of activities?
         15       A.   No, we didn't have any order like that.
         16       Q.   You testified that there had been several
         17  wounded persons to whom you offered assistance when
         18  Serb soldiers started shooting on the refugees, first
         19  of all, above their heads and then on them, and you
         20  told us that they sustained injuries on their limbs.
         21       A.   I saw two female persons; one of them was
         22  shot in the leg and the other one was also shot in the
         23  leg and in the stomach.
         24       Q.   At the UN base, there were some wounded
         25  people.

          1       A.   Yes, sir.
          2       Q.   Did you perhaps suggest or do something about
          3  the transport of these wounded persons to the base?
          4       A.   No, sir.
          5            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          6  I think this is a convenient moment for a break.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          8  very much, Mr. Petrusic, for this suggestion.  We are
          9  now going to have a 20-minute break.
         10                 --- Recess taken at 10.49 a.m.
         11                 --- On resuming at 11.15 a.m.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         13  Mr. Petrusic, you may continue.
         14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         15       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, before the evacuation of
         16  refugees from Potocari began, could you tell us how
         17  many people were there, in your estimate?
         18       A.   When I returned to the UN compound, you
         19  mean?
         20       Q.   You return to the base on the 11th of July.
         21  So the evacuation started on the 12th of July, sometime
         22  in the afternoon.  And at that time, before the
         23  evacuation.
         24       A.   There were many people, thousands of them.
         25       Q.   Could you tell us how many men were there?  I

          1  mean, between the ages of 18 onward.
          2       A.   I don't know anymore.
          3       Q.   Could you tell us how many men were separated
          4  and taken to the White House, according to your
          5  knowledge?
          6       A.   I don't recall it anymore.
          7       Q.   On the 12th and the 13th of July, General
          8  Mladic visited that area, didn't he?
          9       A.   He arrived at -- actually, I saw him on the
         10  12th of July, yes.
         11       Q.   Did you see him on the 13th as well?
         12       A.   I don't know anymore.
         13       Q.   And the officer that was shown on that
         14  photograph yesterday and the day before yesterday, that
         15  was Exhibit 28/13, so the officer sitting to the left
         16  of General Mladic, we see it on the ELMO --
         17       A.   Yes, sir.
         18       Q.   -- did you also see him on the 12th and the
         19  13th of July?
         20       A.   Both days.
         21       Q.   Could you tell us whether your impression was
         22  that, in the absence of General Mladic, it was this
         23  man, this officer, who played the main role, who had
         24  the main say in that area?
         25       A.   Yes, sir.

          1            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          2  I'm about to finish, but before I do so, I should like
          3  to go back to the incident of the 12th of July, in the
          4  evening, that is, the rape, as described by the
          5  witness, the rape which took place behind the factory
          6  compound.
          7       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, you're also a medical
          8  worker, you're a paramedic, aren't you?
          9       A.   Yes, sir.
         10       Q.   And it was dark, but when you switched on the
         11  lamp, then you saw bruises on her thighs.
         12       A.   Yes, sir.
         13       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, do you -- would you think
         14  that, from a medical point of view, some time must
         15  elapse between receiving a blow until the emergence of
         16  a bruise?
         17       A.   I don't understand.
         18       Q.   Well, if one concludes that that girl was
         19  beaten, that she suffered a blow on her thighs, don't
         20  you think that there is a certain time lag between the
         21  blow and the bruise?
         22       A.   Well, if you hit somebody or forced somebody
         23  to do things, then actually it started real fast, the
         24  blue things on her legs, the bruises.
         25       Q.   Corporal Vaasen, how many hanged men did you

          1  see?
          2       A.   Well, there were two persons; one was lying
          3  on the girl and the other was standing guard.
          4       Q.   My question was about men who had hanged
          5  themselves.
          6       A.   In the factory, yes, I saw a couple of men,
          7  yes, who had hanged themselves.
          8       Q.   Could you be more specific?
          9       A.   Well, I saw three or four men hanging there.
         10       Q.   When the evacuation began, the men were being
         11  separated on the basis of some criterion.  Was it age?
         12       A.   Well, they started about the age of 16, 17
         13  years old.
         14       Q.   And the others boarded the buses.
         15       A.   Yes.  The men who got separated got boarded
         16  on the buses.
         17       Q.   Do you know how many convoys were escorted by
         18  members of UN forces?
         19       A.   I don't know.
         20       Q.   And to conclude, Corporal Vaasen, on the 14th
         21  of July, when you went to Srebrenica, who were you with
         22  on that occasion?  Could you tell us?
         23       A.   Yes.  We were mixed up with B Company, and I
         24  don't know those soldiers by name.
         25       Q.   Thank you, Corporal Vaasen.  I have no more
          1  questions.
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          3  Your Honours.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          5  Mr. Petrusic.
          6            Mr. Cayley.
          7            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I have no
          8  questions for the witness.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         10  Mr. Cayley.
         11            Judge Riad.
         12                 Questioned by the Court:
         13            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Yes,
         14  Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. President.
         15            [In English] Corporal Vaasen, good morning.
         16       A.   Good morning.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Do you hear me?
         18       A.   Yes, I hear you.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  I have a few questions to
         20  clarify some points, although you have been quite
         21  clear.  You mentioned that on the 12th of July, you saw
         22  the Serb army, I'm almost quoting you, coming from
         23  Bratunac, heavily armed with RPGs, with anti-tank
         24  weapons, with Russian-type tanks.  Is this a Serb army
         25  or a Bosnian Serb army?  What kind of army was it?

          1       A.   Well, they had the marks -- the badges from
          2  the HVO, and the soldiers who were walking in front of
          3  them were Arkan's Tigers.
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  Arkan's Tigers.
          5       A.   Yes, sir.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  And was it -- you said it was
          7  quite a substantial power, a substantial force.  Was
          8  there a situation -- did the situation require such a
          9  force?  Was there a real battle there?  Were the
         10  Bosnian forces equivalent to have all this military
         11  force?
         12       A.   No, Your Honour.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  It was not.
         14       A.   No.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Now that you mentioned the
         16  Arkan's Tigers, you seem to be quite acquainted with
         17  the insignias, you can know the insignia of the Arkan
         18  Tigers, you know the insignia of the Drina Wolves, as
         19  we saw --
         20       A.   Yes, sir.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  -- and then you mentioned
         22  something called regular soldiers.
         23       A.   Yes, your Honour.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  Does it mean that the Drina
         25  Wolves were not regular soldiers?  Were they an

          1  independent unity under independent command?
          2       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  You mean they were not subject
          4  to the same higher command?
          5       A.   Not at the moment, sir.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  They could have their own
          7  policy.
          8       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.  Now, in these events,
         10  several events which you mentioned, for instance,
         11  certain events which -- like the burning of the houses,
         12  the plundering of the houses, throwing phosphorous
         13  grenades, and the other one where you were stopped and
         14  they told you that if they kill one or two more, it
         15  doesn't make any difference, when you interfered and
         16  told them to stop what they were doing, was it the
         17  Drina Corps which was visible?
         18       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  And were you close enough to
         20  know?
         21       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Because in the case of the
         23  people who you said stopped you and laughed at you and
         24  threatened you not to interfere, you were close enough
         25  in that case.  But in the case of the plundering of the

          1  houses and the phosphorus and so on, were you close
          2  enough to know that they were the Drina Corps?
          3       A.   No, Your Honour.
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  You were not.
          5       A.   No, Your Honour.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Then how did you detect that it
          7  was the Drina Corps?
          8       A.   Because the same group that went inside was
          9  also the same group we stopped -- tried to stop.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  And the group you tried to stop
         11  was Drina.
         12       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, these Drina Wolves, these
         14  Drina Wolves, as you said, they were an independent
         15  unit.  Was it disciplined, as disciplined as the army?
         16  Was it organised under very strict command, or just a
         17  band of anarchic fighters?
         18       A.   Well, from my point of view, they looked like
         19  bandits.  They were just doing something.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  I mean, everything can do what
         21  he likes, or were they receiving orders?
         22       A.   Well, I haven't seen that they received
         23  orders.  I saw only that they went to those houses and
         24  started plundering, shooting, throw grenades, and they
         25  enjoyed themselves real good.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  So it did not give you the
          2  impression of a disciplined -- you are an army man --
          3  of a disciplined unit of the army.
          4       A.   No, they were not so quite disciplined as the
          5  rest of the army.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  The Arkan Tigers were different?
          7       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  The Arkan Tigers were supposed
          9  to be Bosnian Serbs or more or less Serbs?
         10       A.   What I can recall, Serbs.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Serbs.  You mentioned also
         12  something about hunting Muslim people and killing them
         13  when they were found.  These hunts, were also the Drina
         14  Corps involved in it?
         15       A.   I don't remember it.  I only heard the
         16  screams and the noises, the shots, the sound of a wolf,
         17  but I presumed it was the Drina Wolves.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  In all these events, have you
         19  had a glimpse of General Krstic?
         20       A.   No, sir.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  You also mentioned that in the
         22  centre -- I think, yes, it was yesterday -- in the
         23  centre of Srebrenica, or perhaps today, the
         24  blackmarket, what you called the blackmarket, was full
         25  of bodies, 40 to 50 people, and they were civilians,

          1  women, children, and old people.
          2       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  Have you found out what caused
          4  this great mass murder?
          5       A.   Well, I knew that Bravo Company, who was
          6  stationed in Srebrenica, had to withdraw back to the
          7  blackmarket, to the square, and they had to stand there
          8  and to help Muslim people, because they were scattered
          9  around there.  And I also -- I was also informed that
         10  most of the people were killed during the retreat to
         11  the UN base in Potocari.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  I mean, this was in the
         13  blackmarket.
         14       A.   Yes, sir.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  I mean, women and children, what
         16  is the relation between this and the retreat of the
         17  army?
         18       A.   Well, Bravo Company had also suffered from
         19  heavy fire, and when they --
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Fire directed towards the
         21  civilians.
         22       A.   Civilians, and also on UN soldiers.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  From where?  Who?
         24       A.   From the hills.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  From the hills.  And who was in

          1  the hills?
          2       A.   The Serb army.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  The Bosnian Serbs.
          4       A.   Yes, sir.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  But not the Drina Corps, you
          6  cannot --
          7       A.   No.  No.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  -- determine.
          9       A.   No, sir.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, you said every time you met
         11  Muslim units, you disarmed them and took their
         12  weapons.  Was there any clash between your forces,
         13  between the UN, and the Muslim fighters, or was it --
         14  or did they comply with your orders?
         15       A.   Well, they weren't happy with those orders,
         16  but we were very clear that they had to give up those
         17  weapons.  It's the agreement that we made with them, so
         18  they couldn't do anything about it.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  But you were not ordered to do
         20  the same thing with the others, with the other Bosnian
         21  Serbs.
         22       A.   No, Your Honour.
         23            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Corporal Vaasen.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         25  very much, Judge Riad.

          1            Judge Wald.
          2            JUDGE WALD:  Corporal, when you first came to
          3  the Srebrenica area and you were at OP Mike, were you
          4  aware of which part of the Bosnian Serb army was in
          5  authority in that area?  I mean, did somebody tell you
          6  that it was this battalion or this corps, so that you
          7  knew who you were dealing with?
          8       A.   No, Your Honour.
          9            JUDGE WALD:  They didn't tell you -- nobody
         10  said that "This is such and such a battalion" or "such
         11  and such a corps of the Bosnian Serb army that's in
         12  control"?
         13       A.   No, Your Honour.
         14            JUDGE WALD:  But you did mention several
         15  other times in your testimony that you knew somebody
         16  was the Drina Corps, you mentioned in answering Judge
         17  Riad's questions.  So at what point did you become
         18  aware that there were soldiers from the Drina Corps in
         19  the area?
         20       A.   Well, it was very clear the day that they
         21  arrived.  They had the badges on their shoulders --
         22            JUDGE WALD:  You're talking the day you
         23  arrived where, in Potocari or in the area of
         24  Srebrenica?
         25       A.   I was standing at the human barricade when

          1  they arrived.
          2            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  So before that, you had
          3  no idea, for instance, that the soldiers who were
          4  shelling the OP posts, et cetera, you didn't know to
          5  what battalion or corps they belonged?
          6       A.   No, Your Honour.
          7            JUDGE WALD:  You mentioned that the people in
          8  the Potocari compound got even more scared, I think you
          9  said, when they found out that both the Arkan Tigers
         10  and the Drina Wolves were there.  What was there about
         11  the Drina Wolves that would be likely to make the
         12  refugees feel even more scared than other soldiers
         13  being there?
         14       A.   Well, we -- the expression of their faces was
         15  very clear, that when they arrived, they got more
         16  scared and more nervous, and the tension -- the feeling
         17  of them, you could feel it even also there.
         18            JUDGE WALD:  In your knowledge, to your
         19  knowledge, had you heard things that would make you, if
         20  you had been a refugee, to feel more apprehensive about
         21  the Drina Wolves?  Did they have a special reputation
         22  of some sort?
         23       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         24            JUDGE WALD:  What was that?
         25       A.   Ethnic cleansing.

          1            JUDGE WALD:  And were you aware when you saw
          2  the Drina Wolves that the Drina Wolves were somehow
          3  part of the Drina Corps?
          4       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          5            JUDGE WALD:  You were aware of that.
          6            My second question is when you went back to
          7  Srebrenica, you told us you went back there, and when
          8  you saw the terrible sight of all the bodies, who, to
          9  your knowledge or in your observation, was left living
         10  in Srebrenica?  I mean, were there any Muslim civilians
         11  left that you know about?  Were there some Serbs left?
         12  Who was left in the village of Srebrenica after the
         13  evacuations from Potocari?
         14       A.   Well, after the evacuation of Potocari, it
         15  was real fast, because when those Muslim refugees were
         16  gone, the Serb people were standing -- yes, were
         17  standing right in front of the gate to enter the
         18  enclave.
         19            JUDGE WALD:  That was Potocari, right?
         20       A.   Yes, Potocari.
         21            JUDGE WALD:  How about Srebrenica?  When you
         22  went back to Srebrenica and saw all the dead bodies,
         23  were there any living people around there still living
         24  in Srebrenica?
         25       A.   No, Your Honour.

          1            JUDGE WALD:  It was an empty town, so far as
          2  you could tell; is that right?
          3       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
          4            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  The same thing you
          5  started to answer in Potocari.  Once all the
          6  evacuations were finished on the 14th, you were left in
          7  Potocari for another week.  To the best of your
          8  observation, who else was left in Potocari, either in
          9  the compound or in the houses or areas around the
         10  compound?
         11       A.   Well, I'm sure that only the Dutch Battalion,
         12  the UN Battalion, was there, and I also saw that Serb
         13  people, civilians, were also going into the enclave,
         14  plundering, and I saw them even go back -- they went in
         15  with cars -- with empty cars, and they came back with
         16  washing machines, VCRs, everything that they found on
         17  the way.
         18            JUDGE WALD:  During that week that you were
         19  left in the compound in Potocari, did you see any
         20  Muslim civilians of any sort, men, women, children,
         21  old, young, anybody?
         22       A.   No, Your Honour.
         23            JUDGE WALD:  Thank you, Corporal.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         25  very much, Judge Wald.

          1            Corporal Vaasen, I also have a few questions
          2  for you.  You spoke about Arkan's Tigers, Drina Wolves,
          3  dog handlers, and regular troops.  When you mentioned
          4  those regular troops, in answering one of
          5  Mr. Petrusic's questions, you said that they had a
          6  particular badge with a crown on it, and you also
          7  stated that the letters "HVO" were on it.  Are you
          8  absolutely certain about that, that those were, indeed,
          9  the letters "HVO" or rather could it have been some
         10  other letters?
         11       A.   No, Your Honour, you could clearly see it.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]  "HVO".
         13       A.   Yes, Your Honour.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I do not
         15  want to lead you in any manner, but let me just tell
         16  you that the letters "HVO" are used in the context of
         17  Croatian soldiers.  Here, we are dealing with Bosnian
         18  Serb soldiers.  Having said that, I should like to know
         19  whether you are still sure that the letters in question
         20  were, indeed, "HVO".
         21       A.   Yes, Your Honour, because they had different
         22  kinds of clothes.  They also had our clothes already.
         23  They had their regular uniforms and they also were
         24  dressed in those uniforms.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you

          1  very much.
          2            Mr. Usher, could you check whether Exhibit
          3  5/19 is still on the ELMO, please.
          4            As regards this particular photograph,
          5  Corporal Vaasen, I should like to ask you the following
          6  question:  You see a number of houses here on the
          7  photograph.  Could you tell us whether the state of
          8  repair of these houses is the same as the one that you
          9  saw at the time, when houses were being torched, or do
         10  you think that there is any difference between the
         11  situation now and then?
         12       A.   I don't remember, Your Honour.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         14  Thank you anyway.  I think that you have already said
         15  this in response to my colleague's question, but let me
         16  ask it once again.  Do you know General Krstic?
         17       A.   No, Your Honour.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you have
         19  never seen General Krstic in the field, or anywhere
         20  else.
         21       A.   No, Your Honour.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         23  And my last question for you.  You are a military man
         24  and you are accustomed to functioning within an
         25  organisation, and you respect discipline.  If we take

          1  these two elements into account, organisation and
          2  discipline, and bearing in mind your experience and
          3  what you were able to observe in the area at the
          4  relevant time, in your opinion, was there any
          5  organisation in the events you told us about?  Was
          6  there any discipline as well?
          7       A.   Well, during the deportation of the Muslim
          8  refugees, there was some kind of discipline.  But for
          9  the rest of it, there was no discipline.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] What about
         11  the level of organisation?  Did you have an impression
         12  that there, indeed, had been an organisation which was
         13  behind this discipline?
         14       A.   I don't know.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         16  Thank you very much, Corporal Vaasen, for coming here
         17  to testify before the International Tribunal.  We know
         18  you have just had to experience once again your
         19  ordeal.  Let me say once again that the Chamber is
         20  thankful for your testimony, and I hope that you will
         21  be able, one day, to find peace in this beautiful
         22  country of yours.  Thank you very much.
         23            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Your Honour,
         24  before we let the witness go, I should like to know the
         25  status of Exhibit 57 and Defence Exhibit D5.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
          2  Mr. Cayley.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  Yes, Mr. President.  Exhibit 57
          4  is the patch which the witness identified as having
          5  seen on the arm of a member of the Drina Wolves.  If
          6  there are no objections from the Defence, I'd like to
          7  apply for that -- for admission into evidence of that
          8  exhibit, please.  And we certainly have no objections
          9  in respect of Exhibit D5, which is the witness's
         10  statement.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         12  Mr. Cayley.
         13            Mr. Petrusic, are there any objections as
         14  regards the admission of Exhibit 57?  And do you wish
         15  to tender D5 into evidence?
         16            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour,
         17  we do not object to the exhibit tendered by
         18  Mr. Cayley.  However, I should -- could you please
         19  repeat your second question, Your Honour, as regards
         20  this other exhibit?
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  I
         22  thought you were going to ask for your exhibit, D5, to
         23  be admitted into evidence.
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes, that is
         25  the case, Your Honour.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Therefore,
          2  Exhibits 57 and D5 will be admitted into evidence,
          3  Mr. Dubuisson.
          4            Very well, then.  Corporal Vaasen, you have
          5  heard a number of questions by the Prosecutor, by the
          6  Defence, and by the Judges as well.  At the end of your
          7  testimony, I should like to know whether there is
          8  anything else that you wish to add to what you have
          9  said here in evidence.
         10            THE WITNESS:  No, Your Honour.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         12  Corporal Vaasen, once again.
         13                 [The witness withdrew]
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon
         15  or Mr. Cayley.
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  We do have another witness,
         17  Mr. President, but you might feel it's the appropriate
         18  time to take a break because we have to rearrange
         19  ourselves here.  And rather than do that in front of
         20  the Judges, it may be easier.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         22  Mr. Dubuisson has drawn my attention to a particular
         23  fact.  For the purposes of the public principle of the
         24  hearing, I should like to know whether your next
         25  witness is a protected one.
          1            MR. CAYLEY:  He is a protected witness,
          2  Mr. President, yes.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Sorry to
          4  insist, but I should like to know what the reasons for
          5  his application are and what kind of protective
          6  measures you're seeking.
          7            MR. CAYLEY:  Actually, I think my colleague
          8  Mr. McCloskey will answer the question, but it might be
          9  an idea that we go into closed session before he
         10  actually discusses the reason for the protection.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] For the
         12  public gallery, I should therefore stress that our next
         13  witness will be testifying in closed session, and we
         14  will now go into private session to discuss the reasons
         15  for his seeking protective measures.
         16            Are we in private session?
         17            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes, Your
         18  Honour, we are.

         17                 [Open session]
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         19  Mr. McCloskey.
         20            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Mr. President.  We're
         21  ready for the next witness, who I believe will be
         22  Witness F.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Has it been
         24  resolved yet?
         25            Could you repeat, please, from the beginning,
          1  Mr. McCloskey, because I was not getting the French
          2  interpretation.
          3            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Your Honour.  I believe
          4  this is Witness F that we are ready for, and we are all
          5  ready to go.
          6            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Indeed, this
          7  will be Witness F, and there is nobody in the public
          8  gallery of this hearing.  The debate can be followed on
          9  the ground floor.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Will you
         11  please bring the witness in.
         12                 [The witness entered court]
         13            MR. McCLOSKEY:  And, Mr. President, he will
         14  be testifying in Dutch.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Just a
         16  preliminary question.  Mr. McCloskey, will you be
         17  showing any exhibits on the ELMO?
         18            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Mr. President.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Perhaps we
         20  could move -- then perhaps the interpreter and the
         21  witness could change places, so that the witness is
         22  closer to the ELMO.
         23            MR. McCLOSKEY:  That's an excellent idea.
         24  Could we try that out?
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Would you
          1  please put your headsets on?  Could you please switch
          2  places?  Will you put your earphones on, please?
          3            MR. McCLOSKEY:  He needs a headset.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Can you
          5  hear me, Witness F?  You can hear?  Very well.  Witness
          6  F, that is what we shall call you, in view of the
          7  protective measures that have been granted to you.  You
          8  will now read the solemn declaration which the usher
          9  will give you.
         10            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly
         11  declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth,
         12  and nothing but the truth.
         13                 WITNESS:  WITNESS F
         14                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] And now the
         16  interpretation for the interpreter.
         17            THE INTERPRETER:  [Interpretation] I solemnly
         18  declare that I will perform my duty professionally and
         19  with full respect for confidentiality.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness F,
         21  thank you for coming.  The registrar will now show you
         22  a piece of paper with your name on it.  You will only
         23  say if this is your name or not.
         24            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So this is

          1  your name.  Very well.  Now you will answer questions
          2  which the Prosecutor, Mr. McCloskey, will be asking of
          3  you.
          4            Mr. McCloskey.
          5            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          6                 Examined by Mr. McCloskey:
          7       Q.   Witness F, you are currently a member of the
          8  Dutch army; is that correct?
          9       A.   That's correct.
         10       Q.   And in 1995, were you assigned as a
         11  peacekeeping mission in Bosnia as a Dutch soldier?
         12       A.   That's correct.
         13            THE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness please
         14  come closer to the microphone or speak up.
         15            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Excuse me.  Can the witness
         16  please get a little closer to the microphone.
         17       A.   I left in January for Potocari, in
         18  Srebrenica.
         19       Q.   What was your mission in Bosnia at that time?
         20       A.   Our mission was humanitarian, the disarming
         21  of any Muslim fighters we might find, reconnaissance
         22  duties, patrols along the border area and between the
         23  OPs in the enclave.
         24       Q.   What OPs were you assigned to?
         25       A.   My main OPs were mainly OP Papa, at the main

          1  entrance to the enclave, and later on OP ^ Sierra.
          2       Q.   Did you ever work with Corporal Vaasen on an
          3  OP?
          4       A.   No, I have never been with Vaasen on an OP.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me,
          6  Mr. McCloskey, the interpreters say that they did not
          7  understand the question.  So could you repeat it,
          8  please?
          9            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] I should --
         10  and I should now like to seize the opportunity to say
         11  that we have yet one more mediator in our chain of
         12  interpretation and communication.  So will you please
         13  pause between every question and answer because we have
         14  to take a number of relays.  We now have a second relay
         15  here.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In other
         17  words, normally, we need to make a pause between the
         18  question and answer, but in this case, according to
         19  what Mr. Dubuisson tells us, we also have to make at
         20  least two pauses.  Thank you.
         21            MR. McCLOSKEY:
         22       Q.   Did you work with Corporal Vaasen on any of
         23  the OPs during your time in the Srebrenica enclave?
         24       A.   No, I have never been with Corporal Vaasen.
         25  I've never worked with him on an OP.  I've never worked

          1  with Corporal Vaasen on an OP.
          2       Q.   And can you describe the kinds of military
          3  weapons you saw that the Muslim army had at the various
          4  times that you were working there?
          5       A.   The Muslim army consisted of mainly lightly
          6  armed military, mortars, hand mortars, AK-47s of
          7  Russian make, hand grenades, shell hand grenades, and
          8  light machine-guns, and some pistols.  They also had
          9  self-made weapons, home-made weapons.  They were very
         10  creative, and most of those weapons were in the
         11  compound in Srebrenica, on stock.
         12       Q.   Did you notice a change in the quantity or
         13  quality of their weaponry as we get closer to July of
         14  1995?
         15       A.   The more the situation of tension came near
         16  by and the pressure in the area arose, we suspected
         17  that there were helicopter droppings, and after that we
         18  saw men in better military uniforms, they had better
         19  arms, better weapons, they had new shoes, they had
         20  better equipment, and certainly they were better
         21  prepared.
         22       Q.   Did they have any large equipment?
         23       A.   Not so much.  Most of the large material had
         24  been confiscated by the 12th Battalion at the time, and
         25  it was in the compound in Srebrenica.

          1       Q.   Did you ever see any armour in the hands of
          2  the Muslim soldiers prior or during the fall of the
          3  enclave.
          4       A.   One time, when I arrived at the beginning of
          5  January, I saw one Muslim fighter with an AK, and he
          6  ran off as fast as he could.  That was the only thing I
          7  saw.
          8       Q.   Did you ever see the Muslim army with a tank?
          9       A.   One time, one of my colleagues observed a
         10  tank.
         11       Q.   Did you see it personally?
         12       A.   Negative.
         13       Q.   On July 11th, when the town of Potocari fell,
         14  what was your assignment that day?
         15       A.   On that day, we were understaffed already.
         16  We had worked hard, we were together, and we had to
         17  take extra duties on the OP and in the compound.  And
         18  my place was a certain place in the building with a
         19  machine-gun post, directed towards OP Papa.
         20       Q.   And where was that place?
         21       A.   That place was not in the large corridor, but
         22  in a separate building, with a view to the northern
         23  side of the enclave.
         24       Q.   And how high up were you?
         25       A.   On the second floor of the building.  The

          1  building only consisted of two floors.
          2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, at this time,
          3  I would like to show the witness the Exhibit 5/2.  If
          4  you can put that on the ELMO.
          5       Q.   Witness, if you could look directly at the
          6  exhibit as opposed to the ELMO, you may get a better
          7  look at it.  And if you could study it for a moment.
          8  Do you recognise this photograph?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   Is this the area outlined in yellow the UN
         11  base, as it's marked?
         12       A.   That's correct.
         13       Q.   Now, do you see the area of the UN base where
         14  you were actually located on the second floor?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16       Q.   Would you take the green marking pencil
         17  that's in front of you and circle the area.
         18       A.   [Marks]
         19       Q.   And would you put your initials next to
         20  that?  Actually, strike that.  Just put "F" next to it,
         21  please.
         22       A.   [Marks]
         23       Q.   Now, about what time did you first go to that
         24  lookout spot?
         25       A.   Early in the morning, after we had gotten the

          1  orders, the weapons were distributed and the equipment,
          2  and the task duties were given out.
          3       Q.   At some point in the day, did you notice
          4  activity, military activity, in the area where you were
          5  watching out?
          6       A.   That's correct.  There was more and more
          7  shooting in the area.  We heard heavy engine sounds
          8  from all directions, especially from the northern
          9  direction.  At the eastern side, there was heavy
         10  battery sound, but on that day, they mostly came from
         11  the northern side, ever more engine sounds, smoke,
         12  shooting.  From time to time, we saw Muslim fighters
         13  with mortars.  They just fired them and then they ran
         14  back.  And that's how it went for quite a while.
         15       Q.   Do you see the area on this exhibit where you
         16  could see Muslim fighters with mortars?
         17       A.   I can't see the Muslim fighters, but I know
         18  the area, of course.  Yes, I can see it.
         19       Q.   Could you just point out the area where you
         20  saw the Muslim fighters with mortars?
         21       A.   [Indicates].  Here and here and here.
         22            MR. McCLOSKEY:  The record should indicate
         23  that he indicated he saw Muslim fighters on both sides
         24  of the UN base, up in the hill area, as well as the
         25  northern side of the UN base.

          1       Q.   Now, can you describe the scene as you
          2  witnessed it that morning.
          3       A.   That morning, I was with my colleague, we
          4  went to fetch water, and we saw more and more movements
          5  of those Muslim fighters.  They were grouping
          6  themselves and redisappeared into the woods.  From our
          7  point, viewing point, we saw, towards the direction of
          8  houses and OP Papa, we heard fighting coming from
          9  there, fighting sounds.  And later that day, and I
         10  don't know the exact times, more Serbs started coming
         11  in.  We saw smoke arise around OP Papa and on both
         12  sides of the hill, more shooting, more heavy engine
         13  sounds, tank sounds.  And the Muslim fighters were very
         14  nervous, and they started to disappear into the woods,
         15  they ran off.
         16            On the eastern side, there were a couple of
         17  Muslim fighters firing mortars at, I think, Serb
         18  materiel, and they were taken under heavy machine-gun
         19  fire.
         20       Q.   Did you have an opportunity to photograph the
         21  smoke in the area of OP Papa that day?
         22       A.   Yes.  My position was such that I had a good
         23  view at the incoming materiel, the infantry, in such a
         24  way that I also saw the houses at OP Papa's main
         25  entrance.  And indeed, I had a couple of pictures in my

          1  camera, I took pictures of houses on fire and the smoke
          2  of a tank, a Russian tank's oil fire -- I'm sorry, oil
          3  smoke, very heavy smoke.
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we present the witness
          5  with Exhibit 63.
          6       Q.   Now, is this -- does this photograph depict
          7  what you were able to photograph that day?
          8       A.   That's correct.
          9       Q.   Would you point at the various smoke plumes
         10  that you see and tell us anything that you can about
         11  them?
         12       A.   This was my position [indicates].  This was a
         13  hill with mainly Serb positions.  They also had cannons
         14  which had been observed before --
         15       Q.   Excuse me.  When you point to something, we
         16  have to get it on the record, so please listen
         17  carefully to the question and try to answer the
         18  question as particularly as you can.
         19            Could you first point to the smoke that you
         20  noticed and tell us what you can about the various
         21  smoke plumes?
         22       A.   These are smoke plumes arising from houses.
         23  In this area -- there was OP Papa in this area.  In
         24  this area [indicates] we had an open field which was
         25  behind OP Papa.  Here on this hill, against this hill,

          1  were Serb positions.  We were told that there was a
          2  minefield here [indicates], and later on it turned out
          3  not to be true.  This smoke plume came from a T-55
          4  tank, a Russian tank --
          5            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Excuse me, again.  Can the
          6  record reflect that there is a dark smoke plume in the
          7  middle of the photograph that the witness has described
          8  as coming from a tank.  And that the mountain behind
          9  the smoke he earlier described is an area where there
         10  were Serb positions.
         11       Q.   The other smoke in the area, can you describe
         12  what you believe that to be from?
         13       A.   Those other smoke plumes came from houses in
         14  that area.  Most of them were set afire.  It shows
         15  clearly from the white smoke plumes, it was very dry in
         16  that area, so those houses burnt with white smoke and
         17  not with dark smoke.  Dark smoke comes from oil.  And
         18  behind this tree line here [indicates], all those fires
         19  were set ablaze.  Sometimes we even saw the flames.
         20  And those are the only pictures I took from this area.
         21            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Again, the witness was
         22  pointing to the more whitish smoke plume on the right
         23  side of the picture, and then going even more over to
         24  the right, describing the smoke he was able to see and
         25  sometimes flames.

          1       Q.   Can you describe what you saw shortly after
          2  taking this photograph?
          3       A.   Well, what we observed was very nervous
          4  Muslim fighters at the time, sounds -- the tank and
          5  materiel sound coming closer.  Along the tree line,
          6  along the fields, there came a very well-organised
          7  group of infantry units with a tank before them.  This
          8  tank which I showed you, the tank with the dark smoke,
          9  it was indeed a Russian tank of the type T-55.  And to
         10  the left of the compound, there were organised military
         11  men, and to the right, also organised military, and
         12  they cleansed all the houses and looted everything that
         13  they could take.
         14       Q.   Can you describe this first wave of what
         15  you've described as organised soldiers, what they were
         16  wearing, what they looked like?
         17       A.   This first wave of an organised army
         18  consisted of well-disciplined infantry.  They were
         19  dressed with helmets, beautiful, good camouflage suits,
         20  well-armed.  They had several commanders, at least
         21  NCOs, who gave orders.  They had good liaison
         22  materiel.  The units were posted on both sides of the
         23  enclave and they had contact.  That is how they
         24  advanced in line.  And it was -- I had the impression
         25  that they were very well-organised, and I think I have

          1  enough experience to judge this after my time in
          2  service.
          3       Q.   What colour were their camouflage uniforms?
          4       A.   On the right side of the compound from -- to
          5  my right-hand side, most of them were dressed in
          6  black.  They were big, strong boys, strong guys,
          7  lightly armed.  They had very good liaison materiel,
          8  carried on their backs mainly, and most of them were
          9  dressed in black.  They also cleansed all the houses
         10  very thoroughly.  And to the left, there was mainly
         11  infantry.  They advanced across the field.  To the
         12  left, there were fewer houses than to the right, so
         13  there were infantry in camouflage suits, helmets.  They
         14  had machine-guns, AK-47s, grenades.  It was an infantry
         15  unit, an ordinary infantry unit.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me.  You just mentioned
         17  also that they cleansed all the houses very
         18  thoroughly.  I want to know the meaning of this word.
         19  Thank you.
         20            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Your Honour.
         21            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] They cleansed
         22  or cleared the houses in such a way that they could be
         23  certain that there were no Muslim fighters or other
         24  people left behind.  Their task was cleaning or
         25  cleansing out the whole area so that the units coming

          1  after them could advance through this area.
          2       Q.   And what colour camouflage did the unit you'd
          3  last described wear?
          4       A.   Black.
          5       Q.   So was this first wave of soldiers all
          6  dressed in black?
          7       A.   To my right-hand side, yes, and they cleared
          8  out all the houses.  And to the other side, there was
          9  infantry in camouflage and armed.  To the right-hand
         10  side, there was more fighting than to the left.
         11       Q.   But the soldiers on the left, they were also
         12  dressed in black; is that right?
         13       A.   Some of them, yes.
         14       Q.   And what were the others dressed as?
         15       A.   Camouflage suits with helmets, and they were
         16  under the direct command of a group commander,
         17  sergeant, or a corporal, about that rank.
         18       Q.   Did you see any soldiers in green camouflage
         19  together with the soldiers in black?
         20       A.   Not at first, until they had advanced halfway
         21  towards the compound.  If I could show it in a picture,
         22  but I don't have a picture here --
         23       Q.   Again, we've gone back to Exhibit 5/2.
         24       A.   So at first, those men dressed in black came
         25  along this line [indicates], they advanced along this

          1  line, and they had several fighting incidents with the
          2  Muslim fighters --
          3       Q.   Again, I'm sorry to interrupt, but for the
          4  record I have to show you that you're talking about
          5  from the bottom of the photo up towards the UN base,
          6  that is where the black soldiers advanced.
          7       A.   So here were the soldiers dressed in black,
          8  and here was the organised army advancing in this
          9  direction as a corporal or a sergeant.  Those black
         10  military men also advanced, and they cleared or
         11  cleansed out all the houses, and they organised
         12  themselves, or regrouped, around this spot
         13  [indicates] --
         14       Q.   Indicating right where the "UN base" words
         15  are.
         16       A.   So they organised here [indicates], military
         17  men in camouflage suits also advanced from this
         18  direction, from this hill down [indicates], so this
         19  whole area --
         20       Q.   Again, for the record, we have to say from
         21  the hill on the left side of the photograph, military
         22  people in camouflage are advancing down towards the UN
         23  compound.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         25  Mr. McCloskey, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but could

          1  you please ask the witness where was the position and
          2  the direction from which the photograph was taken, that
          3  is, Exhibit 63, if you could do that, please.
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes.  Thank you,
          5  Mr. President.
          6       Q.   Now, could you tell the Court where your
          7  photograph was taken from and what direction the
          8  photograph -- what direction you were pointing the
          9  camera in when you took the photograph?
         10       A.   Towards this direction [indicates].
         11       Q.   I'm sorry.  First can you tell us where you
         12  were when you took the photograph.  Is that inside the
         13  little circle marked "F"?
         14       A.   That's correct, in this dark building, which
         15  you see here [indicates].
         16       Q.   And could you take your pointer again and
         17  point in the direction -- or just lay the pointer down
         18  in the direction your photograph was?
         19       A.   [Indicates].
         20       Q.   And the record should indicate he's pointing
         21  straight down to the bottom of the photograph.  And
         22  that's in the direction of Bratunac, is it not?
         23       A.   That's correct.
         24       Q.   Now, when you saw these soldiers going into
         25  these houses, did you see them taking any property or

          1  doing anything that you thought was not soldierly?
          2       A.   This first wave mostly cleared out the
          3  houses, and they were certainly trained to do so.
          4  Immediately afterwards, there were some people who
          5  entered the houses and who took all their belongings,
          6  everything that was valuable, they just carried
          7  outside.
          8       Q.   Can you describe who those people were, how
          9  they were dressed?
         10       A.   They were dressed in camouflage.  They were
         11  less well-organised.  They were not under any direct
         12  command.  They had -- so after this first infantry line
         13  had been through, they had to guard this area because
         14  there might still be some resistance, and they
         15  literally just spoiled themselves with other people's
         16  property.
         17       Q.   Were both these units you've described
         18  Bosnian Serb army units?
         19       A.   That's correct.
         20       Q.   Were you able to watch all of this from your
         21  perch on the second floor?
         22       A.   That's correct.  It was an ideal point,
         23  looking towards the north and the east.
         24       Q.   Did you see other soldiers, other Bosnian
         25  Serb soldiers, arrive in the area while you were still

          1  up there?
          2       A.   Yes.  The units were replenished, more
          3  materiel was coming in, kind of replenishing units came
          4  in to replenish the troops advancing towards
          5  Srebrenica, bringing in more materiel.  There were also
          6  officers amongst them and higher ranks, because this
          7  area was already cleared because the others had been
          8  through.  And those units mainly consisted of what I
          9  would call Rambo-types, not disciplined units, and
         10  perhaps some reserve people.
         11       Q.   And how were they dressed?
         12       A.   They were mainly dressed in camouflage and
         13  also civilian, so most of them had camouflage trousers
         14  and a civilian shirt.  It was a hot day.  And this type
         15  of military were less well-trained physically.  They
         16  were a bit fatter, they had bellies.  They were also
         17  older than the first wave.  They also had AK-47s with
         18  wooden butts, pistols.  They had bandannas.  The men
         19  with the machine-guns carried the machine-gun straps
         20  diagonally across their chest.  They were smoking, they
         21  had cigarettes between their lips.  So they were less
         22  disciplined.
         23       Q.   Did you see other types of units come into
         24  the area?
         25       A.   When the first wave had passed the compound

          1  and the Rambo-types were around, were supposed to keep
          2  the area safe, more vehicles came in, military and
          3  civilian vehicles, also police vehicles, "police" was
          4  written on those vehicles.  And I saw a blue tank which
          5  was very distinctive between all those blue -- between
          6  all those green.  There were military polices, also
          7  some reporters, people in civilian clothes, et cetera.
          8       Q.   Now, this blue vehicle that you saw, was it a
          9  tank or an armoured personnel carrier?
         10       A.   It was not a tank.  It was a vehicle on
         11  normal wheels, ordinary wheels.  It's an armed vehicle
         12  to transport personnel.  About 15 men would be
         13  transported with such a vehicle.  Usually it's slightly
         14  armed with a machine-gun, such a vehicle.
         15       Q.   Did you see any other blue vehicles in the
         16  vicinity of Potocari that day of a military type?
         17       A.   Negative.  Only the police cars.  Most of
         18  them were Gulfs, Volkswagen Gulfs, type 1.
         19       Q.   Did you see any soldiers in a blue
         20  military-style outfit?
         21       A.   That's correct.  They were dressed in blue
         22  uniforms, or jumpsuits, overalls with a black belt and
         23  pistol, and an AK.  And some of them had an automatic
         24  weapon of German origin.
         25       Q.   When did you first see these men in blue?

          1       A.   Later that day, after the first wave had
          2  passed and the compound was surrounded, and most people
          3  were there before, in front of the compound.
          4       Q.   And were these Bosnian Serb soldiers, these
          5  people in blue?
          6       A.   They were certainly Serbian police, army
          7  police, yes.  They were subordinate to the government.
          8       Q.   Did you see how these Serb army police acted
          9  throughout the day?  Could you tell what role they
         10  played in the events of this day?
         11       A.   They were present, mainly.  Some of them
         12  entered the compound in order to look at the refugees,
         13  and my idea was that their task was mainly to secure
         14  the higher ranking officers, to keep them safe.  I
         15  think a kind of military police, a kind of
         16  anti-terrorist unit, who had to guard the higher
         17  ranking people.
         18       Q.   All right.  Now, is it true that you remember
         19  these days as the first day, meaning the day that the
         20  Bosnian Serb soldiers arrive, and the second day,
         21  meaning the day that all the refugees were shipped out?
         22       A.   That's correct.
         23            MR. McCLOSKEY:  I may have misstated the
         24  date, Mr. President, on this, but we will just refer to
         25  this as the first day, then.

          1       Q.   How long did you stay up in your post on that
          2  first day?
          3       A.   A couple of hours.  And the day before that
          4  first day, we were also already there.  We were
          5  understaffed, so I think -- I don't know the time
          6  anymore, but perhaps till about noon, around that time,
          7  we stopped.
          8       Q.   Okay.  On that first day that the soldiers
          9  arrived, what did you do after leaving the lookout
         10  area?
         11       A.   After the Serbs had entered and the compound
         12  had been surrounded, we got orders to lay down our arms
         13  and to make ourselves visible, to show ourselves to the
         14  Serb units, to show that we would not use any violence
         15  against them, as a sign of that.  We had to go out into
         16  the open and just wait and see what was going to
         17  happen.
         18       Q.   Who gave you the order to lay down your arms?
         19       A.   The order came from, at that time, my
         20  commander, Major Otter, and he, of course, also gets
         21  his orders from a higher hand, and it just filtered
         22  down.
         23       Q.   After that, were you able to assist the
         24  refugees?
         25       A.   Yes.  We were already understaffed, and there

          1  had been so many refugees that we had to give them
          2  help.
          3       Q.   Can you describe how you personally helped
          4  them?
          5       A.   The refugees had, of course, already arrived
          6  on our compound, and during the night, we tended to
          7  them, we comforted them.  And the day when the arms
          8  were laid down, everybody went their own way.  There
          9  was no direct chain of command anymore, and actually
         10  everybody assisted as they could.  I myself mainly --
         11  well, it's probably not a proper expression, but what I
         12  did was put people on the buses, on trucks, on
         13  tractors.  I was in command at the time, I was in the
         14  rank of a commander, so I -- there was no direct chain
         15  of command in this whole process, in this whole
         16  situation.  So I directed others.
         17       Q.   Did you help any refugees with their children
         18  or problems they had with their children?
         19       A.   Correct.  More and more refugees came into
         20  the compound.  If I could just show you on the map from
         21  which direction.  Our people had made a hole in the
         22  gate, in the fence, and the refugees came from this
         23  direction [indicates], onto the compound, and I was
         24  positioned in this area at the time.
         25       Q.   Okay.  May the record show that you're

          1  speaking to an area just below the "Y" in "Blue
          2  Factory" on the outline of the yellow border of the UN
          3  compound.
          4       A.   Many women and children came, many babies,
          5  mostly babies, with babies, babies who had swollen up.
          6  It was save yourselves.  Older people were left
          7  behind.  Everybody was just trying to get to safety,
          8  onto the compound.  And several times, I held babies in
          9  my arms which were so swollen that they finally died.
         10       Q.   Can you give us any kind of an estimate of
         11  how many deceased babies you had to take like that?
         12       A.   About between 5 and 15, and perhaps even
         13  more.  I didn't count at that moment.
         14       Q.   Were any of the babies alive that were given
         15  you?
         16       A.   Yes, some of them were still alive, but they
         17  were certainly undernourished.  Usually the women would
         18  give me the babies because they just didn't know
         19  anymore what to do and what their future would bring.
         20       Q.   And were you able to care for some of the
         21  babies that were still alive and get them some care?
         22       A.   I, in turn, gave those babies to our medical
         23  staff, who at that point in time cared for the wounded,
         24  for the refugees, and for babies and children.  I
         25  mainly was concerned with helping people into the

          1  compound, and I gave the babies to the medical staff
          2  and I referred them to the medical staff.
          3       Q.   Now, after that period where you were helping
          4  refugees into the compound, did you eventually go over
          5  to the area where people were being loaded on the
          6  buses?
          7       A.   That's correct.
          8       Q.   And what did you see over there?
          9       A.   There was chaos on the compound.  There were
         10  several buses, trucks, tractors.  There was nobody in
         11  charge.  It was a very hot day.  There was no water, no
         12  food.  We ourselves had flasks with water, and I
         13  ordered some of my colleagues and subordinates to get
         14  water and to distribute it to the refugees.  The Serb
         15  soldiers just stood there, looking, and they just liked
         16  what they saw.  Some of them were robbing us, the
         17  DutchBat soldiers, of our pistols, of our helmets.
         18  They took away our watches, our clothing, just for a
         19  souvenir.  Those were mainly those Rambo-types which I
         20  described coming in the second wave.
         21       Q.   Were you present when Muslims were actually
         22  loaded onto buses?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   Can you describe what you saw of that
         25  process?

          1       A.   The people who were loaded into the buses and
          2  onto the trucks were mainly the people outside the
          3  compound.  They wanted to get them away as fast as
          4  possible.  A separation was made between men between
          5  the ages of 14, 15, up to 50.  The men had to surrender
          6  their belongings.  And the women were transported in
          7  the other direction, towards the buses.  They had to
          8  advance towards the first bus, and that is how they
          9  filled all the buses.  And as soon as a bus was full,
         10  two or three buses left the enclave.  Sometimes they
         11  were escorted by a military vehicle.
         12       Q.   Now, when the men were separated, did you see
         13  where they went?
         14       A.   Some buses, a couple of buses, were situated
         15  towards the Srebrenica direction and some buses also
         16  went towards Bratunac.  That is how they left the
         17  enclave.  The men were separated.  If I could just show
         18  you in this picture.
         19       Q.   Again, referring to the same exhibit, 5/2.
         20       A.   So this is the area where the separation of
         21  the men took place [indicates].
         22            MR. McCLOSKEY:  And for the record, it should
         23  indicate the witness showed the area around the White
         24  House.
         25       Q.   You mentioned the men's belongings.  What

          1  happened to the men's belongings?
          2       A.   They were searched at such a high pace that
          3  all their belongings were taken away from them.  The
          4  older men were put onto the bus -- the distinction was
          5  immediately made -- and the younger boys, around 15 up
          6  to 30 years, were taken apart.  Some of them were
          7  interrogated, all their belongings were put onto one
          8  big heap, and afterwards, of course, they were also
          9  taken away, and it could be in both directions.
         10       Q.   Did you see where the men were taken for
         11  interrogation?
         12       A.   Most or all of them -- let me show you here
         13  in the picture -- were taken to the White House, across
         14  from the compound.  That was a very distinctive
         15  location.  Many military were around there.
         16       Q.   Where were their belongings accumulating
         17  during this process?
         18       A.   Their belongings were put near the entrance
         19  to this little house.  Let me show you once more.  Do
         20  you see the white bus here?  That is the main entrance
         21  to the path leading to the White House, and that is
         22  where the belongings of all those people were put
         23  down.  And in the end, it was such a big mound that
         24  around the White House everywhere there were those
         25  belongings, rucksacks, bags, shoes, passports, knives,

          1  razors, whatever they had.
          2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  For the record, the witness
          3  indicated a little white speck below the circle
          4  marked "White House."  It appears to be an area in
          5  front of the White House.
          6       Q.   Now, earlier, you said that no one was in
          7  charge.  Did you mean that no one was in charge from
          8  the Dutch or no one was in charge from the Serb side?
          9       A.   We were understaffed, and the higher-ranking
         10  officers and NCOs were under such stress and so busy
         11  with other things that we did not have any command.
         12  Everybody did as they saw best, and we did what we
         13  could.
         14            On the Serb side, it was certainly very
         15  well-organised.
         16       Q.   What leads you to belief that?
         17       A.   It was certainly the case that it was a
         18  well-prepared stage.  Everybody had been assigned a
         19  task, everybody knew his position.  There were people
         20  who had to guard the compound, who had to guard the
         21  surroundings.  There were units who had to clear out
         22  the houses, and there were other units who had to do
         23  the interrogations.  Those were older men; most of them
         24  had a pistol.  It was indeed well organised, and it was
         25  perhaps a separate unit assigned to this task.

          1       Q.   Can you describe this unit that you think may
          2  have been a separate unit, what the people looked like,
          3  what they were wearing?
          4       A.   Around that White House, the interrogation
          5  house, there were mainly armed military in camouflage,
          6  and in the house, there were elder men with pistols.
          7  They had more experience.  And there was certainly a
          8  good chain of command, who decided what was going to
          9  happen to those people and which bus they were to
         10  board.  And, indeed, there was the police car, not the
         11  armed vehicle, but those Volkswagen Golfs.  They were
         12  also present there.
         13       Q.   Now, this description you're giving us of
         14  various units all doing various tasks, including
         15  clearing out houses, guarding the compound, separating
         16  the men from the women and children, interrogating men,
         17  how would you describe the coordination between these
         18  various groups, as you saw it?
         19       A.   From a military point of view, I would never
         20  condone what happened, but it was a good operation.  It
         21  was well organised, well prepared, good command.
         22  Everybody knew their task.  Certainly it was planned
         23  about how to go about this, and several units were
         24  involved for this approach.  It was a large-scale
         25  approach in such a way that they did not know what

          1  resistance to expect, but they knew that they would be
          2  able to handle it as quickly as possible.  There was
          3  good communication, internal communication, good
          4  liaison materiel, and it is well known, the Yugoslav
          5  army is well known for their good liaison materiel.  It
          6  was very well organised.  They had a sufficient chain
          7  of command.  There was new materiel brought in,
          8  constantly new troops, new units, very well-oiled.
          9       Q.   Do you see anyone in this room today that you
         10  saw out there at that time?
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   Could you point out where that person is and
         13  what they're wearing?
         14       A.   [Indicates].  He's sitting behind that
         15  gentleman.  He has greying hair and he has a partition
         16  to the left.  He is wearing a black jacket and a white
         17  shirt.
         18            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Can the record indicate that
         19  he has identified General Krstic.
         20            And, Mr. President, as you've indicated, it's
         21  a good idea for a break.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         23  Mr. McCloskey.  I think that we have another one hour
         24  and five minutes to work, and I think we should split
         25  the remaining time in two parts.  As far as I can see,

          1  there is an English interpreter who is working all the
          2  time, so we're going to have a break, a 15-minute
          3  break.
          4                 --- Recess taken at 1.27 p.m.
          5                 --- On resuming at 1.47 p.m.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          7  Mr. McCloskey, you can continue.
          8            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          9       Q.   Witness F, prior to the break, you'd
         10  identified General Krstic as a man that was present in
         11  Potocari during this time frame.  When was the first
         12  time you saw General Krstic's face after seeing him in
         13  Potocari during this time frame?
         14       A.   On the second day.
         15       Q.   Okay.  That wasn't exactly my question, but
         16  I'll go back to that.  So the first day being the day
         17  that the soldiers, the VRS soldiers, first arrived in
         18  Potocari, again, which day did you actually see General
         19  Krstic?
         20       A.   On the first day, the day of the fall of the
         21  enclave.
         22       Q.   All right.  So you saw him on the day that
         23  soldiers first came into the enclave?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   How about the second day?

          1       A.   I also saw him once in front of the
          2  compound.  At the time, he was together with several
          3  military, I think higher ranking ones.
          4       Q.   When you saw him in front of the compound
          5  with other high-ranking military people, was that the
          6  first day or the second day?
          7       A.   The first day.
          8       Q.   Did you ever see him on the second day?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   Where did you see him on the second day?
         11       A.   Around the compound, in the vicinity, and the
         12  White House, in that area.
         13       Q.   What was he doing when you saw him there on
         14  the second day?
         15       A.   Mostly nothing.  They didn't do much.  They
         16  just looked whether everything was going according to
         17  plan.  They didn't give any direct commands.  It was
         18  all led by officers, by NCOs.  It was already
         19  prepared.
         20       Q.   Now, the first day you saw him with officers
         21  in the vicinity of the compound, what did you see that
         22  time, on that first day?
         23       A.   The first day, they wanted to enter the
         24  compound, to see how many men there were at that moment
         25  in the compound, refugees who had been hiding in our

          1  compound.  So they were kind of consulting at the gate
          2  whether they could enter or not.
          3       Q.   When you say "they," again, who do you mean?
          4       A.   The high-ranking military, security units who
          5  had to secure the officers.
          6       Q.   And General Krstic was in that group?
          7       A.   The security was nervous because the compound
          8  was not yet secured.  They were nervous, they thought
          9  there might be armed fighters inside.  So they had not
         10  yet personally secured the compound.
         11       Q.   I need to go back and clarify the record.  I
         12  didn't hear an answer to my question whether or not you
         13  saw General Krstic in that group of officers outside
         14  the compound.
         15       A.   Yes, he was also present.
         16       Q.   Now, going back to a question I asked a while
         17  back, when was the -- after seeing General Krstic in
         18  Potocari, how many days, weeks, or years later did you
         19  next -- was it until you next saw his face?
         20       A.   I've never, ever seen his face again, after
         21  those pictures.
         22       Q.   You were shown some pictures, weren't you?
         23       A.   That's correct.
         24       Q.   And when were you shown pictures of General
         25  Krstic?

          1       A.   After I had been called to the Tribunal,
          2  those photographs were put in front of me, and I was
          3  asked whether I had ever seen this man before.
          4       Q.   That was within the last two or three days,
          5  wasn't it?
          6       A.   That's correct.
          7       Q.   And I'm the person that showed you those
          8  photographs.
          9       A.   That's totally correct.
         10       Q.   When I showed you those photographs, were you
         11  able to recognise the person in the photographs?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Is that the same person that you see in court
         14  today?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16       Q.   Is there any doubt in your mind that the
         17  person you see in court today is the same person you
         18  saw in Potocari during the time period we're talking
         19  about?
         20       A.   No, I have no doubts.
         21       Q.   During the separation process, did you
         22  witness any Serb troops using any violence against the
         23  men?
         24       A.   When I was outside the compound, standing
         25  outside the compound, the people were separated.  It

          1  had to happen fast.  There were older people amongst
          2  them and children, women with babies and with
          3  belongings.  It was a hot day.  They didn't have any
          4  water.  If they didn't hurry, those people, sometimes
          5  they were kicked, they were beaten, they were pushed.
          6  Many people fell because of that, and some kind of
          7  traffic jams resulted.  And they panicked.  The buses
          8  were loaded so full that people were squashed inside
          9  the buses.  They didn't get any water for the way, no
         10  food.  The windows could not be opened.  It was like a
         11  hot tin oven, it was so hot.  Yes, indeed, there was
         12  kicking, beating, spitting, shouting.
         13       Q.   Were you able to recognise any other Bosnian
         14  Serb officers present at Potocari on that first day?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16       Q.   And who was that?
         17       A.   General Mladic was present.
         18       Q.   What did you see Mladic doing?
         19       A.   He was in the vicinity of the refugees, with
         20  lots of security guards.  There was a camera crew
         21  there.  They distributed candy.  They acted kindly
         22  towards children and elderly people; they even patted
         23  their heads in front of the camera's eye, and they
         24  tried to act friendly, to be friendly.  They said,
         25  "Don't worry.  Nothing bad is going to happen, and you

          1  will be taken away to safety."
          2       Q.   And then what happened?
          3       A.   After the camera crew stopped filming, the
          4  General turned around, he laughed.  The soldiers took
          5  the candy back, took the cigarettes back.  They spit at
          6  the children and at the women, and they were taken away
          7  directly.
          8       Q.   Besides Krstic and Mladic, did you recognise
          9  any other Serb soldier or officer by name?
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me.  He said they were
         11  taken away directly.  Who was taken away, and where?
         12       A.   The refugees who at that point in time were
         13  around the house, who had been given the candies, they
         14  were taken away immediately.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:  Where?  To where?
         16       A.   After the film crew had stopped, after the
         17  film had been taken.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  I just want to understand the
         19  word "away."  To the buses?  To the White House?
         20  Where?
         21       A.   Directly to the buses.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.
         23            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Your Honour.
         24       Q.   Did you recognise any other Bosnian Serb
         25  officer by name that was present in Potocari?

          1       A.   Not by name, not directly by name.
          2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  I'd like to show the witness
          3  Exhibit 28-13.1.
          4       Q.   Do you recognise the person depicted in that
          5  photograph?
          6       A.   That's correct, I recognise him.
          7       Q.   Where did you see him?
          8       A.   I saw him at OP Papa, at the time the convoys
          9  were not allowed to go through, and we negotiated with
         10  him, and I saw him on the day the enclave fell.
         11       Q.   Okay.  To try to clear up -- you're talking
         12  about two different time periods now.  One time period
         13  has to do with the convoys and convoys not being able
         14  to get through; is that right?
         15       A.   That's correct.  That was about halfway
         16  through my time in Srebrenica.
         17       Q.   So at least some weeks prior to the fall of
         18  the enclave.
         19       A.   That's right.
         20       Q.   And where did you next see this person in the
         21  exhibit, 28-13.1?
         22       A.   In the vicinity of the compound and the
         23  refugees.
         24       Q.   What day?
         25       A.   The first day.

          1       Q.   How about the second day?
          2       A.   He was also there.
          3       Q.   And what was he doing in the vicinity of the
          4  refugees that first day?
          5       A.   Not much.  This man was standing there.  He
          6  only talked to officers, not to subordinates.  He was a
          7  quiet man.  He certainly had a lot of authority.
          8       Q.   And were you able to recognise any of the
          9  officers or Bosnian Serb soldiers you saw him talking
         10  to on that first day?
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   And who was that?
         13       A.   The gentleman in this courtroom.
         14       Q.   The person you've identified in this
         15  courtroom previously?
         16       A.   That's right.
         17            MR. McCLOSKEY: [Previous translation
         18  continues] ... indicating General Krstic, for the
         19  record.
         20       Q.   Can you describe what you saw with General
         21  Krstic and this fellow, where they were, what they were
         22  doing?
         23       A.   Those people had to laugh, and they found it
         24  all very jolly, what happened, in my opinion, at
         25  least.  They were present in order to see that

          1  everything was going according to plan, and sometimes
          2  they gave commands, they gave orders, or they told
          3  people what to do, or it was reported to them how the
          4  situation was progressing.  This group of persons
          5  mainly consisted of officers who watched the situation
          6  from the outside.
          7       Q.   Did you see General Mladic around these two
          8  people, General Krstic and this person in this
          9  photograph?
         10       A.   Yes.
         11       Q.   And was he involved in the discussions with
         12  them in any way?
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   And did you see a major who you had become
         15  familiar with prior to the fall of the enclave?
         16       A.   I don't understand the question.
         17       Q.   Do you recognise the name Nikolic?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   And who's Major Nikolic?
         20       A.   He's a high-ranking officer with lots of
         21  authority.  Well, at first sight, he's a friendly man,
         22  a fatherly type, also business-like type.  Many
         23  subordinates became very nervous when he was around.
         24       Q.   And how did you become familiar with Major
         25  Nikolic?

          1       A.   I'm sorry.
          2            THE INTERPRETER:  I'm sorry.  I didn't
          3  understand what the witness said.  The interpreter is
          4  asking for the witness to start his statement again.
          5  Could you please ask the witness to repeat.
          6            MR. McCLOSKEY:
          7       Q.   Let me interrupt you for a minute.  We have a
          8  little translation glitch, so let me ask you again.
          9            How did you know Major Nikolic?  Where did
         10  you know him from?
         11       A.   When I was at OP Papa, as an observer, we
         12  often went to the enclave's border as a kind of --
         13  there was a kind of guardhouse, there were guards.
         14  Often we consulted about the convoys which were not
         15  allowed through, the convoys with food, and he was
         16  present often.
         17       Q.   And did you see Major Nikolic in Potocari on
         18  the first day, the day that Serb soldiers came in?
         19       A.   Yes, he was present.
         20       Q.   And where did you see him?
         21       A.   In the vicinity of the compound.
         22       Q.   And do you know who he was with?
         23       A.   Mainly with the high-ranking officers, and he
         24  had his own security guard.  Mainly he drove in a blue
         25  Golf.

          1       Q.   Okay.  I'm going to take you away from that
          2  first day and into the second day.  Where did you spend
          3  the night of that first day?
          4       A.   Where I spent the night is perhaps saying too
          5  much.  We just kept on working.  Mainly I was on the
          6  compound with the refugees, in the big hall.
          7       Q.   And did you ever find any dead Muslims in the
          8  compound?
          9       A.   Yes.
         10       Q.   When was that?
         11       A.   Mainly during the beginning of the evening,
         12  on the compound itself.
         13       Q.   Was that the first day or the second day?
         14       A.   From the first to the second day.
         15       Q.   And can you describe what you saw?
         16       A.   The people on the compound were very
         17  frightened, they didn't know what to expect.  Some
         18  people had hanged themselves.  Actually, they had
         19  been -- they had injured themselves.  There were dead
         20  babies lying, wrapped in clothes.  There were bodies
         21  around, visible, yes.
         22       Q.   And the next morning, what did you do, the
         23  morning of the second day?
         24       A.   We continued our day with our duties, in
         25  preparing the buses and trucks, to reconnoitre the

          1  vicinity.  Those were our duties.
          2       Q.   And did you make a specific reconnoitre for
          3  some reason?
          4       A.   Several times I made a round of the compound,
          5  mainly in the hall where the injured people were, and
          6  indeed I was there several times and I saw a wounded
          7  soldier whom I had met before.
          8       Q.   And did you talk to him?
          9       A.   I talked to that man.
         10       Q.   What language?
         11       A.   In English.
         12       Q.   And what did he say to you?
         13       A.   This soldier was about my age.  We recognised
         14  each other, we knew each other from OP Sierra.  He
         15  asked me what was going on outside and what was going
         16  to happen to him.  He had injured himself; his arm, his
         17  leg, his head were injured.  I asked, "What happened?"
         18  And he said, "I was in a fight with Serb military."  I
         19  asked about his friend, because he had been with a
         20  friend before.  His friend had been killed in a fight,
         21  and he had fled towards the compound.  He asked me,
         22  "What's going to happen to me?" and I couldn't give
         23  him a direct answer to that.  I mean, I could have done
         24  so, but it's very difficult to tell him that he, being
         25  a man, will be taken away, because separations are

          1  taking place.  So I didn't tell him much.  He said to
          2  me, "You don't have to tell me.  I know what's going to
          3  happen.  I'm going to be taken away and killed."  So I
          4  just nodded my head and I saw the fear in his eyes.
          5  There wasn't much I could do.  I stood powerless.  And
          6  I haven't seen him since.
          7       Q.   On the second day, did you go outside the
          8  compound on a patrol and find anything?
          9       A.   On the second day, I indeed continued with my
         10  duties.  Indeed, I walked around the compound, yes.
         11       Q.   And outside the compound, did you find
         12  anything significant?
         13       A.   Outside the compound, many belongings were
         14  lying around, things belonging to people who had left
         15  their things people.  I found passports, stuff, and
         16  bodies, dead bodies.
         17       Q.   And where did you find the dead bodies?
         18       A.   Behind the White House, the interrogation
         19  house.
         20       Q.   Did you find any bodies up by a creek
         21  anywhere?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   And where is that?
         24       A.   Behind the White House, about 700 metres from
         25  the compound, there is a kind of electricity house.  I

          1  was very familiar with this route because I had
          2  patrolled it many times.
          3       Q.   Now, when you say "behind the White House,"
          4  are you referring to the bodies that you found in the
          5  creek, or were they other bodies actually right behind
          6  the White House?
          7       A.   Further away, behind the White House.
          8       Q.   So you just found one group of bodies.
          9       A.   Yes.  I found nine -- I saw nine to ten
         10  corpses.
         11       Q.   And were you able to photograph them?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, I'd like to
         14  show the witness what has been marked OTP Exhibit
         15  5/3A.
         16       Q.   Could you take the green pen that you have in
         17  front of you and draw a circle around the area where
         18  you photographed these bodies.
         19       A.   [Marks]
         20            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we put that on the ELMO
         21  so that we can all see that.
         22       Q.   Is there a creek in the vicinity of the area
         23  where you found the bodies, or a stream?
         24       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         25       Q.   And could you mark -- do you recall where the

          1  stream was?
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   Can you mark with a green pen where you
          4  recall the stream being?
          5       A.   [Marks]
          6       Q.   Okay.  Could you also circle the White House,
          7  as your recollection serves you, where it was on this
          8  photograph?
          9       A.   [Marks]
         10       Q.   Okay.  Thank you.  Can you describe the
         11  situation, how it was that you came and found these
         12  bodies?
         13       A.   That day there had been rumours already,
         14  rumours about it being possible that there might be
         15  corpses in the vicinity.  Shots had been heard in the
         16  whole area.  And those were just rumours, actually.
         17            I had time to spare, and I just went into the
         18  area.  I thought, "I won't go too far because I'm
         19  alone."  Everybody else was busy, and anything could
         20  happen.  "So if anything goes wrong, they will miss me
         21  straight away."  And I met a colleague, he was higher
         22  in rank than I, and we started talking.  And he asked
         23  me what I was doing there at that point in time, and I
         24  said, "Well, I heard a rumour of corpses being around
         25  here," and he said, "I also heard that."

          1            So after this exchange, we went on together
          2  and we took a path which went towards -- leading
          3  towards the location I circled, and there is where I
          4  found the bodies.  So the rumour was true.
          5       Q.   And how close did you get to the bodies when
          6  you photographed them?
          7       A.   I was on a hill, this brook or creek was
          8  about 20 metres away, and there were the bodies.  My
          9  colleague was standing on guard because there were many
         10  Serb soldiers in the vicinity, those Rambo-types.
         11       Q.   All right.
         12            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we show the witness
         13  Exhibit 59.
         14       Q.   And is this -- number 59, is this one of the
         15  photographs that you took?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   It doesn't come out very well on the ELMO,
         18  but there is a figure that's outlined with two white
         19  stripes.  Were you the one that outlined that figure
         20  and those two white stripes over the photograph?  Were
         21  you the one that outlined the figure with those two
         22  white stripes, Witness?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   It doesn't come out on the ELMO at all, but
         25  could you just give your best effort to point at the

          1  photograph with your pointer and outline where you
          2  believe a figure is.
          3       A.   [Indicates].  This is his head, this black
          4  part is his hair, and this little white spot is his
          5  face.  This man was wearing a blue vest over his white
          6  shirt.  This is his blue vest.  And this is his arm and
          7  a white shirt.  This white part, this is the colour of
          8  his white shirt.  Here is the creek, and this was the
          9  first man who was lying there, and the others were
         10  lying along that line here [indicates], downwards.
         11            MR. McCLOSKEY:  For the record, he indicated
         12  that the creek was below the figure of the person and
         13  that the line where the other bodies were lying was
         14  going from the figure left towards the right of the
         15  photograph.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         17  Mr. McCloskey, sorry to interrupt you, but we are
         18  talking about the 12th of July.  That is when the
         19  photograph was taken.  I should like to know, when was
         20  this photograph taken?
         21            MR. McCLOSKEY:
         22       Q.   Can we clear up the actual date that this
         23  photograph was taken?  If you don't know the date, was
         24  it the first day the soldiers came in or the second
         25  day?

          1       A.   The second day.  The first day, we were too
          2  busy with helping the refugees and there weren't many
          3  people walking around in the vicinity.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I do
          5  apologise for insisting, but could you give us the
          6  date?
          7            MR. McCLOSKEY:
          8       Q.   Do you know the actual date that this
          9  occurred?  Excuse me.  That you saw this.
         10       A.   The 12th.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         12            MR. McCLOSKEY:
         13       Q.   Now, were you able to take photographs of
         14  other bodies in the area, near this body?
         15       A.   I took several pictures of corpses which were
         16  lying there.  These men were in a line, lying in a
         17  line, but as you can see yourselves, the foliage was
         18  very heavy and, to repeat again, I was on the ridge of
         19  the hill and there were many soldiers around.  So I
         20  almost risked my own life in order to take these
         21  pictures, but, indeed, I took several pictures.
         22       Q.   And you're not a photographer, I take it.
         23       A.   As you can see from these pictures.
         24            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Could we show the witness
         25  Exhibit 60, and 61 shortly after that.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          2  Mr. McCloskey, I think that we perhaps could adjourn
          3  after we see those photographs.
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Mr. President.
          5       Q.   Now, again, prior to coming into court today,
          6  did you have a chance to study this photograph and mark
          7  certain outlines with white stripes?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   And is this one of the photographs you took,
         10  this number 60?
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   And does seeing it help refresh your
         13  recollection about where the bodies were lying?
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   It's really impossible to tell from the
         16  photographs any bodies from this photograph, but have
         17  you attempted to outline your recollection of where the
         18  bodies were, from what you could see in the photograph?
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   And can you explain it?
         21       A.   Here is the first victim [indicates], in our
         22  first picture.  The second victim is lying here
         23  [indicates]; this man was wearing black clothes; here
         24  is where he was lying.  Here is another victim
         25  [indicates].  This man is wearing white trousers.

          1  These are his legs and this is his face.
          2            To repeat, this is the direction of the
          3  stream, downwards.
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  And, for the record, the
          5  witness spoke of the first victim on the far left; the
          6  next he spoke of was in the middle; and the next was to
          7  the right of the middle person.  And the stream is at
          8  the -- below the white markings.
          9       Q.   And could you also now look at number 61.
         10  Does the same hold true for 61?  Is this a photograph
         11  that you previously looked at and had a chance to mark?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   And this is one of the photographs you took
         14  that day?
         15       A.   Yes.
         16       Q.   Can you describe what you can about this
         17  photograph?
         18       A.   Just to give you a picture, this is where the
         19  creek is running [indicates].  Here was a body, with
         20  his -- facing the creek, and here [indicates] another
         21  body.  That's the first body in the first picture, the
         22  man wearing a blue vest, white sleeves, and black
         23  hair.
         24            MR. McCLOSKEY:  The record should indicate
         25  the first -- the body you discussed first on this

          1  photograph is to the left; the next body you discussed
          2  is to the right; and you pointed that the creek was
          3  down below both these bodies.
          4            Mr. President, this may be a good time to
          5  take the break or adjourn for the day.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
          7  Mr. McCloskey.  We shall therefore adjourn, and
          8  tomorrow at half past nine, we shall be resuming.
          9  Until tomorrow, then.
         10                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned
         11                 at 2.35 p.m., to be reconvened on
         12                 Wednesday, the 29th day of March,
         13                 2000, at 9.30 a.m.
