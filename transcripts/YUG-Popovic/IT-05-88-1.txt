          1                 Monday, 7th December, 1998
          2                 (Open session)
          3                 --- Upon commencing at 11.15 a.m.
          4            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Please be
          5  seated.  Registrar, have the accused brought in,
          6  please.
          7            What is the number of the case, please?  The
          8  case number on our docket.
          9            THE REGISTRAR:  (Interpretation)  This is
         10  IT-98-33-I, the Prosecutor of the Tribunal against
         11  Radislav Krstic.
         12            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  For the time
         13  being, please be seated, Mr. Krstic.
         14            Thank you.  First of all, I would like to
         15  have the representatives for both of the parties.
         16  First, the Prosecution.
         17            MS. HOLLIS:  Good morning, Your Honours.  I
         18  am Brenda Hollis, and along with my colleagues
         19  Mr. Peter McCloskey and Ms. Ann Sutherland.  We appear
         20  on behalf of the Prosecutor.
         21            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you.
         22  Let me turn to Defence counsel for Mr. Krstic.
         23            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)  Mr. President
         24  and distinguished members of the Tribunal, my name is
         25  Nenad Petrusic, a lawyer from Belgrade, a member of the

          1  Lawyers' Chamber and I have been chosen to defend
          2  General Krstic.
          3            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you.
          4  Today's hearing is an initial appearance which is
          5  carried pursuant to the Rules of Procedure and Evidence
          6  in effect of International Tribunal for the former
          7  Yugoslavia and this always follows the arrest of an
          8  accused.
          9            In this case, the accused, Mr. Krstic, is now
         10  going to rise and tell us his name, his given name, his
         11  place and date of birth, his profession, and his
         12  domicile up to the point of his arrest.  Please,
         13  proceed.
         14            THE ACCUSED:  (Interpretation)  My name is
         15  General Lieutenant-Colonel Radislav.  I am the
         16  commander of the 5th Corps of the army of the Republika
         17  Srpska.  I was born on the 15th of February, 1948 in
         18  Vlasenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Before I was arrested,
         19  I performed the -- my duties in Sokolac and my family
         20  lives in Belgrade.
         21            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you.
         22  You may be seated for the time being.  The
         23  interpretation said General Colonel.  Could you explain
         24  that to me, please?  Are you a General or are you a
         25  Colonel in the Republika Srpska army?

          1            THE ACCUSED:  (Interpretation)  I am
          2  Lieutenant General of the army of the Republika
          3  Srpska.
          4            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you.
          5  You may be seated for the time being.  Let me remind
          6  you that further to the text in effect at the
          7  International Criminal Tribunal, I had read some
          8  relevant passages from the Statute, and will ask the
          9  registrar to read the relevant passages from the Rules
         10  of Procedure and Evidence.
         11            I would like to recall that further to the
         12  Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal,
         13  specifically Articles 21 and 22, all persons against
         14  whom indictments have been confirmed, which is the case
         15  in here, and further to an order for a warrant of
         16  arrest which is issued by the International Criminal
         17  Tribunal to arrest, and the accused must be informed of
         18  the accusations against that person and then to be
         19  transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal,
         20  which is the case today.
         21            Furthermore, the Trial Chamber must read the
         22  indictment, and to be sure that the rights of the
         23  accused have been respected, to confirm that the
         24  accused understood the contents of the indictment, and
         25  ask him to plead guilty or not guilty, and the Trial

          1  Chamber will then set the date for the trial.
          2            There are other relevant passages relating to
          3  the rights of the accused.  That is Article 21(1), (2),
          4  (3), (4); the person shall be informed of the charges
          5  against him, informed promptly and in detail, in a
          6  language which he understands, of the nature and cause
          7  of the charge against him, to have adequate time and
          8  facilities for the preparation of his defence and
          9  communicate with counsel of his own choosing, and to be
         10  tried, of course, without undue delay, to be tried in
         11  his presence, and if he does not have counsel, to be
         12  informed of his right to have counsel, and if he does
         13  not, the Tribunal will assign one to him.
         14            It is under those conditions that
         15  Mr. Petrusic -- Mr. Petrusic, excuse me for
         16  mispronouncing your name -- was appointed -- did the
         17  Registry appoint you, Mr. Petrusic, or was it the
         18  accused who appointed you?  Please rise and tell us
         19  under which conditions you were appointed.
         20            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)
         21  Mr. President, I was elected by General Krstic to act
         22  as his Defence counsel, and if we're talking about
         23  language, the official language of the Tribunal, and as
         24  you have mentioned that Rule, I would like to say a few
         25  words in that regard, if I may.  If you will allow me

          1  to do so.
          2            You do?  Thank you very much.  I know that
          3  according to the Rules of the Tribunal, the official
          4  language used is English or French.  I speak neither of
          5  these two languages, but I do hope that this Trial
          6  Chamber will allow me to use Serbian, the language that
          7  the accused uses, and all further correspondence and
          8  anything in writing, any written documents necessary
          9  and any briefs will be in one of the official languages
         10  of this Tribunal.  So in that regard, there will be no
         11  difficulty in communicating, that is, between the
         12  Defence and the Tribunal.  Thank you.
         13            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you.
         14  Turning to the Prosecutor, will that cause any
         15  problems, that is the fact that Defence counsel does
         16  not speak either of the two official languages of the
         17  Tribunal?
         18            MS. HOLLIS:  Your Honours, given the
         19  qualification that Defence counsel just announced, and
         20  that is that pleadings, and correspondence and other
         21  written submissions would be in one of the official
         22  languages of the Tribunal, it would seem that the only
         23  thing that would be only in the Serbian language would
         24  be presentations made in court or in other proceedings,
         25  and the Prosecution would have no objection to that.

          1            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Very well.
          2  Thank you.  I think that there's no objection from my
          3  colleagues.  Under those conditions we can continue
          4  with the hearing, provided for also in Rule 62 of our
          5  Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
          6            Turning to the registrar, we'll ask him to
          7  read that Rule.  Please read it slowly so the accused
          8  can understand what is being said in his own language.
          9            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)
         10  Rule 62, initial appearance of the accused. "Upon the
         11  transfer of an accused to the seat of a Tribunal, the
         12  President shall forthwith assign the case to a Trial
         13  Chamber.  The accused shall be brought before that
         14  Trial Chamber without delay, and shall be formally
         15  charged.  The Trial Chamber shall:
         16            (i) satisfy itself that the right of the
         17  accused to counsel is respected;
         18            (ii) read or have the indictment read to the
         19  accused in a language the accused speaks and
         20  understands, and satisfy itself that the accused
         21  understands the indictment;
         22            (iii) call upon the accused to enter a plea
         23  of guilty or not guilty on each count; should the
         24  accused fail to do so, enter a plea of not guilty on
         25  the accused's behalf;

          1            (iv) in case of a plea of not guilty,
          2  instruct the registrar to set a date for trial;
          3            (v) in case of a plea of guilty, act in
          4  accordance with Rule 62 bis;
          5            (vi) instruct the registrar to set such other
          6  dates as appropriate."
          7            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you very
          8  much.  Of course, we will read Rule 62 bis only
          9  depending upon the plea entered by General Petrusic.  I
         10  still don't understand if he's a General or Colonel,
         11  because his Defence counsel gives him the rank of
         12  General, he himself says Colonel.
         13            All right.  Let's move on.  All right.
         14  General Krstic.  Thank you.
         15            We are now going to move to reading the
         16  indictment and this is how we will proceed.  The
         17  indictment will be read by the registrar, and when the
         18  charges are read, I will ask the accused if he pleads
         19  guilty or not guilty.  First of all, I would like to be
         20  sure, by asking Mr. Petrusic, whether as soon as the
         21  accused arrived in the detention centre that the
         22  indictment was given to the accused and that he
         23  understood the contents of that indictment.  Did he,
         24  Mr. Petrusic?
         25            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)

          1  Mr. President, in the course of yesterday I spent 4
          2  hours talking to my defendant.  General Krstic has
          3  received the indictment, he has understood the
          4  indictment, so that at today's hearing he will be
          5  pleading on all the counts contained in the
          6  indictment.
          7            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you,
          8  Mr. Petrusic.  The Prosecutor, to whom I will give the
          9  floor, has informed the Trial Chamber that the
         10  indictment that had been issued, among other things,
         11  against General Krstic had been subject to an order for
         12  non-disclosure from one of my colleagues who had
         13  confirmed it.
         14            This order for non-disclosure might also
         15  involve other people indicted in this indictment and
         16  that they be confirmed by the Judges as well.  I give
         17  the floor to the Prosecutor.
         18            MS. HOLLIS:  Yes, Your Honours, we would
         19  remind you of the existing order that was issued by the
         20  confirming Judge pursuant to Rule 53, and we would ask
         21  that you confirm the ongoing nature of that order as to
         22  any other co-accused that may exist.
         23            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Are there any
         24  comments from the Defence, Mr. Petrusic, while the
         25  Judges deliberate quickly at the bench?

          1            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)  I have no
          2  objections, Your Honour.
          3            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  All right.
          4  Thank you.  Let me consult with my colleagues.
          5            Thank you to my colleagues.  The Trial
          6  Chamber, this morning, confirms that referring to
          7  exceptional circumstances as covered by Rule 53(A)
          8  says, "In exceptional circumstances, a Judge or a Trial
          9  Chamber may, in the interests of justice, order the
         10  non-disclosure to the public of any documents or
         11  information until further order."
         12            We can also, pursuant to Rule 53(C), "In
         13  consultation with the Prosecutor, also order that
         14  there be no disclosure of an indictment, or part
         15  thereof, or have all or any part of any particular
         16  document or information.
         17            The Judges note that there is no objection
         18  from the Defence, and that under those conditions the
         19  registrar is now going to read the indictment against
         20  Mr. Krstic, but only as regards the relevant parts for
         21  the accused in this courtroom today.
         22            Lastly, let me remind Mr. Krstic that when I
         23  tell him to rise he will rise, and then the charge or
         24  charges will be read.  At that point I will ask you
         25  whether you intend to plead guilty or not guilty.

          1  After that, we will, in a public session, organise the
          2  proceedings that will follow this hearing, which should
          3  lead to the trial.
          4            If there are no other comments, I will ask
          5  the registrar to rise and to read the indictment
          6  against -- excuse me, Mr. Petrusic.  Yes, go ahead.
          7            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)  I apologise
          8  to Your Honours and members of the Trial Chamber, but,
          9  Mr. President, when the indictment has been read out
         10  and when General Krstic pleads as to whether he is
         11  guilty or not guilty, that he be allowed, because of
         12  serious injuries, and I'll say a little more about that
         13  later on, may he remain seated, because if he has to
         14  get up, it will be difficult for him and I beg the
         15  Court's indulgence in this matter.
         16            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Any objection
         17  from the Prosecution?
         18            MS. HOLLIS:  We have no objection, Your
         19  Honours.
         20            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  All right.
         21  The accused may remain seated when he's asked to plead
         22  guilty or not guilty.  Now, turning to the registrar,
         23  would you please read the indictment against the
         24  accused this morning?
         25            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)  This is

          1  IT-98-33-I the Prosecutor against Radislav Krstic.
          2  Indictment:  The Prosecutor of the International
          3  Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, pursuant
          4  to her authority under Article 18 of the Statute of the
          5  Tribunal, charges Radislav Krstic with genocide, crimes
          6  against humanity and violations of the laws or customs
          7  of war as set together below.
          8            Background:  After armed conflict erupted in
          9  the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the spring of
         10  1992, Bosnian Serb military and paramilitary forces
         11  occupied cities, towns and villages in the eastern part
         12  of the country and participated in an ethnic cleansing
         13  campaign which resulted in an exodus of Bosnian Muslim
         14  civilians to enclaves in Srebrenica, Gorazde and Zepa.
         15            On 16 April, 1993, the Security Council of
         16  the United Nations, acting pursuant to Chapter VII of
         17  its Charter, adopted Resolution 819, in which it
         18  demanded that all parties to the conflict in the
         19  Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina treat Srebrenica and
         20  its surroundings as a safe area, which was to be free
         21  from any armed attack or any other hostile act.
         22            On or about 6 July, 1995, units of the Drina
         23  Corps of the Bosnia Serb army, the VRS, shelled
         24  Srebrenica and attacked Dutch-manned United Nations
         25  observation posts which were located in the safe area.

          1  The Drina Corps attack on the Srebrenica safe area
          2  continued through 11 July, 1995, when forces from the
          3  Drina Wolves, the Bratunac Brigade and other units of
          4  the VRS entered Srebrenica.
          5            The Bosnian Muslim men, women and children
          6  who were in Srebrenica after the beginning of the VRS
          7  attack took two courses of action.  Several thousand
          8  women, children, and some mostly elderly men fled to
          9  the UN compound in Potocari, located within the safe
         10  area of Srebrenica, where they sought the protection of
         11  the Dutch battalion.  The Bosnian Muslim civilians
         12  remained in and around Potocari from 11 July until 13
         13  July, 1995, when they were evacuated by buses and
         14  trucks under the control of the VRS.
         15            A second group of approximately 15,000
         16  Bosnian Muslim men, with some women and children,
         17  gathered at Susnjari village near Srebrenica during the
         18  evening of 11 July, 1995, and fled, in a huge column,
         19  through the woods towards Tuzla.  Approximately
         20  one-third of this group consisted of armed Bosnian
         21  Muslim military personnel.  The rest were unarmed
         22  military personnel and civilians.
         23            On or about 12 July, 1995, Ratko Mladic and
         24  Radislav Krstic, as well as other VRS and Bosnian Serb
         25  civilian representatives, met in the motel Fontana in

          1  Bratunac with Dutch military officers and
          2  representatives of the Bosnian Muslim refugees from
          3  Potocari.  At this meeting, Ratko Mladic explained to
          4  the group that he would supervise the evacuation of
          5  refugees from Potocari and wanted to see all the
          6  Bosnian Muslim men between approximately the ages of 16
          7  and 60 to screen for possible war criminals.
          8            On or about 12 July, 1995, in the presence of
          9  Ratko Mladic and Radislav Krstic, approximately 50 to
         10  60 buses and trucks arrived at the military compound in
         11  Potocari.  Shortly after the arrival of these vehicles,
         12  the deportation process of Bosnian Muslim refugees
         13  started.  As Bosnian Muslim women, children and men
         14  started to board the buses and trucks, Bosnian Serb
         15  military personnel separated the men from the women and
         16  children, and detained the men in and around Potocari.
         17            Between the evening of 11 July 1995 and the
         18  morning of 12 July 1995, the Bosnian Muslims who had
         19  gathered in Susnjari formed a huge column and began
         20  their trek through the woods towards Tuzla.
         21            Bosnian Serb forces supported by armoured
         22  personnel carriers, tanks, anti-aircraft guns and
         23  artillery, positioned themselves along the
         24  Bratunac-Milici road in an attempt to intercept the
         25  column.  Some of the armed members of the retreating

          1  column of Bosnian Muslims engaged in combat with the
          2  Bosnian Serb forces.  Thousands of Bosnian Muslims from
          3  the retreating column were captured by or surrendered
          4  to Bosnian Serb military forces under the command and
          5  control of Ratko Mladic and Radislav Krstic.
          6            Between 11 July 1995 and 18 July 1995, VRS
          7  forces under the command and control of Ratko Mladic
          8  and Radislav Krstic participated in numerous incidents
          9  of opportunistic killings of Bosnian Muslim men shortly
         10  after they had been captured, as well as systematic
         11  summary executions of Bosnian Muslim men who were
         12  initially detained and then transported to various
         13  execution sites throughout the territory under the
         14  control of the VRS Drina Corps.  The VRS forces under
         15  the command and control of Ratko Mladic and Radislav
         16  Krstic executed thousands of Bosnian Muslim men.
         17            Between 10 July 1995 and 18 July 1995, the
         18  VRS forces under the command and control of Ratko
         19  Mladic and Radislav Krstic either expelled or killed
         20  most of the members of the Bosnian Muslim population of
         21  the Srebrenica enclave.  As a result of these actions,
         22  the VRS forces virtually eliminated the presence of any
         23  Bosnian Muslims in the Srebrenica enclave area, thus
         24  continuing an ethnic cleansing campaign which had begun
         25  in the spring of 1992.

          1            The Accused.
          2            Radislav Krstic was a Lieutenant Colonel in
          3  the JNA before the armed conflict in Bosnia and
          4  Herzegovina.  Krstic served as commander of the 2nd
          5  Romanija Motorised Brigade, which was first a component
          6  of the Sarajevo Romanija Corps but was later
          7  transferred to the Drina Corps in 1992.  He continued
          8  to serve as the commander of the brigade until late
          9  1994.  From January 1995 through 14 July 1995, he was
         10  Chief of Staff, Deputy Commander of the VRS Drina
         11  Corps.  He was promoted to the rank of General-Major in
         12  June of 1995.  On or before 14 July 1995, he assumed
         13  command of the Drina Corps.  His assumption of command
         14  was publicly announced on 20 July 1995.  In April 1998
         15  he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel
         16  General and is currently the commander of the VRS 5th
         17  Corps in Sokolac.
         18            Superior Authority.
         19            When the Srebrenica operation began on or
         20  about 6 July 1995, Radislav Krstic held the rank of
         21  General Major with the position of Chief of Staff,
         22  Deputy Commander of the Drina Corps.  As Chief of Staff
         23  Deputy Commander of the Drina Corps, Radislav Krstic
         24  was responsible for directing the activities of the
         25  Corps staff.  He was responsible for monitoring the

          1  activities of all units and activities within the Corps
          2  zone of responsibility, and also act as adviser to his
          3  Corps Commander.  As Chief of Staff he was concurrently
          4  the Corps Deputy Commander, empowered to give orders on
          5  behalf of the Commander in his absence, and to give
          6  supplementing orders to insure implementation of the
          7  Commander's orders.  When Radislav Krstic became the
          8  Commander of the Drina Corps on or before 14 July 1995,
          9  his responsibilities increased to include planning and
         10  directing the activities of all subordinate units in
         11  his zone of responsibility and monitoring their
         12  activities to insure his orders were implemented.
         13            General Allegations.
         14            At all times relevant to this indictment a
         15  state of armed conflict existed in the Republic of
         16  Bosnia and Herzegovina.
         17            At all relevant times Radislav Krstic was
         18  required to abide by the laws or customs governing the
         19  conduct of war.
         20            All acts and omissions charged as crimes
         21  against humanity were part of a widespread or
         22  systematic attack directed against the Bosnian Muslim
         23  civilian population of Srebrenica and its
         24  surroundings.
         25            Radislav Krstic is individually responsible

          1  for the crimes alleged against him in this indictment
          2  pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Tribunal statute.
          3  Individual criminal responsibility includes committing,
          4  planning, instigating, ordering or otherwise aiding and
          5  abetting in the planning, preparation or execution of
          6  any crimes referred to in Articles 2 to 5 of the
          7  Tribunal Statute.
          8            Radislav Krstic is also, or alternatively,
          9  criminally responsible as a commander for the acts of
         10  his subordinates pursuant to Article 7(3) of the
         11  Tribunal Statute.  Such criminal responsibility is the
         12  responsibility of a superior for the acts of his
         13  subordinates if he knew or had reason to know that his
         14  subordinate was about to commit such acts or had done
         15  so and the superior failed to take the necessary and
         16  reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish
         17  the perpetrators thereof.
         18            The general allegations contained in
         19  paragraphs 14 through 18 are realleged and incorporated
         20  into each of the charges set forth below.

         19  Bosnian Muslim men which occurred in several different
         20  locations in and around the Srebrenica enclave from 11
         21  July 1995 until 18 July 1995 included:
         22            Potocari:  Between 12 July 1995 and 13 July
         23  1995, VRS military personnel, under the command of
         24  Radislav Krstic, summarily executed Bosnian Muslim men
         25  at diverse locations around the UN compound at

          1  Potocari where the Bosnian Muslim men had taken
          2  refuge.
          3            Kravica:  On or about 13 July 1995, VRS
          4  soldiers, under the command of Radislav Krstic,
          5  summarily executed hundreds of Bosnian Muslim men who
          6  had been imprisoned in a large warehouse in the village
          7  of Kravica.  The VRS soldiers used automatic weapons,
          8  hand grenades and other weaponry to kill the Bosnian
          9  Muslims inside the warehouse.
         10            Bratunac:  Between 12 July 1995 and 14 July
         11  1995, VRS military personnel, under the command of
         12  Radislav Krstic, transported many of the Bosnian
         13  Muslims who had been detained in Potocari or captured
         14  along the Bratunac-Milici road to locations in and
         15  around Bratunac where they were held in schools,
         16  buildings and vehicles parked along the road.  Between
         17  12 July 1995 and 15 July 1995, VRS military personnel,
         18  under the command of Radislav Krstic, participated in
         19  numerous opportunistic killings of the detained Bosnian
         20  Muslim men at various locations throughout Bratunac.
         21            Tisca:  On or about 12 July 1995 and 13 July
         22  1995, VRS military personnel, under the command of

         24  and children who had been separated from male members
         25  of their families in Potocari to an area near Tisca

          1  village.  Most of the Bosnian Muslim women and children
          2  driven to Tisca were permitted to cross into Bosnian
          3  Muslim territory.  However, VRS military personnel,
          4  under the command of Radislav Krstic, identified and
          5  separated Bosnian Muslim men and some Bosnian Muslim
          6  women.  On or about 12 July 1995 and 13 July 1995, the
          7  VRS military personnel forced the Bosnian Muslim men
          8  and women to walk to a nearby school where they were
          9  taunted and assaulted by VRS soldiers.  On or about 13
         10  July 1995 and 14 July 1995, VRS military personnel,
         11  under the command of Radislav Krstic, loaded 25 Bosnian
         12  Muslim men onto a truck, drove them to an isolated
         13  pasture and summarily executed them.
         14            Orahovac, near Lazete, on or about 14 July
         15  1995, VRS military personnel, under the command of
         16  Radislav Krstic, transported hundreds of Bosnian Muslim
         17  men from in and around Bratunac to the Grbavci School
         18  complex near Orahovac.  On 14 July 1995, VRS military
         19  personnel, under the command of Radislav Krstic,
         20  summarily executed Bosnian Muslim men in and around the
         21  school.  That same day the VRS military personnel
         22  transported the Bosnian Muslim men, many of whom were
         23  blindfolded, from the Grbavci school to the nearby
         24  village of Orahovac.  Once there, VRS military
         25  personnel, under the command of Radislav Krstic,

          1  ordered the Bosnian Muslim men off the trucks and
          2  executed them.  Hundreds of Bosnian Muslim men were
          3  killed.  On or about 14 and 15 July 1995, VRS military
          4  personnel, under the command of Radislav Krstic, used
          5  heavy equipment to bury the victims in mass graves at
          6  the execution site while the executions continued.
          7            The dam near Petkovci:  On or about 14 July
          8  1995, VRS military personnel, under the command of
          9  Radislav Krstic, transported hundreds of Bosnian Muslim
         10  men from detention sites in Bratunac to the school at
         11  Petkovci.  On 14 July 1995, VRS military personnel,
         12  under the command of Radislav Krstic, summarily
         13  executed Bosnian Muslims in and around this school.  On

         15  morning hours of 15 July 1995, VRS military personnel,
         16  under the command of Radislav Krstic, transported
         17  several hundred Bosnian Muslim men from the school at
         18  Petkovci to an area below the dam at Petkovci.  These
         19  people were unloaded from vehicles, led in small groups
         20  to an open area and summarily executed by VRS military

         25  Bosnian Muslim men to an area along a dirt road in the

          1  Cerska Valley, summarily executed them and covered them
          2  with dirt.

          4  military personnel, under the command of Radislav
          5  Krstic, transported hundreds of Bosnian Muslim men from
          6  detention sites in Bratunac to the school at Pilica.
          7  VRS military personnel, under the command of Radislav
          8  Krstic, summarily executed many of the Bosnian Muslim
          9  men who were being detained at the Pilica school.
         10            Branjevo Farm:  On or about 16 July 1995, VRS
         11  military personnel, under the command of Radislav
         12  Krstic, transported hundreds of Bosnian Muslim men from
         13  the Pilica School to the Branjevo Farm.  The Bosnian
         14  Muslim men were unloaded from buses, led in small
         15  groups to an open area and summarily executed with
         16  automatic weapons by VRS soldiers from the 10th
         17  Sabotage Detachment and other units.  On or about 16
         18  and 17 July 1995, the VRS military personnel, under the
         19  command of Radislav Krstic, using heavy equipment,
         20  buried hundreds of victims in a nearby mass grave.
         21            Pilica Cultural Centre:  On or about 16 July
         22  1995, VRS military personnel, under the command of
         23  Radislav Krstic, after participating in the Branjevo
         24  Farm executions, travelled a short distance to the
         25  village of Pilica.  There, using automatic weapons and

          1  hand grenades, VRS military personnel executed
          2  approximately 500 Bosnian Muslim men inside the Pilica
          3  Cultural Centre.
          4            Kozluk:  On or about 16 and 17 July 1995, VRS
          5  military personnel, under the command of Radislav
          6  Krstic, transported hundreds of Bosnian Muslim men to
          7  an isolated place near Kozluk and summarily executed
          8  them.  On or about 18 July 1995, VRS military
          9  personnel, under the command of Radislav Krstic, using
         10  heavy equipment, buried the victims in a mass grave
         11  nearby.
         12            During and after the opportunistic killings
         13  and mass executions which occurred from 11 July until
         14  18 July 1995, Radislav Krstic failed to investigate or
         15  punish any of his VRS subordinates who were responsible
         16  for the killings and executions.  To the contrary,
         17  Radislav Krstic and units under his command
         18  participated in an organised and comprehensive effort
         19  to conceal and cover up the killings and executions by
         20  burying the bodies of the victims in isolated sites
         21  scattered throughout a wide area.
         22            When it became apparent that the
         23  International Community had learned of the killings and
         24  executions arising from the attack on the Srebrenica
         25  safe area, Radislav Krstic and units under his command

          1  participated in a second attempt to conceal the
          2  killings and executions by digging up the bodies from
          3  the initial mass graves and transferring them to
          4  secondary graves.  VRS military personnel or their
          5  agents under the command of Radislav Krstic dug up the
          6  following graves and transferred the bodies to
          7  secondary sites.  The Dam at Petkovci, Orahovac,
          8  Branjevo farm, Kozluk, Glogova.
          9            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you,
         10  registrar.  I want to ask you to stop for a moment.
         11  Let me turn to the accused.
         12            Mr. Krstic, please remain seated.  The counts
         13  will now be read out, and at this point I'm going to
         14  ask you, as my colleagues do, to tell us whether you
         15  plead guilty or not guilty.
         16            First, let me ask you whether you feel well
         17  enough.  Have you understood the indictment and did you
         18  learn of it when you reached the detention centre?  Did
         19  you feel all right when you got there?  Then I'm going
         20  to ask you to plead guilty or not guilty to each of the
         21  counts.  You may remain seated when you answer my
         22  question, please.
         23            THE ACCUSED: (Interpretation)  Do I have the
         24  right to speak?  I have no interpretation.
         25            THE INTERPRETER:  I'm sorry, the interpreter

          1  apologises.  She heard it wrongly.
          2            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Do you hear
          3  me?  Do you hear me?  Do you hear me, Mr. Petrusic?
          4            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)  Yes, I can
          5  hear you very well, Your Honour.
          6            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Just one
          7  moment to clarify the matter.  Do you hear me now,
          8  Mr. Krstic?
          9            THE ACCUSED:  Yes, yes.
         10            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Did you hear
         11  the indictment?  Were you connected properly?
         12            THE ACCUSED:  I have heard the indictment,
         13  except for the last two paragraphs.
         14            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  I ask the
         15  registrar to repeat the reading of those, please,
         16  that's paragraphs 24 and 25, and then tell us whether
         17  you hear.  Do you hear?  Very well.  Go ahead.
         18            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)  During and
         19  after the opportunistic killings and mass executions
         20  which occurred from 11 July until 18 July, 1995,
         21  Radislav Krstic failed to investigate or punish any of
         22  his VRS subordinates who were responsible for the
         23  killings and executions.  To the contrary, Radislav
         24  Krstic, and units under his command, participated in an
         25  organised and comprehensive effort to conceal and cover

          1  up the killings and executions by burying the bodies of
          2  the victims in isolated sites scattered throughout a
          3  wide area.
          4            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  You don't have
          5  to mention the paragraphs.  Move on to the next one,
          6  please.
          7            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)  When it
          8  became apparent the international community had learn
          9  of the killings and executions arising from the attack
         10  on the Srebrenica safe area, Radislav Krstic, and units
         11  under his command, participated in a second attempt to
         12  conceal the killings and executions by digging up the
         13  bodies from the initial mass graves and transferring
         14  them to secondary graves.  VRS military personnel or
         15  their agents, under the command of Radislav Krstic, dug
         16  up the following graves and transferred the bodies to
         17  secondary sites:  The Dam at Petkovci, Orahovac,
         18  Branjevo Farm, Kozluk, Glogova.
         19            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you.
         20  Let me once again turn to the accused.  You've now
         21  heard the indictment and you will tell us, please,
         22  whether you plead guilty or not guilty to each of the
         23  counts that the registrar will read from the
         24  indictment.  I would, first of all, ask you to do the
         25  following:  First, I would like to ask how you feel

          1  physically.  Do you feel all right, other than the
          2  fatigue you feel in your leg?  How do you feel?
          3            THE ACCUSED:  (Interpretation)  As well as
          4  can be expected on the whole, but I am tired after the
          5  arrest, exhausted.  At the detention centre, the people
          6  are very correct in their treatment of us all, and
          7  particularly to me myself.
          8            There has been no heating in the detention
          9  unit, however, for the past three days, and that is
         10  something which makes the circumstances impossible, and
         11  with regard to hygiene as well.
         12            In view of my injuries, I have no conditions
         13  for therapy for my leg, and for the care and attention
         14  of my health.  So much for me.  Thank you.
         15            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you.  I
         16  appreciate your having pointed this out.  This will be
         17  indicated in our records to the registrar and to the
         18  head of the detention unit.  I think it's absolutely
         19  important to have heating at this time of the year,
         20  and, of course, this applies to all of the accused, and
         21  more particularly to the accused and other treatment he
         22  should get.
         23            Let us move back to the indictment.
         24  Mr. Krstic.  First of all, we'll ask the registrar to
         25  continue reading the indictment, and I'll ask you to

          1  plead guilty or not guilty.
          2            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)  Counts.  By
          3  his respective acts and omissions described in
          4  paragraphs below, Radislav Krstic committed;
          5            Count 1:  Genocide, punishable under Articles
          6  (4)(3)(a), and (7)(1) and (7)(3) of the Statute of the
          7  Tribunal; and alternatively:
          8            Count 2:  Complicity to commit genocide,
          9  punishable under Articles (4)(3)(e), and (7)(1) and
         10  (7)(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal.
         11            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Very well.
         12  I'm turning to you, Mr. Krstic.  I'm going to ask you,
         13  for these two counts which are listed alternatively,
         14  you are either accused of genocide or complicity to
         15  commit genocide by the Prosecutor.  We will see the
         16  results of that during the trial.  For the time being,
         17  we simply ask you to plead guilty or not guilty.
         18            THE ACCUSED: (Interpretation)  I plead not
         19  guilty.
         20            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you.
         21  This will be placed into the registrar's records.
         22  Continue, please.
         23            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)  Count 3,
         24  extermination.
         25            The Prosecutor re-alleges and reincorporates

          1  by reference the paragraphs below:  By his respective
          2  acts and omissions described in the paragraphs below,
          3  Radislav Krstic committed:
          4            Count 3:  Extermination, a crime against
          5  humanity, punishable under Articles (5)(b), and (7)(1)
          6  and (7)(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal.
          7            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Mr. Krstic, do
          8  you plead guilty or not guilty?
          9            THE ACCUSED: (Interpretation)  I plead not
         10  guilty.
         11            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Please,
         12  continue.
         13            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)  Counts 4 and
         14  5, murder.
         15            The Prosecutor re-alleges and refers to the
         16  allegations in the following paragraphs:  By his
         17  respective acts and omissions described in the
         18  paragraphs below, Radislav Krstic committed:
         19            Count 4:  Murder, a crime against humanity,
         20  punishable under Articles (5)(a), and (7)(1) and (7)(3)
         21  of the Statute of the Tribunal.
         22            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Mr. Krstic, do
         23  you plead guilty or not guilty?
         24            THE ACCUSED: (Interpretation) I plead not
         25  guilty.

          1            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)  Count 5:
          2  Murder, a violation of the laws or customs of war,
          3  punishable under Articles 3, and (7)(1) and (7)(3) of
          4  the Statute of the Tribunal, as recognised by Article
          5  (3)(1)(a) of the Geneva Convention.
          6            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Do you plead
          7  guilty or not guilty?
          8            THE ACCUSED: (Interpretation) I plead not
          9  guilty.
         10            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)  Count 6,
         11  persecutions.
         12            The Prosecutor re-alleges and refers to the
         13  allegations contained in the following paragraphs:
         14            Beginning on 11 July, 1995 and continuing
         15  through 1 November, 1995, Radislav Krstic, committed,
         16  planned, instigated, ordered or otherwise aided and
         17  abetted the planning, preparation or execution of a
         18  crime against humanity, that is the persecutions of
         19  Bosnian Muslim civilians on political, racial or
         20  religious grounds in Srebrenica and its surroundings.
         21            The crime of persecutions was perpetrated,
         22  executed and carried out by or through the following
         23  means:
         24            (a) the murder of thousands of Bosnian Muslim
         25  civilians, including men, women, children and elderly

          1  persons;
          2            (b) the cruel and inhumane treatment of
          3  Bosnian Muslim civilians, including severe beatings;
          4            (c) the terrorising of Bosnian Muslim
          5  civilians; and
          6            (d) the destruction of personal property of
          7  Bosnian Muslims.
          8            By these acts or omissions, and the acts and
          9  omissions described in the above paragraphs, Radislav
         10  Krstic committed:
         11            Count 6:  Persecutions on political, racial
         12  and religious grounds, a crime against humanity,
         13  punishable under Article (5)(h), and (7)(1) and (7)(3)
         14  of the Statute of the Tribunal.
         15            Done this 30th day of October, 1998, at The
         16  Hague, The Netherlands, signed by the Deputy Prosecutor
         17  Graham Blewitt.
         18            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  There is a
         19  final count.  I would like to know as regards Count 6,
         20  the accused pleads guilty or not guilty?  Persecutions
         21  on political --
         22            THE ACCUSED: (Interpretation)  I plead not
         23  guilty.
         24            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Very well.
         25  The Tribunal has noted that the accused has pleaded not

          1  guilty to all of the counts in the indictment, and at
          2  this point we will now, working with the -- consult
          3  with the Prosecutor and the Defence, to try to set the
          4  date for the trial.
          5            We are covered by Rule 62, and we must now
          6  organise the proceedings that will follow now in order
          7  to set, as quickly as possible, a date for the trial to
          8  begin.
          9            Madam Prosecutor, do you have several
         10  obligations which are covered by Rule 62 and following
         11  in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Have you
         12  satisfied all of your obligations which would allow us
         13  to set the date for the trial as quickly as possible?
         14            MS. HOLLIS:  Your Honour, in regard to our
         15  obligation under Rule 66(A), on Friday we provided the
         16  supporting material relevant to this accused to the
         17  translation section of the registry for translation
         18  into the language of the accused.  Today we are
         19  prepared to provide to the Defence counsel the English
         20  version of the supporting material that was provided
         21  for confirmation.
         22            We believe that there may be a videotape that
         23  would possibly qualify as a statement of the accused
         24  under Rule 66(a)(i).  We have yet to view that
         25  videotape.  As soon as we view it and determine that it

          1  does qualify under that section of the Rules, we will
          2  promptly provide a copy of that to the Defence
          3  counsel.
          4            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Mr. Petrusic,
          5  have you received all of the supporting material which
          6  is covered under Rule 66(a)(i)?
          7            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)
          8  Mr. President, during the course of the morning, about
          9  two hours ago, the only thing I did receive from the
         10  registrar are the Rules of the International Tribunal,
         11  and I also received the Statute.  That is to say, the
         12  Rules and the Statute of this Tribunal.  I did not
         13  receive any additional supporting material.  Then, of
         14  course, the indictment was there too, the indictment
         15  that I was given by the accused yesterday when I saw
         16  him.
         17            So we did not receive any supporting
         18  materials.  We cannot make any statements in this
         19  regard, and I hope that the Prosecutor shall provide
         20  these materials so that the Defence could also start
         21  collecting their materials.
         22            As far as the tape that the Prosecutor speaks
         23  of, I think it is too early for us to state our views
         24  on this, because I have my doubts as to whether this
         25  can be evidence or not, but we are going to state your

          1  views on this when the Prosecutor submits this.  Thank
          2  you.
          3            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  I'm not sure I
          4  quite understood that.  All right.  Madam Prosecutor,
          5  you have 30 days to disclose all of the supporting
          6  material with the indictment.  You say you've already
          7  done that?
          8            MS. HOLLIS:  We have a copy for the accused
          9  in English.  We do not have a copy in the accused's
         10  language, but we have that here and are prepared to
         11  provide that to the Defence Attorney at the
         12  conclusion of these proceedings.
         13            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Very well.
         14  Mr. Petrusic, you will receive them today.  Does that
         15  mean, in your mind, Mrs. Hollis, that you do not need
         16  the 30-day time period?  Do you feel that you've
         17  already satisfied your obligations under Rule
         18  62(a)(i)?  I'm saying that -- I'm talking about the
         19  supporting material.  I would like to expedite the
         20  beginning of the trial.
         21            Aside from the video cassette, have you
         22  already or are you going to submit everything?
         23            MS. HOLLIS:  We're going to submit the
         24  supporting material relevant to this accused today at
         25  the conclusion of the proceedings, but they will be in

          1  English.
          2            As we read the current Rule, Your Honour,
          3  they have been provided in a language the accused
          4  understands.  We have submitted them for translation,
          5  but we do not have the translated copies back as of
          6  today, in Serbian, and I'm not sure when the
          7  translation section will have that available for us,
          8  but we do have the English version here and we will
          9  serve that on the accused's counsel today.
         10            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  All right.
         11  Let me turn to my colleagues.  We could consider that
         12  the 30-day time limit today will suffice for the
         13  translations.  You say that you have given the
         14  supporting material with the indictment not in a
         15  language that the accused understands, but that we can
         16  use the 30-day time period starting today, 7 December,
         17  that takes us to the 7th of January, so that all of the
         18  documents would have been translated.  Mr. Petrusic, do
         19  you agree with that or can we speed up the translation
         20  process?
         21            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)  I agree with
         22  that proposal.
         23            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Very well.  We
         24  can use that 30-day period.
         25            There's a second time period, Madam

          1  Prosecutor.  About how many witnesses do you plan to
          2  call to this trial?
          3            MS. HOLLIS:  Your Honour, if I may take a
          4  moment to confer?
          5            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Do you have an
          6  approximate idea?
          7            MS. HOLLIS:  If I could give you a very rough
          8  estimate, and this would, of course, depend in part on
          9  what happens with our pre-trial --
         10            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Yes, of
         11  course.
         12            MS. HOLLIS:  We would estimate somewhere in
         13  the vicinity of 50 to 70 witnesses, Your Honour.
         14            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Thank you.
         15  Let me turn to the Defence.  Let me also tell the
         16  Defence that it will have a time period for filing any
         17  preliminary motions that it may care to do, once you
         18  have received all of the documents filed according to
         19  the appropriate Rules.  If by the 7th of January you
         20  have received all of the statements, you will have to
         21  file your preliminary motions before the 7th of
         22  February, with that.
         23            Very well.  From that point on, of course, we
         24  cannot say how long -- well, whether you're going to
         25  file any preliminary motions, that depends on you, not

          1  on the Judges.  I don't know whether the Judges will be
          2  able to respond in the next few days.  It will all
          3  depend on the legal substance of the preliminary
          4  motions, but can we today say that a trial around the
          5  end of March, the beginning of April will be possible,
          6  
          7            MS. HOLLIS:  On behalf of the Prosecutor,
          8  Your Honour, yes, that would be possible.
          9            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Mr. Petrusic?
         10            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)  On behalf of
         11  the Defence, it is very difficult, indeed, at this
         12  point in time to estimate when the trial could begin,
         13  and the Defence shall certainly resolve to all the
         14  rights vested in it in Rule 72 of the Rules of
         15  Procedure and Evidence, and as the proceedings further
         16  evolve we shall also draw on Rule 65.  So today, I did
         17  expect to see piles of documents provided by the
         18  Prosecutor, and we do not have a single shred of
         19  material from them.
         20            I repeat that it is unrealistic to set a
         21  time, whether it is going to be March or April, as you
         22  said, but the Defence cannot really say what period of
         23  time they would need to prepare their Defence, because
         24  we do not have a single shred of evidence from the
         25  Prosecutor so that we could speak about the date of the

          1  beginning of the trial.  I hope you understand this,
          2  Mr. President.
          3            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Yes, we
          4  understand what you've just said, but I would like to
          5  say, on behalf of my colleagues, that the Prosecutor
          6  will be ready.  That's the first observation, that the
          7  trial will begin as soon as possible.
          8            You have time periods which allow you to file
          9  a certain number of preliminary motions, and this is
         10  the right of the accused to file them and to raise
         11  them, but it will take time.  It's your right, but
         12  that, of course, will postpone the date of the trial.
         13            The Judges must be prepared to move forward
         14  as quickly as possible as well.  The Tribunal is very
         15  occupied at this time, but thanks to the fact that we
         16  have received some additional Judges, our schedule is
         17  reasonable and is possible to work with despite the
         18  workload of other cases.  I don't think we can say
         19  anything further than that today.
         20            The Status Conferences will determine the
         21  legal follow-up to what has been said today, and the
         22  Trial Chamber has designated Judge Almiro Rodrigues as
         23  the pre-trial Judge.
         24            Let me remind that you the Status Conferences
         25  in cases, as a new procedure whose purpose is to

          1  accelerate the beginning of the trial itself, let me
          2  refer you, both the Prosecution and Defence, to 65 bis
          3  and 73 bis and ter of the Rules of Procedure and
          4  Evidence.
          5            Do you have any other comments you would like
          6  to make, Madam Prosecutor?
          7            MS. HOLLIS:  No, Your Honour, we do not.
          8            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Mr. Petrusic,
          9  do you have any comments you would like to make?
         10            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)  Mr.
         11  President, since you have already asked about these
         12  comments, both the Prosecutor and for myself, allow me
         13  to make a comment.
         14            In all the trials before this Tribunal where
         15  military persons were indicted, the name of the accused
         16  was always preceded by his rank.  I'm talking about
         17  Colonel Krsmanovic, General Djukic and now General
         18  Blaskic, too.  However, in the indictment of General
         19  Krstic, his rank has not been mentioned, and I choose
         20  to interpret this as an accidental omission.
         21            I also wish to point out, with your
         22  permission, something that is really within the
         23  province of work of the Registry of this Tribunal.
         24  That is to say the truly seriously, imperilled health
         25  of General Krstic.  A leg of his was amputated and

          1  there is atrophy of the muscle in the remaining part of
          2  the leg, and there is bleeding, too, and Mr. Krstic is
          3  rightly pointing to the threat of gangrene.
          4            The Registry of this Tribunal is going to
          5  deal with this problem; however, this is very serious
          6  and the consequences that may follow are very serious,
          7  and I wish this to be noted officially.  Thank you.
          8            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  I believe that
          9  the registrar can tell us that the accused was already
         10  examined.  This is ordinarily done.
         11            THE REGISTRAR: (Interpretation)  Yes, he was
         12  examined when he arrived on the 3rd of December.  At
         13  his arrival in The Hague, he was taken to the hospital
         14  where he was examined by a cardiologist.
         15            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Very well.
         16  Your comments have been noted, and if the accused needs
         17  any specific type of treatment, this is a possibility
         18  which we have run into before in this Tribunal, the
         19  proper treatment will be given to the accused.
         20            Before we finish our work, I would like to
         21  turn to my colleagues to ask if they have any comments
         22  and perhaps give the final word to the accused.
         23            Have you any statement you would like to
         24  make, General Krstic?  Before you answer, Madam
         25  Prosecutor, you called the defendant what, General?

          1  Apparently he is a General.  Do you call him Colonel
          2  General?  What is your reaction to the Defence's
          3  comment.
          4            MS. HOLLIS:  Your Honour, our understanding
          5  is that the accused is a Lieutenant General in the
          6  Republika Srpska army.  Indeed, he does hold a General
          7  rank, and it is the rank of Lieutenant General.
          8            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Yes, but what
          9  I want to know, in the indictment, the indictment that
         10  was read, he is referred to as Mr. Krstic.  For my
         11  part, I have no problem to the military ranks being
         12  included, once they have been legitimately accepted and
         13  agreed to by the proper authorities.  You call him
         14  Mr. Krstic, or shall we call him General Krstic?  What
         15  is your opinion?
         16            MS. HOLLIS:  We would refer to him as General
         17  Krstic, if we refer to him other than by his last name,
         18  and in the description of the accused we do include his
         19  military rank.
         20            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Very well.
         21  Mr. Petrusic, I suppose that satisfies you.  Before we
         22  give the final word to the accused, it will be noted
         23  here as being General Krstic.
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: (Interpretation)  Thank you,
         25  Mr. President.  I am satisfied.

          1            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  And I note
          2  that the accused is also claiming his rank in the army
          3  of Republika Srpska, if we understood the comment.
          4  General Krstic, would you like to make any final
          5  statement, either seated or standing, before we finish
          6  our hearing this morning?  Perhaps you have nothing to
          7  add; have you?
          8            THE ACCUSED:  Not for the time being.
          9            JUDGE JORDA: (Interpretation)  Very well.
         10  The Court stands adjourned.
         11                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at
         12                 12.30 p.m., sine die.
