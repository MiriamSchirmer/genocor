  3                            [Status Conference] 
  4                            [The accused entered court] 
  5                            --- Upon commencing at 11.05 a.m. 
  6              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  [Microphone not activated] Good 
  7   morning, ladies and gentlemen.  May I ask the registrar to call the case, 
  8   please. 
  9              THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please. 
 10              THE REGISTRAR:  Case number IT-04-80-PT, the Prosecutor versus 
 11   Milan Gvero and Radivoje Miletic. 
 12              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  [Microphone not activated] 
 13              THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for the Judge, please. 
 14              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Sorry.  All right.  Is that okay? 
 15              Good morning, Mr. Miletic.  Good morning, Mr. Gvero.  Can you 
 16   hear the proceedings in a language that you can understand?  Yes? 
 17              THE ACCUSED GVERO: [Interpretation] I can follow, but I need to 
 18   put the volume up a little. 
 19              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Is that okay? 
 20              THE ACCUSED GVERO: [Interpretation] Yes, thank you. 
 21              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you very much. 
 22              Can we have the appearances, please.  Prosecution first. 
 23              MR. McCLOSKEY:  Good morning.  Peter McCloskey and Janet 
 24   Stewart. 
 25              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you very much. 

  1              The Defence? 
  2             MS. FAUVEAU-IVANOVIC: [Interpretation] Natacha Fauveau-Ivanovic, 
  3   counsel for General Miletic. 
  4              MR. KRGOVIC: [Interpretation] Dragan Krgovic, Defence counsel.  
  5   I'm representing General Gvero. 
  6              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you very much. 
  7              We are here today for the Status Conference as provided by the 
  8   Statute.  As you know, within 120 days after the Initial Appearance of the 
  9   accused we have to have this meeting in order to organise the exchanges 
 10   between the parties and to ensure that the trial is prepared in an 
 11   expeditious way, and we also have to review the status of the accuseds' 
 12   case and to allow you to have the opportunity to raise issues in relation 
 13   thereto. 
 14              The outstanding motions for the moment are twofold:  We first 
 15   have motions for the provisional release.  As you know, there was an order 
 16   staying the consideration of the motions.  That order was based on the 
 17   assumption that the issue of the joinder would be decided sooner.  Given 
 18   the fact that this is not the case, given the current state of the 
 19   proceedings, we will not wait until the joinder has been decided and we 
 20   will give our decision in the coming weeks, hopefully -- certainly before 
 21   the recess.  So that's as far as the provisional release motions are 
 22   concerned. 
 23              Then the motion concerning the appointment of co-counsel for Mr. 
 24   Miletic:  The Registry was requested to provide additional information on 
 25   this matter.  We have just today received the response, and we will further 

  1   consider it. 
  2              The joinder of the Srebrenica cases:  As we all know, the 
  3   Prosecution has filed a motion for joinder.  The time limit for response to 
  4   that motion has been extended in the present case.  We have allowed you to 
  5   have a delay of seven days from the filing of the single indictment to 
  6   introduce your motions. 
  7              So what we have to do now is to make sure that the disclosure 
  8   obligations are respected, and as far as I can see, all this is going 
  9   according to the Rules.  We have been notified that the Prosecution filed a 
 10   notice of compliance with its disclosure obligations under Rule 61(A)(i) 
 11   [as interpreted].  It has informed the Chamber that it has completed the 
 12   disclosure to the accused Gvero on 5 April and to the accused Miletic on 15 
 13   April.  I therefore understand that the Defence has received the copies of 
 14   the supporting material and the prior statements of the accused?  Can you 
 15   confirm this, please? 
 16              MS. FAUVEAU-IVANOVIC: [Interpretation] Defence counsel.  Yes.  
 17   We have received all the documents according to Article 66(A)(i), and we 
 18   would like the Chamber to set a deadline pursuant to Article 66(A)(ii) so 
 19   that the Prosecutor has a definite time limit to disclose all witness 
 20   statements they wish to present, as well as all the exhibits they wish to 
 21   present as exhibits during the presentation of their case. 
 22              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Mr. Krgovic. 
 23              MR. KRGOVIC: [Interpretation] I can confirm that the Prosecutor 
 24   has complied with his obligations under Rule 66(A)(i), and as in the case 
 25   of General Miletic's Defence, we suggest that the Chamber set a deadline 

  1   for the Prosecution to disclose material pursuant to Rule 66(A)(ii). 
  2              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you very much. 
  3              As regarding the material under Rule 66(A)(ii) and Rule 68, I 
  4   have been informed that the disclosure of the witness statements, 
  5   exculpatory material, and relevant material stored in the EDS system is 
  6   either in progress or about to begin.  Do you want to add anything to what 
  7   was discussed in the 65 ter Meeting on this point? 
  8              MS. FAUVEAU-IVANOVIC: [Interpretation] No, I think that what we 
  9   said yesterday is quite sufficient.  I think we have quite good contact 
 10   with the Office of the Prosecution.  We have received all the supporting 
 11   material, but sometimes it is difficult to get hold of some of the 
 12   documents because they're difficult to find.  They can't be found 
 13   elsewhere.  For instance, the Drina Corps documents are difficult to get 
 14   hold of, and we know that the Prosecutor had difficulty getting hold of 
 15   them; they haven't been able to review them all yet.  But we are about to 
 16   receive all the Drina Corps documents in B/C/S.  If this can make -- 
 17   expedite the proceedings, that will be fine. 
 18              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you very much.  So you were 
 19   asking me to set a -- or to ask the Prosecution to set a delay for further 
 20   disclosure.  Can I turn to Mr. McCloskey to ask him what he thinks is a 
 21   reasonable period of time for him to disclose these materials. 
 22              MR. McCLOSKEY:  Your Honour, I am faced with some eight accused 
 23   now, many of whom are in separate trials.  And with the joinder motion 
 24   outstanding, I would request the Court put off an order regarding these 
 25   particular defendants until the joinder motion is resolved or at least 

  1   farther down the way because if I set witness lists for each and every one 
  2   of these separate trials, I will be doing work -- much more work than is 
  3   necessary and I'll have to do it all over again if cases are joined, which 
  4   I think there's a very good chance there are.  So in order to save the time 
  5   and resources of not just the Prosecution but the Court and everyone else 
  6   who will be receiving all these separate witness lists, I would request 
  7   that the -- the actual requirement of the witness list be put off until at 
  8   least the next Status Conference.  And if there's some big delay in the 
  9   joinder or something, perhaps we'll just need to go forward individually, 
 10   but hopefully there won't be. 
 11              We were hoping that the joinder issue would be able to be sent 
 12   to one Trial Chamber, and I know that is in the plans and in the works, and 
 13   so if we can wait a bit to see how that gets resolved, then we'll have a 
 14   much better ability to put together a very comprehensive witness list 
 15   instead of partial witness lists that will -- will constantly change, 
 16   depending on the number of accused. 
 17              So if I could get a little more leeway on that, I think we would 
 18   save resources in the future, though as I have told the Defence, that the 
 19   witnesses in the Blagojevic case, in the Jokic case, cover probably 90 per 
 20   cent of the witnesses in this -- in this case.  And -- and we're helping 
 21   getting them witnesses.  It's probably not as quick as anyone would like.  
 22   But we're -- we're working on that, and we're able to provide them with 
 23   specific small requests that they give, and we're making an effort to get 
 24   the bigger part of our case file on the EDS for them in an organised way. 
 25              So in any event, I -- I would request that we not be tied to a

  1   deadline for witnesses for this case yet, please. 
  2             JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  But you are asking to wait until the 
  3   next Status Conference?  That is a long way ahead.  It's 120 days ahead, if 
  4   I understand the Rules correctly.  And the joinder motion will have been 
  5   filed much earlier, and the new indictment. 
  6              MR. McCLOSKEY:  I would ask -- I'll try to clarify that.  Either 
  7   shortly after the joinder motion a deadline should be set.  I think once 
  8   the joinder is resolved, I think a deadline -- a reasonable deadline should 
  9   be set.  And if the joinder motion -- let's hope it doesn't happen.  If 
 10   that stays in limbo, like can happen here, then I think at the next Status 
 11   Conference we should just probably start going towards trial on all these 
 12   separate cases.  I don't think that's going to happen.  I think the joinder 
 13   motion will get resolved, and as soon as it does, we'll be able to provide 
 14   a witness list -- in fact, we're, of course, working on that right now. 
 15              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  What would then be according to you be 
 16   a reasonable delay after the joinder motion? 
 17              MR. McCLOSKEY:  Oh, 30 days after the joinder motion, I would 
 18   think, should -- should do it.  That's 30 days after something that we 
 19   don't know.  So that's hard to -- 
 20              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  That's true.  But if we have to wait 
 21   until the Status Conference, it's a long way ahead, as well.  So I would be 
 22   inclined to suggest that we would say that if there's a joinder motion, 
 23   then the additional disclosure needs to be done within 30 days from that 
 24   motion.  Would that be agreeable to you? 
 25              MR. McCLOSKEY:  Absolutely. 

  1              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Would the Defence go along with this? 
  2              MS. FAUVEAU-IVANOVIC: [Interpretation] The 30 days deadline 
  3   after filing of the amended indictment seems reasonable.  Of course, all 
  4   will depend when the amended indictment and joinder will be decided upon.  
  5   I know this is a very important case, and there will be other 
  6   technicalities to resolve.  I don't know where the nine accused can be 
  7   tried, and this has nothing to do with disclosure of material.  It has to 
  8   do with the way in which we prepare for this trial. 
  9              As you also mentioned in one of your decisions relating to 
 10   provisional release - this is very important - it's also very important as 
 11   regards the manner in which we prepare the case.  30 days seems to be a 
 12   reasonable time limit, but we would like to set a date and know when the 
 13   amended indictment will be filed. 
 14              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Mr. McCloskey. 
 15              MR. McCLOSKEY:  I hope to file the amended indictment today, and 
 16   that's my intention.  It's sitting on another desk, and I hope to get it 
 17   from that desk soon and file it today.  And -- and just to be clear, what 
 18   we're requesting is that it -- we provide those witness -- that witness 
 19   list and statements 30 days after the decision in joinder, not 30 days 
 20   after the filing of the -- of the indictment because we don't really know 
 21   if that indictment will be joined or not. 
 22              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Okay.  Then I propose that we proceed 
 23   as follows:  That we give this delay of 30 days starting from the decision 
 24   on the joinder, and at the very latest, obviously, on the moment of the -- 
 25   the next Status Conference where we hopefully have more information about 

  1   how this case will be further processed. 
  2              Can we agree on that? 
  3              MS. FAUVEAU-IVANOVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, that's fine. 
  4              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you very much. 
  5              Are there any other matters that the parties would wish to raise 
  6   at this stage? 
  7              MS. FAUVEAU-IVANOVIC: [Interpretation] I just have the issue 
  8   relating to the co-counsel.  I know I have not read all the documents 
  9   pertaining to that in their entirety.  I would just like to draw your 
 10   attention to the extract which states that I don't need to have a co-
 11   counsel which speaks -- who speaks Croatian, because that is not a problem 
 12   for me.  I think it's for me to appoint the person I need on my team, and I 
 13   definitely need to take on board somebody who speaks B/C/S to be able to 
 14   communicate with the witness.  I do not reside in the former Yugoslavia; I 
 15   reside in Paris.  And I really need to be working with somebody who speaks 
 16   Croatian, who can communicate with the client, who can read all the 
 17   documents in B/C/S.  
 18  JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you for your comments, and we shall certainly 
 19   heed them. [Previous translation continues]
 20   to be addressed.  I want to turn to the accused and to ask both of them 
 21   whether they want to raise any matter relating to their state of health or 
 22   condition of detention. 
 23              Mr. Miletic first. 
 24              THE ACCUSED MILETIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, as far as the 
 25   detention conditions are concerned, I don't have any problems; I have no 

  1   health problems, either.  The main problem is the problem that my Defence 
  2   counsel referred to, and this has been a problem from the very outset.  And 
  3   I would be grateful if you could deal with this problem as soon as 
  4   possible.  That's all I have to say.  Thank you very much. 
  5              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you. 
  6              Mr. Gvero? 
  7              THE ACCUSED GVERO: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I have no 
  8   complaints to make about the treatment I've been receiving in the Detention 
  9   Unit and about the attitude of the staff in the Detention Unit.  I would 
 10   like to take this opportunity to say that, in my opinion, I'm being treated 
 11   in a very civilised and fair manner.  I'm being treated far better than I 
 12   had expected. 
 13              With all due respect for this institution, I would like to say 
 14   the following:  Over four months ago, as soon as I discovered that an 
 15   indictment had been brought against me, I surrendered to the Tribunal 
 16   voluntarily.  I didn't have a single day to prepare my defence.  I believe 
 17   that given the state guarantees, I would be granted provisional release 
 18   until the beginning of the trial.  Many others who came here around the 
 19   same time that I came or after I came here - and I have better conditions 
 20   than the others, or at least the same - well, many of these have been 
 21   granted provisional release, and this has an influence on my ability to 
 22   prepare for my defence, and in my opinion I'm not being treated in the same 
 23   way as others.  I would be grateful if you could examine my motion for 
 24   provisional release as soon as possible, since I see that the Prosecution 
 25   and the Chamber will have other issues to consider before the commencement 

  1   of trial. 
  2              Thank you very much. 
  3              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you.  I'm very pleased to hear 
  4   that you are treated well in the detention centre.  And as I've been 
  5   telling you earlier, the motions that are still pending are under 
  6   consideration and the reason why there has been this delay in considering 
  7   has been explained to you, and we expect to render a decision on the 
  8   provisional release request before the recess at the very latest.  So your 
  9   case is being considered at present. 
 10              You may sit down. 
 11              THE ACCUSED GVERO: [Interpretation] Thank you. 
 12              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  And I can also remind you that if there 
 13   would be complaints relating to your detention, that you can issue a 
 14   complaint pursuant to the Rules governing the detention of persons awaiting 
 15   trial or appeal. 
 16              So if there's no other matter to be addressed -- oh, I'm sorry, 
 17   Mr. McCloskey. 
 18              MR. McCLOSKEY:  Just one brief remark regarding the co-counsel 
 19   issue brought up by counsel.  As Your Honour is aware, the Prosecution has 
 20   taken no position on that, leaving that to you and the Registry.  However, 
 21   if the Court does have any questions of the Prosecution about this issue, 
 22   we are, of course, here to -- to help as we may.  As you realise, I think 
 23   the fundamental issue is one that the -- the co-counsel -- potential co-
 24   counsel represented General Krstic in the prior case, and I do know that 
 25   potential co-counsel, Nenad Petrusic, I know him to be an honourable man, 

  1   and he did an excellent job for General Krstic and knows all about the 
  2   case.  And in that respect, I think it would be beneficial for this case. 
  3              And the issues of potential conflict of interest, I think those 
  4   are serious issues, and I will leave that to the Court and to the -- to the 
  5   parties to sort out.  But if there's anything we can be of help on those 
  6   issues, please don't hesitate to ask. 
  7              JUDGE VAN DEN WYNGAERT:  Thank you very much, Mr. McCloskey. 
  8              As I was saying earlier, I've only received the motion today, so 
  9   I haven't been able to consider it, so I don't know whether there are 
 10   additional questions that I may want to address you.  I will do so in due 
 11   time, if necessary.  But I hope to be able to have a decision very soon. 
 12              So if there is no other matter to address, I wish to adjourn the 
 13   hearing for today. 
 14                            --- Whereupon the Status Conference adjourned at 
 15                           11.27 a.m.
