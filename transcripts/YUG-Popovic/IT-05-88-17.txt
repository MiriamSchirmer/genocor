          2                 [Open session]
          3                 --- Upon commencing at 9.32 a.m.
          4                 [The accused entered court]
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          6  morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Can the interpreters
          7  hear me?  I'm glad to see that they're there.  Good
          8  morning to the counsel for the Prosecution, to counsel
          9  for the Defence; good morning, General Krstic.
         10            For the record, we're still hearing the case
         11  against General Krstic, and we will continue with the
         12  testimony that we started yesterday.  So without much
         13  further ado, I will give the floor to Mr. Cayley.
         14            MR. CAYLEY:  Good morning, Mr. President,
         15  Your Honours.  We are coming towards the end of
         16  Mr. Mandzic's testimony.  So with your permission, if
         17  the witness could be brought back into the courtroom,
         18  I'd be grateful.
         19                 [The witness entered court]
         20                 WITNESS:  NESIB MANDZIC [Resumed]
         21                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         23  morning, Mr. Mandzic.  Did you hear me?
         24            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I can.  Good morning, Your
         25  Honour.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Is the
          2  translation all right today?
          3            THE WITNESS:  I think it is.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  Let
          5  me just remind you, Mr. Mandzic, that you are still
          6  testifying under an oath.  You will continue answering
          7  questions that Mr. Cayley is going to put to you, and
          8  thank you for coming back this morning.
          9            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         10                 Examined by Mr. Cayley: [contd]
         11       Q.   Good morning, Mr. Mandzic.
         12       A.   Good morning, Mr. Cayley.
         13       Q.   We left off with your testimony last night on
         14  the night of the 11th of July, 1995, when you returned
         15  from Bratunac to the UN Compound in Potocari, and I'd
         16  now like to move ahead in time to the 12th of July of
         17  1995, in the morning.
         18            You're inside the UN Compound.  Can you
         19  describe to the Judges the scene that you saw in and
         20  around the compound at Potocari and inside the compound
         21  on the morning of the 12th of July, 1995?
         22       A.   Yes, I can do that.  At the base of the Dutch
         23  Battalion in Potocari, approximately 5.000 refugees had
         24  found temporary shelter.  Most of them were elderly
         25  people, weak people.  There were dozens of wounded as

          1  well.  Most of them had been wounded in the shelling,
          2  shelling that was perpetrated by the VRS against the
          3  surrounding villages.
          4            The accommodation was by no means adequate.
          5  People were lying on the floor of old factory halls and
          6  also around the Dutch Battalion base, in the street and
          7  the surrounding factories.  Altogether there were
          8  around 25.000 refugees who had gathered there.  They
          9  had the same problems as those in the camp.
         10       Q.   How hot was it that day, Mr. Mandzic?
         11       A.   The temperature was above 30 degrees
         12  Celsius.  It was exhausting due to the temperature as
         13  well, let alone the fear.  There was a shortage of
         14  water, of food.  There were no toilet facilities.
         15       Q.   The children and the babies, what was their
         16  state at this time?
         17       A.   Well, yes, the children were in a very
         18  difficult situation.  As I have already stated, there
         19  was no food, so their mothers couldn't feed them.
         20  Their mothers were exhausted as well.  So were the
         21  children.  They were crying all the time, screaming.
         22  They had nothing to change them or to wash them.
         23            It was very sad to watch all this.  When I
         24  try to think about it all, when I try to go back and
         25  reflect on it, I really see that it was a terrible

          1  trauma for all of us.
          2       Q.   At 10.00 that morning, Colonel Karremans
          3  called you again.  Can you tell the Judges why he
          4  called you and what you did after your conversation
          5  with him?
          6       A.   Let me go back to the previous night, that
          7  is, the night between the 11th and the 12th of July,
          8  and the first meeting in Bratunac with the
          9  representatives of the military authorities of
         10  Republika Srpska.
         11            General Mladic made an ultimatum.  He
         12  demanded from the Dutch Battalion and from us that we
         13  should be back to Bratunac on the following day at
         14  10.00 together with a Bosniak delegation that would be
         15  representing the refugees.  So according to that, we
         16  organised ourselves.
         17            On the 12th of July, at 10.00 a.m., we were
         18  again in Bratunac together with the representatives of
         19  the Dutch Battalion.
         20       Q.   Whereabouts in Bratunac did you go on that
         21  morning?
         22       A.   The meeting was held at the same place, in
         23  the Fontana Hotel in Bratunac, like the first meeting,
         24  the one that had taken place on the night before.
         25       Q.   You referred to a Bosniak delegation.  Apart

          1  from yourself, who were the members of that delegation?
          2       A.   Members of the Bosniak delegation were, well,
          3  myself, and then Mr. Ibro Nuhanovic, who did not
          4  survive the Srebrenica Calvary.  In the afternoon, on
          5  the 13th of July, he was separated from his family by
          6  the forces of the VRS, and I haven't heard of him since
          7  that day.
          8            The third member of the Bosniak delegation
          9  was Mrs. Camila Omanovic.
         10       Q.   If you can recall, who were the Dutch
         11  officers who accompanied you to that meeting?
         12       A.   Yes, I remember.  It was the Commander of the
         13  Dutch Battalion.  At that time he was a Lieutenant
         14  Colonel, Colonel Karremans.  Then there was a Major
         15  from the Dutch Battalion, Major Boering.  As far as I
         16  can remember, the third officer of the Dutch Battalion,
         17  who was a Sergeant, whom I remember very well but I
         18  just cannot remember his name at the moment, but I am
         19  able to recognise him, and I recognised him yesterday
         20  on the photograph that you showed me.  Now, I have
         21  shown you video extracts of that meeting, which I'm not
         22  going to show in the courtroom for your evidence, but
         23  if you could briefly tell the Judges what you recall of
         24  that meeting.
         25       A.   You're referring to the second meeting, the

          1  one that started on the 12th of July at 10.00?
          2       Q.   That's right, Mr. Mandzic.
          3       A.   This meeting resembled more or less the
          4  previous one, the one that had taken place the night
          5  before, with one exception.  During that meeting, while
          6  we were discussing, somebody approached the group, the
          7  meeting, from the side and addressed General Mladin,
          8  saying that the Bosniaks were arriving in the football
          9  stadium in Bratunac.  So when we heard that, we were
         10  very upset.  But then I glanced at my watch and I
         11  realised that within half an hour it was physically
         12  impossible for thousands of refugees to reach Bratunac
         13  from Potocari.  Therefore it was a kind of provocation,
         14  whose objective was to scare the representatives of the
         15  Bosniak delegation, to disarm them, if one can put it
         16  that way, when it comes to their requests and their
         17  demands.  They simply wanted to crush us, both
         18  physically and morally, so that we would be completely
         19  useless.
         20            Let me mention one other fact which can
         21  support this.  One member of our negotiating group, our
         22  negotiating team, sustained a very severe psychological
         23  shock that day, a nervous breakdown.
         24       Q.   Do you recall anything else that was
         25  discussed at that meeting, Mr. Mandzic?

          1       A.   There was certain indications also about the
          2  possible evacuation of the population, but nothing
          3  really tangible, nothing specific.
          4       Q.   Do you recall who was present at that
          5  meeting?
          6       A.   In addition to the officers from the command
          7  of the VRS, two civilian representatives of the
          8  Bratunac municipality attended the meeting, as far as I
          9  can remember.  One of them was Miroslav Deronjic, who
         10  at the time was the president of the Serb Democratic
         11  Party for the Bratunac municipality.  The other one was
         12  Milisav, I believe his name is, Milisav Simic, who was
         13  the president of the Bratunac Municipal Assembly at
         14  that time.
         15       Q.   Could you name, if you can, the individuals
         16  from the VRS Command that were present at that meeting
         17  on the morning of the 12th of July?
         18       A.   Yes, I can do that.  I remember very well
         19  that next to General Mladic sat General Krstic, who is
         20  here today, together with some other officers, whose
         21  faces I can remember very well, but I'm not quite sure
         22  as to their names.
         23       Q.   Do you recall whether Mr. Miroslav Deronjic
         24  said anything at the meeting?
         25       A.   I cannot recall, but I do remember, on the

          1  other hand, that Simic said something.
          2       Q.   Could you tell the Court what Simic said at
          3  that meeting?
          4       A.   Yes.  Simic spoke to General Mladic at one
          5  point and he told him that in respect of certain
          6  Bosniaks, they needed to have some informative talks.
          7  He suspected that they had been members of the armed
          8  forces.
          9       Q.   Do you recall what time that meeting
         10  finished?
         11       A.   Yes.  It finished between -- sometime between
         12  11.00 and 11.30.
         13       Q.   After the meeting, what did you do?
         14       A.   After the meeting we went back, together with
         15  the officers of the Dutch Battalion.  We went back to
         16  their camp.  The situation was very difficult.  We were
         17  trying to figure out what to do next, because it was
         18  obvious that no firm guarantees had been given that
         19  there would be a positive solution for all those
         20  refugees.  Mr. Ibro Nuhanovic, Mrs. Omanovic, Camila,
         21  and myself, we were very concerned and we were thinking
         22  of putting down the names of the refugees on paper, but
         23  at that time it was a very difficult thing to do.  Do
         24  you want me to say perhaps that during the first
         25  meeting, General Mladic had promised that everybody,

          1  regardless of their age, sex, and so on, would,
          2  according to their wishes, be evacuated.  Later on we
          3  would see that it was by no means an evacuation, but a
          4  very cruel deportation.
          5            Mladic repeated several times those words,
          6  that he would allow for an evacuation to happen for all
          7  those people there.
          8       Q.   You mentioned General Mladic.  Did he appear
          9  that day in Potocari?
         10       A.   Yes, he did appear in Potocari on that day,
         11  between 12.00 and 1.00.
         12       Q.   At that time, at 12.00 or 1.00, had the
         13  deportation started by that time, the movement of the
         14  population to Potocari?
         15       A.   If I remember it correctly, General Mladic
         16  came to Potocari.  He simply entered this mass of
         17  refugees sometime between noon and 1.00 p.m.  And I
         18  think that the deportation began after 1.00 on that
         19  day, on the 12th of July, that is, after General Mladic
         20  had left Potocari.
         21       Q.   So can you give an approximate time when the
         22  movement of the population started?
         23       A.   After 1.00 p.m. on the 12th of July.
         24       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges what you saw
         25  taking place in respect of that movement?

          1       A.   On the 12th of July, 1995, in the afternoon
          2  hours, I was in the Dutch Battalion camp.  I was in a
          3  position to observe, like everybody else who had
          4  remained in the camp, that women, children were
          5  boarding buses.  We could see dozens of buses waiting
          6  in line, waiting for the population to board them.  So
          7  because of that, we concluded that there was a
          8  separation of the population going on at the time.  We
          9  could only see women and children on those buses.  We
         10  didn't know where the men were between 15/16 and
         11  60 years of age.  This additionally upset us, but we
         12  were completely helpless.  We couldn't do anything.
         13       Q.   Let's move ahead to the early evening hours
         14  of the 12th of July.  I think the Dutch Commander,
         15  Colonel Karremans, came to speak to you.  Can you tell
         16  the Judges what happened after he spoke to you?
         17       A.   In the afternoon hours on that day between
         18  5.00 and 6.00 p.m., to be precise, Major Franken from
         19  the Dutch Battalion spoke to me and Mr. Nuhanovic.  He
         20  told us that we had to get out of the Dutch Battalion
         21  camp in Potocari because some officers of the VRS were
         22  expecting us outside the camp.  So this is how me and
         23  late Mr. Nuhanovic went towards the gate of the camp.
         24            While we were moving towards the gate, which
         25  was open at that time, a Serb soldier of a heavy build

          1  started running towards us, and he went straight for
          2  Mr. Ibro Nuhanovic.  He expressed his anger and his
          3  hatred by addressing Mr. Nuhanovic with a question,
          4  "Are you a Turk?"   Nuhanovic remained silent.
          5  However, this didn't stop the Serb soldier, who landed
          6  a heavy blow on Mr. Nuhanovic, who, as a result of that
          7  blow, fell down.
          8            Standing next to us there was a Dutch
          9  officer, a Sergeant, who saw this happening, and at
         10  that moment he reacted by saying, "No.  No.  It's not
         11  correct."  Then the Serb soldiers moved away.
         12            We continued for another 10 or 15 metres, and
         13  then General Mladic got out of a car, and he ordered us
         14  to come with him towards the centre of this mass of
         15  people who had gathered in Potocari.
         16            General Mladic ordered me and Mr. Nuhanovic
         17  to speak to the people, though we actually had nothing
         18  to tell them because our fate was the same as those
         19  30.000 people.  But I do remember that General Mladic
         20  addressed the refugees, and he told them once again,
         21  "Do not panic.  You will all be safe.  You will all be
         22  evacuated to the area," or, rather, "the areas that are
         23  under the control of the BH army.  First the old and
         24  the infirm, then mothers with their children, and then
         25  everybody will follow as well."

          1            But what created additional panic on that day
          2  was the fact that as early as in the morning of that
          3  day, that is, before 12.00, the soldiers of the VRS,
          4  who on the previous night had surrounded the Dutch
          5  Battalion camp and the civilian population, those
          6  soldiers, in the early morning hours on that day, had
          7  pierced the corridor and actually mingled with the
          8  population.  So on that day, a search for certain
          9  Bosniaks started, with no apparent reason at all.  They
         10  also started taking them out from the group, and we do
         11  not know anything about those individuals.
         12            We could see nearby houses on fire.  They
         13  also torched the houses in a selective manner, with the
         14  purpose of frightening the population and also so as to
         15  prevent them from coming back.  It was a very clear
         16  message, very clear sign that Srebrenica -- that is,
         17  that there would be no life for Bosniaks in Srebrenica
         18  anymore.
         19       Q.   After Mladic had addressed the crowd and you
         20  had been outside the compound, did you return inside
         21  the UN Dutch compound?
         22       A.   Yes, I did, and late Ibro Nuhanovic went back
         23  to the camp of the Dutch soldiers, and spent again the
         24  night in the camp.
         25       Q.   Did you hear anything that night?

          1       A.   Yes, and that is what still causes me
          2  problems.  It is voices, incomprehensible voices and
          3  some blunt blows, such sounds.  On that night, between
          4  the 12th and the 13th of July, I could not really
          5  establish where they came from since we were, as I
          6  said, in the compound of the Dutch Battalion in
          7  Potocari, and it was a building which was additionally
          8  reinforced with concrete slabs by the Dutch soldiers in
          9  order to improve their safety in case they were
         10  attacked, in case the Dutch soldiers were attacked.
         11            That night, I repeat, I heard but -- I heard
         12  some shots but not very clearly.  I heard some screams,
         13  noise, but I could not really say which direction they
         14  all came from, these sounds came from, because the
         15  whole building was plated with those concrete slabs.
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         17  Exhibit 5/2, and also if you have available 5/6.
         18       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, you stated to the Judges that
         19  you were inside the compound that night, in a building
         20  that had been reinforced against gunfire by concrete
         21  slabs.  Could you indicate on this photograph where you
         22  stayed that night, on the 12th of July?
         23       A.   On the 12th of July I was in the Dutch base
         24  or, rather, the building that was -- that the
         25  officers -- where the officers were quartered, and

          1  according to this photograph, it is here [indicated].
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          3  witness is pointing to the building which is in the
          4  uppermost left-hand corner of the yellow square, the
          5  square which delineates the UN base.
          6            If the witness could now be shown
          7  Exhibit 5/6.
          8       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, do you recognise this building?
          9       A.   I do, yes.  This is an industrial plant, the
         10  11 of March Factory, which was one of the Energoinvest
         11  units in this building, and in front of it by its fence
         12  posts is the road, Bratunac-Potocari-Srebrenica.  On
         13  the 11th, 12th, 13th of July, there were tens of
         14  thousands of people forcibly amassed in that area.
         15            I can also say that in this building or,
         16  rather, in this hall, in this plant, that I was there
         17  on the 11th of July, and I was there until 9.00, until
         18  I was called to go to the Commander of the Dutch
         19  Battalion.
         20       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Mandzic.  We've finished with
         21  those exhibits.  Let's move ahead in time, Mr. Mandzic,
         22  to the 13th of July, and if you can tell the Judges
         23  rumours you were beginning to hear on that morning in
         24  respect of the men, of the Bosniak men who were present
         25  in and around Potocari.

          1       A.   Yes.  That morning, the 13th of July, 1995,
          2  several acquaintances of mine who are no longer alive,
          3  that is, people who did not survive the Srebrenica
          4  Calvary, approached me and said, "They killed some
          5  people last night."  The soldiers of the Army of
          6  Republika Srpska were taking away men to nearby houses
          7  and killed them there outside the camp in which there
          8  was some 25.000 expellees.  Nobody could sleep because
          9  screams could be heard all night long.
         10            And the man went on with his story and his
         11  experience.  He have said, "So-and-so," and then he
         12  would mention a place near Skelani at Dobrak, was
         13  trying to kill himself, to commit suicide all night to
         14  prevent the soldiers of the Army of Republika Srpska
         15  laying hands on him, but they, nevertheless, prevented
         16  him from that and then took it out on him.
         17            I heard identical stories, shortly
         18  afterwards, from people who, that morning, managed to
         19  jump over the fence where the Dutch soldiers were.  And
         20  I was really scared, like everybody else.
         21            After that I went to see the deputy commander
         22  of the Dutch Battalion and asked him to try to put a
         23  stop to this type of evacuation, which was not
         24  evacuation, properly speaking; it was a very cruel
         25  deportation.  And I remember that Major Franken, who

          1  was replacing Commander Karremans, said then,
          2  "Impossible."  And I also remember what he said in
          3  English.  He said, "I'm doing my best."
          4       Q.   Please carry on, Mr. Mandzic, if you wish.
          5  If you have more to say to the Judges, I don't want to
          6  interrupt you.
          7       A.   Right.  Then I asked Major Franken, "Well,
          8  what next?  Where's the way out of this?  Because they
          9  will separate all men.  Will any of the men survive?
         10  Shall we have any proof that people ever lived in this
         11  area, that there were some people there?"  And Major
         12  Franken said, "Yes, let's do something.  Let's try to
         13  make a list, at least in the camp, if we cannot do it
         14  outside the camp."
         15            So I began to do that straight away.  I
         16  entered those destroyed structures, those plants of the
         17  factory in the camp, and with some other men I started
         18  compiling the list mostly of the male population
         19  between the ages of 17, 18 to 70 onward.
         20            I must also say that I had some trouble as I
         21  was compiling that list, first of all because some of
         22  the people from my -- from the same place were afraid
         23  of seeing their names on that list.  I remember some
         24  said, "Right.  We trust you, we know you, but what if
         25  our name is on this list and the army of the Republika

          1  Srpska gets hold of it?"  But we did manage to make a
          2  list of men in that camp between the ages of 18 and 80,
          3  and there were 239 men on that list, even though there
          4  were many more of them in that camp, but for reasons
          5  that I mentioned, because people were afraid to see
          6  their name on the list, that the army of the Republika
          7  Srpska would get hold of that list, and they refused to
          8  give us names.
          9            I turned that list over to Major Franken and
         10  I was also faced with a major dilemma:  What if this
         11  list with 239 names, what if the army of the Republika
         12  Srpska lays its hand on this list of 239 names?  But
         13  Major Franken said, "Well, don't worry.  If nothing
         14  else, I will put that list in my trousers and won't let
         15  them search me."
         16            And that is how it was.  That list exists to
         17  this day, but those men are no longer alive.  And it is
         18  of no help to their families, because they are still
         19  grieving and still searching for all those missing
         20  people.
         21       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, the evacuation outside the UN
         22  compound, the movement of this population, what time
         23  did it finish on the 13th of July?
         24       A.   In late afternoon, as far as I can remember,
         25  sometime around 1900.

          1       Q.   The buses and trucks that were moving these
          2  people, were you able to see those trucks at close
          3  quarters, the buses and trucks?
          4       A.   Yes, I could.  I was about 200 meters away
          5  from them.  And because I moved around the camp, so
          6  sometimes I came as close as 50 meters and I could see
          7  inscriptions on those buses, so that it was -- the
          8  deportation had been planned, and I concluded it
          9  because I saw such a large number of buses and trucks
         10  which had arrived from outside, by and large from towns
         11  such as Bijeljina, Banja Luka, Bratunac, and so on.  I
         12  know -- I remember, that is, the inscriptions on these
         13  buses:  Sembreija Transport from Bijeljina.  That was a
         14  transporting company, a bussing company from before the
         15  war.  Drina Trans, another bussing company from Zvornik
         16  which is still in operation.  A bussing company from
         17  Banja Luka, I believe, called Auto Transport, and so on
         18  and so forth.
         19       Q.   Did you manage to observe the state of the
         20  civilian population that were on those buses?
         21       A.   Yes, yes.  I could see from a distance of
         22  some 50 to 100 meters those were mothers, wives,
         23  sisters, crying, screaming, tearing their hair off,
         24  because they had boarded the buses and could leave, yet
         25  their next of kin -- their children, their fathers,

          1  brothers, husbands, and so on -- were not with them,
          2  even though they, on the 11th and the 12th of July, not
          3  to mention all the days before that, had been together,
          4  and that was a separation which I think hurt very
          5  badly.  And to this day, if you could see those women,
          6  if you could see how they live, under what conditions,
          7  and their sorrow, which persists to this day, you would
          8  understand it all.
          9       Q.   You mentioned earlier that there were people
         10  that had been wounded that were inside the compound in
         11  Potocari.  What happened to those people on the 13th of
         12  July?
         13       A.   Yes.  A group of wounded was evacuated that
         14  day.  But another group of people, who I believe had
         15  sustained more severe injuries, who were awaiting
         16  operations, they could not be transported and they
         17  stayed behind in Potocari.
         18       Q.   On that day you mentioned earlier in your
         19  testimony that there were a large number of VRS
         20  personnel in and around the compound.  Do you recall if
         21  any VRS soldiers or officers came into the compound at
         22  Potocari?
         23       A.   Yes, I do remember.  As I said -- as I have
         24  said, and I shall repeat it, it was already in the
         25  early morning hours of the 12th of July.  The army of

          1  Republika Srpska entered Potocari and amongst the
          2  civilian population, with a view to intimidating them,
          3  especially, and taking away the male population, so
          4  when the evacuation was on its way, there was no
          5  choice.  Men as of the age of 12 to one side, women and
          6  children to the other.  But on the 13th of July, I
          7  remember how a VRS officer came into the camp, Momir
          8  Nikolic.  Before the war he was an educator in
          9  Bratunac.
         10            Momir Nikolic, as he said, was tasked with
         11  checking who were those wounded, what age groups they
         12  belonged to, and how had they sustained their wounds.
         13  I was not far from him when this officer, Momir
         14  Nikolic, asked a Bosniak who had been gravely wounded
         15  and was awaiting for the surgical operation in the
         16  camp, "Where were you wounded?  And that Bosniak did
         17  not reply, yet Nikolic persisted, "You were wounded in
         18  combat, and as such, you may not be evacuated,
         19  transported for further treatment."
         20            He also approached some other wounded, and in
         21  the same way he asked them where they had been wounded,
         22  where had they spent the time of the war, and so on and
         23  so forth.
         24            And also that day in the camp I saw another
         25  officer of the army of Republika Srpska in glasses,

          1  aged less than 40, and I recognised him on a slide
          2  yesterday.  I would recognise him, but I can't remember
          3  his name.
          4            MR. CAYLEY:  Could the witness be shown
          5  Exhibit 43, please.
          6       Q.   So it would be correct to say that
          7  Mr. Nikolic was actively involved in deciding which of
          8  the wounded could be moved from the UN compound and
          9  which of the wounded would remain in the UN compound?
         10       A.   Yes, yes, quite so.  He was determining which
         11  group of the wounded would be transported for further
         12  medical treatment and which ones of the wounded would
         13  stay behind in Potocari.
         14            Yes, this is that officer of the army of
         15  Republika Srpska who came to the camp of Dutch soldiers
         16  on the 13th of July, and on the 11th and the 12th of
         17  July attended, was present at the meeting in Bratunac.
         18            MR. CAYLEY:  For the purposes of the record,
         19  the witness is referring to a photograph of an
         20  individual wearing glasses in Exhibit 43.
         21       Q.   If you know, Mr. Mandzic, what was the
         22  position of Mr. Nikolic in the VRS?  Do you know?
         23       A.   Some people introduced him as a colonel, but
         24  I'm not sure that that was indeed so.  As a colonel of
         25  a unit whose operational zone was Bratunac.

          1       Q.   And that's all you know about Mr. Nikolic's
          2  position, is it?
          3       A.   Yes.  Rather, they called him Colonel and
          4  that his zone of operations was the municipality of
          5  Bratunac.
          6       Q.   Now, the movement of the population, do you
          7  recall what time the movement of the population that
          8  was still in the UN compound finished on the 13th of
          9  July?
         10       A.   Yes.  Sometime around 1900 on the 13th of
         11  July, the Dutch soldiers' camp, where there were still
         12  some 5.000 people, but it was practically empty, the
         13  army of Republika Srpska ordered all the expellees, all
         14  the expelled, to come out of the camp so after 1900
         15  there was only a small group of severely wounded, and a
         16  group of 27 Bosniaks who had been working for UNPROFOR
         17  or MSF as their local staff were left in the camp.
         18       Q.   Now, since these were individuals that had
         19  been in the compound rather than outside the compound,
         20  were you able to observe more closely what was actually
         21  happening with these individuals that were being
         22  expelled?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what you saw taking
         25  place?

          1       A.   I can, yes.  On the 12th of July and on the
          2  13th of July too, I saw and I watched women and small
          3  children board buses, trucks, and the scene which I
          4  described, women crying, children screaming, those
          5  women tearing their hair off, in pain because their
          6  next of kin had been separated from them.  I could see
          7  that they were evacuating or, rather, deporting women
          8  and children.
          9            And in the same manner they evacuated or,
         10  rather, deported men from the Dutch Battalion compound,
         11  where there were some 5.000 people.  One could
         12  invariably see one or two soldiers who would announce,
         13  "Now, this group.  That group goes now.  One hundred,
         14  200, 300, move," and so on and so forth.
         15       Q.   Now, you say that you saw men being deported,
         16  and by the manner of your evidence, are you saying that
         17  the men were being separated?
         18       A.   Yes.  I watched from a distance of some 50 to
         19  100 metres away how only women with small children
         20  boarded the buses, with children up -- from infants
         21  from up to 12, 13 years of age.  I saw those women
         22  screaming, moaning, crying, tearing their hair off.
         23            On that day, the 13th of July, on the 12th of
         24  July, the same scene repeated over and over again.
         25  Everybody reacted in the same way.  And I could see

          1  that male individuals, as of the age of 12 or 13, had
          2  been separated by force from their next of kin, from
          3  their families.
          4       Q.   Who was carrying out the separation of the
          5  men from their families?
          6       A.   Well, soldiers of the VRS.
          7       Q.   Now, speaking of these VRS soldiers, did you
          8  observe the uniforms and the insignia of these
          9  soldiers?
         10       A.   Yes, I did.  On the first day, on the 11th of
         11  July, and on the following day, on the 12th of July, as
         12  I was coming back from Bratunac on my way to Potocari,
         13  I could observe hundreds of soldiers standing next to
         14  the road, wearing uniforms, brand-new uniforms, I might
         15  say.  Some of them were wearing the insignia of the
         16  VRS.  Some didn't have any insignia at all.  But they
         17  did have new military clothing.
         18            I could also hear various dialects, very just
         19  accents which did not resemble the dialect, the
         20  Ijekavski dialect, which is used by Bosnian Serbs in
         21  the region of Podrinje in Eastern Bosnia.
         22       Q.   Let's now move ahead in time.  The compound
         23  is now empty.  All of the refugees have gone.  You're
         24  remaining with members of the Dutch Battalion.
         25            On the 17th of July, you signed a declaration

          1  with Major Franken.
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness can now be shown
          3  Exhibit 47, which is the last new exhibit for this
          4  witness.  There are four exhibits.  There's 47A; 47B;
          5  47C, which is the French translation; and 47D, which is
          6  the B/C/S translation.
          7            Mr. President, if I can explain in respect of
          8  this exhibit.  There are, in fact, two English
          9  translations.  The reason for that is that one of them,
         10  which I'll show on the ELMO, was a field translation
         11  that was done at the time, on the 17th of the July, in
         12  order to facilitate the signature of the representative
         13  of the Dutch Battalion.  There are some inaccuracies in
         14  that translation.  We have the original version there
         15  B/C/S, in the Bosnian language, and we have had that
         16  translated into English.  So there is now an official
         17  English translation.  But in order that the Court, as
         18  it were, sees all of the documents, there are, as I
         19  said, two English translations.
         20       Q.   Now, Mr. Mandzic, first of all --
         21            MR. CAYLEY:  Before I ask Mr. Mandzic any
         22  questions, can you put 47B on the ELMO?  If you could
         23  move it up slightly.
         24       Q.   Now, Mr. Mandzic, is this the English version
         25  of this declaration that you signed on the 17th of

          1  July?
          2       A.   Yes, it is.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could now -- if
          4  you could now put on the ELMO, I think it's 47D, which
          5  is the version in the witness's language.  If you could
          6  turn the page.
          7       Q.   This, Mr. Mandzic, is the version that you
          8  signed in your own language, and indeed Major Franken
          9  and a representative of the Bosnian Serb civilian
         10  authorities; is that correct?
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   Thank you.
         13            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be given
         14  the version in his own language.  That's fine.
         15            The French and English translations, Your
         16  Honours, are the ones I would like you to follow, the
         17  French being 47C and the official English being 47A.
         18       Q.   Now, Mr. Mandzic, a few questions about this
         19  document.  In the second paragraph, the document states
         20  that:  "On 12 July 1995, in the Fontana Hotel in
         21  Bratunac, at our request negotiations were conducted
         22  between the representatives of our civilian authorities
         23  and the representatives of the Republika Srpska
         24  civilian authorities and the army regarding the
         25  evacuation of our civilian population from the

          1  Srebrenica enclave."
          2            Mr. Mandzic, is it accurate that that meeting
          3  was called at your request on the 12th of July, 1995?
          4       A.   No, it is not accurate.  You will remember
          5  that I said yesterday, and you could see it clearly on
          6  the video, that nobody from the Bosniak side ever
          7  requested negotiations, neither on the 11th, nor on the
          8  12th of July.  It was done upon the insistence of the
          9  VRS, and it was UNPROFOR who organised the first
         10  meeting in Bratunac on the 11th of July.  Again, I must
         11  say these negotiations were not conducted at the
         12  request of the Bosniak side.  We never requested these
         13  negotiations to take place.
         14       Q.   If we could move down through this document.
         15  We get to a section which says:  "At the end of the
         16  negotiations between the two sides, the following was
         17  agreed," and the first paragraph states:  "Our civilian
         18  population could stay in the enclave or move out,
         19  depending on the wish of each individual."
         20            Now, Mr. Mandzic, is this an accurate
         21  reflection of what actually happened on the 12th and
         22  13th of July?
         23       A.   No, it is not really.  Not a single word from
         24  this paragraph reflects the events that were taking
         25  place on the 12th and the 13th of July and the

          1  following days as well.  The International Committee
          2  for the Red Cross registered thousands of people who
          3  are still listed as missing.
          4            I would like to tell Your Honours, to state
          5  here before this Chamber, that the Bosniak
          6  representatives did not take part in the signing of
          7  this statement, and I assume neither did the
          8  representatives of the Dutch Battalion do so.  This
          9  statement was a ready-made document which was prepared
         10  by the military and civilian authorities of the
         11  Republika Srpska, and it was presented to us as an
         12  ultimatum.  It was presented also to the Dutch
         13  Battalion, as well as the Bosniak representatives, as
         14  an ultimatum.
         15       Q.   Now, in the third paragraph following that
         16  paragraph it states:  "It was arranged that the
         17  evacuation would be carried out by the army and police
         18  of Republika Srpska and that UNPROFOR would supervise
         19  and provide an escort for the evacuation."
         20            Is that statement an accurate reflection of
         21  what actually happened on the ground on the 12th and
         22  13th of July?
         23       A.   This paragraph is not an accurate reflection
         24  of the events and the facts that took place in Potocari
         25  and on the way from Potocari to Kladanj either.

          1  Kladanj is a small town in the area of Eastern Bosnia.
          2  It is actually the first town in the territory that was
          3  held by the soldiers of the BH army since 1995 -- 1992,
          4  I'm sorry, and this is where the Bosniak population was
          5  deported to in July 1995.
          6            As I said, this does not reflect the events,
          7  because the Dutch Battalion Major complained that on
          8  the night of the 11th and the 12th of July, had
          9  requisitioned almost every single vehicle and used them
         10  for deportation of the Bosniak population from
         11  Srebrenica.  He could practically no longer send any
         12  soldier anywhere.  They could not expose themselves to
         13  risk of an attack by the forces of the VRS.
         14       Q.   So you're stating that in reality, there were
         15  very few convoys that were actually properly escorted
         16  by UNPROFOR?
         17       A.   Only on the first day, on the 12th of July.
         18  On that day, the officers of the Dutch Battalion did
         19  send soldiers and vehicles to escort some of the buses
         20  carrying Bosniaks who were actually being deported by
         21  the VRS to the area of Kladanj.  However, on the way
         22  from Potocari to Kladanj, according to Major Franken,
         23  his soldiers ran into obstacles that had been put up by
         24  soldiers of the VRS.  They harassed them.  They
         25  requisitioned their vehicles, vehicles belonging to the

          1  UNPROFOR forces.  So they were unable to accomplish
          2  that mission.
          3            So on the following day, on the 13th of July,
          4  the deportation was carried out mostly without any
          5  escort or presence of the UNPROFOR forces.
          6       Q.   Now, the very last paragraph, and this may be
          7  something that you can't comment upon because you were
          8  not actually with any of the convoys, but the last
          9  paragraph states:  "No incidents were provoked by any
         10  side during the evacuation, and the Serbian side
         11  observed all the regulations of the Geneva Conventions
         12  and the International Law of War."
         13            Then there is added, I think, a sentence by
         14  Major Franken:  "As far as the convoys escorted by the
         15  UN forces were concerned."
         16            What do you say about that, Mr. Mandzic?
         17       A.   Yes.  As I already told Your Honours, the
         18  Serbian representatives, Deronjic, who represented the
         19  civilian government, appeared with this ready-made
         20  statement, and he made an ultimatum requesting that
         21  this statement be signed.  However, he was very well
         22  aware of the situation.  He knew that between the
         23  13th and the 17th of July in Bratunac, a group of about
         24  several dozen wounded, whom I said had been evacuated
         25  on the 13th of July, had been retained.  He also knew

          1  that there was still 27 Bosniaks in the camp, in
          2  addition to several other dozens of severely wounded
          3  persons.  So that's what he had in mind.  He said that
          4  we should sign the statement because human lives were
          5  at stake.  So this was a kind of condition for all
          6  these persons that I have mentioned, all these
          7  categories of persons that I have mentioned, that they
          8  would be released.
          9            You must be aware of the situation, of the
         10  position in which some 450 soldiers of the Dutch
         11  Battalion had found themselves in.  I've read this
         12  statement several times; that is, I read it several
         13  times at the time.  I looked Major Franken in the eye,
         14  and he knew very well that this statement by no means
         15  reflected the real situation on the ground and the
         16  tragedy that ensued and that had happened actually.
         17            It was very ironical and cynical to invoke
         18  the Geneva Conventions, the provision regulating human
         19  rights and so on and so forth, especially the
         20  provisions of the International Law of War, for
         21  example.  But as I must stress once again, on those
         22  days of July 1995, we were alone.  We were helpless.
         23  The world was silent.  They didn't know what was going
         24  on in Srebrenica or Potocari, or what to do in
         25  Srebrenica and Potocari.

          1            The International Community did not manage to
          2  send any representative of the International Red Cross,
          3  for example, UNHCR, United Nations to Srebrenica on
          4  that day.  The only persons I know that had certain
          5  contacts were perhaps officers of the Dutch Battalion.
          6  He had perhaps contact with their command in the
          7  Netherlands, as well as other UNPROFOR commands in
          8  Bosnia.  They were concerned about the fate of their
          9  soldiers.  I, on the other hand, was concerned about
         10  the fate of my fellow citizens of Srebrenica.  Of
         11  course, we didn't want any more blood to be shed, and
         12  we also wanted the soldiers of the Dutch Battalion to
         13  reach safely their homes.  So we were all thinking in
         14  those lines.
         15            At that moment, Major Franken suggested, when
         16  he was presented with the statement by Deronjic, the
         17  representatives of the civilian authorities, that he
         18  adds this particular wording here:  "As far as the
         19  convoys escorted by UN forces were concerned."
         20            This completely changed the meaning of this
         21  paragraph, and it actually meant that this statement
         22  could only refer to the evacuation as far as the
         23  persons escorted by the UN forces were concerned.
         24  According to what Dutch Battalion soldiers were saying
         25  on the 12th and the 13th of July, they managed to

          1  escort only two or three buses as far as Kladanj and
          2  that was that.  There were hundreds of other buses, but
          3  in respect of those buses, they couldn't do anything,
          4  because their vehicles had already been requisitioned
          5  by VRS troops, together with all their equipment.
          6            So in view of the situation and in view of
          7  what Major Franken said, I simply signed this
          8  statement.
          9            Please, Your Honours, members of this
         10  Honourable Chamber, do consider this statement as an
         11  ultimatum that was put to us by members of the VRS in
         12  those  days of the month of July 1995, when tens of
         13  thousands of people had been deported.
         14            And we didn't know what had happened to
         15  them.  They had perhaps reached their destination, but
         16  at that time their destination was unknown to us.  We
         17  were completely unable to inform ourselves about the
         18  situation through the media, for example.  By signing
         19  this statement, we had in mind the fate of thousands of
         20  people, namely, the wounded persons who were still in
         21  the Dutch Battalion camp, about 27 Bosniaks who were
         22  still there, and we also had in mind the fate of the
         23  Dutch Battalion soldiers who were there in the area.
         24            It is very cynical that this statement should
         25  mention anything about the provisions of the Geneva

          1  Conventions and the International Law of War.  However,
          2  it was our estimate at that time, and we were forced to
          3  sign it, because the fate of hundreds of people
          4  depended on our signature at that moment, despite the
          5  fact that we were actually not convinced that the fate
          6  of those hundreds of people and members of the Dutch
          7  battalion would have a positive outcome.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, if you wish, we
          9  could take a break now.  I have about five minutes of
         10  my examination-in-chief remaining.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, I
         12  think it's a very good moment.  I think our witness is
         13  already a bit tired, the interpreters, myself as well.
         14  We will have a 20-minute break and we shall resume
         15  after that.
         16                 --- Recess taken at 10.53 a.m.
         17                 --- On resuming at 11.20 a.m.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         19  Mr. Cayley.  We now had a break and I believe we've all
         20  recovered, or perhaps with a cup of coffee or something
         21  like that, and I think that we can now assume.  So you
         22  have the floor.
         23            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         24       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, from the 17th of July until the
         25  21st of July, where did you find yourself?

          1       A.   At the command of the Dutch Battalion, in the
          2  compound that were several hundred Dutch soldiers there
          3  and 27 Bosniaks.  I already said that those were people
          4  who worked for UNPROFOR as interpreters, and some
          5  others who worked for MSF.  MSF is an organisation
          6  called Medecins Sans Frontieres.
          7            So we were in Potocari in the compound
          8  between the 11th and the 21st of July, 1200 hours.  At
          9  that time we left Potocari, we left Srebrenica, and
         10  across the Bosnian-Yugoslav border.  We crossed into
         11  the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
         12  that is, the first town across the border, Ljubovija,
         13  in the direction of Sabac, and then we moved on to
         14  Croatia.  And on the 22nd, in the early morning hours,
         15  we arrived in Zagreb.
         16       Q.   Now, you've just stated that the people who
         17  remained within the compound were members of the Dutch
         18  Battalion, various others, and some Bosniaks.  Earlier
         19  you had stated that the man who accompanied you to the
         20  meeting on the 12th of July in the morning was Ibro
         21  Nuhanovic.  You also stated in your evidence that Ibro
         22  subsequently disappeared.  Can you tell the Court what
         23  you know happened to Ibro Nuhanovic and his family?
         24       A.   Yes.  Ibro Nuhanovic, before the war, he was
         25  the manager of a timber processing company in the area

          1  of Srebrenica and Vlasenica.  He had two sons, both
          2  students at the time, and his wife.  On the 12th and
          3  13th of July, he was a member of the Bosniak
          4  delegation.
          5            As you know, I already said that on the 12th
          6  and 13th of July, Bosniaks were deported in large
          7  numbers and people were separated, men and women, and
          8  so the Serb party requested that Ibro's wife and son be
          9  deported.  Ibro knew about this request, but, as a
         10  parent and husband, according to what he said, he
         11  simply could not watch, could not suffer this
         12  separation, because after the first time they were to
         13  part company would not know anything about each other.
         14  So he joined his son and wife, and left.
         15            Several days later, when we arrived in
         16  Zagreb, we learned that neither he nor his wife or son
         17  had not reached the territory held at the time by the
         18  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, or even that his son, who
         19  survives, who is still alive, who is today alone and is
         20  suffering a great deal after he lost his father and
         21  mother and son [sic].  They looked for him -- he looked
         22  for them everywhere.  He called even some people that
         23  his father and he knew before the war in the territory
         24  of the Republic of Srpska to ask them if they knew
         25  anything about his father or mother or his brother, but
          1  nobody could tell him anything definite.
          2            On a number of occasions I had the
          3  opportunity to talk to Ibro's son, who survived and who
          4  was in that group of 27 Bosniaks.  And in those
          5  conversations I could see that today Ibro's son is an
          6  educated, an accomplished man.  He works for IPTF, for
          7  UN forces, in the area of Tuzla.  But he is a broken
          8  man, because he has no family and he is simply unable
          9  to start a normal life and live a life worthy of men
         10  like other people who did not suffer such losses as
         11  Hasim Nuhanovic, Ibro's son.
         12            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I have no further
         13  questions of the witness, so I can now offer him for
         14  cross-examination.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         16  very much, Mr. Cayley.
         17            Now, Mr. Mandzic, you will answer the
         18  questions which counsel for the Defence, I believe
         19  Mr. Petrusic, or perhaps Mr. Visnjic -- no,
         20  Mr. Petrusic will have to ask of you.
         21                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         22       Q.   Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning,
         23  Mr. Mandzic.  I'm sorry, I did not get your surname
         24  right.  Excuse me.
         25            My first question is whether you can tell us,

          1  Mr. Mandzic, something about how did the Serbs and
          2  Muslims live in the municipality of Srebrenica before
          3  the armed conflicts broke out.
          4       A.   Yes, I can tell you that.  I am glad that you
          5  asked me that question.  Before the war,
          6  Bosnia-Herzegovina was a multi-ethnic community with
          7  three constituent peoples, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats,
          8  and other citizens.  In such a multi-ethnic society
          9  life was indeed harmonious.  There was mutual respect
         10  for religions or traditions of other peoples.  There
         11  were no, and I repeat it again, there were no ethnic or
         12  religious obstacles, barriers between people.  People
         13  socialised, people helped one another, people worked
         14  together.  And Srebrenica was another such example of
         15  good multi-ethnic coexistence in the territory of
         16  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the territory of the formal
         17  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
         18       Q.   In 1991, the first multi-party elections took
         19  place in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a short time before
         20  that political parties had been set up and various
         21  political organisations.  Until then, until the
         22  elections or after the elections, excuse me, after the
         23  elections, political authorities were to be constituted
         24  in the municipality of Srebrenica.  You were in
         25  Srebrenica, as far as I could understand, when you gave

          1  your particulars to this Tribunal, so you were there.
          2  So could you tell us something about how these new
          3  authorities, how the new government was constituted
          4  after these first multi-party elections?
          5       A.   Thank you.  I've understood your question.
          6  The first multi-party elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
          7  including the local ones for the municipality of
          8  Srebrenica, took place in the autumn of 1990, not in
          9  1991.  After the results of the elections were
         10  announced in Srebrenica, a multi-ethnic government was
         11  constituted on the basis of the census and the results
         12  of the elections.
         13            It needs to be pointed out that Bosniak
         14  political parties had the majority in the government
         15  and in the Municipal Assembly of Srebrenica.
         16       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, you were a councilman in the
         17  municipality of Srebrenica, weren't you?
         18       A.   No, I was not a councilman at that time, and
         19  you can see that in the Official Gazette of
         20  Srebrenica.  You can see there how many councilmen were
         21  there in the municipal hall and who were those
         22  councilmen.  I was not, but I was elected to the
         23  Municipal Assembly in 1997, and I'm now the mayor of
         24  the municipality and the councilman.
         25       Q.   Oh, I see.  So those are the elections in

          1  1997.  In Srebrenica at that time, the Serbs were a
          2  minority, according to some sources.  They accounted
          3  for some 25 to 30 per cent of the population.
          4       A.   Yes.  That is correct.
          5       Q.   At that time, they did not make up part of
          6  the municipal government, did they?
          7       A.   No.  That is not correct.  They were in the
          8  government.  They were in the executive bodies of the
          9  Municipal Assembly.  Let me explain this.  After this
         10  multi-ethnic government and even before that we had
         11  multi-ethnic authorities when we still had a
         12  single-party system.  We had authorities on the
         13  multi-ethnic basis and all the establishments and all
         14  the institutions, functions, and businesses, and
         15  everything else was governed by multi-ethnic
         16  principle.
         17       Q.   But at that time, representatives, Muslim
         18  representatives in the Municipal Assembly, did they
         19  raise the question of the mayor of the municipality who
         20  was to be elected on the basis of that key which was
         21  widely applied in our country before and after those
         22  elections?  So that was Zekic who was proposed to
         23  become ...
         24       A.   Well, let me repeat it once again, that I was
         25  not a councilman.  I did not have a seat in the

          1  Municipal Assembly at the time.  But as far as I can
          2  remember, the president of the Municipal Assembly was
          3  to be elected from amongst the Bosniaks, that is,
          4  Bosniak political parties, because he needed -- he
          5  needed a majority in the assembly.
          6       Q.   So can one say that in 1991 it already began
          7  some fermentation amongst the population, or, rather,
          8  among the political leaders and then this siphoned over
          9  to the population?
         10       A.   No.  In the multi-party system, there may
         11  have been some slight differences, but it did not find
         12  its reflection in the coexistence of the multi-ethnic
         13  community of Srebrenica.  That is, people continued to
         14  live together harmoniously, to cohabit, and I can
         15  mention Skelani.  In Skelani, Bosniak Serbs all the
         16  others, we went to school together, worked together,
         17  visited one another, were family friends and all that
         18  until 1991.
         19       Q.   But, Mr. Mandzic, why then did the Serb
         20  population leave Srebrenica in 1992?
         21       A.   They began to move out of Srebrenica then,
         22  yes, because in early spring and even before spring, I
         23  should say, it was in February that some local
         24  politicians, Serb politicians, began to request the
         25  constitution of a monoethnic Serb assembly and

          1  monoethnic Serb municipality of Skelani and some other
          2  monoethnic municipalities within the municipality of
          3  Srebrenica.  I do not know whether this august court
          4  understands me.
          5            That is the territory of 529 kilometres
          6  square of the municipality of Srebrenica.  There were
          7  some 38.000 inhabitants there.  And some local Serb
          8  politicians in the municipality of Srebrenica wanted to
          9  partition the municipality of Srebrenica according to
         10  the ethnic principle, which simply could not be done
         11  because people were mixed.  There were next-door
         12  neighbours you had in towns.  In one and the same
         13  building you would have Serbs and Bosniaks and others,
         14  so that the majority of people there, and in my
         15  opinion, this was not really a very sensible request
         16  and could only deepen the misunderstanding between
         17  people there.
         18       Q.   So Serbs were leaving Srebrenica at the time?
         19       A.   According to what I can remember, a small or,
         20  rather, a large part of them did leave the town area
         21  itself, which had about 5.000 inhabitants.  They were
         22  leaving the town by actually moving away their families
         23  to the towns such as Bajina Basta and other towns in
         24  Yugoslavia itself.
         25            We wanted to know why they were doing that,

          1  because no one was doing them any harm, but they would
          2  simply say, "Well, the times are somehow uncertain.  We
          3  don't know what's going to happen.  There might be a
          4  war," and so on.
          5       Q.   What about the municipal authorities, the
          6  political structures who were in power at that time?
          7  Did they do anything to prevent this movement of
          8  population from the urban area of Srebrenica?
          9       A.   Yes.  Yes, they did.  First of all, it was
         10  the former president of the Municipal Assembly, Besim
         11  Besovic who acted at that time.  He put a lot of
         12  personal effort in visiting various locations, seeing
         13  people, asking them not to panic, telling them that
         14  they had been living in the area together for hundreds
         15  of years and that they were capable of surmounting even
         16  this crisis, and he would tell them that there was no
         17  need for anyone to move away.
         18            However, I must stress that at that time,
         19  because the Serbs were leaving, some Bosniaks were
         20  leaving as well.  Actually, it was the Bosniaks who had
         21  left the town area in March and April 1992.  So, sir,
         22  let us be clear.  The town of Srebrenica, in the month
         23  of April, was abandoned, first of all, by Bosniaks.  It
         24  is true that part of Serbs had already moved their
         25  families away, but in the meantime, they had returned.

          1  However, the majority of Bosniaks who lived in the town
          2  area itself left the area at that time and, of course,
          3  they haven't come back to this very date.
          4       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, at that time we see the
          5  establishment of armed forces in Potocari, for example,
          6  Sucaskin [phoen] And other villages, under the
          7  leadership the Naser Oric, Zulfo Tursunovic, and
          8  others.  Do you have any knowledge about that?
          9       A.   I think we should move back in time a little
         10  and see about the cause.  It is true that the
         11  consequence was the formation of certain village
         12  guards.
         13       Q.   Please allow me, Mr. Mandzic, to repeat the
         14  question.  I think you should answer the question as it
         15  was put to you.
         16       A.   In view of the fact that in early April
         17  paramilitary units of Arkan and some other units such
         18  as White Swans arrived in Bratunac and forced the
         19  Bosniak population to leave the town and surrounding
         20  areas, the same happened in Srebrenica where Arkan's
         21  and Sesan's units, with the connivance of certain
         22  Serbian politicians, entered the town itself and caused
         23  the Bosniak population to withdraw further into the
         24  interior part of the territory, into some remote
         25  villages.  So those paramilitary units, most of which

          1  had come from the neighbouring country, that is, the
          2  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, attacked the Bosniak
          3  villages.
          4            So as a result of that, as a consequence of
          5  that, the population were forced to defend themselves.
          6  And it is true that in certain villages, there were
          7  some village guards but which were not very well
          8  organised.  Their task was mainly to protect the
          9  population from the exodus.
         10       Q.   Then we see the formation of the protected
         11  area and an agreement on demilitarisation was also
         12  signed.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  Will the interpreter say when
         14  there is a question and when there is an answer,
         15  because it is always the same voice and we don't know
         16  when it stops.
         17            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         18       Q.   It is the year of 1993.  Relevant
         19  UN resolutions were passed and the area was declared a
         20  safe haven, and an agreement on the demilitarisation of
         21  the zone was signed between General Halilovic and
         22  General Mladic, General Halilovic being the Commander
         23  of the BH army.
         24            That enclave, the safe area of Srebrenica,
         25  was it ever truly demilitarised, Mr. Mandzic?

          1       A.   Mostly it was.  First of all, all of the
          2  heavy artillery was handed over to the Protection
          3  Forces in the presence, as far as I can remember and
          4  according to some other people who lived in the area,
          5  of some representatives of the VRS.  An agreement was
          6  signed, and the heavy weapons were handed over.  In
          7  addition to that, some light weaponry was also handed
          8  over.  This could be seen by everybody who lived in the
          9  enclave.
         10            There used to be a huge pile of weapons next
         11  to the PTT building, and the light weaponry was mainly
         12  handed over to the UNPROFOR forces, but I don't know
         13  what they did with it, whether they destroyed it or
         14  what.
         15       Q.   Was the command of the 28th Division, which
         16  was commanded by Mr. Oric, quartered in Srebrenica?
         17       A.   Legally speaking, I can say that it did not
         18  exist there at that time.  In the enclave, there were
         19  no armed forces.  In the month of September in 1995, I
         20  did see something happening in Tuzla.  I know that the
         21  28th Division was established there by General Delic.
         22  But it happened only several months after the takeover
         23  of the enclave by the VRS.
         24       Q.   The year of 1995?
         25       A.   Yes.  In 1995 there was a review of the said

          1  division in Tuzla by the commander of the BH army,
          2  Rasim Delic.
          3            And let me mention one other fact.  From
          4  January of 1993, I was no longer a member of the armed
          5  forces; I was only a teacher and I worked in the field
          6  of education.
          7       Q.   Could you explain to us, Mr. Mandzic, because
          8  I trust that you are familiar with the situation that
          9  was taking place after July 1995, and even before
         10  that.  In the column that was formed in the village of
         11  Susnjari in the night between the 10th and 11th of
         12  July, there were at least 5.000 armed men.  How did
         13  they end up there, bearing in mind the fact that the
         14  area had been demilitarised?
         15       A.   Thank you for your question.  First of all, I
         16  must tell that I was not present in the village of
         17  Susnjari at the time.  I said that the demilitarisation
         18  of the enclave had been mostly finished, but, however,
         19  there were certain individuals who had their personal
         20  weapon licence for hunting rifles and some personal
         21  arms that they had kept as a souvenir in most of the
         22  cases.  So one could see such individuals in
         23  Srebrenica, and elsewhere, and even groups of such
         24  people, but they were groups of civilians who had kept
         25  their personal weapons.  But it was by no means, you

          1  know, hundreds of people.  One could perhaps check the
          2  record of the police department in Srebrenica to see
          3  how many individuals indeed had weapon licences, and I
          4  think it would bring us to the number of, I don't know,
          5  somewhere between 500 and 1.000 individuals.  Those
          6  were the people who had licences for their weapons, and
          7  I don't know anything about any other people with
          8  weapons.
          9            Those groups of people had kept weapons in
         10  order to protect their villages in such difficult
         11  situations.  They were members of small, unorganised
         12  village guards which were not under any military
         13  control, properly speaking.
         14       Q.   As far as I can understand what you're
         15  saying, those weapons were -- it was possible to obtain
         16  those weapons through regular purchase, according to
         17  our legislation.
         18       A.   Before the war, you mean, yes.
         19       Q.   Yes, yes.  I'm referring to hunting weapons.
         20       A.   However, not every citizen could obtain such
         21  weapons.  I remember that there were requests, dozens
         22  of requests coming from, for example, a particular
         23  local community, but only 10 people would end up
         24  getting their licences.
         25       Q.   What about automatic weapons, such as the

          1  infantry is using in the army?  Such weapons were not
          2  kept.  That is, I want to say that no licences could be
          3  issued for this type of weapons.
          4       A.   No, of course not.
          5       Q.   Let us turn to the village of Slapovici and
          6  the 8th of July.  Were there any armed formations in
          7  that village at that time?
          8       A.   I don't know.  All I know is that on the 6th
          9  of July, units of the VRS ran over the checkpoint in
         10  Zeleni Jadar that was met by UNPROFOR forces, and they
         11  continued advancing in the direction of the village of
         12  Slapovici, where there were several thousands of
         13  refugees who had been displaced as early as in 1992 and
         14  1993 from the areas such as the area of Bratunac, for
         15  example.
         16       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, the Swedish Housing Project had
         17  several hundreds of flats at their disposal?
         18       A.   Yes, that is correct.
         19       Q.   And how many people were accommodated there?
         20       A.   In my estimate, between two and three
         21  thousand.  The then-representatives of the municipality
         22  of Srebrenica probably have reliable figures to that
         23  effect.
         24       Q.   Let us be precise.  Those people at one point
         25  went from Slapovici to Potocari?

          1       A.   Yes, but there was a number of villages in
          2  the area where such columns were formed.
          3       Q.   So you were referring to the columns of
          4  people that were formed in those villages?
          5       A.   First of all, Slapovici, and then also some
          6  neighbouring villages:  Pusmulici and so on.  The total
          7  figure would be somewhere over 6.000, I think.
          8       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, turning to the first and the
          9  second meeting held on the 10th and the 11th of July in
         10  Bratunac, could you please tell us something more, more
         11  than what you said yesterday in your testimony,
         12  concerning the role and the participation of General
         13  Krstic in that meeting?
         14       A.   I can only say that General Krstic, who is
         15  present here today and who was here yesterday, was
         16  sitting next to General Mladic.  However, he did not
         17  say anything about the modalities regarding the
         18  population and how they should be taken care of or
         19  evacuated.  And it was not an evacuation; it was a
         20  deportation, as we all know.  General Krstic kept
         21  silent.  Whether by doing so he approved of what Mladic
         22  was saying, that will be upon the Judges to decide.
         23       Q.   So you were present at the meeting, and on
         24  the following day, on the 12th of July, the meeting was
         25  attended by two other representatives of the Bosniak

          1  population as well.  Could you now tell us who it was
          2  who actually conducted the negotiations; members of
          3  UNPROFOR -- we saw a video to that effect -- or
          4  yourself?
          5       A.   The negotiations were imposed on us by the
          6  Army of the Republika Srpska.  They were imposed also
          7  on UNPROFOR.  So the negotiations were mainly
          8  conducted, legally speaking, between the VRS and
          9  UNPROFOR.  As for ourselves, we were merely a
         10  delegation which had the need and wish to express its
         11  concern about the situation, about the position in
         12  which more than 30.000 people had found themselves,
         13  about the humanitarian needs that they had at the time,
         14  and so on.
         15            However, at that meeting, if you remember
         16  what I said, I told General Mladic -- and it was quite
         17  a difficult moment; one had to muster a lot of courage
         18  to do so.  I asked him, "Sir, whether, in view of the
         19  situation going on in the area of Srebrenica and
         20  Potocari, and bearing in mind the position of those
         21  30.000 refugees and displaced persons, I wish to know
         22  whether relevant international authorities -- UNHCR,
         23  ICRC -- have been informed about the situation of those
         24  people.
         25       Q.   As regards the situation in the base itself

          1  and the separation of males, was any distinction made
          2  in that respect?  Could you be precise as to the
          3  criterion?  Was it the working part of the population
          4  that was being separated or was it simply regardless of
          5  any criterion at all?
          6       A.   As I have already stated before this
          7  Honourable Chamber, I saw women board buses, together
          8  with small children between 1 and 10 years of age, but
          9  I didn't see anybody else.  And that is how I concluded
         10  that the units of the VRS had been separating menfolk
         11  from the rest of the population.  Because mostly it was
         12  the elderly and the infirm who were in Potocari at that
         13  time, but there were also between 1.000 and 2.000 men
         14  who were there at that time.
         15            Let me just mention one example from a
         16  village of the Srebrenica municipality.  There was a
         17  very old man who lived in my neighbourhood.  He was 85
         18  and he was there in a wheelchair.  He was a very simple
         19  man, a peasant, a shepherd, who had spent his life as a
         20  peasant, and he is no longer alive, and there are
         21  hundreds of people whose fate was the same.
         22       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, you talked about Colonel Nikolic
         23  who entered the base at one point.  Do you have any
         24  knowledge as to the fact of his military position?
         25       A.   I'm not quite sure what you have in mind.

          1       Q.   Was he an officer from the infantry or did
          2  you perhaps come to a different conclusion?  Did you
          3  perhaps think that he was an intelligence officer on an
          4  intelligence mission in the area?  Because we have to
          5  bear in mind the fact that he was questioning those
          6  people, interrogating them.
          7       A.   I really do not know which part of the army
          8  he belonged to.  I can not say anything about that.
          9       Q.   As regards the 12th of July, you said that
         10  units of the VRS were entering the area and you saw
         11  members of the VRS there at that time.  Could you tell
         12  us if they had -- if they had some different insignia
         13  on their uniforms at that time?
         14       A.   As I have already told Your Honours, I saw
         15  hundreds of soldiers.  Some of them were wearing
         16  insignia, some did not.  However, what I found rather
         17  surprising was the fact that there were hundreds of
         18  young soldiers who were there, who were there wearing
         19  uniforms, soldiers whom I had never seen in the area,
         20  and I believe I know the area very well.  This is where
         21  I was born.  I think that they would also have
         22  recognised me had they been from the area.  But again,
         23  I must say that there were quite a few soldiers wearing
         24  no insignia at all, soldiers of the VRS, that is.
         25       Q.   Was there any police?  Could you make a

          1  distinction at that time between the military and the
          2  police?
          3       A.   I could not.  I didn't see such insignia,
          4  whether they were the civilian or the military police.
          5       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, the statement that was the
          6  subject of the last part of your examination-in-chief,
          7  could you tell us whether Major Franken, as one of the
          8  signatories of the statement, did he or anybody else
          9  request a new statement to be drafted?  Do you
         10  understand my question?
         11       A.   Yes, I do, and it's a very good question
         12  indeed.  Looking with hindsight, it is true one could
         13  ask such a question.  However, you have to bear in mind
         14  the situation at the time.  There were about
         15  30.000 refugees.  Their deportation was imminent and it
         16  was to be to an unknown direction.  Also because of the
         17  fact that on the 12th and the 13th of July, units of
         18  the VRS forcibly stopped a convoy of wounded.  The
         19  convoy was stopped in Bratunac.  And there were quite a
         20  few severely wounded people, civilians, in that
         21  convoy.
         22            Also, on the 17th of July, on that day,
         23  dozens of severely wounded persons had been gathered in
         24  Potocari as well.  Some of them were still bleeding.  I
         25  can remember that a Dutch Battalion medical officer,

          1  medical doctor, did perform certain very complex
          2  surgeries on those people.
          3            I also remember that during those days,
          4  soldiers of the VRS came to us, were checking on the
          5  population, intimidating the population.  They were
          6  guarding the camp.  And I know that Major Nikolic or,
          7  rather, Colonel Nikolic, as he was addressed to, I
          8  remember that they came personally to see about the
          9  people who had remained there.  They wanted to know who
         10  they were, where they had come from, and what they were
         11  doing between 1992 and 1995.  They inquired whether
         12  they knew Naser Oric and this other gentleman you
         13  mentioned.  So a lot of pressure is being exerted on
         14  those people and myself as well.  So we had no choice.
         15            The Serbian side wouldn't have it anyway.  If
         16  they had wanted to have another declaration, another
         17  statement, they would have suggested that to us.  They
         18  would have proposed another statement to be drafted
         19  which would reflect the effects on the ground.
         20       Q.   But, Mr. Mandzic, the Serb delegation
         21  consisted only of Miroslav Deronjic at that point in
         22  time, on the 17th.
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   And in the end, I'm quoting:  "As regards the
         25  convoys escorted by the UN forces," end of quote.  And

          1  this significantly changes the content, and that is why
          2  I'm asking you, and I do not doubt that there was fear,
          3  but if one adds a sentence, which, as I have said,
          4  changes the substance of this text, couldn't one do
          5  something, make an effort to draw up a new statement,
          6  bearing in mind that at that meeting there were no
          7  representatives of the army or police, there were only
          8  civilian representatives, rather, Miroslav Deronjic as
          9  the representative of the civilian authority in the
         10  municipality of Srebrenica.  He was the only one
         11  present.  So could you answer that question with yes or
         12  no, please?
         13       A.   The statement mentions other representatives
         14  of the military and civilian authority of the Republika
         15  Srpska, and the signatory, on behalf of all of them, is
         16  Deronjic.
         17            And I did see Deronjic in the Dutch battalion
         18  compound, but until that time, until that moment when
         19  Deronjic came to see Major Franken and when they
         20  invited me, they had been officers and soldiers of the
         21  VRS.  From the place where we were sitting and where we
         22  signed that document, only five metres away were the
         23  guards of the Army of Republika Srpska.  So that we had
         24  no say.  We could have no saying in changing and
         25  rephrasing the document, with the exception of the last

          1  sentence in the statement that as far as the convoys
          2  escorted by UN -- by UNPROFOR forces were concerned.
          3       Q.   And finally, do you -- are you aware that
          4  from Bratunac, from the hospital which was run by the
          5  International Red Cross, the wounded were evacuated,
          6  rather, Muslim wounded were transferred from Bratunac,
          7  from the hospital where they had been hospitalised, and
          8  were transported to the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina
          9  and with the Red Cross escort?
         10       A.   I do not know many details about this,
         11  whether all those wounded managed to survive.  Most of
         12  them, yes, I mean, those wounded.  But it was only on
         13  the 17th of July that in the presence of some
         14  representatives of the International Committee of the
         15  Red Cross, but this -- there was, believe me, a much
         16  larger number of wounded, of sick, and we know nothing
         17  about their fate to this day.
         18       Q.   Mr. Mandzic, thank you.
         19            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours,
         20  I have no further questions.
         21       A.   Thank you too, counsel.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         23  Mr. Cayley.
         24            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I
         25  have no questions for the witness on re-examination.  I

          1  would simply ask to move a number of exhibits into
          2  evidence.  They are Exhibit 40, which is the video of
          3  the second meeting in Bratunac; Exhibit 40A, "B," and
          4  "C," which are the English, French, and B/C/S
          5  translations of the transcript of that meeting;
          6  Exhibit 41, which is a still photograph of
          7  Colonel Karremans taken from that video; Exhibit 42,
          8  which is a still of Petar, a translator/interpreter;
          9  then there is Exhibit 43, which is the still of a VRS
         10  officer who the witness was unable to identify but did
         11  recognise being at the meeting; Exhibit 44, which is
         12  the still of General Mladic; Exhibit 45, which is the
         13  still of General Krstic; Exhibit 46, which is the still
         14  of a broken sign placed in front of the witness at the
         15  meeting.  Then there is Exhibit 47, which composes of
         16  four parts, an English translation which is 47A; 47B,
         17  which is an English field translation; 47C, which is a
         18  French translation; and 47D, which is a B/C/S
         19  translation.  And then finally Exhibit 48, which is the
         20  still of the Dutch Major, Major Boering.  If I could
         21  apply for admission of all of those exhibits into
         22  evidence, please, Mr. President.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         24  Mr. Cayley.  We shall continue in the presence of
         25  Mr. Mandzic, and we shall consider this at the end, but
          1  I have to ask the Defence.
          2            Do you have any objections against the
          3  admission of this evidence?
          4            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] No,
          5  Mr. President.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] These
          7  exhibits will be admitted.  Now I shall give the floor
          8  to my colleagues to see if they have any questions.
          9            Judge Riad, you have the floor.
         10            JUDGE RIAD: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         11  Mr. President.  Yes, I do.
         12       Q.   [In English] Good morning, Mr. Mandzic.
         13       A.   Good morning.
         14       Q.   I would like you to give me some more
         15  precision about what you have been telling us.  First
         16  concerning the meeting in the Fontana Hotel, which you
         17  talked about with the Prosecutor and with Defence
         18  counsel, the meeting of the 12th of July at 10.00.  You
         19  mentioned that General Krstic was sitting next to
         20  General Mladic and that he was silent.
         21            Was there any other manifestation in that
         22  meeting, whether from the side of General Krstic or the
         23  others, of approval of this or disapproval or threat or
         24  anything, or were they just silent witnesses.  Could
         25  they have expressed anything in the presence of Mladic,

          1  in your opinion?
          2       A.   Thank you.  Your Honours, when I speak about
          3  the second meeting which took place on the 12th of
          4  July, 1995 in the Fontana Hotel, yes, indeed, next to
          5  General Mladic was General Krstic.  General Krstic and
          6  other officers representing the command of the Army of
          7  Republika Srpska were not adding anything to what
          8  General Mladic was saying.
          9            When he would say something -- I mean,
         10  General Mladic, when General Mladic turned to me and
         11  said, "Nesib, everything is in your hands.  You can
         12  survive or you can vanish as people from the face of
         13  the earth because God Almighty has given us life and
         14  given us room to leave in peace, so it is logical that
         15  the survivability of a community, of a people is
         16  determined, decided by the Maker," and the other side
         17  of General Mladic then says, "Or you may vanish,"  none
         18  of the military representatives of the Army of
         19  Republika Srpska or the civilian authorities reacted to
         20  that.  They went along with the General's idea that a
         21  local community might or the population might vanish,
         22  and that is -- that particular thing which instilled
         23  fear in the Bosniak delegation, in us, all along those
         24  days we felt this tremendous pressure to begin with
         25  because of the presence of all those officers and

          1  soldiers of the Army of Republika Srpska, but we were
          2  also under tremendous psychological pressure which was
          3  created by the encirclement and by the creation of a
          4  ghetto, I have to put it that way, in this small area
          5  in Potocari.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Then I just gathered you
          7  repeated several times the word "vanish."  You
          8  understood from it clearly that it was to vanish  from
          9  this planet, from this world, or to vanish from
         10  Srebrenica or Bosnia?  Was it vanishing in the meaning
         11  of extermination, in your opinion, or -- clearly was it
         12  extermination?
         13       A.   That word I understood meant "to vanish"; the
         14  disappearance, the end of life of all those people,
         15  their execution.  Somebody was depriving, was taking
         16  away their right to life.  And that kind of power was
         17  then with the Army of Republika Srpska, their power,
         18  and General Mladic put it in so many words.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  How many were the other officers
         20  with General Mladic, and what was their rank, if you
         21  know, of General Krstic, or his importance in this
         22  group of Mladic?
         23       A.   I remember that on the first night, I mean
         24  the 11th of July, sometime around 11.00 at night,
         25  General Mladic introduced all the officers who were

          1  present, the officers of the Army of Republika Srpska;
          2  first, General Krstic, and he introduced him as a corps
          3  commander.  At that time I was slightly taken aback
          4  that General Krstic was the corps commander, to begin
          5  with, because listening from time to time to radio
          6  news, and we had difficulty in hearing that in
          7  Srebrenica, while we lived in the enclave, because all
          8  the radio transmission equipment had been destroyed
          9  around us and the signal was very weak.
         10            But in 1993, 1994, the commander of the corps
         11  of the Drina Corps was General Zivanovic.  And most of
         12  the Bosniaks and Serbs in the area, in the
         13  municipalities of Srebrenica and Bratunac, knew him,
         14  because he came -- he was born in that area, from the
         15  boundary between Srebrenica, Bratunac municipalities,
         16  and so I was quite surprised to hear that General
         17  Krstic was the commander of that corps.  But General
         18  Krstic, and I repeat that, did not amplify on what
         19  General Mladic was saying, nor did he say anything.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  I gather from what you said that
         21  General Krstic replaced Zivanovic, who you thought or
         22  you knew was the corps commander.  Was that related a
         23  little bit to what was preceding the events which
         24  happened afterwards?
         25       A.   No, I do not think it had any effect.  I do

          1  not think it really mattered who was the corps
          2  commander.  They simply expected General Zivanovic to
          3  be that, because he came from that area, from the
          4  municipality of Srebrenica.  I did not know that
          5  General Krstic had replaced him.  But I doubt that
          6  anything would have happened differently.  If the plan
          7  was to take the Srebrenica -- or rather, their plan was
          8  to take the enclave and to expel and to separate the
          9  male population, and other physical and psychological
         10  barriers that the civilian population was confronted
         11  with in those days.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  A corps commander means that he
         13  will be one giving the orders?
         14       A.   In the former Yugoslav Army, that is, in the
         15  former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, I
         16  served the army in 1981, 1982, and at that time a corps
         17  commander, from what I knew, was also a member of the
         18  Main Staff, that is, the second in command to the
         19  commander of the armed forces.  And in his area of
         20  responsibility, the authority covered by the units
         21  subordinate to him.  He used to be the man who would
         22  have complete control and therefore responsible for the
         23  conduct of whatever operations, naturally, I assume,
         24  while informing, while notifying the Main Staff about
         25  that.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, you mentioned something
          2  about these people, the VRS soldiers, whom you never
          3  saw before -- some of them were young -- and they had
          4  no insignia and they had a different accent.  Now, you
          5  being about more or less -- I think you are a man of
          6  culture and you know the accents a little bit perhaps
          7  of the area.  What accent did they have?  From which
          8  part, do you think?
          9       A.   Yes.  I completed my secondary education in
         10  Belgrade and I worked there for about a year and a half
         11  after I matriculated from the secondary school.  So I
         12  know the Ekavian dialect, such as is spoken by
         13  Counsel Petrusic.
         14            In Serbia most people will use Ekavian
         15  dialect.  In Bosnia-Herzegovina or, specifically, the
         16  north-eastern Bosnia, they will speak Ijekavian
         17  dialect.  But at that time I could, as I said, I could
         18  hear young soldiers, whom I did not know, well
         19  uniformed, clean-shaven, very tidy, very neat, who were
         20  selectively torching houses in the Potocari area, I
         21  assume having received orders to that effect, and their
         22  speech varied.  Some of them, they spoke Ijekavian
         23  dialect, or there was a mixture of the two dialects, of
         24  the Ekavian and Ijekavian, and, as far as I remember,
         25  an Ekavian speech, but different from the one spoken by

          1  those who live in west Serbia.  It sounded more like
          2  the speech, like the dialect of Vojvodina and Slavonia.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, you are finished?  Good.
          4  Now, another question concerning the list which was
          5  given to Major Franken.  It was the list of 239 men
          6  which apparently disappeared, if I understood rightly.
          7  And he told you he would put it in his trousers and
          8  nobody would take it.  Have you an idea of the future,
          9  what happened to this list?
         10       A.   Yes.  Well, I spent months trying to locate
         11  this list of 239 men, and Ibro Nuhanovic's son was also
         12  trying to trace it.  I told you that Ibro Nuhanovic was
         13  a member of the Bosnian delegation and we just do not
         14  know what happened to him.  And it was only through
         15  some journalists who came from Western Europe to
         16  Bosnia-Herzegovina that Hasan Nuhanovic was able to get
         17  that list, and he showed me and I saw it and I also
         18  have it.  I wrote it in my own hand.  But it was only
         19  several months later, perhaps four or five months later
         20  I was able to see it again.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  But during these months you
         22  don't know what happened to it, in whose hands it was?
         23       A.   I don't know in whose hands it was.  We made
         24  some guesses that perhaps the Dutch battalion
         25  commander, or perhaps his deputy, Major Franken, had

          1  given it to the UNPROFOR command for former Yugoslavia,
          2  which I believe was headquartered in Zagreb.  But we as
          3  individuals could not get the list, because there were
          4  some -- it was said that the list, or rather a copy of
          5  that list with 239 names could be given only to some
          6  organisations, and like that.  But I was concerned.  I
          7  was really worried.  I really hoped that the list would
          8  not be destroyed and that we would lose any trace of
          9  existence of those men.
         10            But Mr. President, Your Honours, when one --
         11  when I leafed through that list before I left Bosnia
         12  for The Hague and for this august institution, I went
         13  through that list and I felt a lump in my throat,
         14  because those people are no more.  And the world
         15  watched quietly.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Some people refused to have
         17  their names on the list.  Are they also no more, or
         18  perhaps some of them are still around?
         19       A.   If I may just a minute.  May I have just a
         20  minute?  I need to calm down.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Sorry.  I can stop my
         22  questions.
         23       A.   Yes, but, you know, they were all my fellow
         24  townsmen.  I can.  I can.  Yes, I'm all right now.  I'm
         25  all right now.

          1            Your Honours, there were also some men of
          2  different ages, even those of 80 and over, who in such
          3  a dramatic situation refused to be included in the
          4  list, fearing that the list might fall into the hands
          5  of the Army of Republika Srpska.  And they thought,
          6  well, if they don't know my name, then who he is and
          7  what he is, perhaps it will make it easier through the
          8  checkpoints of the Army of Republika Srpska.
          9  Lamentably, that is not what happened.  Yes, you may go
         10  on.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  You mentioned, you answered the
         12  Defence counsel that Serbs started leaving Srebrenica
         13  in 1992.  There was something -- I think 5.000, I
         14  don't -- something of that count, and they said the
         15  times are somehow uncertain, this is why they left,
         16  because, according to you, there was no mistreatment,
         17  there was no threat.  How -- I mean, were there some
         18  rumours, or perhaps some information, now that you
         19  effectively received, they received, to know what was
         20  going to happen, and that it was safer to go out?  Why
         21  did they leave, if there was no threat or no
         22  mistreatment?
         23       A.   Your Honour, I mentioned, I don't know how it
         24  was translated, that prior to the war in 1992,
         25  approximately 38.000 people lived in the territory of

          1  the Srebrenica municipality.  In the town itself, there
          2  were about 5.000 people, and more than 32.000 lived
          3  outside the town area, and they lived in the so-called
          4  local communes.  So as far as the town area is
          5  concerned there were about 1.500 to 2.000 Serbs.  So
          6  the Bosniaks were the majority in the town as well.
          7            In the spring, in April of 1992, on the
          8  border with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in neighbouring
          9  towns on the territory of the Federal Republic of
         10  Yugoslavia, such as Bajina, Basta, Ljubovija, military
         11  units were located on those borders, and there was a
         12  heavy concentration of troops on those borders, troops
         13  belonging to the army of the Federal Republic of
         14  Yugoslavia.  Several months earlier that country put a
         15  ban on the import of food stuffs for the population in
         16  Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Since both Bosniaks and Serbs
         17  regularly had to cross over that border prior to the
         18  conflict, they had an opportunity to see armed units in
         19  the area, and according to what they said, those units
         20  made it perfectly clear that they would be coming to
         21  Bosnia to protect Serbs, as they put it.
         22            Again, I must say, and I'm speaking the
         23  truth, and nothing but the truth, that before the month
         24  of April, in the territory of the Bratunac and
         25  Srebrenica municipalities, there had been no armed

          1  forces, either of Bosniaks or Serbs.  That was the case
          2  until mid-April, and until that time they lived
          3  together, they worked together, their children went to
          4  school together.  But at one point in time,
          5  paramilitary units entered the area from the republic
          6  of Yugoslavia.  I'm referring first of all to the units
          7  of Arkan.  They came to Bratunac.  And this caused
          8  panic amongst the population.  And at that moment
          9  Srebrenica was being abandoned both by Bosniaks and
         10  Serbs, together, if I may put it that way.  Serbs were
         11  mostly moving their families away into the neighbouring
         12  towns in Serbia.  Bosniaks were leaving to major
         13  Bosniak centres such as Tuzla, for example, and the
         14  towns in that area.
         15            The result of that situation in the territory
         16  of the Srebrenica municipality was such that as early
         17  as the 17th of April, I think, paramilitary units,
         18  together with certain local Serbian politicians who
         19  were hard-liners and were supported by certain members
         20  of their population, they entered the town of
         21  Srebrenica.  There were no Bosniaks in the town area
         22  itself at the time.  They had fled, in the meantime,
         23  out of fear.  Several elderly Bosniaks had remained, of
         24  course.
         25            But at that moment, the paramilitary units

          1  entered the town, and in late April and early May,
          2  several people, several elderly people, were killed by
          3  the members of those paramilitary units.  The victims
          4  were old and infirm Bosniaks.  And let us not be
          5  confused about that.  In April of that year, citizens
          6  of both ethnic groups were leaving Srebrenica.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  I think I understood.  Thank
          8  you.
          9       A.   Yes, thank you.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         11  Judge Riad.
         12            Judge Wald.
         13            JUDGE WALD:  Mr. Mandzic, you referred, in
         14  your earlier testimony, to the fact that there were
         15  about 5.000 people in the UN Compound before the
         16  evacuation and maybe 15.000 to 20.000 people were
         17  outside the compound in the neighbouring streets,
         18  congregated, milling around.  I have two questions.
         19  One is:  You also testified, and I think we saw a video
         20  of Colonel Karremans, who said basically the vast
         21  majority of the evacuees were women and children or
         22  maybe the elderly or the sick.  Is that true of the
         23  group that was outside the compound, the 15.000 to
         24  20.000, as well as those that were inside, or were
         25  there considerably greater proportion of men in the

          1  group outside the compound?
          2       A.   Thank you for your question, Your Honour.  At
          3  the base itself, at the camp, approximately 5.000
          4  people had found shelter.  However, outside the camp
          5  there were no 15.000 or 20.000 people but probably more
          6  than 25.000 people.  I think that their situation was
          7  far worse than the situation of the people who had
          8  gathered in the camp two or three days before.  They
          9  had no water.  They had no toilet facilities.  They had
         10  no food.  On the other hand, they were being attacked
         11  by the VRS units.
         12            JUDGE WALD:  I understand that from your
         13  prior testimony.  My question specifically was though:
         14  In that 25.000 people outside, were they mostly women
         15  and children too or were they more a mixture of men?
         16  From the photographs one would see many men there, but
         17  it was a greater percentage of men in the outside group
         18  than of the inside group?  Is that right or wrong?
         19       A.   In that group, in that mass of 25.000 people,
         20  there were mostly women and children, but to answer
         21  specifically that question as regards the male
         22  population between 18 years of age and 60, I think that
         23  there were more of them outside than inside the camp.
         24  And proportionally speaking, there were, of course,
         25  much more people outside the camp than within the

          1  compound itself.
          2            JUDGE WALD:  Thank you.  My second question
          3  along the same lines is:  When the evacuation began,
          4  were the people outside the compound the ones -- the
          5  25.000 that you talked about, were they put on buses or
          6  were the people inside the compound put on buses first
          7  and, later on, what happened to that group outside the
          8  compound once the evacuation began?
          9       A.   I'm using the word "deportation."  I felt it
         10  on my own skin.  Began on the 12th of July, in the
         11  early afternoon hours.
         12            The first to be put on buses were persons
         13  standing outside the camp, and then it was only later
         14  on, in the afternoon hours of the 13th of July, that
         15  the persons inside the camp were being put on buses,
         16  were being deported.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.  Now, on the
         18  night of the 11th in the Fontana Hotel, the first
         19  meeting that you went to and of which we saw a video,
         20  General Mladic said several times words to the effect
         21  of, "Get your people to lay down their arms if they
         22  want to survive.  Survival is in your hands.  Bring me
         23  a delegation that can produce people who will lay down
         24  their arms if you want to preserve the population."
         25            Now, at that point, as you have testified and

          1  others as well, the people in the compound and outside
          2  of the compound were mainly women and children.  The
          3  column that was going to Tuzla had already left, is
          4  that not right?  It left from a neighbouring village.
          5  So how did you understand General Mladic's ultimatum to
          6  be?  If you had wanted to accede to it, what could you
          7  have done?  The people with the arms had already left,
          8  as I understand it, and begun to march towards Tuzla on
          9  their own, and the people that were left in the
         10  compound were largely women and children.  So how did
         11  you -- when he talked about "survive or vanish" or "lay
         12  down your arms," what do you think he wanted you to
         13  do?
         14       A.   I do remember very well what General Mladic
         15  said and how he threatened us.  He said, "Lay down your
         16  weapons and you can either survive or vanish."  It was
         17  difficult to understand such a request, because we were
         18  simply representatives of the displaced population.  We
         19  were not representatives of any armed force.
         20            However, General Mladic persisted in his
         21  request that we should lay our weapons, and nobody had
         22  anything -- nobody amongst the population that gathered
         23  there.  So I realised it was a kind of psychological
         24  pressure, and I feared the worst for that population.
         25            JUDGE WALD:  When you convened the next

          1  morning with your three-person delegation, did
          2  General Mladic bring that up again?  You didn't testify
          3  too much about what was happening on the morning of the
          4  12th.  Did he again say, "Well, here's your
          5  delegation.  I want you to tell me you'll lay down your
          6  arms and everything will be all right," or did he just
          7  drop that subject altogether on the morning of the 12th
          8  meeting?
          9       A.   Your Honour, to the best of my recollection,
         10  on the following day, on the 12th of July,
         11  General Mladic reiterated the request to our
         12  delegation.  He said, "Lay down your weapons," and
         13  again, as far as I can remember, he said that, "Whoever
         14  lays down his weapons, I, as a General and a human
         15  being, can guarantee there would be no problems, would
         16  have no problems.  Our objective is not to harm the
         17  Muslim population, and we will enable every single
         18  individual, regardless of age and sex, to choose the
         19  place where he or she wants live."
         20            JUDGE WALD:  Did anyone in your delegation
         21  ask him or suggest to him that you didn't have a
         22  population with arms, you just had some women and
         23  children and some elderly and infirm displaced persons,
         24  there was no way to get them to lay down arms that they
         25  didn't have?

          1       A.   Yes.  Yes, Your Honour.  This was done
          2  firstly by Mrs. Camila Omanovic, as a member of our
          3  delegation.  She said, "Well, sir, we have nothing to
          4  do with those who took to the woods, who may have
          5  weapons with them.  What we have here are refugees,
          6  displaced persons without any food, water, medicine,
          7  clothing."
          8            JUDGE WALD:  Am I correct that in both the
          9  11th meeting in the evening and the 12th meeting there
         10  was a film crew filming this, or was it only the night
         11  of the 11th that General Mladic had a film crew who was
         12  filming the whole thing?  Were they on the 12th or were
         13  they on the 11th?
         14       A.   On the 11th and the 12th of July, the film
         15  crew was there, and they also came to Potocari on the
         16  13th of July.  I could see them there.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  My last question deals
         18  with the document that we talked about that was signed
         19  on the 17th.  You went over, with Mr. Cayley, some of
         20  the statements that you said were not correct, were
         21  inaccurate.  Let me point your direction to one of them
         22  that you did not discuss, to get your opinion on that.
         23  It is the one -- the third from the bottom which says:
         24  "It was agreed that we could choose where we wanted to
         25  go.  We decided that the entire civilian population

          1  move out of the enclave and be evacuated to the
          2  territory of Kladanj."
          3            Now, can you tell me your opinion on whether
          4  that was an accurate statement that "we," whoever "we"
          5  is, "decided that the entire civilian population would
          6  move out"?
          7       A.   It is not an accurate statement, Your
          8  Honour.  Between the 6th and the 11th of July, units of
          9  the VRS forced about 40.000 strong population of the
         10  area to leave their homes, to abandon their estates,
         11  their belongings, everything they had.  Most of them
         12  found themselves in Potocari; that is, they were
         13  directed by VRS units to that particular location
         14  because of the fire that was being opened.  The
         15  population was pushed up to Potocari by VRS units.
         16            On the 12th and the 13th of July, VRS units
         17  encircled the area and started entering the group of
         18  people.  Then they began separating the population
         19  according to their age and sex.  They started putting
         20  people on buses.
         21            We are the kind of people that cannot easily
         22  accept departure from our homes and separation.  Every
         23  single change, every move to another town, another city
         24  is very difficult to us, let alone deportation.
         25            So this statement is by no means true and

          1  does not reflect the real situation.  If there had been
          2  any understanding on the part of VRS units, if they had
          3  withdrawn at least here at the boundaries of the
          4  demilitarised area, everybody, all of the population,
          5  would have come back.
          6            I apologise, Your Honour, but I have to say
          7  that we had been living as refugees for years.  We have
          8  been living as refugees for years, and we're trying to
          9  go back but this is very difficult.  Before the war,
         10  we, and I refer to both Bosniaks and Serbs, used to
         11  have a good life there.  We had our houses there, we
         12  had good salaries.  There were no homeless people.  We
         13  had, you know, more houses than families.  There are
         14  figures that can testify to that effect.
         15            JUDGE WALD:  At the time of this statement,
         16  July 17th, 1995, did any Serbians still live -- any
         17  Serb civilians still live in Srebrenica?  I know you
         18  talked a great deal and told us a great deal about how
         19  the Bosniaks and the Serbs, starting in April, had
         20  begun to leave, but were there any Serbian civilians
         21  left in Srebrenica in July?
         22       A.   You mean before the capturing of the
         23  enclave?
         24            JUDGE WALD:  At the time of the Potocari --
         25  no, after the capturing.  At the time of the Potocari

          1  evacuation, were there any Serbians still resident,
          2  living in Srebrenica?
          3       A.   Since 1992, that is, May 1992 until July
          4  1995, there had been a small group of Serbian citizens,
          5  mostly elderly people.  And on that day, on the 11th of
          6  July when this massive persecution occurred of the
          7  members of the Bosniak community, that small group of
          8  Serbian residents remained.  And I can say that because
          9  I work in Srebrenica, that most of them still live
         10  there and work there, and they still hoped that we
         11  would come back.
         12            JUDGE WALD:  Thank you.
         13       A.   But on the other -- yes.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Well, as
         15  far as I can see, we have been working for one and a
         16  half hours, and this has been quite an ordeal for our
         17  interpreters.  I'm in a bit of a quandary here.  I have
         18  questions myself, but it wouldn't make much sense to
         19  bring back the witness after the recess.  Would you be
         20  so kind as to give us another 10 minutes?  I will try
         21  and be very brief in my questions.  Very well.  Thank
         22  you very much.
         23            Mr. Mandzic, I have three questions for you,
         24  and I will try to be as brief as possible, and I should
         25  also ask you to answer with the same concern in mind.

          1            I'm interested in reasons of the signature on
          2  this statement as it was presented to you.  Did they
          3  explain to you any reasons for the signing of the
          4  statement?
          5       A.   What is stated here is not correct.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Sorry to
          7  interrupt you.  I would like to know if the persons who
          8  produced this document told you, "You're going to sign
          9  it because so-and-so."
         10       A.   Well, we were all very well aware of the fact
         11  that in Bratunac, which was a town controlled by the
         12  VRS, that several dozens of wounded persons had been
         13  kept, that in Potocari there was still a number, that
         14  is, several dozens of severely wounded persons,
         15  including women and children, and we also knew that at
         16  the time there were 27 healthy persons, who also wanted
         17  to survive, still there.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  But
         19  what you're telling me are your own reasons, the
         20  reasons you perceived as being such.  What I'm
         21  interested in is what Mr. Deronjic told you.  Did he
         22  explain anything?  Did he tell you why you had to sign
         23  this statement?
         24       A.   No.  No.  He did not.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So you were

          1  aware of the situation.  You knew what would happen,
          2  and you felt that you had to sign this document.  Was
          3  that the case?
          4       A.   Yes.  The fate of probably 80 or 100 Bosniaks
          5  depended on our signature and also the fate of the
          6  soldiers of the Dutch Battalion.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
          8  Mr. Mandzic.  You have spoken about that.  Thank you
          9  very much.  We are little pressed for time.
         10            I have one other question in respect of this
         11  document.  You signed a declaration, a statement, in
         12  your language, and you also signed a copy in English.
         13  Is that true?
         14       A.   Yes, it is.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] At the
         16  time, did you understand English?
         17       A.   A little bit.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         19  Thank you.  Still on the same document.  In most of the
         20  sentences the plural is used in this document.  It
         21  says, "we," "our civilian population," and so on and so
         22  forth, but at one point it is stated:  "After the
         23  agreement was reached, I claim that the evacuation of
         24  the civilian population of the Srebrenica enclave was
         25  carried out absolutely correctly," and so on.  I'm

          1  interested to know who was the person who was
          2  speaking.  Who used this particular expression "I
          3  claim"?
          4       A.   There was no Bosniak delegation, properly
          5  speaking, on the 13th of the July.  Mr. Nuhanovic, with
          6  his family, had left; that is, we didn't know anything
          7  about him.  Mrs. Camila Omanovic had a nervous
          8  breakdown because soldiers of the VRS had entered the
          9  area.  So they knew very well about the whereabouts of
         10  the members of the Bosniak delegation.
         11            So I was the only one who was capable of
         12  following the situation.  I was trying to record
         13  everything but, of course, I wasn't in the position to
         14  record everything because I feared that whatever I
         15  write might end up in the hands of the Serb army.
         16            So the only person they could count upon was
         17  myself, and I was the one who had to understand the
         18  situation of those people, and their fate depended on
         19  this understanding of mine.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So this
         21  expression "I claim," first person singular, refers to
         22  you?
         23       A.   Well, yes, but it is not mine, properly
         24  speaking, because I was not the drafter of this
         25  statement, and the statement did not reflect the

          1  facts.  It was prepared in advance, and it was merely
          2  an ultimatum.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          4  Mr. Mandzic, you probably read this document several
          5  times, and you probably read it more than I did.  If
          6  you have a look at it, all we have throughout the
          7  document is the first person plural, "we", "our
          8  population," and so on and so forth.  But there is one
          9  paragraph, one single paragraph where the wording used
         10  is "I claim."  What I'm trying to understand is who it
         11  was who said, "I" and who it was who used the
         12  expression "we" and "our."  Are you in a position to
         13  explain that to us?
         14       A.   We, and I, probably referred to a
         15  representative of the civilian government of Republika
         16  Srpska.  In this document, where it is stated "I
         17  claim," I do not claim anything, because I was not the
         18  drafter of the document.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         20  So if I can use the expression, there is some kind of
         21  schizophrenia in this document.  We have two persons
         22  speaking at the same time.  At any rate, we will see
         23  later on how this problem can be resolved.
         24       A.   Your Honour, if I may, in this document the
         25  drafter of the document used the word "I"

          1  conscientiously.  Two other members of the delegation,
          2  Nuhanovic, for example, had been taken away.  He had
          3  probably been killed in the meantime.  Camila Omanovic
          4  had had a nervous breakdown.  In the previous sentences
          5  the persons are speaking -- are used in plural.
          6  Probably several persons are needed to have a proper
          7  agreement, but I was the only one who was there, so the
          8  drafter of this particular statement had all the
          9  necessary knowledge about our situation.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         11  Another question which I have concerns the presence of
         12  General Krstic.  We know that he was present at two
         13  meetings in Bratunac on the 10th and on the 11th.  Did
         14  you see him again after those two meetings?
         15       A.   General Krstic, I never saw him before the
         16  11th of July.  The only time I saw him was on the 11th
         17  and the 12th of July.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         19  Another question.
         20            Mr. Mandzic, it is Exhibit 40A, and this is
         21  the transcript of a video, which I wish to read to
         22  you.  General Mladic asks you, "Are you a teacher?"
         23  And you say, "Yes, I was this morning, but I don't know
         24  for how long."  What did you mean by that?
         25       A.   General Mladic put a question to me:  what

          1  was my profession and what had I done before the war
          2  and while living in the enclave.  And I told him that
          3  before the war I was a teacher also in the enclave in
          4  1994, 1995, that I was a teacher and school principal.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me,
          6  Mr. Mandzic.  Will you please try to answer my question
          7  directly.  General Mladic asked you, "Are you a
          8  teacher?"  And you said, "Yes, I am.  I was one this
          9  morning, but I do not know for how long yet."  And
         10  Mladic then goes on, "What school did you come from?"
         11  And you say, "The electrical engineering."
         12            My question is, what did you mean when you
         13  said, "I was this morning, but I don't know for how
         14  long yet."  So this is my question.  Would you please
         15  try to answer it directly.
         16       A.   Well, I didn't know if I would live to see
         17  another day or not, because the enclave had been taken,
         18  its population expelled, and I could see that the
         19  Bosnian Serb army was treating the Bosnian population
         20  ruthlessly, so I simply realised that I could expect
         21  the worst.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         23  I have finished.  I do not have any more questions at
         24  the moment.  So you answered the questions of the
         25  counsel for the Prosecution, the counsel for the

          1  Defence, the Judges.  Is there anything that you should
          2  like to say and were not asked about?  If there is
          3  something that you should like to tell us, you can do
          4  so now.
          5       A.   Mr. President, Your Honours, about life in
          6  Srebrenica between 1992 and 1995, about the suffering
          7  of the population, the expulsion, and so on and so
          8  forth, one could go on and on.  But what I should like
          9  to emphasise, and it goes beyond this institution, is
         10  how to overcome the effects.
         11            In the first place, I have in mind tens of
         12  thousands of expelled who live in Tuzla, Sarajevo, and
         13  dozens of other places around the Federation, and most
         14  of them have said that they would like to go back to
         15  their homes.  But for political and other barriers,
         16  people are not returning.  And they live now as
         17  second-rate citizens.  They suffer because their life
         18  is not worthy of man.  But I do know that that is not a
         19  subject that is dealt by this Tribunal.  But any
         20  advice, any recommendation that you might have, I would
         21  think would be of great help to other institutions who
         22  are responsible for trying to resolve the problem of
         23  refugees and displacement as soon as possible, to help
         24  those people go back home and live life worthy of human
         25  beings.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
          2  Mr. Mandzic.  We have finished.  You have told us about
          3  your suffering.  Thank you.  You showed great courage
          4  in coming and testifying here.  You have also given
          5  evidence of your spirit of tolerance.  I believe I
          6  speak in the name of my colleagues when I tell you that
          7  we all wish you a happy return to your home.  Yes,
          8  those places were witness to suffering, but they should
          9  also be witness to tolerance and peace.  Injustice,
         10  wherever, shall always be a threat to everybody.
         11            Now I believe I must make it up to everybody,
         12  and especially the interpreters, and we shall make a
         13  half-an-hour break now and we'll resume after the break
         14  with another witness.  Half an hour, therefore.
         15            Thank you and farewell.
         16            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.  Thank you, too.
         17                 --- Recess taken at 1.10 p.m.
         18                 --- On resuming at 1.48 p.m.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         20  Now we have also had the opportunity of enjoying this
         21  great weather, and I believe the interpreters did the
         22  same thing, but now I think it is time to resume.
         23            Mr. Cayley, the floor is yours.
         24            MR. CAYLEY:  Just a point that relates to the
         25  document with which you were concerned, which is
          1  Exhibit 47, and we've been notified by the translation
          2  and interpretation unit that there is, in fact, a
          3  mistake in the French translation in the final
          4  paragraph.  In the English translation -- this is the
          5  final paragraph on page 1 of the document:  "After the
          6  agreement was reached, I claim."  That is what it
          7  states in the English translation, and apparently the
          8  verb used in the French translation is wrong, and is
          9  not a correct translation of the original version in
         10  B/C/S.
         11            Please don't ask me the details.  Being an
         12  Englishman, I'm embarrassingly unilingual, so I don't
         13  want to get involved in arguments over what it should
         14  be but, nevertheless, we're informed it's wrong and a
         15  corrected version will be produced, which we will
         16  submit to the Court tomorrow.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Because if
         18  one reads the French version, "exiger," "I demand it,"
         19  then the English version should say, "I claimed."  But
         20  my question was not to find out about the correct tense
         21  but whether it was singular or plural.  But we shall
         22  wait for the amended version to see the result.  Thank
         23  you.
         24            MR. CAYLEY:  I think that the tense is
         25  actually correct in terms of -- in fact, not that you

          1  refer to the tense, whether the word "I" or "we" was
          2  used.  But from my own interpretation of this document,
          3  if you go to the second paragraph, it actually states,
          4  "The representatives from our side were Camila
          5  Purkovic, Ibro Nuhanovic, and myself Nesib Mandzic."
          6            Now, I'm obviously not really in a position
          7  to really argue the matter before you, Mr. President.
          8  Perhaps now is not the proper time.  But I think the
          9  document does actually make it clear that he was
         10  signing as an individual on behalf of two people that
         11  were not present, and that is why the document was
         12  drafted in that manner.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Be that as
         14  it may, I do not usually follow the French
         15  translation.  Now that I did have the French
         16  translation, we have a problem, but I will still want
         17  to have French translations.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  I believe that "claim" is not
         19  "exiger" in French.  "Exiger" is stronger than
         20  "claim," but there are more greater authorities than
         21  me.  "Claim" could be "required" or even "wanted,"
         22  but "exiger" is too strong.  So perhaps you have to
         23  check that.  Thank you.
         24            MR. CAYLEY:  You're asking somebody who is
         25  not an authority, Judge Riad, but that is certainly the

          1  explanation that has been given to me, that "exiger" is
          2  a much stronger term.  I think it means "request"
          3  rather than "claim."  It's "request" rather than
          4  "affirmation."
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
          6  but we are not now to go into the review of the
          7  translation, but we do work indeed under very difficult
          8  conditions.  These cases are very difficult.  We all
          9  work under very difficult conditions and, therefore, it
         10  is absolutely requisite that we maintain good
         11  communication.
         12            However, I should like also to apologise to
         13  the interpreters, but I also wish to say that we have
         14  only a certain concentration, capacity, and after a
         15  certain time, of course, it simply declines, after a
         16  certain period of time.  So perhaps we should try to
         17  keep the -- to discuss sets of questions, entities of
         18  questions separately, not to go to one or two things.
         19            I also think that 50 minutes would be --
         20  50 minutes is decided to be a good period of time for
         21  children, during which they can hold their
         22  concentration.  For the adults it's closer to an hour,
         23  1 hour and 10.  After that, they lose the
         24  concentration.  So we say that 1 hour and 10 minutes is
         25  a good time, and perhaps 1 hour and 20.  After that we
          1  should make a break because, otherwise, I'm afraid it
          2  might damage the communication, because somebody is
          3  about to finish something and then we get into 1 hour
          4  and 10 minutes, 1 hour and 20 minutes.  I believe that
          5  both parties can, in such a case, take initiative, make
          6  a sign, for instance, this international sign, I
          7  believe everybody shows that, and say, "Let us make a
          8  break because the powers of concentration are rapidly
          9  declining."  So we should bear in mind the time and our
         10  powers of concentration.
         11            Thank you very much for this.  Now I think we
         12  are ready for the next witness.  I see that it will be
         13  Mr. Harmon who will -- tell us, you are omniscient, you
         14  are all-knowing, Mr. Harmon, so will you tell us what
         15  we're going to do now.
         16            MR. HARMON:  Yes, our next witness is
         17  Mrs. Camila Omanovic.
         18                 [The witness entered court]
         19                 WITNESS:  CAMILA OMANOVIC
         20                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         22  afternoon, Mrs. Omanovic.  Did you hear me?  Would you
         23  stand up and remaining standing just for a short while,
         24  please.
         25            Madam, you will now read the solemn

          1  declaration which you will be given by the usher.
          2            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly
          3  declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth,
          4  and nothing but the truth.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
          6  You may take your seat now.  Just make yourself
          7  comfortable.
          8            Thank you for coming here to testify,
          9  Mrs. Omanovic, to give your evidence before the
         10  International Criminal Tribunal.  You will now answer
         11  questions which the Prosecution, Mr. Harmon, will ask
         12  of you.
         13            Yes, Mr. Harmon.
         14                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
         15       Q.   Good afternoon, Mrs. Omanovic.  Can you hear
         16  me?
         17       A.   Yes, I can.
         18       Q.   Would you spell your last name for the
         19  record, please?
         20       A.   O-m-a-n-o-v-i-c.
         21       Q.   Could you spell your first name for the
         22  record?
         23       A.   C-a-m-i-l-a.
         24       Q.   What is your date of birth?
         25       A.   I was born on the 15th of April, 1953, in

          1  Srebrenica.
          2            MR. HARMON:  I'm not getting a translation,
          3  Mr. President.
          4       Q.   We'll continue, Mrs. Omanovic.  Could you
          5  tell the Judges about your educational background,
          6  please?
          7       A.   I completed my elementary and secondary
          8  education in Srebrenica.  Then I enrolled in university
          9  in Tuzla, and I completed the first stage of the
         10  faculty of economics, and I came back to Srebrenica and
         11  found a job there.
         12       Q.   Were you born in Srebrenica?
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         14  I'm sorry, but I cannot see on the transcript the date
         15  of birth of Mrs. Camila Omanovic.  Perhaps you could
         16  ask her to repeat it, please.  Thank you.
         17            MR. HARMON:
         18       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, could you repeat your date of
         19  birth, please?
         20       A.   I was born in Srebrenica on the 15th of
         21  April, 1953.
         22       Q.   Can you tell the Judges when you were
         23  married?
         24       A.   It was the 10th of February, 1977.  That is
         25  when I married Ahmet Omanovic.

          1       Q.   Do you have any children?
          2       A.   I had two children, Dzermina Omanovic, born
          3  on the 28th of October, 1977; and Dzermin Omanovic,
          4  born in 1981, on the 25th of December.  My daughter
          5  also married in Srebrenica, and she gave birth to a
          6  child in 1985, in March of 1985.
          7       Q.   In 1985 or in 1995?
          8       A.   1995.
          9       Q.   So at the time of the events that you're
         10  going to be describing to the Judges, you had a
         11  grandchild; is that correct?
         12       A.   Yes.  My grandchild was born on the 10th of
         13  March, 1995.
         14       Q.   Did you continue to work in the area of
         15  Srebrenica or Potocari after your marriage?
         16       A.   Yes.  I worked in Srebrenica and Potocari
         17  throughout my life there, both my husband and I.
         18       Q.   So it would be fair to say that you're quite
         19  familiar with the area of Potocari?
         20       A.   I know the area of Potocari quite well
         21  because from 1996 my husband worked there, and besides,
         22  that is my native country, so I do know Potocari very
         23  well.
         24       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, let me ask you one last
         25  question about your background.  Are you, by faith, a

          1  Muslim?
          2       A.   I am a Muslim by faith.
          3       Q.   And was your husband Ahmet likewise, by
          4  faith, a Muslim?
          5       A.   Yes, my husband Ahmet was also a Muslim.
          6       Q.   Now, Mrs. Omanovic, I'd like to focus your
          7  attention on the 10th of July, 1995, and I'd like to
          8  ask you to tell the Judges where you were on that
          9  date.
         10       A.   I was, on that day, in my brother's house,
         11  Zulfo Turkovic.  His house is at the exit from
         12  Srebrenica.
         13       Q.   Now, can you see the large map that's to your
         14  right?  Could you take a pointer and point to the
         15  general location where your brother's house was
         16  located?
         17       A.   It was here approximately [indicated].
         18       Q.   So the record is perfectly clear, the witness
         19  has pointed south of the town of Srebrenica, near the
         20  hairpin turn indicated below the town of Srebrenica.
         21            You may resume your seat.  Who was with
         22  you --
         23       A.   I'm sorry.
         24       Q.   It's quite all right Mrs. Omanovic.  Who was
         25  with you at your brother's house on the 10th of July?

          1       A.   The 10th of July in my brother's house were
          2  my husband and my brother.
          3       Q.   On that date, did something unusual happen?
          4  Can you describe to the Court what it was and what you
          5  did in reaction to it?
          6       A.   That day there was a lot of gunfire around my
          7  brother's house.  As I came out of -- came out of the
          8  house onto the terrace and was engaged in some everyday
          9  chores, I could see very many people loaded with
         10  luggage moving towards the town, and I didn't pay much
         11  attention to it because the day before that I had sent
         12  my daughter and my son into town to my daughter's flat,
         13  and my husband and my brother and I stayed in the
         14  house.  I had livestock which we had brought during the
         15  war merely to survive.
         16            There was a lot of gunfire around us, but it
         17  was at a distance, and we'd already become immune to it
         18  and were not paying much attention.  But at a certain
         19  point I looked through the window, across the river,
         20  the house there.  I saw a group of people who were
         21  carrying that luggage and were standing below the
         22  terrace and indicating or mimicking that fire was
         23  coming from above the house.  Then I looked to the
         24  other side and saw thousands of bullets hitting the
         25  facade of my brother's house.  My brother jumped across

          1  the terrace and made his way from one house to another
          2  to go there.  My husband and I did not jump from the
          3  terrace.  We ran down the stairs to the next-door house
          4  and thus we came with very many people who were coming
          5  from all the houses, and we all headed towards the
          6  town.
          7            The gunfire was gaining momentum, and I think
          8  it came from all the weapons, from artillery, from
          9  infantry, and shells and bullets were falling all
         10  around us.  We, however, managed to get to the town,
         11  and the gunfire then stopped.  I mean, there was some
         12  sporadic, intermittent fire, one could hear it in the
         13  town, but it was not as intensive as on the periphery.
         14            That night I spent with my daughter and
         15  grandchild, and lots of people who got there who were
         16  all rallied in the centre of the town.
         17            THE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness be asked
         18  to speak slower, please.
         19            MR. HARMON:
         20       Q.   You've been asked by the interpretation booth
         21  if you could just speak a little slower.
         22            Now, let me focus your attention on the
         23  following day, the 11th of July.  Tell the Judges what
         24  you did.
         25       A.   On the 11th I went back to Petrica -- that is

          1  where my brother's house is -- because the livestock
          2  had to be fed.  And also the laundry, the diapers of my
          3  grandchild, were still drying on the clothesline behind
          4  the house.  And my husband and I decided to go early in
          5  the morning and go back to my brother's house.  And
          6  that is what we did.  We followed the bank of the river
          7  and we reached the house and there was no gunfire.  And
          8  on our way we met various people, neighbours, who said
          9  because Srebrenica is in a valley, in a hollow, and
         10  they said that a bullet would be fired from time to
         11  time by snipers.  But we got to the house, we fed the
         12  livestock, we cut off the clothesline and all the
         13  diapers fell down, and we came out.  We just picked it
         14  up in a hurry and went back to our daughter's.
         15            And there was a lull until about afternoon
         16  and then hell broke loose, because gunfire came from
         17  all sides, from all possible weapons.  And people
         18  again, with all that luggage, they headed for
         19  Potocari.  And we somehow gathered all around the
         20  petrol pump which was near the UN base, which was by
         21  the petrol station near Bratunac.  And there were very
         22  many people there, women, children, and just whatever
         23  they happened to be wearing.  They had children on
         24  their shoulders or some small belongings.  They were
         25  milling about, screaming, because shells were falling

          1  from all over.
          2            The road was so narrow that all those people
          3  simply could not fit in, fit onto the road, and there
          4  were several trucks which tried to take people to
          5  Potocari, but --
          6       Q.   Let me interrupt you for just a minute,
          7  Mrs. Omanovic.  Were you with your husband around noon
          8  on the 11th of July?
          9       A.   Yes, I was with my husband, and the whole
         10  family was there together.  And then we parted our ways
         11  at the petrol station.  He went towards Kazani.  All
         12  the men, all the men over 13, headed for it.  Somehow a
         13  selection started, and they headed off towards the
         14  Kazani and we headed for Potocari.
         15       Q.   Now, what was the date of birth of your
         16  husband?
         17       A.   My husband was born in Mostar on the 10th of
         18  July, 1948.
         19       Q.   Now, were there -- at this gas station, were
         20  there a lot of people who went in a different direction
         21  other than Potocari?
         22       A.   Yes, very many people went in the other
         23  direction who did not go to Potocari.
         24       Q.   Now, were the people who went in the
         25  direction other than Potocari, were they mostly men and

          1  boys, or were there some women involved in that
          2  particular group as well?
          3       A.   Men, by and large, but there was an
          4  occasional women amongst them.
          5       Q.   Now, did some of these men in this group by
          6  the gas station have guns?
          7       A.   Some of them -- some of the men did have
          8  weapons.
          9       Q.   Did your husband have a gun?
         10       A.   My husband did not have a weapon.  A month
         11  before that he had been operated on and felt -- and was
         12  unwell.  But he nevertheless started for the forest,
         13  because rumours spread that if he fell into the Serb
         14  hands, that he would be maltreated, and he would not
         15  allow that, and so he went to the forest with other
         16  men.
         17       Q.   Now, was the 11th of July, 1995 the last time
         18  you saw your husband alive?
         19       A.   That was the last time I saw him; never
         20  again.
         21       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, there should be some tissues
         22  to your left.
         23            Mrs. Omanovic, in which direction did you
         24  proceed, and with whom did you proceed in that
         25  direction?

          1       A.   With my daughter, son, and grandchild, I
          2  started to Potocari.
          3       Q.   And how old was your son at the time and how
          4  old was your daughter and grandchild?
          5       A.   My grandchild was 4 months old, my daughter
          6  was 17, and my son 13.
          7       Q.   Can you describe to the Judges the
          8  environment as people fled toward Potocari; how many
          9  people there were, what the conditions were like, the
         10  state of mind of the people who were fleeing from
         11  Srebrenica to Potocari was like?
         12       A.   It was a huge crowd; several thousand women,
         13  children, and old people and babies, and they all had
         14  one thing in mind:  to escape, to flee to the UN base
         15  in Potocari.  Because we believed that if we did reach
         16  that, that we would be saved.  Everybody was in a
         17  hurry.  Everybody was carrying their belongings,
         18  babies.  Women were crying, screaming.  It was such a
         19  huge throng of panicking people with only one thing in
         20  mind:  Let's get to Potocari as quickly as possible.
         21  If we get there, we'll be all right.
         22            And under such conditions, gunfire came from
         23  all sides.  Thousands and thousands of bullets, and a
         24  swarm of bees all around buzzing all the time, and
         25  every now and then shells were fired at this crowd.

          1  And in all this confusion somebody lost his belongings,
          2  somebody a piece of bread.  An old woman who could not
          3  manage in this crowd fell.  And APC, if it came across
          4  a body put aside, they would simply be collected, put
          5  on the APC.  And they were simply telling us, "Hurry,
          6  hurry."
          7            I was somewhere in the rear of this column
          8  and I had all my luggage and the baby's luggage in the
          9  pram.  My daughter took the baby and started for
         10  Potocari.  But there were so many remains of clothes
         11  and personal affairs on the road that you couldn't
         12  really push the pram really to reach Potocari, but
         13  somehow we covered those five kilometres, and that was
         14  really -- that was really sheer horror.
         15       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, did all the people who fled
         16  from Srebrenica to Potocari go on foot or were some
         17  people taken in UN vehicles?
         18       A.   Some of the people were taken in a UN
         19  vehicles; however, not everybody could be transported
         20  in that way.  The first group of people, who was the
         21  closest to the UN base, they were put on the trucks and
         22  they were crowded.  But there was a lot of panic going
         23  on, because everybody wanted to board those trucks at
         24  the same time.  They were clinging on the trucks
         25  because they believed, they hoped, that they would be

          1  safe if they reached the area in time.  So everybody
          2  rushed towards those trucks.  There were lots of people
          3  coming from all sides.  They were trying to get hold of
          4  the truck, and the trucks had to leave before everybody
          5  was on board, and there were lots of people actually
          6  clinging from those trucks as they were leaving.
          7            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, we would now like
          8  to show a film.  It's about seven minutes long.  It's
          9  Prosecutor's Exhibit 50.  And if we could have the
         10  lights dimmed and Prosecutor's Exhibit 50 shown.  And
         11  this film, Mr. President and Your Honours, is in the UN
         12  compound in Potocari.
         13                 [Videotape played]
         14            MR. HARMON:
         15       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, do these images that we've
         16  been looking at for the last few minutes accurately
         17  depict the condition of the refugees as you recall
         18  them?
         19       A.   Yes, they do.  This is exactly how it
         20  happened.  Only this is just a small excerpt.  You have
         21  to imagine thousands and thousands of more people
         22  coming in; you have to imagine all those voices.  The
         23  whole thing has to be magnified.  This is only one
         24  truck that we saw.  Now, you have to imagine several
         25  thousands of people and the noise being much louder,

          1  and you also have to bear in mind that we kept hearing
          2  fire and the shells that were falling all around us.
          3       Q.   What were the weather conditions like on the
          4  11th of July in Potocari?
          5       A.   It was a very warm day.  It was very hot.
          6       Q.   And when you arrived in Potocari, where did
          7  you go specifically?
          8       A.   Together with my family, I went to the
          9  compound of the Zinc Factory.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Now, could I, with the
         11  assistance of the usher, have Prosecutor's Exhibit 5/2
         12  placed on the ELMO.
         13       Q.   Mrs. Omanovic, I've shown you this exhibit
         14  before.  I'm going to ask you to point out on
         15  Prosecutor's 5/2 the location of the Zinc Factory and
         16  orient the Judges to other locations that will be
         17  relevant to your testimony.
         18       A.   On the first day, that is, when I first
         19  arrived to the compound of the Zinc Factory, coming
         20  from the direction of Srebrenica, I was here, in this
         21  area, in the corner of this area [indicates], together
         22  with my children.
         23            And on the following day, on the second day,
         24  I moved to the Express plant, which was part of the
         25  transport company, of the bussing company, and I was

          1  here in the vicinity of the petrol station.  It was a
          2  petrol station that was used by buses.  That's where
          3  the spent the second night.
          4       Q.   While we're on this particular exhibit, did
          5  you used to work in a building known as the Feros
          6  Building?
          7       A.   Yes, I did.  For the past three years prior
          8  to the war, I worked there as a chief accountant.  This
          9  is the factory in question, the Feros Factory.  It's
         10  here.
         11       Q.   We're going to be referring later in your
         12  testimony to a White House that was near the Feros
         13  Building.  Can you locate that particular building that
         14  we're going to be referring to in your testimony, the
         15  White House?
         16       A.   The White House is situated across the
         17  street, across from the Feros Factory.  I was able to
         18  see the White House from my office in the factory.  My
         19  window was facing the White House, the window of my
         20  office.
         21       Q.   Now, let me show you that.  Would you
         22  re-examine that image again and see if your pointer is
         23  on the right building, because do you see the road that
         24  is going from the top of the image to the bottom of the
         25  image?  You mentioned that the White House was across

          1  the street from the Feros Building.
          2       A.   Yes.  This is our warehouse, and it was
          3  across the street from that [indicated].  This is the
          4  road to Bratunac and the White House is the one here
          5  [indicated].
          6       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much, Mrs.
          7  Omanovic.  Just for clarification, you said you worked
          8  in this area for three years.  Is that correct?
          9       A.   I said three years.  I worked in Feros for
         10  three years.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, it is 2.29.  This
         12  might be a good place to break before we go into the
         13  more substantive areas of Mrs. Omanovic's testimony.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, you're
         15  right, Mr. Harmon.  I think it's much better that we
         16  adjourn now for today at this point.  So we will finish
         17  with our work for today.
         18            Mrs. Omanovic, we will continue with your
         19  testimony, and we will see you again at 9.30.
         20                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned
         21                 at 2.30 p.m., to be reconvened on
         22                 Thursday, the 23rd day of March, 2000
         23                 at 9.30 a.m.
