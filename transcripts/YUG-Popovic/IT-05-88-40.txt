          2                 [Open session]
          3                 [The witness entered court]
          4                 --- Upon commencing at 9.34 a.m.
          5                 [The accused entered court]
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          7  morning, ladies and gentlemen; good morning to the
          8  technical booth, to the interpreters; good morning to
          9  the legal assistants, court reporters.  I think that
         10  Mr. Cayley, Mr. McCloskey, and all the Prosecution are
         11  there, so is the Defence.  Good morning, General
         12  Krstic.  We are continuing our hearing from yesterday,
         13  and we shall take up where we left off.
         14            Good morning, Mr. Ruez.  As you know, you
         15  shall now be answering questions put to you by the
         16  Defence.  And I see Mr. Petrusic on his feet.
         17            Mr. Petrusic, you have the floor.
         18            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
         19  Your Honours; good morning to my learned colleagues of
         20  the Prosecution and good morning to you, Mr. Ruez.
         21                 WITNESS:  Jean-Rene Ruez [Resumed]
         22                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         23       Q.   Mr. Ruez, in the course of your testimony
         24  yesterday, you spoke about the units, that is to say,
         25  the commanders of the Drina Corps.  You mentioned the

          1  special police force as well.  My question for you is
          2  the following:  The special police force, with its
          3  headquarters in Janja, whose deputy commander was
          4  Ljubisa Borovcanin, did that unit, the unit of the
          5  Ministry of the Internal Affairs of Republika Srpska,
          6  was it that unit, did it belong to that Ministry?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Ruez.
          9       A.   I would like to --
         10       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Ruez.  That's fine.  The 65th
         11  Protection Regiment, which you also mentioned as being
         12  in Nova Kasaba, was that a unit of the Main Staff of
         13  the army of Republika Srpska as well?
         14       A.   That is correct.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Ruez, I
         16  apologise but could you please switch your other
         17  microphone on as well.  Thank you.  That's fine now.
         18  Thank you very much.  It's on, I see.  The microphone
         19  is on and functioning.
         20            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         21       Q.   The videotape that we saw yesterday and the
         22  contents of that video was an interview of General
         23  Krstic.  Was that videotape, according to your
         24  knowledge, made on the 12th of July?
         25       A.   Yes, I believe it was made on the 12th of
          1  July, for the reason that this is the only day where
          2  Serb press personnel was present in Potocari, and this
          3  is also the day when General Mladic gave a press
          4  interview.  So I do believe that this interview was
          5  given on July 12th.
          6            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          7  I have no further questions.  Thank you, Mr. Ruez.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          9  very much, Mr. Petrusic.
         10            Mr. Harmon, do you have any additional
         11  questions for the witness?
         12            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, I do not.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Judge
         14  Wald.
         15                 Questioned by the Court:
         16            JUDGE WALD:  I have just one question,
         17  Mr. Ruez, which you may be able to answer.  If you
         18  can't, perhaps it's in the domain of the later
         19  witnesses.  But I gather from your testimony and the
         20  exhibits that were attached thereto that virtually, if
         21  not entirely, all of these movements from the primary
         22  grave sites to the secondary grave sites took place
         23  within a period of several weeks in September and very
         24  early October.  Is that approximately right?
         25       A.   Yes, it is.  Obviously holes were pre-dug,

          1  and later on, probably in one night or two night's
          2  operation, these holes were then filled with the
          3  bodies.
          4            JUDGE WALD:  Are you in a position to tell us
          5  in an enterprise of that magnitude the numbers, which
          6  we'll go into later, that were moved from one site to
          7  another, how much -- for instance, take any one of the
          8  grave sites where it was moved from a primary site to a
          9  secondary site.  How long, approximately -- would that
         10  be; a couple of day's work or just a couple of hours'
         11  work?  How much time and effort, trucks, et cetera,
         12  would it have taken to make one of those moves?
         13       A.   I, indeed, believe this might be covered
         14  later on by another witness, but it took certainly at
         15  least two nights, two full nights to conduct such an
         16  operation.  This is probably a minimum.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  Would it have taken, in your
         18  view, if you feel competent to answer, take any one of
         19  the grave sites, would it have taken just one truck or
         20  several trucks to make that kind of a move?
         21       A.   For each site --
         22            JUDGE WALD:  Yes.
         23       A.   -- most certainly several trucks were
         24  involved.
         25            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  The last part of this

          1  question:  Give me a notion of the distances between
          2  the primary and the secondary sites.  Take any one
          3  where a primary site was disturbed and the bodies and
          4  parts of the bodies moved to a secondary site.  Was
          5  that just a matter in terms of miles or metres?  How
          6  long was the distance between them?
          7       A.   I would have to anticipate on information
          8  which will be provided to you by my colleague, Dean
          9  Manning, who will explain to you the connections
         10  between primary sites and the secondary sites.  So to
         11  give you these distances, I would need first to expose
         12  to you what are the links between these sites.  What I
         13  can tell you now is that the longest distance which was
         14  covered was from Branjevo Farm to Cancari, and this
         15  would be -- it's a rough estimate, I'm making it
         16  currently by looking at the map, and I would say 40
         17  kilometres.
         18            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.  That's all I
         19  have.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         21  Judge Wald.
         22            Mr. Ruez, you mentioned on several occasions
         23  during your testimony the words "remote places," that
         24  was the term you used, and often you mentioned the
         25  configuration of the terrain.  I think that I already

          1  have the answer I need, but, nevertheless, I'd like to
          2  hear it from you.  What is the importance and
          3  significance of this factor, this element, that is to
          4  say, the configuration of the terrain, remote places,
          5  and so forth?
          6       A.   Yes.  I said remote places.  I could also
          7  have said isolated places, and even desolated places,
          8  completely destroyed places.  The reason why, I
          9  believe, this is very important is that this is part of
         10  an operation aimed to conceal the crime, and this
         11  massive effort of hiding these bodies was certainly
         12  much more successful if the bodies were taken in areas
         13  where probably no one would have at least resettled for
         14  years.  At the moment it was done, there was probably
         15  an expectation that no one would resettle in these
         16  places before a couple of years, and this is, indeed,
         17  what happened.  The first refugees are coming back in
         18  this place, in fact, since last year, and mainly this
         19  year.  So there was very little risk for the
         20  perpetrators to have someone coming across one of these
         21  sites, even by accident.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Can you
         23  tell us what the reasons were?  Were there any factors
         24  or reasons which led to this operation?
         25       A.   Yes, for sure there are some factors.  I

          1  cannot say that these factors are part of the
          2  investigation.  We have no ability to enter the mind of
          3  those who live it, but one has to remember the context
          4  at that time.   The shuttle diplomacy was going on
          5  conducted by Mr. Richard Holbrooke who was going to
          6  Belgrade to meet Mr. Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic was in
          7  easy contact with General Mladic at that time, and I
          8  may have a wrong recollection of the date, but when I
          9  read the book of Mr. Holbrooke, I noticed that, I
         10  think, that around 10th of September 1995, he requested
         11  Mr. Milosevic, President Milosevic, to have access to
         12  the area, to give access to the area, to John Shattuck
         13  who was, at that time, under secretary of state for
         14  human rights, and John Shattuck was supposed to have
         15  the freedom of access to the area to crime scenes and
         16  mass graves.
         17            So this could be a reason why this has sped
         18  up the process of disturbing these sites, but it is
         19  also clear that at one point, the perpetrators took
         20  more time because they realised that these kinds visits
         21  would not happen so soon and, indeed, the first visit
         22  was made in January of 1996.
         23            But this is an assumption.  There is no
         24  certainty at all behind it, but there might be other
         25  reasons that we are absolutely unaware of.

          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You used
          2  the term "acceleration".  Can you tell us how much
          3  time, how long did this operation take all in all?
          4       A.   If I look at the little survey I just made of
          5  these dates, one can see that between the 7th of
          6  September and the 2nd of October, open pits are
          7  created.  So it is already at some point between these
          8  dates, for sure the 27 September pits were already
          9  open.  It is only later that these pits were filled and
         10  the latest pit to be closed is between the 20 October
         11  and the 23 October.
         12            So we can consider that all this period of
         13  time was used to prepare and conduct this operation.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] And another
         15  question for you, Mr. Ruez.  In this period of time, is
         16  it possible to have the basic ideas of the procedure
         17  conducted, that is to say, you said that the trenches
         18  were dug, and then the bodies were transported and
         19  placed in those trenches.  So can you give us an idea
         20  of the procedure actually involved and what the steps
         21  that were taken were, in general terms.
         22       A.   I'm not familiar with these types of military
         23  activities and there will be a General coming and
         24  exposing his views about what and logistics and command
         25  efforts such an operation would take; so I'm not sure I

          1  am the relevant person to explain the methodology the
          2  army would use in such a circumstance if they were the
          3  one doing it.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] No, I do
          5  apologise, Mr. Ruez, it's my fault.  I was speaking
          6  about procedure of displacing bodies from one location
          7  to another, the procedure of that.  The organisation of
          8  how the bodies were transported; that side of the
          9  operation was what I had in mind.
         10       A.   On this point, we have elements that we are
         11  not in a position to disclose at this point, but we
         12  have quite precise information about movements of
         13  personnel in the days before the executions took
         14  place.
         15            So I'm a bit embarrassed to already enter
         16  that field, and I turn to the Prosecutor for that.
         17            MR. HARMON:  We intend to present,
         18  Mr. President, more detailed information that will
         19  answer your question at a later time.
         20            If that's acceptable to the Court, I would
         21  ask Mr. Ruez defer his answer until we present that
         22  evidence.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         24  So we're going to wait for an answer in -- during the
         25  proceedings.

          1            Mr. Ruez, as we have no further questions, we
          2  should like to express our gratitude for having come
          3  here.  Thank you very much.
          4            THE WITNESS:  Thank you Your Honours.
          5                 [The witness withdrew]
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
          7  what are you going to propose next?
          8            MR. HARMON:  We have an additional witness,
          9  Mr. Dean Manning, who is an investigator with the
         10  Office of the Prosecutor.  And Mr. Manning's testimony
         11  will be connected, in part, to the testimony of
         12  Mr. Ruez who has described the movement, but now
         13  Mr. Manning's testimony will be more focussed and more
         14  precise.
         15            He will testify today in a summary form,
         16  about the findings of experts who conducted
         17  examinations of various grave sites from 1996, 1998 and
         18  1999 and he will introduce for Your Honours proofs
         19  linking the primary sites to the secondary sites.
         20            If I could call Mr. Manning as my next
         21  witness, we can commence.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, please
         23  do.
         24            MR. HARMON:  And in this testimony,
         25  Mr. President, it would be -- we have a large number of
          1  exhibits and if they could be distributed now to the
          2  parties and to Your Honours, then we will be in a
          3  position to proceed quite expeditiously.
          4                 [The witness entered court]
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I see.
          6  Yes, very well, Mr. Harmon, I'm in full agreement.  We
          7  should, indeed, always do everything to facilitate
          8  matters and to speed up the process.
          9            Mr. Manning good morning to you.  Can you
         10  hear me.
         11            THE WITNESS:  Yes.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You are now
         13  going to read the solemn declaration that you have
         14  before you.  Please go ahead.
         15            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will
         16  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
         17  truth.
         18                 WITNESS:  DEAN MANNING
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         20  very much.  You may be seated.
         21            I think that you know the procedure.  You're
         22  going to answer questions put to you by Mr. Harmon to
         23  begin with.
         24            Mr. Harmon, the floor is yours.  Please go
         25  ahead.

          1                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
          2       Q.   Good morning, Mr. Manning.
          3       A.   Good morning, Mr. Harmon.
          4       Q.   Could you spell your last name for the
          5  record, please.
          6       A.   My last name is Manning, M-a-n-n-i-n-g.
          7       Q.   How old are you?
          8       A.   I'm 37 years of age.
          9       Q.   Could you inform the Trial Chamber of your
         10  professional background, please.
         11       A.   I've been a member of the Australian Federal
         12  Police, based in Canberra, Australia, since 1993, and
         13  the majority of that time was spent in the general
         14  criminal investigations branch as a detective.  I
         15  joined the OTP in August of 1998 and since that time
         16  I've been working with Team 6 in the Srebrenica
         17  investigation, specifically or mainly involved in
         18  exhumation and the coordination of all evidence from
         19  that exhumation project.
         20       Q.   Let me put aside exhumations aside for just a
         21  moment.  Did you and did the investigative team
         22  investigate and examine evidence found at killing
         23  sites, killing sites that did not also include mass
         24  grave sites?
         25       A.   Yes, we did.

          1       Q.   Can you identify those principal killing
          2  sites.
          3       A.   Two major sites of execution which were not
          4  mass graves were the Pilica Dom in the town of Pilica
          5  and the Kravica warehouse.  There was also a third site
          6  examined by myself and other team members near the
          7  sites of the Nova Kasaba mass graves.  That site was
          8  known as the Svilile meadow.
          9       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, can you tell the Trial
         10  Chamber when exhumations were conducted in respect of
         11  the investigation of Srebrenica.  What years?
         12       A.   Exhumations commenced in 1996; four sites
         13  were exhumed during that year.  In 1997 there were no
         14  Srebrenica-related exhumations.  In 1998 there were a
         15  further eight sites exhumed.  In 1999, five sites were
         16  exhumed.
         17       Q.   Have you been present during some or all of
         18  these exhumations?
         19       A.   I've been present at four complete
         20  exhumations, I've also visited the sites of the other
         21  exhumations after they have concluded, and I've also
         22  been present at the mortuary when the remains were
         23  examined and the artifacts also examined.
         24       Q.   Now, in conducting exhumations, did the
         25  Office of the Prosecutor hire or retain experts in

          1  various fields?
          2       A.   Yes, they did.
          3       Q.   Could you just generally inform the Trial
          4  Chamber of the types of experts that are retained to
          5  conduct an investigation in an exhumation site.
          6       A.   Generally there is a chief archaeologist and
          7  sometimes a chief anthropologist to perform the same
          8  duties.  The rest of the team is made up of qualified
          9  archaeologists, anthropologists, pathologists.  Also a
         10  number of those people have qualifications in other
         11  aspects of archaeology such as surveying, photography.
         12  There are also police officers, either serving or
         13  retired, who, if you like, coordinate the handling of
         14  exhibits, the tagging of such, and the initial
         15  examination of them.
         16       Q.   Do the police officers essentially ensure
         17  that there is a proper chain of custody on evidence
         18  recovered from the grave sites?
         19       A.   Yes, they ensure the evidence is
         20  photographed, logged, tagged, sealed, and the
         21  continuity of that item retained until it goes to the
         22  mortuary, and then ultimately to the Tribunal.
         23       Q.   Now at the end of an exhumation, in a
         24  particular year, do the experts who participated in the
         25  exhumation process prepare reports?

          1       A.   Yes.  Specifically, the chief of the
          2  exhumation project prepares a report in relation to the
          3  exhumations under his control.  That was done by
          4  Dr. William Hagland for 1996, professor Richard Wright
          5  for 1998, Professor Wright for 1999, and also Mr. Jose
          6  Baraybar for the remainder of 1999.
          7       Q.   I'm going to interrupt this examination just
          8  to remind you, and to remind myself as well, that
          9  because we speak the same language we have to pause
         10  between question and answer because the interpreters
         11  are going to be working very, very hard and they are
         12  going to be working harder if they need to -- if we
         13  talk too fast.
         14       A.   My apologies.
         15       Q.   So if I ask a question, if you would pause --
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   -- and I'll pause after I ask my next
         18  question, after your answer.
         19            Now, Mr. Manning, you've described the
         20  general type of experts that are conducting the
         21  exhumations at the sites.  But in addition to those
         22  experts, did the Office of the Prosecutor engage
         23  experts to examine evidence and material that were
         24  found at those particular sites?
         25       A.   Yes, they did.  They contracted chief

          1  pathologists and also other experts in the United
          2  Kingdom and in the Netherlands and the United States to
          3  examine items.
          4       Q.   For example, were ballistics experts retained
          5  to examine ballistics -- I'm sorry, shell casings that
          6  were found at the various sites?
          7       A.   Yes.  The United States Bureau of Alcohol,
          8  Tobacco and Firearms conducted examinations of shell
          9  cases from those sites.
         10       Q.   Were experts in the field of geology and soil
         11  analysis retained by the Office of the Prosecutor to
         12  compare soil samples between the primary grave site and
         13  the secondary sites?  And if you just pause before
         14  you -- to give the interpreters time to translate the
         15  question.
         16       A.   That's correct.  Dr. Tony Brown from the
         17  University of Exeter in the United Kingdom.
         18       Q.   Did the Office of the Prosecutor retain
         19  experts to analyse, for example, blindfold material
         20  that were found in the primary sites and the secondary
         21  sites?
         22       A.   Yes.  Officers from the Netherlands Institute
         23  of Forensic Studies -- Forensic Science examined cloth
         24  blindfolds and cloth ligatures.
         25       Q.   Now, at two of the principal killing sites,

          1  the Kravica warehouse, and the Pilica Dom, blood and
          2  tissue samples were gathered and collected and turned
          3  over to the Office of the Prosecutor.  Did the Office
          4  of the Prosecutor retain experts to analyse those
          5  samples to determine if there was human DNA present in
          6  them?
          7       A.   Yes.  Again the Netherlands Forensic
          8  Institute provided experts to study those items.
          9       Q.   Did the Office of the Prosecutor retain
         10  experts to examine the explosives residue samples that
         11  were collected from the Pilica Dom and from the Kravica
         12  warehouse?
         13       A.   Yes.  Again, the Netherlands Forensic
         14  Institute provided experts to examine the explosives
         15  for residues.
         16       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, are the expert reports that
         17  had been prepared in 1996, 1998, and 1999 voluminous
         18  reports?
         19       A.   Yes, they are.  There's approximately 17
         20  reports, some with multiple volumes, thousands of
         21  pages.
         22       Q.   For purposes of this trial, Mr. Manning, did
         23  I ask you to prepare a summary report relating to the
         24  significant findings and conclusions of the experts
         25  from the analyses of grave sites and crime scenes in

          1  1996, 1998, and 1999?
          2       A.   Yes, you did.
          3       Q.   Did I also ask you to incorporate into your
          4  report the findings of the various experts who analysed
          5  the physical evidence that was retrieved from those
          6  various sites?
          7       A.   That's correct.
          8       Q.   Did you prepare a summary report that I had
          9  requested?
         10       A.   Yes, I did.
         11       Q.   Now, can you identify for the Trial Chamber
         12  the names of the experts and the reports which are
         13  summarised in your summary report, please.
         14       A.   Yes, I can.  There was a report from the
         15  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau in the United
         16  States.  There was a report on anthropological aspects
         17  of the 1998 bodies from Mr. Baraybar.  Also a report by
         18  him in relation to the anthropological examination of
         19  human remains in 1999.  Also a report by him on the
         20  exhumation of mass graves in eastern Bosnia, August to
         21  October 1999.  A report by Dr. Anthony Brown in
         22  relation to soil relating to 1998 exhumations.  A
         23  report by the same doctor in relation to soil analysis
         24  from 1999 exhumations.  A report by Dr. John Clark on
         25  the pathology for the 1999 exhumations.  A report on

          1  blood and tissue by the Dutch lab, the National
          2  Forensic Institute by Dr. A.D. Klosterman.  The same
          3  lab, the examination of blindfolds and their
          4  relationships from one site to another, by Ms. Suzie
          5  Maljaars.  And that same laboratory, the forensic
          6  examination of explosive residues from various sites.
          7            There's also five volumes of a report on the
          8  forensic investigation of the Cerska grave site by
          9  Dr. William Hagland.  Five volumes of a report by
         10  Dr. Hagland in relation to the Lazete 2 grave site,
         11  which is also known as Orahovac.  A report by
         12  Dr. Hagland in relation to four graves in the area of
         13  Nova Kasaba.  A report by Dr. Hagland, four volumes, in
         14  relation to --
         15            THE INTERPRETER:  If the witness could speak
         16  up, please.
         17            MR. HARMON:  Also if one of the microphones
         18  could be turned on.  It appears that one of the
         19  microphones is not on.
         20       A.   As I said, a report from Dr. Hagland in
         21  relation to the Branjevo Military Farm or Pilica mass
         22  grave site, four volumes.  Eight reports from Dr. Chris
         23  Lawrence relating to autopsies of the 1998 graves.
         24  Four volumes of the United States Naval Investigations
         25  examination of the Pilica Dom and Kravica warehouse.  A

          1  report by Professor Richard Wright in relation to the
          2  1998 exhumations, eight sites.  And a report by
          3  Professor Richard Wright in relation to the 1999
          4  exhumations at Kozluk.
          5       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, I don't intend to ask you
          6  detailed questions about the contents of each of those
          7  reports because we're going to be hearing from
          8  Dr. Hagland and we're going to be hearing from
          9  Dr. Lawrence and we're going to be hearing from many of
         10  those experts.  The purpose of your testimony is to
         11  essentially inform the Judges of the general findings
         12  of these -- many of these experts and the connections
         13  between the primary grave sites and the secondary grave
         14  sites.
         15            For purposes of your testimony, I know you're
         16  going to be using the terms "primary grave site" and
         17  "secondary grave site".  Can you define those terms as
         18  you intend to use them.
         19       A.   Put simply, the primary graves that I refer
         20  to are graves in which the persons or victims were
         21  placed immediately after or at the time of their
         22  execution and buried within those graves.
         23            A secondary grave is one in which the bodies
         24  are placed after they've been removed from the primary
         25  grave or, as I refer to it, "robbed" from the primary

          1  graves and placed into secondary graves.
          2       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, what's the total number of
          3  grave sites associated with Srebrenica that have been
          4  completely exhumed and where the mortal remains of
          5  humans have been found?
          6       A.   There have been 17 complete exhumations since
          7  1996.  In all those cases, multiple remains have been
          8  found.
          9       Q.   Before we take your report, let me ask you to
         10  identify the report that you prepared, and it is
         11  Prosecutor's Exhibit 140.  Can you identify the title
         12  of your report, please?
         13       A.   Yes that report is entitled, "United Nations
         14  International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
         15  Yugoslavia Srebrenica Investigation Summary of Forensic
         16  Evidence-Execution Points and Mass Graves".  It's
         17  marked as OTP 140.
         18       Q.   Now, will you take Exhibit 140 and place on
         19  the ELMO page number 4/21.  We need to see the whole
         20  page in the -- can you lower that a little, please.  A
         21  little bit lower, please, Mr. Usher.  That's fine,
         22  thank you.
         23            Mr. Manning, would you, using the pointer,
         24  explain what this is to the Court and to the people in
         25  the gallery.

          1       A.   This is a representation of the number of
          2  graves that we have exhumed and haven't exhumed to
          3  date.  In this column, we have the exhumed graves, and
          4  in this column we have the graves that we have not yet
          5  exhumed.
          6            In 1996, we exhumed the Cerska grave, the
          7  Nova Kasaba grave which I refer to as "96" as we
          8  exhumed a grave in a similar area in 1999.
          9            There is a grave at Orahovac which is known
         10  as Lazete 2, a grave at Branjevo Military Farm which is
         11  also known as Pilica.  Those exhumations were conducted
         12  by Dr. Hagland.
         13            In 1998, the site known as the dam near
         14  Petkovci was exhumed as was Cancari Road 12, Cancari
         15  Road 3, Hodzici Road 3, Hodzici Road 4, Hodzici Road 5,
         16  a site known as Lipje 2 and a site known as Zeleni
         17  Jadar 5.
         18            Those graves were exhumed by Professor Wright
         19  with the exception of the dam site.  The remainders are
         20  secondary graves with the dam sites being a robbed
         21  primary grave.
         22            During 1999, Professor Wright conducted the
         23  exhumations of the grave at Kozluk, and Mr. Baraybar
         24  then in 1999 as the Nova Kasaba which I've indicated as
         25  the 1999 Nova Kasaba grave, a few kilometres from the

          1  1996 site, also a site at Konjevic Polje 1 and Konjevic
          2  Polje 2, and a site known as Glogova 2.
          3       Q.   Mr. Manning, while we're on this particular
          4  chart, some of the names appear to be shaded and some
          5  are unshaded.  What does that mean?
          6       A.   The names of the graves that are shaded
          7  indicate primary graves.
          8            In this case, Cerska is a primary grave that
          9  was not tampered with or robbed; Nova Kasaba was 96,
         10  was not tampered or robbed; Orahovac Lazete was;
         11  Branjevo Military Farm was; the dam at Petkovci was
         12  disturbed.  The grave at Kozluk was disturbed.  The
         13  grave at Nova Kasaba was not.  Konjevic Polje 1 was
         14  not.  Konjevic Polje 2 was not and Glogova was not.
         15       Q.   So the shading in on page 4/21 are primary
         16  graves?
         17       A.   Primary graves, yes.
         18       Q.   The unshaded are secondary graves?
         19       A.   The unshaded graves are secondary.
         20       Q.   Now, in the column on the right, "examined
         21  but not exhumed", what do you mean by "examined"?
         22       A.   The graves in the white column indicate
         23  graves in which we have either by mechanically digging
         24  or trenching, established that there are human remains,
         25  multiple human remains within those graves.  We have

          1  not yet been able to exhume them.
          2            Again the grey shading on Lazete 1 or
          3  Orahovac and on Glogova 1 indicate that they are
          4  primary graves.  The remainder of the graves are
          5  secondary graves.
          6       Q.   Now, let me turn your attention, Mr. Manning,
          7  to another exhibit that's on the easel.  It's
          8  Prosecutor's Exhibit 135.
          9            Your Honours should have an A-3 size of
         10  Prosecutor's Exhibit 135.
         11            Let me turn your attention to this large
         12  exhibit and can you explain, first of all, using this
         13  exhibit, the location of the primary grave sites using
         14  the -- there's a pointer.  Perhaps you can approach.
         15  There is a microphone.  Will you just identify the
         16  primary mass grave sites?  First indicating the ones
         17  that were disturbed?
         18       A.   Firstly, the Branjevo Military Farm at the
         19  top of the picture.
         20       Q.   Why don't you take the microphone from the
         21  usher, please.  Thank you.
         22       A.   This grave is a primary grave which was
         23  disturbed in that bodies were taken from that grave.
         24            This is the grave at Kozluk next to the Drina
         25  River.  Again, a primary grave that was disturbed.

          1            This is the Petkovci dam or the dam near
          2  Petkovci site.  Again, that was disturbed.
          3            This is the two sites at Orahovac, also known
          4  as Lazete.  Lazete 2 was disturbed.  We have not yet
          5  exhumed Lazete 1.
          6            In the south, we have the site known as
          7  Glogova.  Primary graves, Glogova 2 has been exhumed
          8  and was a disturbed grave, Glogova one has not been
          9  exhumed.
         10       Q.   Now, using the pointer, show the Court on
         11  this exhibit the undisturbed primary grave sites.
         12       A.   The undisturbed primary grave sites are
         13  clustered in this area of the map.  They include
         14  Cerska, a primary grave, Nova Kasaba, Nova Kasaba 1999,
         15  a grave known as Konjevic Polje 1, and Konjevic Polje
         16  2.  All primary and all undisturbed.
         17       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Manning.  Have a seat.
         18            Now, Mr. Manning, if you would kindly take
         19  Prosecutor's Exhibit 140, your report, and turn to the
         20  page which has the numbers 00950925, and place that on
         21  the ELMO, please.
         22            Can you briefly explain what this particular
         23  chart is that you prepared?
         24       A.   This chart shows the primary graves in
         25  relation to the Srebrenica investigation.  Graves here

          1  in red, are the undisturbed primary graves, the ones
          2  that I indicated on the map in one particular area.
          3            Graves here in blue indicate primary graves
          4  which have been disturbed or robbed of some of the
          5  victims.
          6       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, I'm not going to ask you to
          7  approach the board again because we had extensive
          8  testimony from Mr. Ruez identifying the secondary mass
          9  grave sites, but on Prosecutor 135, do the green dots
         10  on that exhibit represent the locations of the second
         11  mass grave sites?
         12       A.   Yes, they do.  They represent the collection
         13  of secondary graves that we're aware of.
         14       Q.   Now, if you turn to the next page in
         15  Prosecutor's Exhibit 140 which is found at 00950926,
         16  would you place that on the ELMO, please, and this is a
         17  summary chart and it has certain information.  Can you
         18  explain to the Judges what this chart contains?
         19       A.   In a similar fashion to the previous chart,
         20  it shows the secondary mass graves.  All the graves
         21  listed are ones in which we are aware that multiple
         22  human remains have been found.
         23            The graves that are indicated by the dark
         24  green filled-in areas, are the graves that we've
         25  exhumed during the past few years.  These other graves

          1  are graves that we have not yet exhumed but, again,
          2  they contain multiple human remains.
          3       Q.   They've been probed?
          4       A.   Been probed.
          5       Q.   Now, let me correct this chart.  In the top
          6  of the middle column below it, it says "Hodzici Road 2"
          7  and "Hodzici Road 2".  Can we correct the top box?
          8       A.   It should read "Hodzici Road 1".
          9       Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Manning.
         10            Now, we had extensive general discussion
         11  about the robbing of these graves, and since you
         12  participated in the exhumations and had frequent
         13  contacts with the experts.
         14            When an exhumation at a particular site was
         15  being conducted, could it be determined from examining
         16  the soil and examining the texture of the soil and the
         17  composition of the soil whether or not particular grave
         18  site had been tampered with?  And you can answer that
         19  yes or no because I'm going to show you some exhibits
         20  and I'll ask you to explain it in a minute.
         21       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Now, if I could have
         23  Prosecutor's Exhibit -- it's a large exhibit, 135 --
         24  I'm sorry, it is 1J1 placed on the easel.
         25       Q.   Mr. Manning, you're familiar with this

          1  exhibit and while it's being placed on the easel, does
          2  Prosecutor's Exhibit 1J1 show any evidence of a
          3  disturbance at a primary mass grave site?
          4       A.   Yes, it does.
          5       Q.   Please feel free to approach the exhibit on
          6  the easel and, using the pointer, will you explain to
          7  the Judges the significance of this particular
          8  photograph.
          9       A.   This is a photograph of the Kozluk mass grave
         10  site that was exhumed in 1999.  This represents bodies
         11  on the surface of the soil which I'm told was the
         12  original surface, the original level.
         13            As you can see, this group of bodies here
         14  appears to have been cut through, it's at the bottom
         15  middle of the page, by this trench that runs through
         16  this section of the photograph.
         17            As that section of the trench cuts through
         18  the original surface, it must have been made after this
         19  surface had the bodies on it.  Therefore, this trench
         20  here cut through the grave and removed at least parts
         21  of these bodies here and some of the soil.
         22       Q.   All right.  The soil then from this
         23  particular site and the bodies that were -- and the
         24  parts of the bodies that were taken from that site were
         25  transported to a secondary site and I take it,

          1  Mr. Manning, that the soil that was take taken from
          2  this trench was then the basis of a later comparison by
          3  experts to determine whether the soil found in the
          4  secondary grave had come, for example, from this
          5  grave.
          6       A.   That's correct, yes.
          7       Q.   Now you can have a seat, Mr. Manning, please,
          8  and I'm going to ask the usher to assist you in placing
          9  an exhibit on the ELMO.  It's Prosecutor's Exhibit
         10  132/107.  Do you have a copy of that exhibit with you?
         11       A.   Yes, that's a copy of that exhibit.
         12            MR. HARMON:  Now, this is Prosecutor's
         13  Exhibit 132/107, and let me ask, has that been
         14  distributed to the parties?  It should be in Your
         15  Honours' -- Your Honours should have some binders and
         16  it should be in the binder marked "132."  There will be
         17  a tab in your binder that's before Your Honours that
         18  says "107."
         19       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, where is this site?
         20       A.   The site depicted on this exhibit is the same
         21  as the large exhibit on the easel.  It's the Kozluk
         22  primary mass grave.
         23       Q.   Could you speak up, please.
         24       A.   It's the Kozluk primary mass grave, as in the
         25  larger exhibit.

          1       Q.   Now, what does this particular exhibit
          2  illustrate that is not illustrated in the previous
          3  exhibit?
          4       A.   It's, in effect, the same photograph.  As you
          5  can see, this line through the middle of the page is
          6  the cutout shown on the large picture.  It shows the
          7  more extensive trenching or cutting of the base of that
          8  area and it shows the extension through this area, to
          9  the right of the picture, where soil and bodies have
         10  been removed from that grave.
         11       Q.   Does this give any clue as to what kind of a
         12  device was used to remove the bodies?  And if so, can
         13  you explain.
         14       A.   Yes.  I've been informed by the chief
         15  archaeologists that this would represent a mechanical
         16  digger or trenching machine such as a -- similar to a
         17  bulldozer with a bucket that could scoop into the soil
         18  and make these sort of marks.  It also leaves wheel
         19  marks on the base of the soil.
         20       Q.   Mr. Manning, can you inform the Trial Chamber
         21  the effect of this removal process on the bodies in the
         22  primary grave and the evidence that is associated with
         23  those bodies.
         24       A.   It's difficult not to overstate the effect
         25  that removing of the bodies has had on the

          1  investigation.  As you can see in this exhibit, the
          2  bodies appear to be cut through.  You can see that a
          3  large amount of soil and bodies have been removed.
          4  They were removed by a bucketed machine, in effect,
          5  scooped up, placed in the back of a truck or dumped in
          6  the back of a truck, which would mean the body parts
          7  would be further broken up, and driven some distance
          8  over rough roads before being placed in a secondary
          9  grave in a similar manner, or dumped.  That will cause
         10  the body and body parts to break apart, to mix up, to
         11  fall in different areas, effectively spreading the
         12  bodies across both sites and across the sites.
         13            It has meant that identification of the
         14  individuals has become extremely difficult, it has
         15  meant that items which would lead to identification
         16  have been damaged and destroyed, and instead of
         17  exhuming the primary graves within a year or two we are
         18  at the stage where we've only be able to exhume a part
         19  of the graves.
         20       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much,
         21  Mr. Manning.
         22            Now I'd like to focus your attention on the
         23  general findings of these experts, and if you would
         24  refer to page 3/21 of Prosecutor's Exhibit 140, your
         25  report.

          1            I'd like to start out with just some
          2  statistics, your providing some statistics, please, and
          3  the reason I ask you to just provide the statistics is
          4  we're going to be hearing from the experts themselves
          5  shortly.  But can you first of all tell the Court the
          6  minimum number of individuals who were located at all
          7  of the exhumed sites.  How many are we talking about?
          8       A.   The MNI, or minimal number of individuals, is
          9  1,883.
         10       Q.   Can you define the term "minimal number of
         11  individuals"?
         12       A.   It's a complicated term that will obviously
         13  be explained at greater length by the experts.  But as
         14  the bodies have been broken up in the robbing process,
         15  it's not simply a matter of counting the bodies, which
         16  would be the case with an undisturbed grave such as
         17  Cerska.  With the disturbed primary grave and secondary
         18  grave, the bodies are so intermingled that a simple
         19  count won't work.  They're damaged.
         20            Anthropologists calculate the minimum number
         21  of individuals by selecting normally a large bone and a
         22  left or right bone and only counting that bone, in
         23  effect, a thigh bone, all left thigh bones.  From that
         24  they calculate the minimum number of people that would
         25  be represented by those bones.  If those bones aren't

          1  present or are damaged, then they can't be counted.  It
          2  then gets more complicated.  Basically it's a count of
          3  a selected large bone.
          4       Q.   Now, the use of the minimum number of
          5  individuals and the formula that you've described, is
          6  that a conservative approach to numbering the victims?
          7       A.   Very conservative.  If that particular bone
          8  is not present or damaged, then it's not counted.  You
          9  could have an entire body minus a leg or part of a leg
         10  and it would be difficult to count that body.  So it is
         11  a very conservative number.
         12       Q.   Does that lead to the likelihood that in the
         13  22 fully exhumed grave sites there are more than 1,883
         14  individuals in those sites?
         15       A.   In the 17 exhumed --
         16       Q.   Seventeen, I'm sorry.
         17       A.   Yes.  There would be, I believe, more than
         18  that, and in fact there are large numbers of body parts
         19  in some graves which certainly outnumber the number of
         20  whole bodies.  I would expect that number to be
         21  greater.
         22       Q.   Now, does the figure 1,883, the minimum
         23  number of individuals, include the number of
         24  individuals found in the probed sites?
         25       A.   No, it does not.  They have not been counted

          1  in that 1,883.
          2       Q.   Mr. Manning, please turn your attention to
          3  the gender of the victims found in the various exhumed
          4  sites.  Can you provide the Trial Chamber with the
          5  statistics in that regard, please.
          6       A.   In relation to the assessment of sex of the
          7  victims, 1,656 individuals were determined to be male;
          8  212 individuals were undetermined, that is, no sex was
          9  determined for them; 1 individual was determined to be
         10  a female.
         11       Q.   Let me turn your attention now to the
         12  statistics in respect of the cause of death.  Would you
         13  please summarise the findings.
         14       A.   As to cause of death, 1,424 individuals died
         15  as a result of gunshot wounds; 169 individuals died of
         16  probable or possible gunshot wounds; 5 individuals died
         17  of shrapnel injuries; 4 died of other causes, such as
         18  trauma or possible suffocation; and 1,374 individuals
         19  died of undetermined causes.
         20       Q.   Now if I could have placed on the easel
         21  Prosecutor's Exhibit 1/H/I, we're going to turn our
         22  attention to the blindfolds because they play an
         23  important part in this case and in linking the various
         24  sites.
         25            Let me ask you first, Mr. Manning, did the

          1  people conducting the exhumations discover the presence
          2  of blindfolds in various mass grave sites?
          3       A.   Yes, they did.
          4       Q.   Now, this is an image.  Can you first of all
          5  identify this image and what it shows.
          6       A.   This image is a victim from the Kozluk mass
          7  grave.  This is during the exhumation process.  This
          8  photo depicts the individual with a cloth blindfold
          9  over his eyes.  It also shows his arms bent backwards
         10  behind him in the area of the belt, and some of the
         11  vegetation and other artefacts in the grave, including
         12  near his head, the boot of another victim.
         13       Q.   Go ahead, please.
         14       A.   My apologies.  That individual was also bound
         15  at the wrists.
         16       Q.   Let me show you an exhibit which is
         17  Prosecutor's Exhibit 149.  It's an A4-size photograph.
         18  If that could be placed on the easel, please.
         19            Can you identify this particular photograph,
         20  Mr. Manning.
         21       A.   Again this photo is from the Kozluk mass
         22  grave.  It was during the 1999 exhumation.  This
         23  photograph shows one of the archaeologists in the
         24  process of exhuming this body.
         25            As you can see on the right-hand middle side

          1  of the image, there's the head and part of the body of
          2  the victim, with the mouth.  Across the eyes is a cloth
          3  blindfold, tied at the back of the head.
          4       Q.   I take it, Mr. Manning, in the course of the
          5  exhumation work photographs are made of the various
          6  bodies and then the items that are found on these
          7  bodies, such as the blindfolds and other items, are
          8  identified, preserved, and retained by the Office of
          9  the Prosecutor.  Is that correct?
         10       A.   That's correct.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Now, could I have Prosecutor's
         12  Exhibit 27/9, which is a physical exhibit, shown to the
         13  witness; 27/9 is the exhibit.
         14       Q.   Mr. Manning, do you have in front of you an
         15  example of one of the blindfolds that was retrieved
         16  from the Kozluk site?  Could you remove it, please, and
         17  show the Court.
         18       A.   I have it in front of me.  Excuse me.  I'll
         19  just place some gloves on.
         20            This artefact is marked "KK-3" for Kozluk,
         21  grave 3, "834B," for body 834, and also marked as
         22  "A1."  It's a cloth with a knot at the back of it, and
         23  a metal tag identifying it.  It also has what I believe
         24  to be hair and human tissue adhering to it.  As you can
         25  see, it was spread out and has since shrunk a little

          1  bit in the washing process.  But it's the blindfold
          2  that you see on that image on the large easel.
          3       Q.   So it's the blindfold on the man who is
          4  depicted in the large image on the easel; is that
          5  correct?
          6       A.   That's the blindfold removed from that body.
          7       Q.   It's this kind of material that then was
          8  submitted for expert analysis for comparison purposes
          9  with other blindfolds that are found at secondary
         10  sites; is that right?  This kind of material, blindfold
         11  material.
         12       A.   This sort of material and cloth of this type
         13  that was also used as a ligature.
         14       Q.   Now, if I could have Prosecutor's Exhibit --
         15  actually let me ask you another question first,
         16  Mr. Manning.  How many different exhumation sites were
         17  blindfolds and cloth material discovered?
         18       A.   From eight separate sites.
         19       Q.   Now, can you identify those sites orally,
         20  please.
         21            MR. HARMON:  For purposes of assisting Your
         22  Honours, at page 21/21 in Mr. Manning's report, there
         23  is a table that will provide the Chamber with
         24  statistics about blindfolds, their locations where they
         25  were found.

          1       Q.   Mr. Manning, can you just identify orally the
          2  locations of those sites, please.
          3       A.   Yes, the sites were the Branjevo Military
          4  Farm, which is a primary grave.  The related secondary
          5  grave of Cancari Road 12, the primary grave at Orahovac
          6  known as Lazete 2, the three connected secondary graves
          7  at Hodzici Road 3, Hodzici Road 4 and Hodzici Road 5.
          8  Also at the Kozluk site, as you've seen, and the
          9  Cancari Road 3 site which is the associated secondary
         10  for that grave.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Could I have Prosecutor's
         12  Exhibit 130/96 placed on the ELMO, please.
         13            THE REGISTRAR [Interpretation] Your Honours,
         14  it can be found in the binders.
         15       A.   Sorry Mr. Harmon, can you tell me that
         16  exhibit number again?
         17            MR. HARMON:  It's 130/96.
         18       Q.   This is a blindfold that was taken from
         19  Orahovac and it appears to be coloured material; is
         20  that correct?
         21       A.   That's correct.
         22       Q.   This also provided indications to the people
         23  who were doing the expert analysis when they would find
         24  something of this colour, they would compare it to a
         25  similar coloured material from a different site in

          1  attempting to reach their conclusions; is that correct?
          2       A.   That's correct.
          3            MR. HARMON:  Remove that, please, from the
          4  ELMO.  Now, could I have placed on the easel
          5  Prosecutor's Exhibit 142, please.
          6       Q.   Mr. Manning, how many blindfolds were
          7  discovered at the various sites that were exhumed?
          8       A.   In total, at least 270 blindfolds were found
          9  at those eight sites.
         10       Q.   Is that a conservative figure?
         11       A.   Yes, it is.  Some blindfolds had deteriorated
         12  to the point that we couldn't use them.  Some had been
         13  dislodged.  This is a conservative figure.
         14       Q.   Could you explain now -- there's a board on
         15  the easel with many, many small photographs.
         16            Can you explain to the Judges what that
         17  represents.  The Judges have also been provided with an
         18  A-3 sized copy of this exhibit.
         19       A.   This represents a photo of each of the
         20  blindfolds located.  It -- there were one or two photos
         21  that showed two blindfolds but effectively, this is the
         22  270 blindfolds located within those graves.  They are
         23  in order of grave.
         24            The first section is the grave designation.
         25  Some of those blindfolds are in situ on the head,

          1  others are photographed at the morgue after cleaning.
          2            MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, Prosecutor's
          3  Exhibit 128, 129 and 130 are the binders with
          4  individual photographs that are depicted on this
          5  collective, this collage.
          6       Q.   Could you tell the Judges how you made this
          7  selection of these images, please, what methodology you
          8  used, why you were conservative in your approach and
          9  how you were conservative in your approach?
         10       A.   Your Honour, I examined all the records,
         11  photographs, expert reports in relation to the
         12  discovery of blindfolds.  But as you can see from some
         13  of the photographs, they are difficult to see.  They
         14  are difficult to see due to the condition of the
         15  bodies.
         16            They would have been logged at the exhumation
         17  side; however, some of those blindfolds would move or
         18  slip or be dislodged on transportation to the morgue,
         19  and the morgue will also find blindfolds loose on the
         20  body and part of the associated artefacts.
         21            Therefore the count of blindfolds from the
         22  exhumation site and from the morgue would be
         23  different.  I examined those counts.  I physically
         24  examined the blindfolds, and I selected only those
         25  blindfolds that were either mentioned by the

          1  archaeologist, mentioned by the pathologist,
          2  anthropologist, photographed in situ or were clearly a
          3  blindfold due to their construction material, and
          4  normally the presence of human hair in the knot or
          5  pieces of what appeared to be scalp and skull on those
          6  pieces of cloth.
          7            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, I don't know what
          8  time you would like to take a break but if you -- I can
          9  very easily continue this examination, but if I know,
         10  then I can orient myself.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I think
         12  that this is indeed a good time because we've been
         13  working for an hour and 15 minutes.  Let us now have a
         14  20-minute break and we can continue after that.
         15            MR. HARMON:  Maybe before we take the break,
         16  I can introduce the exhibits that were tendered by
         17  Mr. Ruez.
         18            We had not formally tendered those exhibits
         19  and I can identify those for Your Honours.  It would be
         20  28/7, 28/9, 28/11, 28/18, 28/8, and then 160 through
         21  169, and 184 through 187.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         23  Mr. Petrusic, have you any objections to make?
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] The Defence
         25  does not have any objections to the exhibits presented

          1  by the Prosecution; however, the Defence does have a
          2  proposal, that is, to officially tender D20, Exhibit
          3  D20 during the testimony of Witness T.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, very
          5  well.
          6            Mr. Harmon, any objections with respect to
          7  D20 and its tendering?
          8            MR. HARMON:  Let me have one moment.
          9            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I think that
         10  it ought to be under seal, an exhibit under seal.
         11            MR. HARMON:  I have no objection.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, but we
         13  have had that observation by Mr. Petrusic, and as it is
         14  a protected witness, the declaration must be under
         15  seal, admitted under seal.
         16            The exhibits, Prosecution, as they were
         17  numbered, 7, 9, 11, 18, 8, 169, 184 through 187, and
         18  Exhibits D20 have been tendered and admitted.
         19            Very well.  Let us now have a 20-minute break
         20  after which we shall continue the hearing.
         21                 --- Recess taken at 10.48 a.m.
         22                 --- On resuming at 11.17 a.m.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         24  you may continue.
         25            MR. HARMON:

          1       Q.   Mr. Manning, before we start your testimony,
          2  let me ask you to keep your voice up.
          3            We're going to change the topic now.  We're
          4  going to turn to the topic of ligatures.  Let me ask
          5  you, during the course of the exhumation process, was
          6  it determined that some of the victims, or many of the
          7  victims had had their hands or their arms tied with
          8  ligatures of various types of material?
          9       A.   That's correct.
         10       Q.   Now, during the recess I placed Prosecutor's
         11  Exhibit 141 on the easel; it's a collage.  The Judges
         12  should have an A3-size copy of Prosecutor's Exhibit 141
         13  in front of them for their own reference.
         14            Let me ask you, Mr. Manning, can you explain
         15  what's depicted in this particular exhibit.
         16       A.   Again, this exhibit is similar to the
         17  blindfold collage.  It shows the ligatures that were
         18  located at the various graves.  The grave name is
         19  indicated in the first white section and continues to
         20  show all the ligatures that I could identify from those
         21  graves.  A total of 407 ligatures of different types.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, Prosecutor's
         23  Exhibits 128, 129, 130, and 131 have the individual
         24  images that are contained in the collage, so for your
         25  later reference the sum individual parts of this

          1  exhibit are found in those binders.
          2       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, once again let me ask you,
          3  the figure of 407 ligatures that are depicted in the
          4  exhibits, is this a conservative number?
          5       A.   Yes, it's conservative.
          6       Q.   For the same reasons that you gave in respect
          7  of the blindfold material?
          8       A.   Exactly the same reason, and indeed some of
          9  the ligatures were cloth which deteriorated; some were
         10  wire which broke apart.  Exactly the same methodology
         11  was applied to the ligatures.
         12       Q.   Now, referring to page 20/21 of your summary
         13  report, can you identify the sites, the exhumation
         14  sites, where these ligatures were found, and can you
         15  make a distinction in making these identifications
         16  between a primary site and a secondary site.
         17       A.   Yes.  Ligatures were found at Cerska grave.
         18  This is a primary grave.  Almost all those ligatures
         19  were of wire.  The Nova Kasaba primary grave of 1996,
         20  ligatures were also found.  Both those graves were not
         21  disturbed.  At the Orahovac (Lazete 2) grave, a
         22  ligature was found; that is a primary grave, and at the
         23  related secondary grave of Hodzici Road 5, a ligature
         24  was also found.  At the primary disturbed grave of
         25  Branjevo Military Farm, ligatures were found, and at

          1  the related secondary grave at Cancari Road 12.
          2  Similarly, ligatures were found at the primary site of
          3  the dam near Petkovci and its related site of Liplje
          4  2.  They were also found at the primary grave of Kozluk
          5  and its associated secondary grave of Cancari Road 3.
          6  Ligatures were also found at the secondary site of
          7  Zeleni Jadar 5.
          8       Q.   Now, did your analysis of these ligatures
          9  reveal that there were different types of ligature
         10  material used on the victims?
         11       A.   Yes.  Different materials were used.  Some
         12  were used opportunistically, such as a cloth sack.  But
         13  predominantly there were ligatures of wire, mainly two
         14  types of wire; there were ligatures of cloth; there
         15  were ligatures of string.
         16       Q.   Let me start by putting on the easel
         17  Prosecutor's Exhibit 134.  We're going to use a series
         18  of exhibits to illustrate the different kinds of
         19  ligature material that were found in the various
         20  exhumation sites.
         21            MR. HARMON:  Would you stand that up,
         22  Mr. Usher?  That's the correct perspective.
         23       Q.   Now, on the easel is Prosecutor's Exhibit
         24  134, Mr. Manning.  Can you approach that, please, using
         25  the microphone, and identify the significant parts of

          1  that exhibit, please.
          2            First of all, where is this image, taken from
          3  which grave site?
          4       A.   This image is from the Kozluk primary grave,
          5  mass grave site.  It shows an individual who is laying
          6  on his face and front, with the head and skull up here,
          7  two arms here, the belt and rest of the body down here
          8  to the end of the photo.
          9            Clearly around the arm and wrists of this
         10  individual is a ligature made of twine or string, white
         11  synthetic twine.  It is tied in a knot here and goes
         12  round both wrists of this individual.  This individual
         13  also has a blindfold.
         14       Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Manning.  Please sit
         15  down.
         16            Mr. Manning, I'd like to now put on the ELMO
         17  Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/86, which is a cloth ligature
         18  example, please.
         19            Could you please explain this particular
         20  exhibit, where it's located -- where the photograph is
         21  taken, from which site, and what kind of material is
         22  used in this particular illustration.
         23       A.   This particular image is from the Branjevo
         24  Military Farm, or Pilica.  It represents human remains
         25  that have been found during the exhumation process.

          1  There are a set of hands and arms.  The rest of the
          2  body has not yet been exposed.  You can see that the
          3  arms are crossed over in the area of the wrist, and
          4  here is a cloth ligature, again knotted and wrapping
          5  round both wrists.  Some of these cloth ligatures
          6  formed a figure 8; some of them formed a circle, but
          7  all of them bound and knotted.
          8       Q.   Let's turn to the next exhibit, Mr. Manning,
          9  which is Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/87.  Would you place
         10  that on the ELMO, please, and explain to the Court what
         11  that represents.  Could you turn it to the side,
         12  please.
         13       A.   This is a photograph of a ligature binding of
         14  the hands and wrists of an individual from the Nova
         15  Kasaba 1996 mass grave.  You can see the victim's coat
         16  sleeve.  This is one of his hands and this is another
         17  of his hands.  Binding and digging into the flesh is a
         18  wire ligature, again knotted or tied around the
         19  wrists.
         20       Q.   Now, can you show the Court, using
         21  Prosecutor's Exhibit 16/6, what a wire ligature that
         22  was retrieved from one of these sites looks like.  You
         23  should have it in front of you.  Mr. Manning, if you
         24  would remove that from the bag, please.
         25       A.   This is a wire ligature, and marked on the

          1  bag is "CSK," which is the code for Cerska, "108,"
          2  which is the body that it came from, and the number 2,
          3  which indicates artefact 2.
          4            This is now in two parts.  It is a wire
          5  ligature.  At one stage it was passing around the
          6  wrists of the individual through one loop, and through
          7  the other loop was the other wrist.  It is bound here
          8  and twisted and tied.  As you can see, it is quite
          9  small.  It was very tightly bound around the wrists.
         10       Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Manning.
         11            Now, Mr. Manning, we'll turn to another
         12  important category of evidence which is the presence of
         13  artefacts, as I call it, at the various grave sites,
         14  and during the exhumations.
         15            Did the Office of the Prosecutor recover
         16  different types of artefacts that were significant and
         17  that led to the identification, first of all, of the
         18  victims having come from Srebrenica and, second of all,
         19  to the actual identifications of some of those victims?
         20       A.   That's correct.  In each of the graves that
         21  we exhumed, documentation or other items were found
         22  which provided a positive link to Srebrenica.  They
         23  included licna carte or licence cards, identification,
         24  other.  In some instances, they have provided
         25  identification of the victims.

          1       Q.   Can you describe, just in -- using a general
          2  example, how the discovery of an artefact in a mass
          3  grave site leads to the identification of someone from
          4  Srebrenica?
          5       A.   In the general sense, the licence card may
          6  have the address or the opstina of Srebrenica on it.
          7  It may be some other artefact as documentation from
          8  factories, offices, receipts naming Srebrenica or
          9  addresses in Srebrenica.
         10       Q.   Now, have artefacts linked to Srebrenica been
         11  located in all of the primary mass grave sites?
         12       A.   Yes, every one.
         13       Q.   Also located in the exhumed secondary -- all
         14  of the exhumed secondary sites?
         15       A.   There's been something to link the
         16  individuals to Srebrenica in all the cases.
         17       Q.   What I'd like to do now, Mr. Manning is run
         18  through a series of exhibits to illustrate the types of
         19  artefacts that are discovered in these graves and we'll
         20  start with first of all Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/95.
         21  There is a related exhibit to that and that is
         22  132/95A.  But if you would put 132/95 on the ELMO
         23  first.
         24            Can you tell, first of all, where that
         25  particular artefact was retrieved?

          1       A.   This artefact was removed from body number 60
          2  or human remains number 60 at the Cerska grave.  "CSK"
          3  is the code for Cerska, 1996, primary grave.
          4       Q.   What is it?
          5       A.   I'll just move it down a bit.  It's a
          6  pendant, a gold coloured pendant or necklace with an
          7  "S" as part of the pattern.  You can also see on the
          8  top of the photo a knot in the chain of that pendant.
          9            This was removed from the victim, Cerska 60.
         10       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, this ultimately led to an
         11  identification which we'll get to in a minute.  Can you
         12  please tell the Court how this led to an identification
         13  and the story related to this particular object?
         14       A.   As part of the attempt to interview, to
         15  identify the victims from Srebrenica, families would
         16  report the missing to known government organisations
         17  such as PHR and the International Red Cross.  In that
         18  process, they would provide as much information as they
         19  could on the description of the individual; age,
         20  height, injuries.  Also personal effects such as
         21  clothing, such as wallets, such as medallions such as
         22  this.
         23            This particular thing was identified by a
         24  family prior to it being investigated by the OTP.  They
         25  drew a picture of a pendant with an S on it and a knot

          1  in the chain.  On the basis of that, on the basis of
          2  the description of the individual, and the post mortem
          3  data, they established that the individual Cerska 60
          4  was the individual that had been identified as wearing
          5  this chain and this pendant.
          6       Q.   What were the circumstances under which the
          7  victim came to wear this particular pendant?  Would you
          8  tell the Judges what information the Office of the
          9  Prosecutor found out?
         10       A.   The pendant was given to the individual, who
         11  was a young boy, by his mother.
         12       Q.   Where was that?
         13       A.   In Srebrenica.  It was given to him.  She
         14  detailed that to PHR.
         15       Q.   Would you describe, please, the story?
         16       A.   She indicated that she gave him the chain as
         17  a gift.  He placed it around his neck.  Because of his
         18  small size, it was too long.  She saw him knot it to
         19  make it a little bit easier to wear.
         20            She was able to identify the pendant itself,
         21  particularly the "S" and, more importantly, identify
         22  the knot that she saw her son put in that chain.
         23       Q.   Now, how old was the boy?
         24       A.   He was born in 1979 according to the
         25  identification material, so that made him 15, 16 years

          1  of age.
          2       Q.   Would you place Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/95A
          3  on the ELMO.  There's a name that's highlighted on
          4  that.  First of all, what is this list?
          5       A.   This is a page from the list prepared by ICRC
          6  or International Red Cross and PHR.  It indicates the
          7  name of the missing from Srebrenica.  It's a large
          8  volume.
          9            This indicates the missing identified
         10  victim's name as Samir Spiodic, a male, his date of
         11  birth which is the 22nd of February 1979.  It also
         12  indicates the place of birth, Srebrenica, his father's
         13  name, Kamel, date and place of disappearance, and it
         14  also indicates the municipality.
         15       Q.   Let's turn to another example, Mr. Manning.
         16  Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/93.  Can you place that on the
         17  ELMO, please.
         18            Explain what this is and what its
         19  significance is.
         20       A.   This item was recovered from the mass grave
         21  at Branjevo Military Farm.  It's marked as Pilica, the
         22  code for that grave, 16, and item 10.  It's the 10th
         23  item removed from body 16 from that grave.  And as can
         24  be seen, it's an artificial leg.  It was removed from
         25  that victim.

          1            Repairing or binding that leg is an amount of
          2  tape.  On that tape are the words "Feros Uniz
          3  Srebrenica and Yugoslavia."   On the basis of the data
          4  provided by the family, that false leg led to the
          5  identification of PLC-16.
          6       Q.   Would you place Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/93A
          7  on the ELMO.  Identify this object first of all and
          8  then tell us about it.
          9       A.   Again, it's a page detailing persons missing
         10  from Srebrenica.  This is a PHR, ICRC missing list.  It
         11  provides the name of the victim, Nezir Efendic, a male,
         12  the year he was born, his father's name, and where he
         13  went missing from.
         14       Q.   Let's turn again to an example of an artefact
         15  that was significant and  was discovered in one of the
         16  mass grave sites.
         17            Could you please put Prosecutor's Exhibit
         18  132/91 on the ELMO.  Tell us about this particular
         19  exhibit, Mr. Manning.
         20       A.   If I can just move it up.  This is a licence
         21  card or licna carte which was recovered from the
         22  secondary mass grave of Hodzici Road 3 which is
         23  indicated here.  It's from body 3, and it's the seventh
         24  artefact from that body.
         25            There is a photograph still partly visible of

          1  a male person and the details of that individual, date
          2  of birth, father's name, his name, where he's from,
          3  Srebrenica, is included on that licence card.
          4       Q.   Now, what's the date of birth that's
          5  indicated on that licna carte licence card?
          6       A.   17th of June, 1919.
          7       Q.   Would you turn to the next exhibit which is
          8  related, which is Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/91A.  Please
          9  tell us about this exhibit.
         10       A.   Again, it's a page of details of missing from
         11  Srebrenica.  It includes the details of the identified
         12  person from the Hodzici Road grave, Abdurahman Avdic,
         13  male, and a year of birth and, again, date and place of
         14  birth, Srebrenica, father's name, and date and place of
         15  disappearance.
         16       Q.   And the year of birth is different in this
         17  exhibit, it's the year 1920, and in the previous
         18  exhibit it was 1919.  Nevertheless, was there a
         19  confirmation that the individual whose licence card
         20  licna carte was found in the grave site is this?
         21       A.   This individual has been positively
         22  identified, that identification accepted by the Bosnian
         23  authorities, and a death certificate issued.
         24            I believe, and I've had experience with the
         25  details provided by the family.  They are often wrong

          1  in the sense that they don't know the precise year of
          2  birth and, as indicated here, they can't recall or
          3  don't know the day and month of birth.
          4            I've spoken to witnesses who didn't know
          5  their own date of birth, month or even year.
          6       Q.   Thank you, Mr. Manning, let's turn to another
          7  exhibit, please.  Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/98.  Turn it
          8  on its side so we can see the whole exhibit.
          9            Mr. Manning, what does this exhibit tell us?
         10       A.   This exhibit is from the Cancari Road 3, the
         11  secondary grave to Kozluk.  It's from body or may even
         12  represent body 372 from that grave.
         13            As you can see, it's part of a spinal column
         14  of an individual.  In this case, due to medical
         15  conditions best described by experts, the spine has
         16  been fused along its length.
         17            Obviously, this individual would be unable to
         18  freely move or bend and he was subject to an autopsy
         19  report that details that condition.
         20       Q.   That autopsy report that details his
         21  condition is Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/98A.  You don't
         22  have to put that on the ELMO, but does that autopsy
         23  report indicate that this was a man who was disabled as
         24  a result of this condition?
         25       A.   From the autopsy report, the whole spine

          1  showed a severe ancylosis which would have caused
          2  obvious problems in moving.
          3       Q.   Now, this is a unique medical condition for
          4  this particular victim.  Has this led to an
          5  identification of the victim?
          6       A.   Not in this case, it hasn't led to an
          7  identification.  Those efforts are still continuing.
          8       Q.   Let's turn to another type of artefact that
          9  was found in, I think, the exhumed sites if we could
         10  turn to Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/109.
         11            Again, Mr. Manning, please tell us where this
         12  was located and what this particular object is and what
         13  it represents.
         14       A.   This object was removed from the Hodzici 4
         15  secondary grave related to the Orahovac Lazete graves.
         16  It is removed from body 296, and it's artefact 2.  The
         17  other details include the photographic numbers and the
         18  date.
         19            As you can see, it is a pocket watch with
         20  what is obviously a hole or mark through it apparently
         21  caused by a bullet or similar.
         22       Q.   Now, did this artefact corroborate the
         23  medical findings on the cause of death?
         24       A.   Yes.  The cause of death of this individual
         25  indicated gunshot wounds, multiple gunshot wounds.

          1  This being in his possession is indicative of being
          2  struck by those bullets.
          3       Q.   Now this, for Your Honours' benefit, we won't
          4  put this on the ELMO as Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/109A.
          5            Let's turn now, Mr. Manning, to another type
          6  of evidence that confirms that people who are located
          7  in these exhumed sites were of the Muslim faith.  Could
          8  you please place 132/110 on the ELMO.
          9            Now, first of all, tell us if, in the course
         10  of the exhumations, Muslim religious objects were
         11  retrieved from various sites.
         12       A.   In the majority of sites, Muslim religious
         13  artefacts were located, such as small copies of the
         14  Koran, et cetera.
         15       Q.   Explain what is in Prosecutor's Exhibit
         16  132/110, please.
         17       A.   This item was removed from Hodzici 3 grave.
         18  The "A" and the number indicates it's an artefact which
         19  normally means separate from a body.  It was loose in
         20  the grave; during the disturbance it separated.  It was
         21  a plastic packing which included this script, which is
         22  a long thin sheet of paper with apparent Muslim verses
         23  on it; I've been informed that it's of a religious
         24  nature.  It's indicative of the sorts of religious
         25  texts, or Muslim texts located in the graves.

          1       Q.   This is an example of an artefact that
          2  confirms at least that some of the victims within the
          3  site exhumed are of Muslim faith.
          4       A.   That's correct.
          5       Q.   All right.  Let's turn now to the next
          6  exhibit, Mr. Manning, 132/1.  This is also under a
          7  different exhibit number introduced earlier, 1.G.  It
          8  is a photograph, Mr. Manning.
          9            If you'd be so kind as to place that on the
         10  ELMO and tell us where it was found, and generally the
         11  significance of photographs that are found along with
         12  bodies.
         13       A.   This is Exhibit 132/1.
         14            MR. HARMON:  We need to pan up so that the
         15  whole exhibit can be seen.  Just down a little bit,
         16  please, Mr. Usher.  Thank you very much.
         17       A.   This item was removed from the Lazete or
         18  Orahovac grave.  Lazete 2 is the grave designation, and
         19  body 36, and it's one of at least 12 items recovered
         20  from that body.  It's obviously a family photo, a
         21  snapshot.  This individual had a number of photographs
         22  in his possession, in his wallet.
         23            The photographs have allowed us, in some
         24  instances, to identify the victims.  These photographs
         25  can be shown to the surviving relatives.  On occasion

          1  that has proved difficult as the photographs
          2  deteriorate rather quickly.  In this instance you can
          3  still see the individuals that this man carried
          4  around.
          5       Q.   Now, earlier in your testimony you touched on
          6  the effect of the removal of bodies from the primary
          7  sites to the secondary sites.  Is one of the
          8  consequences of essentially robbing the graves and
          9  trying to hide the mortal remains of these victims that
         10  physical evidence, such as photographs that have been
         11  hidden at different locations and therefore take a
         12  longer time to find because each grave has not yet
         13  completely been exhumed, does that result in the
         14  deterioration of physical evidence?
         15       A.   Very much so.  This photograph was exhumed
         16  with the body in 1996 but you can still see it has
         17  deteriorated, or did then.  Photographs removed from
         18  the graves in 1999 are either destroyed, or I've seen
         19  them disappear as they are exposed to air.
         20       Q.   Mr. Manning, let's turn to the next exhibit,
         21  please, 132/4.  It's another photograph.
         22            MR. HARMON:  We need to lower that.
         23       Q.   What is this photograph, where was it found,
         24  and has it led to an identification?
         25       A.   This photograph was found with Lazete 2 or

          1  Orahovac, body 36.  Again it's part of item 12 so it's
          2  with that other photograph.  It's a young girl, a
          3  child, in a pink dress, normal family photographs that
          4  were with this victim.  In this case it hasn't led to
          5  an identification.
          6       Q.   Let's turn to the next exhibit, please,
          7  Mr. Manning.  Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/6.
          8       A.   Again --
          9       Q.   Please connect this exhibit to the site and
         10  tell us the significance of this exhibit, please.  Turn
         11  it the other way, please.  That's fine.
         12       A.   This exhibit, again from the same grave and
         13  the same body, item 12, and it is a photo or part of a
         14  photo of a small boy.  Also of interest is the tape
         15  that's binding that photograph and other photographs at
         16  the back of it.  Again, it's the Feros Uniz Srebrenica,
         17  Yugoslavia-type that we saw on the artificial leg from
         18  the Branjevo Military Farm grave.
         19       Q.   So these photographs and the previous two
         20  photographs have not led to identifications, but there
         21  is evidence from the tape indicating Srebrenica that
         22  these are probably from somebody from Srebrenica; is
         23  that a fair assessment?
         24       A.   Yes, that's a fair assessment, or my
         25  assessment.

          1       Q.   All right.  Now let's turn to the last in the
          2  series of these exhibits, 132/18.  Mr. Manning, again
          3  orient us to this particular exhibit.
          4       A.   Again, a family photo.  This was removed from
          5  body number 11, at Pilica, or the Branjevo Military
          6  Farm.  This individual had a photograph of, we assume,
          7  his family.  As a result of this and other information,
          8  that individual was identified.
          9       Q.   Now, would you kindly take Prosecutor's
         10  Exhibit 132/18A, and you said that photograph led to an
         11  identification.  Who was the victim in this particular
         12  case?
         13       A.   The victim who carried that photograph was
         14  Elizabet Selimovic, a male; date of birth: 30th of
         15  January, 1962; again, date and place of birth,
         16  Bratunac; father's name; and date and place of
         17  disappearance.
         18       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much, Mr. Manning,
         19  on that series of exhibits.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, I'm finished with
         21  that series of exhibits.
         22       Q.   What I'd like to turn your attention to now,
         23  Mr. Manning, is focus on some of the types of other
         24  evidence that led to connecting and linking the primary
         25  grave sites to the secondary grave sites.

          1            In your earlier testimony you said that the
          2  Office of the Prosecutor had retained various experts:
          3  ballistic experts, soil analysis experts, materials
          4  analysis experts, comparing cloth samples, blindfolds
          5  and ligatures, from one grave site to the other.  You
          6  said that there have been comparative analyses run on
          7  these objects; is that correct?
          8       A.   That's correct.
          9       Q.   What I'd like to do, first of all,
         10  Mr. Manning, is start with the ballistics experts,
         11  please.
         12            MR. HARMON:  If we could have placed on the
         13  easel Prosecutor's Exhibit 133.  That should be placed
         14  on the side.
         15       Q.   First of all, did the Office of the
         16  Prosecutor, in the course of conducting these
         17  exhumations, recover shell casings from the primary and
         18  secondary sites?
         19       A.   Yes, shell casings were recovered from all
         20  the sites.
         21       Q.   Now, were all of the shell casings from all
         22  the sites recovered or only samples?
         23       A.   Only samples.  There were shell casings at
         24  sites that were not collected.
         25       Q.   Now, focusing your attention on Prosecutor's

          1  Exhibit 133, first of all can you identify from which
          2  site this photograph is taken.
          3       A.   Again, this is from the Kozluk mass grave
          4  site, exhumed in 1999, a primary site, primary
          5  disturbed site.
          6       Q.   Would you approach the exhibit, please, using
          7  the easel, and explain to the Trial Chamber the
          8  significance of this exhibit.
          9       A.   This is an exhumation photograph.  They have
         10  presented or uncovered part of the body.  You can see
         11  that it's an individual with his legs running through
         12  here to the bottom of the photo; skull and head with a
         13  blindfold; his arms behind his back, bound.  General
         14  artefacts within the grave:  Notably on this is a shell
         15  case here near what would be the individual's left
         16  arm.  That is indicative of where we found shell cases
         17  either associated with the bodies, amongst the
         18  clothing, or in other parts of the grave.
         19       Q.   Thank you very much, Mr. Manning.  We're
         20  going to show another example.  If we could place on
         21  the ELMO, Mr. Manning, 132/106.
         22            Please identify this exhibit and point out
         23  the significant features of this exhibit.
         24       A.   Again, this is from the Kozluk grave,
         25  designated by "KK-3."  It is body or body parts 571,

          1  body 571.  This is obviously an individual's arms and
          2  you can see that they're bound.  The rest of the body
          3  has not been exposed yet.  Again you can see the
          4  artefacts that are present within the grave.  In this
          5  case, a shell case, a shell case, a shell case, and
          6  part of a shell case here still buried.  Those are the
          7  sort of shell cases that were collected.
          8       Q.   Mr. Manning, then, were shell cases from
          9  primary sites, such as this at Kozluk, also collected
         10  at secondary sites?
         11       A.   Yes, they were.
         12       Q.   Were those or some of those shell casings
         13  submitted to the United States Treasury Department's
         14  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in an attempt
         15  to make a comparison to see if the shell casings from
         16  primary sites matched shell casings located in
         17  secondary sites?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President and Your Honours,
         20  the Office of the Prosecutor filed the Bureau of
         21  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' report with the Trial
         22  Chamber, pursuant to Rule 94 bis, on the 14th of April,
         23  2000, and on the 28th of April, 2000, the Defence
         24  informed the Trial Chamber that it had accepted the
         25  statement of this expert.  So we would now have and

          1  tender to the Court Prosecutor's Exhibit 144, which is
          2  the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' ballistics
          3  report.
          4       Q.   Mr. Manning, have you had a chance to review
          5  that report?
          6       A.   Yes, I have.
          7       Q.   Can you first of all briefly describe to the
          8  Trial Chamber the types of analyses that were conducted
          9  by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
         10       A.   Simply put, the shell cases collected have
         11  various marks on them caused by the firing and ejection
         12  process from the weapon.  Specifically, ejector marks
         13  on shell cases, marks that were put there when the
         14  shell was ejected from the weapon after firing, were
         15  examined by the ATF, using -- including methods such as
         16  microscopic examination and comparison.  They would
         17  examine a shell case ejector mark on one or more shell
         18  casings and attempt to match those marks to show that
         19  that shell case had been fired by the same weapon.
         20       Q.   Now, as a result of that analysis, were shell
         21  casings that were found in primary execution sites and
         22  grave sites matched with shell casings found in
         23  secondary mass grave sites?
         24       A.   Yes, they were.
         25       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, would you kindly place page

          1  14/21 from your report on the ELMO.  Once it's centred,
          2  properly, Mr. Manning, I'd like you to explain the
          3  findings of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
          4  Firearms, the location of shells from primary sites or
          5  other locations and where they matched shell casings at
          6  other locations.
          7       A.   On the basis of the matches and the numbers
          8  provided by ATF, they produced this table which
          9  indicates that a shell case or shell cases from the
         10  Kravica warehouse execution point were matched by ATF
         11  to the secondary grave of Zeleni Jadar 5; that is, a
         12  shell case from Kravica and a shell case from Zeleni
         13  Jadar 5 were apparently fired by the same weapon.
         14            In the Cerska primary grave, in the grave
         15  itself, shell cases were matched to the surface of the
         16  grave, at the roadway near the grave, and the roadway
         17  on the north side of the road.
         18            In the primary grave of Orahovac, or Lazete
         19  as it's indicated here, shell cases from these areas,
         20  including the grave and the grave surface, were matched
         21  to shell cases found in the related secondary grave of
         22  Hodzici Road 3, 5, and 4.
         23            Again, the primary grave of Petkovci, the Dam
         24  near Petkovci, the shell cases on the surface of the
         25  dam matched those found within the hole, or the grave

          1  itself.
          2            The Kozluk primary mass grave surface, the
          3  shell cases match that found at the secondary site of
          4  Cancari Road 3.
          5       Q.   Let's turn to another link connecting primary
          6  graves to secondary graves now, Mr. Manning, and that
          7  is the results of soil and pollen sample analysis.
          8            Now, in respect of primary and secondary
          9  sites that were exhumed by the Office of the
         10  Prosecutor, did the Office of the Prosecutor collect
         11  soil samples from particular primary sites and
         12  secondary sites, and did they retain those soil samples
         13  for later analysis?
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   Why were the soil samples from the primary
         16  sites and the secondary sites collected?
         17       A.   They were collected either by Dr. Tony Brown,
         18  or at his request, in an attempt to identify the types
         19  of soil and properties of the soil that were found in
         20  one grave which were apparently picked up and
         21  transported and placed inside the secondary grave, that
         22  soil being foreign to that area; so an attempt to match
         23  the soil from the primary site to where it was dumped,
         24  if you like, in the secondary site.
         25       Q.   What primary and secondary sites were soil

          1  samples collected?
          2       A.   Soil samples were collected from the Branjevo
          3  Military Farm, from its associated secondary grave of
          4  Cancari Road 12; from the Kozluk primary grave and its
          5  associated secondary grave of Cancari Road 3; from the
          6  Orahovac Lazete site and it's associated sites of
          7  Hodzici 3, 4 and 5, and also from the primary grave of
          8  Glogova and the secondary grave of Zeleni Jadar 5.
          9       Q.   You said these soil samples were submitted to
         10  a Dr. Brown, can you identify him further and what his
         11  background qualifications are?
         12       A.   Dr. Brown is a palynologist at the University
         13  of Exeter in the UK.  He has degrees in geology and he
         14  also is an expert on the identification of soil, soil
         15  types, and the artefacts found in soil such as
         16  macrofossils but more particularly pollen which
         17  represents where the soil came into contact with
         18  vegetation, specifying the area where that soil was.
         19       Q.   Did Dr. Brown prepare an expert report and
         20  did he submit that to the Office of the Prosecutor?
         21       A.   He prepared two expert reports, and he
         22  submitted them.
         23            MR. HARMON:  Your Honours, Dr. Brown's report
         24  for the 1998 exhumations was filed by the Prosecutor
         25  with the Trial Chamber pursuant to Rule 94 bis on

          1  January 6, 2000 and his report for the 1999 exhumations
          2  was filed by the Prosecutor's office on February 7th,
          3  2000.
          4            On the 25th of February 2000, the Defence
          5  informed the Trial Chamber in writing pursuant to Rule
          6  94 bis (B) that they accepted the statements of
          7  Dr. Brown.  So we could tender Dr. Brown's two expert
          8  reports, Exhibit 179 which is Dr. Brown's analysis for
          9  the 1998 analysis, exhumations, I'm sorry, and Exhibit
         10  180 which is Dr. Brown's analysis for the 1999
         11  exhumations.
         12       Q.   Mr. Manning, briefly --
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         14  excuse me, I think that you mentioned, quite rightly,
         15  the two reports of Anthony Brown, and it is true that
         16  the Defence has accepted the first tendered on the 6th
         17  of January, but I think that the Chamber still has no
         18  response to this day regarding Anthony Brown's report
         19  filed on the 7th of February.
         20            I don't know whether that one response
         21  applies to both reports or if the Defence has given a
         22  positive response to the first and has still not
         23  provided a response to the second.  Perhaps we need to
         24  clear that up with the Defence.
         25            Mr. Petrusic, I don't know whether we are

          1  right or not, but we have not found any response in
          2  relation to the report of the 7th of February.  We do
          3  have a response on the report dated the 6th of
          4  January.  Can you help us, please?
          5            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          6  the Defence has accepted both reports by expert Brown.
          7  I will check later if there is some technical errors,
          8  but it is our intention to accept both reports.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  So we
         10  have your response dated the 3rd of March, 2000.  But
         11  if you say that you accept both, they are accepted.  No
         12  problem then.
         13            So we've cleared that up now.  Thank you very
         14  much, Mr. Harmon, you may continue.
         15            MR. HARMON:  Thank you Mr. President.
         16       Q.   Briefly, Mr. Manning, can you summarise for
         17  the Trial Chamber the types of analyses prepared or
         18  performed by Dr. Brown?
         19       A.   Dr. Brown has detailed in his report specific
         20  methods of examination, examining the soil.  They refer
         21  to methods accepted by geologists and people in that
         22  field.
         23            I, unfortunately, can't explain those tests,
         24  but some of those tests were by using a microscope in
         25  and examining the structure of the soil, the structure

          1  of fossils within it and particularly in the structure,
          2  type, of pollen grains within that soil sample.
          3       Q.   Did you conclude that there were similar
          4  types of soil found in primary and secondary graves?
          5       A.   Yes, he did.
          6       Q.   Referring to your report, Prosecutor's
          7  Exhibit 140, could you place on the ELMO the page and
          8  the chart that is found at 00950927.
          9            Using -- we need to lower it a little bit.
         10  Using this particular chart, can you inform the Trial
         11  Chamber where the soil from primary grave sites matched
         12  the soil found in secondary grave sites based on
         13  Dr. Brown's analysis?
         14       A.   Using Dr. Brown's analysis, the Branjevo
         15  Military Farm soil pollen samples matched that at
         16  Cancari Road 12.  The Kozluk primary grave matches that
         17  at Cancari Road 3.  The Glogova 2 grave matches that at
         18  Zeleni Jadar 5.  And the Orahovac or Lazete grave
         19  matches all three at Hodzici Road 3, Hodzici Road 4 and
         20  Hodzici Road 5.
         21       Q.   Now, there is a small box of soil samples
         22  found between the site, the dam and Liplje 2, that was
         23  not the subject of Dr. Brown's analysis.  That's an
         24  analysis performed by another expert; is that correct?
         25       A.   That's correct.

          1       Q.   We'll get to that testimony later in the
          2  course of this trial.  That concludes this particular
          3  link between primary and secondary grave sites.
          4            What I'd like to do now, Mr. Manning, is turn
          5  to another source of evidence that linked the primary
          6  grave sites to secondary grave sites.  Let me ask you,
          7  you've testified first of all about finding a large
          8  number of cloth ligatures and blindfolds.
          9            Were those or some samples of those cloth
         10  ligatures that were found in primary sites and in
         11  secondary sites submitted to the Netherlands Forensic
         12  Institute which is part of the Dutch Ministry of
         13  Justice?
         14       A.   That's correct.
         15       Q.   And was the purpose of that submission to
         16  have the Netherlands Forensic Institute make an
         17  analysis of the materials that were found in primary
         18  and secondary sites to determine if the materials were
         19  the same?
         20       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         21       Q.   Now, if we could turn to your report, please,
         22  Mr. Manning, at page 15/21.  Before you place that on
         23  the ELMO, let me ask you some questions before we place
         24  this on the ELMO.
         25            What types of analysis did the Netherlands

          1  Forensic Institute conduct on the cloth material
          2  samples; can you tell us that after having reviewed
          3  their report?
          4       A.   Yes, the investigation was conducted by
          5  Ms. Suzie Maljaars who examined the cloths in an
          6  attempt to group them into like cloths.  She and other
          7  scientists examined the cloth for colour, weave,
          8  pattern, shininess of the material.
          9            It was examined under a microscope to
         10  determine the number of threads within the weave, the
         11  embroidery pattern, also the elasticity of the
         12  material.
         13            As a result of that, the cloths were grouped
         14  within graves in groups of like cloths, of similar
         15  cloths and a simple or a representative sample from
         16  each of those groups was compared to the other graves
         17  to a representative sample from those other graves.
         18       Q.   Did the Netherlands Forensic Institute
         19  prepare a final report with their conclusions and did
         20  they submit that to the Office of the Prosecutor?
         21       A.   They did.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, Judge Wald, the
         23  particular report which is the Netherlands Forensic
         24  Institute report, Exhibit 143, was filed with the Trial
         25  Chamber by the Office of the Prosecutor on the 28th of

          1  February 2000.  And on the 1st of March 2000, the
          2  Defence filed a notice pursuant to Rule 94 bis (B)
          3  informing the Trial Chamber that they had accepted that
          4  expert report.
          5       Q.   Now, if you will, Mr. Manning, turning to
          6  your report Prosecutor 140, would you place page 15/21
          7  on the ELMO, and can you please tell us what their
          8  conclusions were.
          9       A.   After examining that report and the details
         10  provided by the Dutch lab, they advised that cloth
         11  ligatures or blindfolds located at the Branjevo
         12  Military Farm matched those at Cancari Road 12.  A
         13  group of blindfolds or a type of blindfold ligature
         14  also matched that at Cancari Road 3.
         15            There was no match from Zeleni Jadar 5.
         16  Cloth blindfolds collected from the Grbovci school
         17  matched those at Hodzici Road 4.  Cloth collected from
         18  Orahovac Lazete 2 matched all three secondary graves of
         19  Hodzici Road 4, 3, and 5.
         20            Also, a cloth ligature or blindfold from
         21  Hodzici Road 4 matched that at the secondary site of
         22  Liplje 2.
         23       Q.   Now, let me just ask you to put some examples
         24  of the type of the materials that were compared on the
         25  ELMO to illustrate the types of materials that were

          1  compared.
          2            And if you would start by taking Prosecutor's
          3  Exhibit 143, please, it's appendix 1, the page number
          4  on that, the ERN number is 00916676.  Could you place
          5  that --
          6       A.   Sorry Mr. Harmon, I don't have the pages of
          7  that report.
          8       Q.   It's the colourful pattern.  Do you have the
          9  report in front of you?
         10       A.   No, I don't.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Could the registrar please
         12  furnish the witness with a copy of that report, 143,
         13  please.
         14       Q.   Mr. Manning, you're familiar with the report
         15  and you're familiar with the exhibit that I'm referring
         16  to.  Would you please place that on the ELMO.
         17            Now earlier, Mr. Manning, we had seen in a
         18  picture on a skull that had been exhumed a piece of
         19  colourful material.  Now, can you explain what this
         20  particular exhibit is and its significance?
         21       A.   This exhibit is from the report by
         22  Ms. Maljaars.  It includes a strip of cloth spread out
         23  on the table and photographed.
         24            This cloth has a distinctive pattern, a
         25  colourful pattern printed on to the material.  This

          1  piece of cloth and the one below it obviously
          2  particularly similar.  She examined both of these
          3  cloths to the level that I previously described and
          4  established that they were indistinguishable from each
          5  other.
          6            Of particular notice, that this cloth at the
          7  bottom is from the Pilica grave, the Branjevo Military
          8  Farm grave.  This piece of cloth is from the Cancari
          9  Road 12 cloth.
         10       Q.   Turn to the next exhibit please, Mr.
         11  Manning.  It is found in appendix 2 at 00916678.
         12            Explain this exhibit, please, Mr. Manning.
         13       A.   Again, this is three strips of cloth spread
         14  out on a table to be viewed.  They are from three
         15  different graves.  The top one is the Pilica Branjevo
         16  Military Farm primary grave and the other two are from
         17  the Cancari Road 12 and Cancari Road 3 secondary
         18  graves.
         19            Of particular note is not only is the type of
         20  cloth colour material the same.  These cloths have an
         21  embroidered circle with a flower which is quite
         22  visible.  Each of these cloths has the same embroidered
         23  mark on them and, again, they are found to be
         24  indistinguishable from each other.
         25       Q.   These samples were found at three different

          1  locations; is that correct?
          2       A.   Three different locations, three different
          3  graves.
          4       Q.   Lastly, let's turn to appendix 3 in
          5  Prosecutor's Exhibit 143 at page 00916680.
          6            Can you please explain what this exhibit
          7  represents?
          8       A.   This is a view of another type of cloth used
          9  as a blindfold or ligature.  In this case, blindfolds.
         10  These are from two separate graves, but as you can see,
         11  the pattern is very similar.  There is a clean or
         12  straight edge at the bottom.  The cloth is of a similar
         13  width, and there's a scalloped pattern across the top
         14  of the cloth.
         15            This particular pattern is seen on a large
         16  number of blindfolds and ligatures and is seen at a
         17  number of different graves.
         18       Q.   Where did these two cloth samples come from,
         19  where were they retrieved and what did they link?
         20       A.   I'm sorry, Mr. Harmon, without referring to
         21  the report, itself, and checking those numbers, I can't
         22  tell you.  I believe the Hodzici Road graves.
         23       Q.   All right.  Well, the answer to that question
         24  is found in the report, and we'll leave the answer
         25  imbedded in that report for further examination if you

          1  don't know.
          2            Let's -- I've concluded then with that
          3  particular exhibit, and we've concluded with the
          4  analysis of this particular set of links between
          5  primary and secondary graves, Mr. Manning.
          6            What I'd like to do now is place Prosecutor's
          7  Exhibit 27/7 on the ELMO.  We're going to turn our
          8  attention, Mr. Manning, to another connection between
          9  primary grave site and secondary grave site.  We'll
         10  start by putting this particular exhibit on the ELMO.
         11            We've seen this exhibit earlier in this
         12  trial.  Mr. Manning, can you tell us what this
         13  particular exhibit is?
         14       A.   I recognise this photograph of the Vetinka
         15  bottling factory which is located near the Kozluk mass
         16  grave.
         17       Q.   Was the Vetinka bottle factory located next
         18  to a headquarters of any particular military unit in
         19  the Drina Corps?
         20       A.   Next to the bottling factory was the then
         21  barracks of the Drina Wolves.
         22       Q.   Did the Vetinka bottle factory have labels
         23  that reflected "Vetinka bottle factory"?
         24       A.   Amongst a variety of labels, yes.  It had the
         25  name Vetinka; it also had the town Kozluk on some

          1  labels.
          2       Q.   Did it also have bottles that were green
          3  glass?
          4       A.   Yes, thousands of green glass bottles.
          5       Q.   How far away was the Vetinka bottle factory
          6  and the headquarters of the Drina Wolves from the mass
          7  execution site at Kozluk?
          8       A.   About 1, 1.5 kilometres along the road that
          9  you see in front of that factory.
         10       Q.   Now, at the mass execution site at Kozluk,
         11  was the site itself, before the executions, used as a
         12  grounds where the broken glass was discarded by the
         13  factory?
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   Was it a dump site?
         16       A.   It was apparent that it was a dumping ground
         17  for broken bottles, amongst other things.
         18       Q.   If we could now turn to another exhibit,
         19  please, that is, Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/103.
         20            This doesn't show up as clearly as I'd hoped
         21  on this so you'll have to explain to the Trial Chamber
         22  what this particular exhibit illustrates.
         23       A.   This is a photograph of the exhumation site
         24  at Kozluk, in particular detailing body 818.  The
         25  significance of this photo, however, is the massive

          1  bodies here and surrounding them and under them is
          2  thousands of green glass bottles.  You can see the
          3  shape here of the base of a bottle.  You can see it
          4  here, particularly here, near the yellow arrow, yellow
          5  and black arrow.  Effectively this whole background
          6  here is broken green glass.
          7       Q.   Now we're going to put another exhibit on the
          8  ELMO.  It's Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/99.
          9            Mr. Manning, could you tell us what's
         10  depicted in this exhibit.
         11       A.   This is a photo of artefacts recovered from
         12  the Kozluk grave.  It's numbered 773A, an artefact.  It
         13  shows paper labels, bottle labels, which were recovered
         14  from that grave.  You can see part of "Vetinka," or the
         15  spelling of Vetinka.  On examination of those labels
         16  you can see "Vetinka," and "Kozluk" as well.
         17       Q.   Earlier in your testimony you've testified
         18  that the Kozluk primary mass grave site had been
         19  disturbed, and we had seen in Prosecutor's Exhibit
         20  1/J/I the trench mark or the gouge mark at that
         21  particular location.
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   Let me ask you, then, Mr. Manning, were
         24  similar pieces of green glass and labels similar to
         25  what's depicted in Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/99 found at

          1  secondary mass grave sites?
          2       A.   Yes.  The same green glass, the same labels,
          3  were found at the secondary grave of Cincari Road 3.
          4       Q.   Let me start then by using the next exhibit,
          5  which is 128/263.  Would you place that on the ELMO,
          6  please.  Would you lower that just a little bit,
          7  please.
          8            Now, what is this exhibit?  What does this
          9  exhibit depict, Mr. Manning?
         10       A.   This exhibit is an exhumation photo from the
         11  secondary grave of Cincari Road 3.  It is an
         12  individual, a skull, and what is a blindfold fallen
         13  from the face.  It was given an artefact number.
         14            The significance of this particular photo,
         15  and again it's not as clear as perhaps hoped, is in the
         16  background here are fragments, pieces, of green glass
         17  bottles.  In the Cincari Road 3 grave, there were
         18  thousands of small pieces of glass adhering to the
         19  bodies and within the grave itself.
         20       Q.   Let's turn to the next exhibit, please, which
         21  is 132/101.
         22            Mr. Manning, what is depicted in this
         23  particular exhibit?
         24       A.   This is a photograph taken at the mortuary of
         25  artefacts recovered from the Cincari Road 3 grave.

          1  It's numbered 402.  It is the glass labels -- the
          2  bottle labels, sorry, "Vetinka" and "Kiseljak Water."
          3  But again on those labels was "Vetinka" and "Kozluk."
          4       Q.   So these labels were found mixed in with the
          5  bodies that were discovered at the secondary mass grave
          6  at Cincari Road 3.
          7       A.   That's correct.
          8       Q.   Let's turn to the last exhibit in this
          9  series, Mr. Manning, Prosecutor's Exhibit 132/105.
         10            Mr. Manning, what does this particular
         11  exhibit depict?
         12       A.   This is a photograph taken during a trenching
         13  operation of the Cincari Road 1 grave by an
         14  investigator.  What it shows is a body part, in this
         15  case a part of the pelvis, within the unexhumed grave
         16  of Cincari Road 1.  As you can see clearly, again
         17  pieces of broken green glass.
         18       Q.   This is a grave that was probed, it wasn't
         19  fully exhumed; is that right?
         20       A.   That's correct.
         21       Q.   All right.  Based on your analysis of the
         22  findings of green glass and Vetinka bottle labels in
         23  the secondary sites of Cincari Road 1 and Cincari Road
         24  3, is it your conclusion that the bodies found in those
         25  two sites came from the primary mass execution site at

          1  Kozluk?
          2       A.   Certainly the bodies in Cincari Road 3 came
          3  from Kozluk, and I believe that the bodies in Cincari
          4  Road 1 will be shown to have come from Kozluk,
          5  particularly by the obvious green glass fragments.
          6  That will be more clear once it's exhumed.
          7            MR. HARMON:  Now, Mr. Usher, if we could have
          8  placed on the easel Prosecutor's Exhibit 135.  It's
          9  previously been shown.
         10       Q.   Mr. Manning, if you would prepare, while
         11  that's being done, locate in your report page number
         12  00950927 and place that on the ELMO.
         13            Mr. Manning, would you approach the large
         14  easel exhibit.  What I'd like you to do, please, is
         15  based on the analyses that we've been discussing, the
         16  shell casings, the soil analysis, the textile analysis,
         17  the presence of green glass and labels, could you
         18  summarise, please, the movement of victims' bodies from
         19  primary mass execution and grave sites to secondary
         20  sites, based on the analysis and based on the reports
         21  that you've reviewed.
         22       A.   Yes.  Based on all that material, the bodies
         23  from Branjevo Military Farm, the primary grave, were
         24  removed from that grave, some of the bodies, and were
         25  then transported to Cincari Road 12 where they were

          1  placed in that grave.
          2            The primary grave site of Kozluk was robbed;
          3  some of those bodies were taken and transported to
          4  Cincari Road 3.
          5            This site at the Dam, near Petkovci, was
          6  robbed, with the majority of the bodies being taken to
          7  Liplje 2.
          8            The site at Orahovac (Lazete 2) was robbed;
          9  bodies from that grave were transported to the graves
         10  Hodzici Road 3, 5, and 4.
         11       Q.   And Glogova.
         12       A.   Also the primary mass grave of Glogova 2,
         13  bodies from that grave were transported to and reburied
         14  at Zeleni Jadar 5.
         15       Q.   All right.  Have a seat again, Mr. Manning,
         16  please.
         17            The exhibit that's found on the ELMO, which
         18  is from your report at page 00950927, is essentially a
         19  summary chart coming to the same conclusions; is that
         20  correct?
         21       A.   Essentially, yes.
         22       Q.   All right.  Mr. Manning, we're going to turn
         23  to a different topic at this point because I'd like you
         24  to discuss some additional forensic reports that were
         25  prepared and submitted to the Office of the

          1  Prosecutor.
          2            Now, following the revelation that mass
          3  executions had occurred, did the Office of the
          4  Prosecutor send investigators to two locations?  First
          5  of all, did they send a team of investigators and
          6  forensic experts from the United States Naval
          7  Investigative Service to the Kravica warehouse, on the
          8  30th of September, 1996?
          9       A.   I did, yes.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Usher, if we could place on
         11  the ELMO Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/4, which is a panorama
         12  of the Kravica warehouse.
         13       Q.   Mr. Manning, is this the location where the
         14  experts went?  Is this the Kravica warehouse?
         15       A.   Yes, it is.  It's the Kravica warehouse, one
         16  end of the warehouse, if you like.  They examined this
         17  end of the warehouse, to the right of the picture.
         18  They didn't examine the far end of the warehouse,
         19  depicted on the left.
         20       Q.   What was the purpose of that examination?
         21       A.   We had been told by witnesses, and there was
         22  evidence there, of a mass execution.  Their job was to
         23  collect evidence to corroborate that witness, or those
         24  witnesses, to the fact that there was a major execution
         25  that took place in that building.

          1       Q.   Did they collect hair and blood samples and
          2  explosives residue samples?
          3       A.   They did, yes.
          4       Q.   Did they provide those samples to the Office
          5  of the Prosecutor?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   Now, let me place on the ELMO a photograph
          8  from a report that was prepared by the Naval
          9  Investigative Service, Prosecutor's Exhibit 181/1.  I'd
         10  like you to put on the ELMO, please, Mr. Manning,
         11  photograph 16 from roll 2.
         12            There are many photographs in this particular
         13  report, are there not?
         14       A.   There are many volumes of reports -- volumes
         15  of photos.
         16       Q.   But I have selected one particular photograph
         17  just to illustrate the location where samples were
         18  taken.  That's photograph 16, on the bottom.  What is
         19  that, please, Mr. Manning?
         20       A.   This is a photograph of the wall of the
         21  warehouse.  More particularly, it's a photograph of
         22  what is blood, human blood, on the wall, splashed
         23  across the wall of the warehouse.
         24       Q.   Just describe briefly how a blood sample was
         25  collected.

          1       A.   Using two sampling methods, water and a
          2  scraping action, the naval investigators would remove a
          3  section of the stain, scrape it off and also swab it
          4  off, place it into bags which they sealed and numbered,
          5  and the numbering up in the top corner would reflect
          6  the number of the sample.
          7       Q.   All right.  Those samples were provided to
          8  the Office of the Prosecutor for later analysis.
          9       A.   That's correct.
         10       Q.   Let's turn our attention to another mass
         11  killing site, the Pilica Dom.  If I could have
         12  Prosecutor's Exhibit 25/7 placed on the ELMO.
         13            As a point of reference to your testimony,
         14  Mr. Manning, can you tell us what is illustrated in
         15  this particular exhibit.
         16       A.   This is a photograph of the Pilica Dom in or
         17  near the town of Pilica.  At the rear of this building
         18  was the execution point examined by the Naval
         19  Investigation Service.
         20       Q.   The Office of the Prosecutor sent
         21  investigators to that location after Drazen Erdemovic
         22  informed the Prosecutor that approximately 500 Muslims
         23  had been executed at that location on the 16th of July,
         24  1995.
         25       A.   That's correct.

          1       Q.   Now, did the Office of the Prosecutor
          2  investigators and Naval Investigative Service forensic
          3  specialists go to the Pilica Dom between the 27th and
          4  29th of September, 1996, and did they return again on
          5  the 2nd of October, 1996?
          6       A.   That's correct.
          7       Q.   Was their purpose similar to the purpose that
          8  you've described as those same experts and
          9  investigators going to the Kravica warehouse?
         10       A.   That's correct.
         11       Q.   Did they, in fact, turn over the hair, blood
         12  samples and the explosives residue samples that they
         13  collected at the Pilica Dom to the Office of the
         14  Prosecutor?
         15       A.   They did.
         16       Q.   What I'd like you to do, please, Mr. Manning,
         17  is if you would take Prosecutor's Exhibit 181/4, and
         18  I'm referring to photograph 18 in roll 10 of that
         19  exhibit.  I'd like you to just illustrate what an
         20  explosives pattern looks like and explain to the Judges
         21  how a sample of an explosives residue is collected.
         22       A.   In this photo you can see there's some
         23  markings on the wall, red marks, and some numbering.
         24  That's part of the examination process.  But in the
         25  centre of the photo you see a black staining rising

          1  from the floor area.  This is soot or residue from an
          2  explosives seat which has struck the wall or gone up
          3  the wall.  The naval investigation service members
          4  again number marked that area.  They took a swab using
          5  water and also a swab using a light acid in separate
          6  samples.  They then bagged, numbered that, and provided
          7  that to the Office of the Prosecutor, from various
          8  areas within the Pilica Dom.
          9       Q.   Did the Naval Investigative Service prepare a
         10  report describing their collection methods, and did
         11  they submit that report to the Office of the
         12  Prosecutor?
         13       A.   They did.
         14       Q.   Have you reviewed their report?
         15       A.   Yes, I have.
         16            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President and Judge Wald, in
         17  respect of this report, this is Prosecutor's Exhibit
         18  181/1, which is the Naval Investigative report for the
         19  Kravica warehouse, and Prosecutor's Exhibits 181/2, /3,
         20  and /4, which is the Naval Investigative Service report
         21  for the Pilica Dom, these reports were filed by the
         22  Office of the Prosecutor, pursuant to Rule 94 bis, on
         23  the 2nd -- I'm sorry, on the 7th of February, 2000 and
         24  on the 25th of February, 2000, the Defence notified the
         25  Trial Chamber in writing, pursuant to Rule 94 bis (B)

          1  that she had accepted the reports from the Naval
          2  Investigative Service.
          3       Q.   Subsequently, Mr. Manning, did the Office of
          4  the Prosecutor submit to the Dutch Ministry of Justice,
          5  again, the Netherlands Forensic Institute, numerous
          6  blood and tissue samples that had been collected by the
          7  Naval Investigative Service for an analysis to
          8  determine if human DNA was present in those samples?
          9       A.   Yes, they did.
         10       Q.   Why did they submit those samples to the
         11  Netherlands Forensic Institute?
         12       A.   Those samples were representative of the
         13  blood and tissue on the walls of the buildings.  They
         14  submitted it in an attempt to corroborate the execution
         15  of those people in the buildings.
         16       Q.   In the Pilica Dom and --
         17       A.   And Kravica warehouse.
         18            MR. HARMON:  Again, Mr. President and Judge
         19  Wald, the Netherlands Forensic Institute report on the
         20  analysis of blood and tissue samples was filed by the
         21  Office of the Prosecutor on the 7th of February 2000.
         22  And on the 25th of February 2000, the Defence filed
         23  written notice pursuant to Rule 94 bis (B) informing
         24  the Trial Chamber that they had accepted the reports
         25  from the Netherlands Forensic Institute.

          1       Q.   Now, Mr. Manning, briefly, can you summarise
          2  the types of analysis that were performed on the blood
          3  and tissue samples by the Netherlands Forensic
          4  Institute?
          5       A.   The institute used standard testing methods
          6  involving chemical reactions which proved positive to
          7  the presence of human DNA.  They applied that to all
          8  the samples and then produced the report detailing
          9  which ones were positive.
         10       Q.   I'd like to turn to those conclusions,
         11  please, Mr. Manning.  What were the conclusions of the
         12  Netherlands Forensic Institute in respect of the blood
         13  and tissue samples from the Pilica Dom.  How many
         14  samples were submitted and what were their conclusions?
         15       A.   Of the 234 representative blood, hair or
         16  tissue samples which were collected throughout the
         17  Pilica Dom.  They were able to establish that 166 of
         18  those samples were positive for the presence of human
         19  DNA.
         20       Q.   Turning to the samples that had been
         21  collected from the Kravica warehouse, how many samples
         22  were analysed by the Netherlands Forensic Institute and
         23  what were their conclusions?
         24       A.   From the Kravica warehouse, 149 represented
         25  blood, hair or tissue samples were collected throughout

          1  the building and the Netherlands Forensic Science
          2  Laboratory Institute said that 142 of those samples
          3  were said to contain human DNA.
          4       Q.   Now the Netherlands Forensic Institute
          5  report, Mr. President and Judge Wald, is Prosecutor's
          6  Exhibit 150.  That's the report relating to the blood
          7  and human tissue analysis.
          8            The last part of my examination, Mr. Manning,
          9  deals with the analysis of the explosives residue that
         10  was collected by the Naval Investigative Service and
         11  retained -- those samples were retained by the Office
         12  of the Prosecutor.
         13            Let me ask you first of all:  Did the Office
         14  of the Prosecutor submit those explosives residue
         15  samples to the Netherlands Forensic Institute for an
         16  analysis?
         17       A.   They did.
         18       Q.   Did the Netherlands Forensic Institute
         19  conduct an analysis?
         20       A.   Yes, they did.
         21       Q.   Did they prepare a report?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, Judge Wald, the
         24  report of the Netherlands Forensic Institute relating
         25  to the analysis of explosives residue is Prosecutor's

          1  Exhibit 97.  That report was filed by the Prosecutor
          2  with the Trial Chamber on the 24th of March 2000.  I
          3  may have the wrong date on that.  I apologise.  It
          4  was -- all I can say in looking at my notes is that it
          5  was filed by the Office of the Prosecutor, I'm sorry,
          6  on the exact date, but on the 24th of February, 2000,
          7  the Defence filed a written notice pursuant to Rule 94
          8  bis (B) informing the Trial Chamber that they had
          9  accepted the conclusions of that report.
         10       Q.   Could you please, Mr. Manning, summarise,
         11  first of all, the types of analysis that the Institute
         12  conducted on the samples of residue explosives residue
         13  that had been submitted to them?
         14       A.   In relation to the explosives analysis, I'm
         15  not able to describe what these are, but it was a
         16  reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
         17  and photo-diode array detection test and confirmed
         18  using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid
         19  chromatography and double mass-spectrometry detection.
         20            MR. HARMON:  I'd like to hear the translation
         21  of that.  I think that's probably pretty tough to
         22  translate, but we appreciate the effort.
         23       Q.   Any event, Mr. Manning without going into the
         24  scientific analysis would you just tell us what their
         25  conclusions were?

          1       A.   Effectively they informed me that their
          2  conclusion were that of the 15 representative samples
          3  of explosive residue collected throughout the Pilica
          4  Dom, a single sample was found to be positive for the
          5  presence of the high explosive TNT.
          6            And in relation to the Kravica warehouse, 23
          7  of the representative samples of explosive residue were
          8  examined, two were found to have possible traces of
          9  TNT, the high explosive.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Manning, thank you very
         11  much.  I've concluded my direct examination.
         12            Your Honours, I've concluded my direct
         13  examination.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         15  very much, Mr. Harmon.
         16            Mr. Visnjic or Mr. Petrusic.
         17            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  Mr. President,
         18  the Defence has reviewed the report of the expert as
         19  Prosecution Exhibit 140.  This exhibit was disclosed to
         20  the Defence three days prior to today.
         21            Bearing in mind the report of Mr. Manning and
         22  the fact that it is really a summary report of other
         23  reports that will be reviewed here in the courtroom in
         24  the next few days, and bearing in mind the very short
         25  time that we have had, and the fact that the text was
          1  received only in the English version, the Defence, in
          2  the interest of uninterrupted, positive cooperation
          3  with the Prosecution, the Defence has taken the liberty
          4  to suggest to the Prosecution that the
          5  cross-examination of Mr. Manning, if possible, if the
          6  Prosecution agrees, and if Mr. Manning can come back,
          7  should be held in the middle of next week after the
          8  other expert witnesses have been heard, according to
          9  the plan of witnesses, because a part of the questions
         10  which might be addressed to Mr. Manning after today's
         11  examination-in-chief will be put to the other expert
         12  witnesses and thereby the cross-examination of
         13  Mr. Manning would be shorter.
         14            That is why I should like to suggest to the
         15  Chamber, to accept this motion of ours, and to allow us
         16  to postpone the cross-examination until the middle of
         17  next week.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon.
         19            MR. HARMON:  I have discussed this with my
         20  colleagues, Mr. President.  I have no objection to
         21  that.  The only request that I have is that there is
         22  presently in place a court order that I cannot contact
         23  or communicate with my witnesses.
         24            Mr. Manning and I may have a need to discuss
         25  matters other than his testimony.  I have no intention

          1  of discussing his testimony with him, but I would ask
          2  to be relieved of the order of the Court saying that I
          3  cannot contact Mr. Manning.
          4            What I would request is that on matters other
          5  than his testimony, I be permitted to talk to him about
          6  other matters relating to the investigation.  That also
          7  would apply to members of my trial team as well.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          9  Mr. Visnjic.
         10            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  We have no
         11  objections to that, we have no objections to that,
         12  Mr. President.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
         14  case, we are going to show confidence in Mr. Harmon,
         15  who may talk to Mr. Manning regarding other matters,
         16  but not regarding this case.
         17            Is that acceptable, Mr. Harmon and
         18  Mr. Visnjic?
         19            MR. HARMON:  It is.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
         21  case, we are going to trust you.  Mr. Manning has heard
         22  well what we have decided regarding this matter.  So
         23  exceptionally, we will suspend the ruling of the
         24  Chamber.  We will treat this as an exception so that
         25  Mr. Harmon may contact the witness, but not on this

          1  subject.
          2            As to the request of Mr. Visnjic, the Chamber
          3  fully understands your reasons and I think that from
          4  the point of view of the rights of the accused to a
          5  fair and expeditious trial, I think it is good to
          6  combine fairness with efficiency so that we will have
          7  the cross-examination in the middle of next week.
          8            Do you have a more or less fixed date?  Is
          9  the witness available?
         10            MR. HARMON:  Mr. Manning is available all of
         11  next week.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         13  What are we going to do next, Mr. Harmon?  Are we going
         14  to have an expert witness?
         15            MR. HARMON:  We are.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         17  Mr. Visnjic, I think you had some remarks to make or
         18  certain suggestions regarding that so please proceed.
         19            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  Mr. President,
         20  our suggestion and request to the Trial Chamber would
         21  be that during the examination-in-chief and the
         22  cross-examination of expert witnesses that the
         23  Prosecutor is going to call, that the Defence be
         24  allowed to include, on the Defence team, our own expert
         25  so that he might assist the Defence counsel with his

          1  expert knowledge of terms and the subject matter.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          3  Mr. Harmon.
          4            MR. HARMON:  We have no objection.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
          6  case, bearing in mind your request, Mr. Visnjic, and
          7  the fact that the Prosecutor has no objection but also
          8  in line with Article 90, paragraph D, the Chamber
          9  allows the presence of your expert so as to help you in
         10  preparing for the cross-examination.
         11            MR. HARMON:  The last item I have,
         12  Mr. President, is I would request that the exhibits
         13  that have been tendered in the direct examination of
         14  Mr. Manning be introduced at this time.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         16  Mr. Visnjic, have you any objection to the admission of
         17  the exhibits mentioned?
         18            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  No,
         19  Mr. President, we have no objection.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
         21  case, the Prosecution exhibits are admitted into
         22  evidence.  I think there are no other matters to deal
         23  with before the break, so we are now going to have a
         24  break, and we will be able to resume with the expert
         25  witness' testimony, and I should like to ask the

          1  registrar to have the witness brought in before we
          2  begin so as to speed things up.
          3            It is now five to 1.00.  I think that we can
          4  have a 20-minute break now.  I can feel that there are
          5  many people who would like a half an hour break.  I
          6  think we need to work for at least an hour and a
          7  quarter, so let's have a 25-minute break.  A 25-minute
          8  break.
          9                 --- Recess taken at 12.55 p.m.
         10                 --- On resuming at 1.25 p.m.
         11                 [The witness entered court]
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I see that
         13  we ended up having a half-hour break, but never mind.
         14            I see that the two parties are standing up.
         15            Mr. McCloskey.
         16            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Mr. President.  Good
         17  afternoon.  Good afternoon, Judge Wald, Mr. Visnjic.
         18            Professor Wright is our next witness.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         20            Mr. Visnjic, perhaps you could take advantage
         21  of this opportunity to introduce your expert witness
         22  whom we see in the courtroom.
         23            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         24  thank you.  I was just going to do so.
         25            With us we have Docent Dr. Zoran Stankovic,
          1  the head of the Institute for Forensic Medicine of the
          2  Medical Military Academy in Belgrade.  Mr. Stankovic is
          3  on the list of experts of the United Nations for
          4  forensic medicine and has been there since 1964.  Thank
          5  you.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          7  very much.  May I say welcome to Mr. Zoran Stankovic.
          8            I'm now going to turn to Professor Wright and
          9  say good afternoon to him.
         10            Can you hear me, Professor?
         11            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I can hear you,
         12  Mr. President.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You are now
         14  going to read the solemn declaration that the usher is
         15  going to give you.  Please go ahead, Professor.
         16            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will
         17  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
         18  truth.
         19                 WITNESS:  RICHARD WRIGHT
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You may be
         21  seated.  Perhaps you are already acquainted with
         22  procedure.  For the moment, Professor, you're going to
         23  answer questions put to you by the Prosecutor,
         24  Mr. Peter McCloskey.
         25            Please go ahead.

          1            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          2            Prior to addressing Professor Wright, I would
          3  like to -- as a point of background, as we've heard, he
          4  was the supervising archaeologist for our exhumations
          5  of 1998 and 1999, and we have filed, in November 1999,
          6  which is Exhibit 204, his report for the 1998
          7  exhumations, and Exhibit 205, which we filed on
          8  February 18th of 2000, is his report on the 1999
          9  exhumations.  We were notified by the Defence that they
         10  would like to cross-examine Professor Wright.  So we
         11  are calling Professor Wright to give you some of the
         12  background and some more of the scientific detail of
         13  the exhumations, though, as we can all imagine, this
         14  could be a subject of several months of a course.  We
         15  will try to keep it to the highlights and to the brief
         16  points, but of course he'll be open for everyone's
         17  questions.
         18                 Examined by Mr. McCloskey:
         19       Q.   Professor Wright, could you state your name
         20  and spell your last name for the record.
         21       A.   Yes.  My name is Richard Wright, and the
         22  spelling of my surname is W-r-i-g-h-t.
         23       Q.   What is your profession?
         24       A.   I'm an archaeologist.
         25       Q.   Can you give us a review of your educational

          1  background and your employment background.
          2       A.   Yes.  I was educated at Cambridge University,
          3  where I have a masters degree.  I was employed in the
          4  Anthropology Department of the University of Sidney in
          5  1961, and in 1981 I had the Chair of Anthropology,
          6  which I held until 1990.  I resigned from that position
          7  in 1990 and the university gave me the title of
          8  Emeritus Professor of Anthropology.
          9       Q.   Okay.  We should remember we need --
         10  everything we've said is being translated so we need
         11  to, probably both of us, slow down a little bit, and
         12  it's something that we may be reminded of as we go.
         13            In any event, can you briefly describe to us
         14  what the field of archaeology is and in particular how
         15  it fits in to the exhumations of mass graves.
         16       A.   Yes.  From the point of view of these
         17  investigations, archaeologists are experts in the
         18  recognition of disturbed soil; in recovering
         19  objectives, whether they're bodies or artefacts, from
         20  that disturbed soil; in properly recording the location
         21  of objectives from that disturbed soil.  That's the
         22  central expertise of archaeologists.  This expertise is
         23  required for the detection and exhumation of mass
         24  graves.
         25       Q.   How does that fit in to the greater picture

          1  of archaeology that you were taught and learned in
          2  school and practised before that?  Just briefly, how is
          3  it related to the classic archaeology, as we speak.
          4       A.   I think the aspects of archaeology that I've
          5  mentioned are absolutely central to the discipline;
          6  that is, the use of soil to reveal what went on in the
          7  past.
          8       Q.   Does an archaeologist analyse artefacts and
          9  soil together to try to build a picture of the dig,
         10  what it means, what happened, what the various things
         11  might tell us about a prior culture, or in this case a
         12  prior crime?
         13       A.   Yes, that is exactly the responsibility of
         14  archaeologists.
         15       Q.   In fact, you did do that in your exhumations
         16  for the OTP.
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   Can you give us a background in some of the
         19  exhumations, archaeological work that you've done in
         20  the past, perhaps starting in your earlier years and
         21  working around.
         22       A.   My general or my major interest has been in
         23  the archaeology of Australia, particularly the
         24  excavation of sites that have bones from marsupials,
         25  and trying to reconstruct the environment from those

          1  sites.
          2            In 1990 I began to develop a special interest
          3  in forensic investigations, and I was employed by the
          4  Australian government to investigate three mass graves
          5  in the Ukraine.  That was in 1990 and 1991.
          6            Before I worked for the Prosecutor, I worked
          7  on the recovery of human remains in the Middle East,
          8  that was an archaeological job, and I also worked for
          9  the New South Wales investigators for the recovery of
         10  the skeletons of children from a nineteenth century
         11  orphanage cemetery.
         12       Q.   Can you tell us a little bit more about your
         13  archaeological dig in the Ukraine?  Who was that for?
         14  And can you just describe briefly about that dig.
         15       A.   Yes, the Australian government had complaint
         16  made to it that three naturalized Australians had
         17  participated in the killing of large number of Jews in
         18  1942.  The war crimes investigation unit in Sydney
         19  asked me whether I would go over there to see whether
         20  there were graves, where the eyewitnesses said there
         21  were graves and whether they contained the remains of
         22  the sort that the eyewitnesses had stated.
         23       Q.   And were you able to go over at that time,
         24  the Soviet Union and do an exhumation of a mass grave?
         25       A.   Yes, in 1990 I conducted the exhumations at

          1  Serniki which contained 550 mainly women and children
          2  who had been shot in the head.
          3            In 1991, I went to Ustinovka which is in the
          4  Ukraine and conducted the excavations at a grave where
          5  adults had been killed first and then children.
          6            And later in 1991, I conducted the exhumation
          7  of a grave at Gnivan, also in the Ukraine, where about
          8  100 victims had been shot.
          9       Q.   And these were Jewish victims?
         10       A.   These were Jewish victims.
         11       Q.   In those graves were you able to find
         12  artefacts like paper materials and things that you've
         13  been able to since recover in Bosnia?
         14       A.   We were able to find -- I don't remember
         15  papers specifically, because these were extremely old
         16  sites and papers had disintegrated, but we were able to
         17  find shell cases that had the date and manufacture
         18  of -- manufactured in Germany in 1939, 1941, and 1942.
         19       Q.   Did you try to prove ethnicity or background
         20  in those graves as well?
         21       A.   No, we didn't -- that wouldn't have been my
         22  responsibility anyway, but the -- my responsibility was
         23  that of an archaeologist.  But the point of the --
         24  whole point of the work was to establish whether the
         25  eyewitnesses' testimony had any credibility.

          1            In other words, whether the material evidence
          2  supported the claims of the eyewitnesses.
          3       Q.   Now, before we get into your ICTY experience,
          4  I notice that you refer to yourself as an
          5  archaeologist.  The front of your report refers to you
          6  as a professor of anthropology, and we have already
          7  heard about forensic pathologists from the summary
          8  witnesses.
          9            Can you tell us what forensic anthropology
         10  is, where you fit in that field and how it fits into
         11  the field of archaeology and exhumations?
         12       A.   Yes, put very simply, in this sort of work
         13  there are three disciplines that are called on; one of
         14  that is archaeology, and I've described the reasons why
         15  archaeologists are called in to do this work in
         16  connection with the soils.
         17            The anthropological side concerns the study
         18  of the bones for the purpose of determining the sex and
         19  age of the individual, and interpreting breaks and
         20  other holes in the bones.
         21            In addition, the pathologists, who are drawn
         22  from the medical profession, are the ones who finally
         23  determine the cause and manner of death.
         24       Q.   Now, when you deliver, your team delivers all
         25  these broken up bones to the morgue, which profession

          1  is it that tries to sort out the minimum number of
          2  individuals based on the --
          3       A.   The anthropologists do that.
          4       Q.   And when did you first start working for the
          5  ICTY?
          6       A.   In June 1997.
          7       Q.   And can you just briefly describe what your
          8  work involved?
          9       A.   Yes, I was in charge of the exhumations at
         10  Brcko where there were Muslim and Croatian victims.
         11       Q.   In 1998?
         12       A.   In 1998, I worked for the case that we are
         13  discussing now.
         14       Q.   As well as 1999?
         15       A.   As well as 1999.
         16       Q.   And this year are you continuing to work for
         17  the ICTY?
         18       A.   Yes, I've just completed an investigation in
         19  Croatia where there are alleged Serb victims, and I'm
         20  currently working at Prijedor in Bosnia.
         21       Q.   Now, the first exhumation you began with in
         22  1998 for the Srebrenica team was the dam; is that
         23  correct?
         24       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         25       Q.   Well, we have a film, as you're aware, of an

          1  exhumation at Cancari 12, so I'm going to take us out
          2  of order, briefly, and we'll play that film a bit
          3  later.
          4            Starting with Cancari 12, can you tell the
          5  Court a little bit about what you knew about the area
          6  going into it, and what you first did when you came to
          7  the area, what plan you developed.
          8       A.   Yes, the plans are essentially the same for
          9  all the sites.  The ICTY investigators take me to a
         10  place where they suspect there is a mass grave.
         11            Often, their knowledge comes from aerial
         12  imagery.  I then have to find the exact location of the
         13  grave within the generally disturbed area.
         14            I then take charge of the finding of the
         15  grave, the removal of the bodies and the putting of the
         16  bodies into a freezer van which is then sent to the
         17  mortuary and my duty stops with sending the bodies down
         18  to the mortuary.
         19       Q.   And do the investigators many times
         20  investigate the surface of the area if there appears to
         21  be evidence or indications of the crime prior to you
         22  coming on it?
         23       A.   Sometimes yes and sometimes not.
         24       Q.   And of course the demining act is the
         25  absolutely first thing that happened?

          1       A.   Yes.  The area is checked for mines and booby
          2  traps.
          3       Q.   Now, we've seen a clip of the beginning of
          4  the Cancari 12 site of surveyors and of a backhoe at
          5  work, and you're walking around, and we'll get to that
          6  very soon.  But can you just tell us before we get into
          7  that, what's going on there, what are your plans,
          8  what's going on there?
          9       A.   We, when I say "we", I mean the team of
         10  experts which includes archaeologist and
         11  anthropologists under my direction, we use a backhoe, a
         12  mechanical backhoe to find the exact location of the
         13  grave.  Our task is not to find bodies first, but to
         14  find the outline of the grave, and that way we do the
         15  least damage to the remains.
         16       Q.   Can you describe your team?  Can you give us
         17  more detail on who is working with you and what kind of
         18  work they do?
         19       A.   The team of archaeological and
         20  anthropological consists normally of about ten people.
         21  They're drawn from literally all over the world.  We
         22  depend a lot on experts from Central and South America
         23  who have to investigate police and military killings in
         24  their own countries.  And they sometimes have
         25  archaeological expertise, sometimes anthropological

          1  expertise, but many people have both.
          2       Q.   And this is with an educational background to
          3  back it up.  And do you have just basic labourers, you
          4  know, there is this -- there may be ideas out there
          5  that from films that there is labourers running
          6  around.  Who are basically the labourers?
          7       A.   The experts may look like labourers when
          8  they're doing the work but we don't have local
          9  labourers.  The people who do the work are the experts.
         10       Q.   So the people we'll see in the film are all
         11  educated experts in their field of archaeology or
         12  anthropology by and large?
         13       A.   Yes, and by and large they'll -- well,
         14  they've already done forensic work before ICTY takes
         15  them on.
         16       Q.   Perhaps if we could start with the tape.  We
         17  have three or four minutes of the tape that you've seen
         18  before.  But then we'll get into the end of the tape
         19  that you did not see before and, Dr. Wright, if you
         20  could explain some of the things that are going on in
         21  it and I may stop the tape to give you a better chance
         22  to explain more detail.
         23            So if we dim the lights and play Exhibit 188
         24                 [Videotape played]
         25       A.   This is the site of Cancari 12, as you see, a

          1  secondary grave.  Here my experts are setting up a
          2  surveying system to record the grave itself and the
          3  contents of the grave.
          4            The backhoe will be used to scrape off the
          5  surface of the soil until we are satisfied that we have
          6  the complete outline of the grave.
          7       Q.   How do you do that without messing up the
          8  potential evidence there?  This seems like a big
          9  machine.
         10       A.   They are removing only the top of the grave.
         11  The driver that we have has been doing forensic work
         12  since 1996, so he's familiar with the changes of colour
         13  and texture in the soil that has to be established.
         14            We also have to clear a large area around the
         15  grave, so some of these pictures that look as though
         16  destruction is taking place are due to the clearing of
         17  a large area outside the grave.
         18            The soil here, I should say, is a clay.  Most
         19  of these graves are in what's called a loess soil which
         20  is a brownish clay.
         21       Q.   When you say "these graves" are you referring
         22  to the secondary graves or all the graves?
         23       A.   All except the dam site which is in a
         24  construction --
         25       Q.   What are you doing here?

          1       A.   Here what we think are the outlines of the
          2  grave are being marked with flags.
          3       Q.   Can we stop the film right here, please.  Go
          4  ahead, I'm sorry.
          5       A.   Here you can see the natural soil, I don't
          6  think my pointer shows on this, does it?
          7            At the top of the picture, you can see the
          8  brownish soil and we're beginning to see now the
          9  blueish-green soil which is characteristic of these
         10  clays when they've been in contact with putrefying
         11  bodies.
         12       Q.   I believe that you're referring to the little
         13  orange -- the second orange piece from the top you can
         14  see a dark clay to the left and a blueish clay to the
         15  right?
         16       A.   The band across the middle of the picture is
         17  the blueish clay that we use to detect where bodies
         18  are.
         19       Q.   Okay.  And that's what you are marking with
         20  the little tags?
         21       A.   Yes.
         22       Q.   What do those little indicate?  What are you
         23  marking there?
         24       A.   We are here developing the outline of the
         25  rectangular grave.  This is a very early stage when we

          1  were still exploring to find the whole outline of the
          2  grave.
          3       Q.   How do you know that this colour change in
          4  the soil actually outlines a grave?
          5       A.   In my experience in Bosnia, when we find this
          6  greenish soil near the surface, it's invariably in
          7  contact with putrefying bodies.
          8       Q.   Just feel free to comment as we go along.
          9       A.   And here you can see the development of what
         10  we suspect in the early stages to be the outline of the
         11  grave.
         12       Q.   Did that turn out to be correct?
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   You trust your backhoe driver.
         15       A.   Normally.
         16            And then there is some development of the
         17  detail by hand.  In this case, one of my experts using
         18  a pick.
         19       Q.   How much of the work actually gets done by
         20  backhoe?
         21       A.   Very little, just the development of the
         22  outline of the grave and the putting in of a ditch
         23  around the grave itself to control flood water and to
         24  give us access to the bodies.
         25            So all that we're looking at is not

          1  exhumation but the preparatory work.
          2       Q.   And as yet you haven't found any indication
          3  of human remains aside from the colour in soil; is that
          4  correct?
          5       A.   At Cancari 12, we did find some bones on the
          6  surface, but here we see the first remains, some
          7  bones.  At the top left, a shoe, on the right, and this
          8  characteristic greenish soil.
          9            And at this stage, we have the whole of the
         10  outline of the Cancari Road 12 grave visible and on the
         11  left, you can see the --
         12       Q.   Stop here.  Excuse me, Professor.  Go ahead.
         13       A.   On the left-hand side, you can see a deep
         14  trench which is artificial in the sense that we have
         15  put that deep trench in, and on the centre and to the
         16  right is the -- are the contents of the grave itself.
         17            So the grave is turned into a mound by
         18  putting trenches around it.
         19       Q.   So it be -- the perimeter of the grave
         20  does -- it is not included in this ditch that you're
         21  talking about, it's only the area, the mound we see?
         22       A.   The perimeter of the grave is what the
         23  experts are working on to reveal bodies.
         24       Q.   Continue, please.
         25       A.   So the work consists of -- the removal of the

          1  empty soil and once the bodies are exposed then we use
          2  trowels and sometimes brushes.
          3            Here is a much later stage of the work.
          4  People are walking in the trench and they are
          5  surveying --
          6       Q.   Stop this again, please.
          7       A.   They are surveying the bodies within the
          8  grave.  We --
          9       Q.   Can you explain what that means?
         10       A.   Yes, for each of the bodies, we record 12
         11  landmarks; the skull, the shoulders, the elbows, the
         12  wrists, the pelvis, the knees, and the ankles.
         13            And that allows us to reconstruct the
         14  arrangement of bodies within the grave.
         15       Q.   So this surveying system is an electronic
         16  system that actually records these various points?
         17       A.   Yes.  It records the number of metres north,
         18  number of metres east and the depth of each of the
         19  points, it's a three dimensional recording system.
         20       Q.   A little later on, we'll see some of the
         21  results of the surveying system.  Continue with the
         22  film, please.
         23                 [Videotape played]
         24       A.   This is the surveying process in place,
         25  taking place.

          1       Q.   Do you see some investigators working along
          2  with your team there?
          3       A.   Yes.  In addition to the
          4  archaeological/anthropological experts, we have working
          5  at the site police, as scene-of-crime officers, and we
          6  have investigators from ICTY who are really observers
          7  of what's going on at the site.
          8       Q.   What's going on here with these numbers and
          9  the labelling of these bones?
         10       A.   We assign a unique number to each body or
         11  body part found within the grave.  Here they have
         12  recovered a hand with a ligature, cloth ligature, and
         13  that is being bagged separately, because in the
         14  secondary graves we often find just an arm or a hand
         15  that's been ripped off at the time of removing the
         16  bodies from the primary graves.
         17       Q.   And the process of photography.
         18       A.   Yes.  Each of these items is photographed and
         19  a log is kept of the photographs and cross-referred to
         20  the site log.  "A," as you see there, signifies an
         21  artefact that's being photographed.
         22            Here the hand with the ligature is being
         23  bagged and will be sent down to the morgue for further
         24  analysis.
         25       Q.   That will be the anthropologists' work; is

          1  that correct?
          2       A.   Anthropologists, and investigators in the
          3  morgue.
          4            There's a scene-of-crime officer in the
          5  middle and one of the anthropologists on the left.
          6            The remains, the human remains, are put in
          7  body bags and these are taken to the chiller van and
          8  periodically transferred down to the ICTY morgue, which
          9  is in Visoko.
         10            This is one of the body sheets, the record
         11  sheets --
         12       Q.   Can we stop there so we can explain that.
         13  Thank you.
         14       A.   Each time we remove a virtually complete
         15  body, the experts fill out a form that describes the
         16  properties of this body, the way in which it's lying,
         17  whether it shows any signs of injury, whether it has
         18  clothing, and so on.  So this form that you're seeing
         19  here is a checklist to be sure that the excavators have
         20  recorded critical information, and these forms are sent
         21  to the morgue with the bodies for the information of
         22  the mortuary staff.
         23       Q.   Continue, please.
         24            Is this the typical kind of checklist that
         25  you would do on many archaeological projects?

          1       A.   Yes.  The surveying is continuing here.  The
          2  person holding the staff communicates with a surveyor
          3  by means of a two-way radio because of the noise of
          4  machinery in the distance.
          5            Here you can see someone filling out one of
          6  these body sheets.
          7            Here some remains are obviously being put
          8  into the body bag.
          9       Q.   How do the archaeologists sort out what part
         10  belongs to what body?
         11       A.   In the case of primary graves that have not
         12  been disturbed, that's very easy.  But in the case of
         13  secondary graves, they will follow an arm or a leg
         14  until it stops, or the next bone makes no anatomical
         15  sense, and so they will call that a body part and it
         16  will be sent to the morgue, and I understand some
         17  attempt to link these pieces together is made at the
         18  morgue.  But because these are secondary graves and the
         19  bodies have been ripped out of the primary graves,
         20  everything is mixed up.  So the fact that two body
         21  parts are found together is not a necessary indication
         22  that they belong together.  It's a complicated process
         23  of reconstruction.
         24            In a sense, what's happening now is the end
         25  of my responsibilities as a team leader.  The bodies

          1  have been put into the chiller van, and then the
          2  anthropological and pathological analysis starts at the
          3  morgue later.
          4            Here the individuals are searching the
          5  outside of the body for any documents, looking in the
          6  outside clothing.  The reason for doing that is that
          7  oxygen, to which these bodies are now freshly exposed,
          8  can cause rapid deterioration of images and so we take
          9  photographs of any documents that are on the outside of
         10  the bodies.  Those that are on the inside are much more
         11  protected from oxygen and so we let the people in the
         12  morgue discover those in the course of their
         13  pathological examination.
         14       Q.   Is this the chiller van you spoke of?
         15       A.   Yes.  Here are the bags, the body bags,
         16  waiting for transmission to the morgue.  This van is
         17  locked, and the scene-of-crime officers are responsible
         18  for maintaining the chain of custody.
         19            Here you see a shell case mixed up with the
         20  bodies.  These are treated as artefacts and are put in
         21  evidence bags and then sent down with the bodies to the
         22  morgue, where the investigators take over.  They are
         23  cleaned with a toothbrush and water in order to prevent
         24  any further corrosion of the cases.
         25       Q.   These are largely brass cases.

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   That's a computer.  Do you have computers out
          3  there?  And could we stop just briefly, could we stop
          4  it, please.  Can you explain where the computer fits
          5  in.
          6       A.   Yes.  We have two systems of maintaining the
          7  log.  The log of the site which lists all the bodies
          8  and their properties -- their sequence numbers is kept
          9  on paper, and at the end of the day, for security
         10  reasons, to ensure we don't lose the thing, the paper
         11  log is typed into a computer version of the log.
         12       Q.   Continue.  Thank you.  You can continue.
         13       A.   Here is an example of one of the documents
         14  found at Cancari 3 which was photographed and on which
         15  you can see a name.
         16       Q.   Salko Ramic.
         17       A.   Salko Ramic, information about --
         18       Q.   Mother, Sabin --
         19       A.   Yes, and where it was issued.  And then
         20  this -- although this is not my work, it's an example
         21  of some preliminary work that's done at the site by the
         22  investigators to see whether the names on the documents
         23  that my team recovers also occur in this missing
         24  persons register.  This is the missing persons register
         25  with the same name as the person that was on the

          1  document that my team recovered.
          2       Q.   Okay.  That's the end of the film.
          3            Professor Wright, now we're going to go back
          4  in time a bit to where you first began, and that was at
          5  the site known as the dam.
          6            MR. McCLOSKEY:  If Professor Wright could be
          7  shown Exhibit 22/3, or if he's got that in front of
          8  him, we could place it on the ELMO.
          9       Q.   Does this photograph reflect the dam before
         10  you began work?
         11       A.   Yes, this is the dam before we began work.
         12       Q.   What can you tell us about the area on that
         13  photograph?
         14       A.   The suspect area that I've been showing from
         15  aerial imagery is circled in red here.  It was evident
         16  by the growth of weeds that were not growing elsewhere
         17  on the dam -- I should say that this whole surface here
         18  is an apron in front of the dam, it's entirely
         19  artificial ground made up of rocks to contain the dam
         20  wall, that is, behind where the photographer is
         21  standing.
         22       Q.   Okay.  Could we move that sideways a bit,
         23  going in the -- yes, in that direction.  Could you stop
         24  right there.
         25            Did you at some point wander around a bit and

          1  look at some of the piles of rocks in the area and
          2  notice anything in particular?
          3       A.   Yes.  As an archaeologist I look at all
          4  rocks, and I looked at this heap here and decided that
          5  it is a demolished mosque; decided that on the basis of
          6  the carved stone, angular carved stone, of the sort
          7  that I've seen in the structure of mosques.  But this,
          8  I should say, is well before the killing events that we
          9  were investigating because it appears on aerial
         10  photographs before the executions took place.
         11       Q.   All right.  Can you just tell us a bit about
         12  this exhumation, what it involved, what you found out
         13  about?
         14       A.   Yes.  The ICTY investigators who took me to
         15  the site told me that this was an undisturbed primary
         16  grave.  I had to tell them very soon into our
         17  investigations that this was not an undisturbed primary
         18  grave, that it was a robbed primary grave from which
         19  bodies had been taken away.  What was left after the
         20  grave had been filled were many pieces torn off
         21  bodies.  We were obviously looking at a few dozen
         22  people -- the remains of a few dozen people but
         23  entirely disintegrated.
         24       Q.   Could you explain in a little more detail how
         25  you knew it was not a primary grave?  What were the

          1  main characteristics?
          2       A.   The main characteristics were that there
          3  wasn't a complete single body, scarcely a complete
          4  limb.
          5       Q.   Did you get results back from the
          6  anthropologists about how many total individuals were
          7  reflected in all these body pieces that you refer to?
          8       A.   Yes.  Mr. President, may I refer to my notes
          9  for numbers and dates and so on.
         10       Q.   I may have misspoke if I said how did you
         11  know that this was not a primary grave, I should have
         12  said how did you know that it was not a primary
         13  undisturbed grave, just to clarify the record.
         14       A.   The same answer would apply, that it
         15  consisted of just fragments of human remains.
         16       Q.   Can you describe the grave itself, how big it
         17  was.
         18       A.   You asked me just now about the numbers, and
         19  I didn't answer it.  I asked the President whether I
         20  could refer to some notes on this matter that I have
         21  with me.
         22       Q.   I'm sorry.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         24  Professor, naturally.  We are not computers that can
         25  remember all the dates and the numbers, so please do.

          1       A.   As I said, I knew that there were some tens
          2  of people here.  The report that I have seen from the
          3  analysis by the anthropologists at the morgue show that
          4  these fragmentary remains account for a minimum number
          5  of 46 individuals that were left -- whose pieces were
          6  left behind in this primary grave.
          7            MR. McCLOSKEY:
          8       Q.   And then I'll get back to the question that I
          9  asked originally.  About how big was this grave?  Can
         10  you describe what it looked like, and then we'll go on
         11  to another exhibit to help that out.
         12       A.   Yes.  It was a very large grave.  My
         13  estimates are is it was 25 metres long, 6 metres broad,
         14  and 3 metres deep.
         15       Q.   Any indication from the soils or from what
         16  you'd seen as to what kind of implement was used to dig
         17  this?
         18       A.   We found traces of machine teeth within the
         19  grave, showing, not surprisingly, that it was dug by an
         20  excavator.
         21       Q.   Could you take a look at what is Exhibit
         22  189.  It should be your next in order.  Could you
         23  please, and thank you, put that on the ELMO.  If you
         24  could, tell us what this is and --
         25       A.   This is the grave at the dam, after we have

          1  removed the refilling of the grave.  It was dug out,
          2  the bodies were taken away, and then it was refilled.
          3  So we were removing the refilling, and for scale you
          4  can see people up here and the vans.  So it's a very
          5  large trench after we finished removing all the
          6  forensic evidence.
          7       Q.   Can you just tell us roughly how long it
          8  takes you to get this far?  You don't need exact
          9  dates.  Just a rough number of days.
         10       A.   I can give you the exact number of days that
         11  the exhumation there took place:  It was ten days.
         12       Q.   Could we look at the next exhibit, which is
         13  190.  What is this, and how is it in relation to the
         14  last exhibit?
         15       A.   In the last exhibit you'll remember that
         16  there was a bottom to the grave.  These are fragments
         17  of human remains, that is, bones, scattered along the
         18  bottom of the grave, representing what was there after
         19  the bodies had been removed and before the grave was
         20  refilled.
         21       Q.   All right.  Could we go to Exhibit 191, the
         22  next one.  What does this represent?
         23       A.   It represents some clothing contained within
         24  the refilling of the robbed grave.
         25       Q.   Would that be the kind of clothing that would

          1  have been searched like we've seen on the movie?
          2       A.   Yes, it would have been.
          3       Q.   Could we go to the next photo.  Now, I note
          4  in the bottom this says, "Item 122 from body pocket
          5  028."  The previous exhibit was marked, in the
          6  photograph, as 028.  What is this exhibit, this
          7  document?
          8       A.   This is a document that my team found in the
          9  pocket of that body part that you saw in the previous
         10  picture.
         11       Q.   What about these records lead you to believe
         12  that, that this came from that, aside from the matching
         13  numbers?  The numbers at the bottom of this exhibit, is
         14  that something your team would have written down?
         15       A.   The photographer would have written it down
         16  before he took the photograph.
         17       Q.   And then it would have been put in the photo
         18  log.
         19       A.   The entry would have been made in the photo
         20  log as well.
         21       Q.   All right.  While it cannot be read very
         22  well, the name on the exhibit, on the paper was Dzevad
         23  Kardasevic.  Again, if we could go to the next exhibit,
         24  193.  As we've seen in the film, here is a page out of
         25  the ICRC missing list with an individual's name in it

          1  like that.
          2       A.   Yes.
          3       Q.   All right.  Thank you very much.
          4            Now, while we recall those big rocks and
          5  boulders from the exhibit of that big hole, as you went
          6  through the summer exhuming the various secondary
          7  graves, did you come across any of the secondary graves
          8  that resembled the rocks from the dam?
          9       A.   Yes.  The rocks at the dam are rocks that
         10  were used to construct the dam itself, and these were
         11  quarried from limestone quarry and have angular edges,
         12  as all quarry rocks do.  Naturally, when I was looking
         13  at secondary graves I was looking out for such angular
         14  limestone blocks.
         15       Q.   Let's go to the Liplje grave, and I may be
         16  skipping out of order a bit, but it's Exhibit 194,
         17  which should --
         18       A.   Yes, this is the totally exhumed -- this
         19  photograph is taken at the grave of Liplje 2 which was
         20  totally exhumed, and you can see in various places
         21  limestone blocks.
         22       Q.   Are those the same kind of rocks as the dam?
         23       A.   They are the same kind of rocks as the dam,
         24  and moreover they are not rocks that are found
         25  naturally in the area -- not found naturally in the

          1  soil from which the grave was dug.
          2       Q.   You inspected the whole area and didn't see
          3  any of those cut limestone rocks in that area.
          4       A.   That's correct.  We don't merely inspect the
          5  surface of the area, we also inspect, as you can see
          6  here, a dug trench through the soils in the area.  So
          7  we see right down to below the area of the grave, and
          8  angular limestone blocks are not to be found in that
          9  place.
         10       Q.   And how about the contents of the grave?  How
         11  did you find the contents of the bodies?
         12       A.   At Liplje, in particular?
         13       Q.   Yes?
         14       A.   At Liplje, in particular, the bodies were
         15  almost entirely broken up into their individual bones.
         16       Q.   And how did you account for that?
         17       A.   I think at the dam itself where the original
         18  bodies were mixed up with very large boulders, that as
         19  they were removing, as they were robbing the primary
         20  grave, the bodies were torn apart by the machinery that
         21  was dragging them out.  One end of the body being
         22  trapped under a boulder, and then the part that's been
         23  pulled is separated.
         24            Now, I also account for it on the grounds
         25  that this -- at the dam site, the soil is fairly

          1  porous.  Oxygen gets in and speeds up putrefaction, so
          2  the periosteal tissues that hold bones together would
          3  be partly putrefied and thus the bodies would come
          4  apart fairly easily.
          5       Q.   And can you tell how many bodies were pulled
          6  out of the Liplje site and tell us the exact number of
          7  the Liplje site, if you could, that we're looking at?
          8       A.   This is only the Liplje 2.  I had only the
          9  vaguest of ideas how many bodies might be represented
         10  by these disintegrating body parts, but I was told by
         11  the morgue that the minimum number of individuals at
         12  this Liplje 2 site was 192.
         13       Q.   All right.  Thank you.  Now, let's go back to
         14  Cancari Road now.  How many bodies were recovered from
         15  the Cancari 12 site?
         16       A.   From the Cancari 12 site, the morgue told me
         17  that 177 were recovered by my team.
         18       Q.   Now, the Hodzici sites.  Can you tell us
         19  about the sites along the Hodzici site?
         20       A.   The numbers or the properties in general?
         21       Q.   No, the properties in general.  Were they any
         22  different as compared to the other secondary sites?
         23       A.   No, there was a consistency of size and shape
         24  of these secondary sites.  They were generally 13
         25  metres long by 3 metres wide by 1.5 to 2 metres deep.

          1  The -- except for the Zeleni Jadar secondary site, all
          2  the sites had been dug by what I call a front loader,
          3  an excavator and we found traces of the wheels and the
          4  teeth of those machines in the bottom of the -- in the
          5  bottom of the grave.
          6            The Hodzici sites and the Cancari Road sites
          7  and the Liplje sites were as graves, as dug graves
          8  virtually identical.
          9       Q.   And could you look at Exhibit 200, I'm sorry,
         10  I've skipped again on you it's the bulldozer.  And
         11  could we put that on the ELMO.
         12       A.   Yes.  This is not a bulldozer.  This is what
         13  I was calling a front loader.  It's a machine which has
         14  obviously got wheels and a bucket at the front and this
         15  is the machine -- the marks that we found in the
         16  secondary graves along Cancari Road and Hodzici Road
         17  and at Liplje are consistent with the graves having
         18  been dug by this sort of machine.
         19       Q.   And briefly, on the Hodzici Road sites, can
         20  you tell us the numbers of those graves in each, how
         21  many bodies came out of those three sites?
         22       A.   Yes.  Hodzici Road 3, I was told 40; Hodzici
         23  Road 4, 81; Hodzici Road 5, 57.
         24       Q.   So while the size of the Hodzici Road graves
         25  in -- was almost identical to the size in Cancari Road

          1  and Liplje, there is a significantly less number of
          2  bodies in those than you had described in Cancari?
          3       A.   The smaller number of bodies along Hodzici
          4  Road, in particular in Hodzici Road 3, as it was a
          5  full-sized grave, only had 40 individuals.  And Hodzici
          6  Road 1 is a grave that was never used at all.  That is,
          7  the rectangular hole there with all the properties but
          8  the hole was not used.
          9       Q.   From your exhumations of the secondary
         10  graves, were you able to make any kind of estimate on
         11  how many truckloads it may have taken or how many
         12  truckloads it takes to fill up a grave or was that ever
         13  attempted by you?
         14       A.   I didn't attempt that because I wouldn't know
         15  the size of the trucks.
         16       Q.   All right.  Now, let's go to Cancari 3, and
         17  can you describe at Cancari 3, as the dig commenced,
         18  was its size any different than the others?
         19       A.   No, Cancari 3 was a perfectly average-sized
         20  secondary grave; that is, it was 12 metres long, 3
         21  metres broad and 2 metres deep.
         22       Q.   And what did you note about the geology and
         23  the artefacts that was particularly interesting and
         24  different from the graves that you saw?
         25       A.   The grave was dug into clay, but the contents

          1  of the grave consisted of river cobbles or pebbles as
          2  they are called and some clay, but the most conspicuous
          3  artefact mixed up with the bodies in Cancari Road 3
          4  were thousands of fragments of broken green glass.
          5       Q.   And in particular, what could you tell what
          6  the glass was originally or what it had been
          7  originally?
          8       A.   Yes, we used our archaeological minds here,
          9  if I can just give an account of the properties of
         10  these bottles, they were broken.  About half of them
         11  had the crown seals, the metal seals on the top, so we
         12  formed the conclusion that they had been filled before
         13  they were broken.
         14            None of the bottles had a label on the body
         15  of the bottle, and so it appeared to us that they had
         16  been broken in some accident in a bottling factory, not
         17  in a distribution warehouse, because then you would
         18  expect them to have labels as well as their tops.
         19            So towards the end of the excavation, we
         20  found a large collection, some 100 or 200 labels all
         21  stuck together which gave the name Vetinka bottling
         22  factory and the town of Kozluk.
         23            So I contacted the investigators at ICTY and
         24  asked about a primary grave at Kozluk and was told that
         25  no investigations had been made there, but Mr. Ruez

          1  came down to Bosnia very quickly and we went to Kozluk,
          2  passed the Vetinka bottling factory and found an area
          3  where there was broken green glass lying around and
          4  many hundreds of thousands of fragments and area where
          5  holes had been dug and two legs on the surface and some
          6  clothing.
          7       Q.   And that is what we now call the Kozluk
          8  primary site that was the subject of your exhumation
          9  last year?
         10       A.   Yes, in 1998 we simply observed that there
         11  were human remains on the surface there, and in 1999,
         12  we carried out an investigation at that site.
         13       Q.   Okay.  Then let me go back to Cancari 3 and
         14  what were the total numbers that came out of Cancari 3?
         15       A.   Cancari 3, the estimated minimum number of
         16  individuals is at 160.
         17       Q.   All right.  Thank you.  Now, if I could
         18  direct your attention to the exhibits of
         19  computer-generated exhibits beginning with 196, and if
         20  you could just go through each of the exhibits, 196,
         21  197, 198, and 199 and describe to us, if you could,
         22  what -- how you were able to get these images and what
         23  actual size they are and how they relate to the various
         24  secondary graves you exhumed.
         25       A.   If we put on one side the top one which is

          1  the red dam, I'll just explain briefly how these are
          2  constructed.
          3            The outlines of the grave when we have
          4  finished removing the contents are surveyed by my
          5  archaeological surveyor, and from that survey data, the
          6  contour image of the grave is constructed.  So for each
          7  of the graves we do we have such an image.
          8            In case of the Cancari 12 site, the
          9  dimensions of the Cancari 12 site are 13 metres long
         10  by -- 13 metres in this direction, 3 metres broad and 2
         11  metres deep.
         12            And you can also, if I can also draw
         13  attention to the fact that we can also detect in our
         14  excavations the entrance ramp that the front loader
         15  went down to excavate the grave.  And we frequently
         16  find impressions of the wheel marks and the teeth of
         17  the impressions of the tines or teeth on the front of
         18  the bucket.
         19       Q.   I'll ask you, in particular, when we get to
         20  Kozluk on that point, so save that thought.  Do we see
         21  a ramp on the dam as well?  I think you mentioned it in
         22  previous testimony.
         23       A.   Yes, we see a ramp here.  Down which were
         24  strewn many body parts.
         25       Q.   Okay and going to the next exhibit, 198.

          1       A.   At the top, we have the outlines of the
          2  Hodzici Road 5 site that I mentioned.  The dimensions
          3  of the Hodzici Road 5 site 16 metres long by 3 metres
          4  by 1.5 metres deep and, again, we have the entrance
          5  ramp visible.
          6       Q.   And Hodzici 4?
          7       A.   Hodzici 4 has an entrance ramp and Hodzici 4
          8  is 12 metres long by 3 metres long by 1.5 metres deep.
          9       Q.   And the next exhibit, 199, Liplje 2.
         10       A.   Liplje 2 is the site that I conclude came
         11  from the dam, where the bodies came from the dam, and
         12  it is 13 metres long by 3 metres wide by 1.5 metres
         13  deep and again has an entrance ramp.
         14       Q.   And Zeleni 5?
         15       A.   Zeleni 5 is south of Srebrenica and this is
         16  the only grave that was not dug by a front loader.  It
         17  has no ramp.  This appears to be a -- perhaps a ramp
         18  but it isn't.  It has no whole tracks or tooth marks.
         19            I believe that this grave was dug by a
         20  backhoe; that is, a machine with an arm that can dig.
         21  The dimensions of the Zeleni Jadar 5 site are 17 metres
         22  long by 3 metres broad by 1.5 metres deep.
         23       Q.   And how many bodies came out of the full
         24  exhumation of the Zeleni site?
         25       A.   Zeleni site, 150.

          1       Q.   So aside from what you've just described as
          2  remarkably similar in size than the ones that are much
          3  further north?
          4       A.   Yes.
          5       Q.   Now, did you examine Zeleni 2 in any fashion?
          6       A.   I did examine Zeleni 2 because the
          7  investigators had asked that I should exhume it, but I
          8  had to tell them after my investigations that if it was
          9  a secondary grave, and I believe from the aerial
         10  imagery that it was a secondary grave that coincided in
         11  time with the rest, that that secondary grave had,
         12  itself, subsequently been dug out.
         13            So somewhere there must be a tertiary grave
         14  that we haven't discovered.
         15       Q.   Could you tell us what you did to Zeleni 2
         16  that allowed you to reach that conclusion, what you
         17  saw?
         18       A.   There was just a few disconnected human
         19  remains and isolated items of clothing in the filling
         20  of the Zeleni Jadar 2 grave.
         21       Q.   Were you able to make out that it was a
         22  similar size as the other -- of the other graves?
         23       A.   Yes.  It was a rectangular structure the same
         24  size as the Zeleni Jadar 5.
         25       Q.   Any indications -- was it in any particular

          1  area near a stream that was causing any overflow into
          2  that grave; do you recall?
          3       A.   There was a stream nearby but I don't know
          4  whether it would overflow into the grave.  It was a
          5  very wet area so possibly it would, but I couldn't say
          6  for sure that it did.
          7       Q.   All right.  Now, aside from all of those --
          8  how many of the secondary graves did you actually fully
          9  exhume?  We just went over those.
         10       A.   We fully exhumed seven secondary graves in
         11  1998.
         12       Q.   Did you go on to examine other sites that
         13  were believed to be secondary graves?
         14       A.   Yes.  The investigators took me to places
         15  where aerial imagery suggested that they were secondary
         16  graves, and these we subjected to a process that we
         17  called probing.  Probing means within the disturbed
         18  area that is shown on the aerial imagery, to try and
         19  find the rectangle of the grave, and having done that,
         20  to establish that there are multiple body parts
         21  within -- multiple bodies, I should say, within the
         22  grave.  And that's the end of the probing process.
         23       Q.   Did you go to the various sites along the
         24  Cancari Road, the Hodzici Road, Liplje, and Zeleni
         25  Jadar and examine another many sites?  And can you tell

          1  us how many you examined?
          2       A.   Yes.  I examined exactly 21 sites that proved
          3  to be secondary -- that proved to be graves.
          4       Q.   Now, did you, as an archaeologist, make any
          5  kind of estimate of numbers of potential bodies inside
          6  those unexhumed, yet confirmed secondary graves?
          7       A.   I did do that.  I did it on the grounds that
          8  the secondary graves, the seven that we did exhume
          9  along the three roads that we've already discussed,
         10  were the same size and shape.  What I did was to
         11  average the number of bodies found in those seven
         12  graves and extend that average to the 21 places that we
         13  had probed and shown to have multiple body parts.
         14       Q.   Your total for that was?
         15       A.   Well, it's an estimate; that in the 21
         16  graves, based on the seven exhumed graves, in the 21
         17  graves my estimate was 2,571 bodies.
         18       Q.   If you take the graves by road, in the
         19  vicinities, for example, Cancari 12, take the average
         20  there, and Hodzici Road, take the average there, and
         21  take the average of Zeleni and Liplje, do you come up
         22  with a somewhat different number?
         23       A.   Yes.  The number of 2,571 takes the whole
         24  area of secondary graves as a whole, and that's the
         25  number that I gave in my report.

          1            If I do it road by road, that is, average the
          2  numbers for Cancari Road and then for Hodzici Road, I
          3  come up with a higher number.  The estimate then would
          4  be 3,189 as opposed to the 2,571 that comes from taking
          5  the area as a whole.
          6       Q.   These are clearly estimates.  What's your
          7  opinion on the reliability of these estimates for
          8  numbers in the ground?
          9       A.   It's a common archaeological practice to
         10  expand one's estimates to unexcavated places from
         11  excavated places.  Whether or not my estimate is
         12  correct could be established by the total exhumation of
         13  the graves.  But it's, I think, a conservative approach
         14  to take the average and then extend it to the other
         15  graves.  The real number might be less, it might be
         16  more.
         17            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, he has one
         18  more grave, primary grave, Kozluk to discuss.  It's
         19  2.30.  It might be a good time to take a break, so we
         20  could start on that on Monday.  Or he can go on longer
         21  and it shouldn't take us much longer to get through
         22  Kozluk, though there are some exhibits.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I would be
         24  ready but I think it is quite impossible to continue
         25  today.  It is Friday, people have already packed their

          1  suitcases, and it would be torture for them to continue
          2  the hearing.
          3            So for today we'll end there and we will
          4  resume work on Monday, at 9.30, won't we.
          5            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          7  Professor.  Enjoy your weekend here in The Hague.  You
          8  will be able to take a walk and take a rest.
          9            THE WITNESS:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         10            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, I'm sorry, one
         11  thing.  If we could have Dr. Wright -- Professor Wright
         12  is in our team area, and if we could have again
         13  permission to speak to him on non-testimonial matters.
         14  I don't expect to have to speak to him but it's
         15  inevitable that I would run into him in the hallways
         16  and things, as well as the rest of the team.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         18  Mr. Visnjic.
         19            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         20  we have no objection to this exception.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, but
         22  with too many exceptions we won't have a rule.  We
         23  understand that the professor is here for a long
         24  weekend and perhaps we should give permission for
         25  contact.  But I have confidence in you so it's all

          1  right.
          2            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
