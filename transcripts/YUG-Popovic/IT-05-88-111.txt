 2                          [Defence Closing Statement]
 3                          [Open session]
 4                          --- Upon commencing at 9.43 a.m.
 5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good morning, ladies and
 6    gentlemen; good morning to the technical booth, the Registry staff,
 7    members of the Office of the Prosecutor, members of the Defence team; good
 8    morning, General Krstic.
 9            We're a bit late for reasons you are well aware of, but we hope
10    that we will be able to make up for lost time.  Therefore, pursuant to the
11    provisions of Article 86, I give the floor now to Mr. Petrusic for his
12    closing arguments.
13            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President, Your Honours, good
14    morning; good morning to my learned friends opposite, representatives of
15    the Registry.  The Defence would like to bid good morning to the technical
16    booth, as well as the interpreters.
17            After 15 months of trial, the Defence will today and tomorrow
18    present its closing arguments, which will consist of two parts.  The first
19    part will relate to factual matters, command responsibility as it is
20    regulated by Article 7.3 and 7.1 of our Statute.  And in the second part,
21    my colleague Mr. Visnjic will address the legal qualifications of the
22    crime of genocide with which General Krstic is charged in the indictment.
23            At the outset, Mr. President, the Defence would like to begin from
24    the most disputed fact, in our opinion, and that is the date from when
25    General Krstic becomes Commander of the Drina Corps.

 1            General Krstic was appointed Commander of the Drina Corps by the
 2    decree of the President of Republika Srpska on the 14th of July, 1995.  It
 3    says in the decree that he's appointed to this duty as of the 15th of
 4    July, 1995; OTP Exhibit 468.
 5            The same decree appoints, as Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps,
 6    the hitherto Commander of the Birac Brigade, Colonel Andric.
 7            Both Krstic and Andric, at the time when they were appointed
 8    pursuant to this decree, were at Zepa, that is, in a combat operation that
 9    was being conducted in the Zepa area, safe area.  And Krstic as the Chief
10    of Staff, and Andric as the Commander of the Birac Brigade, were
11    commanding some of the units taking part in that operation.
12            In order to be able to assume their new duties, they had to either
13    move from those locations or carry out a handover of duties, a pass-over
14    of duties at the headquarters where the positions they were being
15    appointed to are located.
16            It is clearly visible from the decree on the appointment of
17    General Krstic as Commander of the Drina Corps that the president of
18    Republika Srpska at the time, Dr. Karadzic, as the only authorised
19    official for the appointment of generals, issued a binding document which
20    explicitly instructed General Krstic to take over duty as of the 15th of
21    July, 1995.  That date has to be taken, and it's the only way that it can
22    be understood as the date, the earliest date when Krstic could have taken
23    over duty or, rather, the earliest date when General Zivanovic could have
24    handed over the duty of corps commander to his successor.  That is the
25    15th of July, 1995, and it is a date before which the substitution could

 1    not have taken place.
 2            The Defence relies for this submission on the decree of the
 3    president of the republic, which refers to the rules of service of the
 4    army of Republika Srpska, that is, Article 106 and Article 369; OTP
 5    Exhibit 404, footnote 44.
 6            That Article reads that according to the law of the army of
 7    Republika Srpska, only the president of Republika Srpska, as the
 8    Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, may promote, appoint, relocate,
 9    replace, or send into retirement officers from the rank of major-general
10    upwards.
11            It is quite clear that President Karadzic acted in accordance with
12    the law, and it is also clear that both Major-General Zivanovic and Krstic
13    have ranks that fit within this range.
14            The Defence has called evidence before this Trial Chamber to show
15    that the pass-over of duty is a process rather than a fact that takes
16    place in one moment.  General Radinovic testified that according to
17    military doctrine, the process of handover and takeover of duty for a
18    corps commander can last up to 30 days, and under extremely complex
19    operative conditions, even longer.  And one could certainly just say that
20    that was the case with Colonel Andric, as Professor Radinovic testified,
21    who took over his duty not before mid-August.
22            Further, according to the testimony of Professor Radinovic, the
23    former commander briefs the newly appointed commander regarding his
24    duties, obligations, area of responsibility, documents, and everything
25    else, and of course the members of the staff; in other words, everything

 1    that a commander position entails.
 2            If we take into consideration the fact that at the time of
 3    appointment Krstic was the commander of the Operative Group for Zepa and
 4    as such he was in command of the Zepa operation, then the fact has to be
 5    acknowledged that it was indispensable for the pass-over of duty for the
 6    necessary operational conditions to be in place.
 7            However, it should be noted, for the sake of truth, that Krstic
 8    was the Chief of Staff of the corps, a career officer with a relatively
 9    long career behind him.  But also for the sake of truth it should be noted
10    that Krstic, after taking over the duty of Chief of Staff in September
11    1994, went to another theatre of war outside the area of responsibility of
12    the Drina Corps and that he returned to the Drina Corps area in November
13    1994; and that after having spent a month in that area of responsibility
14    of the Drina Corps as Chief of Staff, he was wounded and he was absent
15    until mid-May 1995.  Therefore, from mid-May, General Krstic was de facto
16    a member of the corps command as the Chief of Staff, and he was in that
17    position in the relevant period we are discussing.
18            Regardless of General Krstic's considerable experience as a staff
19    officer, as an officer in general, the time he spent in the corps was not
20    sufficient for him to familiarise himself with every minute detail, of the
21    area of responsibility, the staff members, the documents, the confidential
22    ones, the less confidential ones, the state secret documents, and
23    everything else that such a command function entails.  All these are
24    reasons explaining that this pass-over of duty is not something that
25    occurs at one particular moment in time but an extended process.

 1            The actual act of pass-over of duty is regulated in the Rules of
 2    Service in the army of Republika Srpska, actually in the documents and
 3    rules that were taken over from the rules of the former Yugoslavia, and
 4    this anyway applies to all the other rules as well.
 5            According to those provisions, as testified by General Radinovic,
 6    the regiment, brigade, and division commanders take over and pass over
 7    duty before a ceremonious line-up of the unit in the presence of the
 8    Superior Commander.  For higher levels of command, that is, the corps
 9    level that General Krstic belonged to and levels above the corps, the
10    handover and takeover of duty takes place at a formal meeting which is
11    attended by the subordinate brigade commanders, the commanders of other
12    corps, and someone representing the Superior Command; in this particular
13    case, it would have to be the Main Staff of the army of Republika Srpska.
14            Upon the completion of such a pass-over ceremony, a report is
15    compiled which constitutes an official document.  According to the
16    testimony of General Krstic, and also on the basis of other exhibits which
17    we will be referring to, that ceremony, that meeting was held on the 20th
18    of July, 1995.  True enough, General Krstic says the 20th or the 21st of
19    July.  Simply, one can attribute this uncertainty to the passage of time,
20    uncertainty regarding the precise date.
21            Professor Radinovic, in the Defence submission of the 28th of May
22    and Exhibit D181/4, as well as the oral testimony of Professor Radinovic,
23    in quoting Article 609 of the Rules of Service, he indicated how the legal
24    provisions regulated this matter.
25            This submission of the Defence is borne out by Exhibit 181/5.  It

 1    can be noted in this document that the signatory is Major General Milenko
 2    Zivanovic.  From the contents of the document, it is clear that he was the
 3    hitherto commander of the Drina Corps.  The document is dated the 17th of
 4    July, 1995.  This actually means that Major General Zivanovic was the
 5    commander who was, in effect, in command of the Drina Corps at the moment
 6    the document was compiled.
 7            If we were to carry out an analysis of this document and compare
 8    it with OTP Exhibit 467, dated the 14th of July, from which it is clear
 9    that General Zivanovic was the hitherto commander of the Drina Corps, the
10    Defence submits that the only conclusion one can make is that if
11    General Zivanovic was the commander, as shown by the Prosecution document,
12    at the time this document was issued, and if that is the last moment until
13    when his command authority applied, then he could not have been the
14    hitherto commander on the 17th of July, 1995.
15            However, the document dated the 17th of July, D181/5, shows
16    clearly that he was the Drina Corps Commander on the 17th of July, 1995.
17    The Prosecutor, however, rejects even the 14th of July as the day when,
18    according to this document, General Zivanovic is described the hitherto
19    commander.  Of course, the Defence has a different opinion.  Furthermore,
20    this document, that is, 181/5, confirms that the pass-over of duty took
21    place on the 20th of July, 1995, because General Zivanovic himself states
22    in this document that his send-off will be organised on that day in the
23    Jela Motel at Han Kram.
24            Analysing the word Dosadasnj, that is, "hitherto," a term that has
25    been officially analysed by the head of the translation service in this

 1    Tribunal, it is to be found on page 8356 of the LiveNote of the 11th of
 2    December, 2000, the concept Dosadasnj is clearly defined and described,
 3    that is, the English equivalent "hitherto."
 4            In the submission of the Defence, there can be no doubt that on
 5    the occasion of the pass-over of duty, a report or minutes were compiled.
 6    And the Defence expected, at the beginning of this trial, in fact, we were
 7    quite certain that we would be able to gain possession of that report in
 8    the archives either of the Supreme Command of the Drina Corps or in the
 9    archives of one of the subordinate units.  One could not have assumed that
10    such a document could not be found and that wherever we looked for that
11    document, all the doors were closed, which provoked a great deal of
12    suspicion and doubt with the Defence.
13            The Prosecutor - and I do not wish to interfere in their method of
14    work, I would not like to be misunderstood - conducted an investigation
15    into Srebrenica and was in a far better position, either through SFOR or
16    thanks to the willingness of the Defence Ministry and the army of
17    Republika Srpska, to gain possession of such a document.  However, allow
18    me to observe that suddenly General Zivanovic reemerged on the 23rd of
19    April, 2001, and the notification, his document, somehow emerged out of
20    the blue, and the Defence wonders how to explain the submission of that
21    document all of a sudden, which again is not the kind of document that can
22    be called a report on the pass-over of duty, a document over which there
23    could have been no dispute.
24            Naturally, may I make myself quite clear, the Defence has no
25    doubts at all with respect to the professional activities of the

 1    Prosecution.  Our doubts refer to the former Commander of the Drina Corps,
 2    General Zivanovic.
 3            The Prosecution fails to take into consideration two undisputable
 4    facts with respect to the date when General Krstic took over his functions
 5    as Commander of the Drina Corps.  In the decree on the appointment, the
 6    President of Republika Srpska, who is authorised to appoint and discharge
 7    generals, it states that the 15th of July, the day when Krstic can take
 8    over his duties as corps commander at the earliest moment, before that
 9    date, nobody could have done this.  Nobody had authority to do this.
10            It is the position of the Prosecution, as has been said, that it
11    was the 13th of July, 1995.  If it is, therefore, the submission of the
12    Prosecution, which refers to the information issued to subordinate units
13    by Colonel Jovicic, and it is Exhibit 905, OTP Exhibit 905, the Defence
14    then raises a number of questions.  And in providing the answers to those
15    questions, it disavows this act, rejects it as a valid document on the
16    basis of which the pass-over of duty is conducted.
17            From this document, it is a notorious fact that on that particular
18    day, there was no decree by the president of the republic.  It was not in
19    existence at all.  And then the question arises, how can an officer in
20    charge of personnel duties, who by nature of his job, should refer to the
21    normative acts and regulations, legal ones and bylaws, can refer and rely
22    on a decree which is non-existent as yet, a document which does not
23    exist?
24            Colonel Jovicic -- furthermore, this act as a piece of
25    information, sends to the subordinate units of the Drina Corps, although

 1    there is no need to inform them, because according to Rule 609 of the
 2    rules of service, Article 609 of the rules of service of the armed forces,
 3    subordinate commanders, that is to say the commanders of subordinate units
 4    are duty-bound to attend the ceremony of pass-over of duty itself.
 5            This act, this document should be sent to the Supreme Command, the
 6    president of the republic, who must have knowledge of the fact of whether
 7    his decree is being implemented or not, because the decree is an
 8    imperative, normative requirement, a binding one in the legal system of
 9    the then-SFRY, and by the same token, Republika Srpska.
10            Therefore, the President of the Republic, as the Supreme
11    Commander, is the first person who most needs to be informed about the
12    appointment on the basis of the decree.  This cannot be seen in this
13    informative document, and that is impossible.  It would be impossible
14    because the decree to which Jovicic refers, Colonel Jovicic refers, was
15    never compiled.  It does not exist.
16            Furthermore, had the handover and takeover of duty taken place on
17    the 13th of July, as is said in this informative document, pursuant to it,
18    we would have the following situation:  Colonel Svetozar Andric, who was
19    appointed as Chief of Staff, simultaneously would be the Commander of the
20    Birac Brigade, and that quite simply is not possible.  It would be a
21    duality of functions, and dual function is something which is
22    inconceivable.  Only the chief of staff of a corps can perform the
23    simultaneous function of deputy corps commander, but we will speak at
24    greater length later on, when he came over to take his duty as deputy and
25    commander.  Therefore, this would quite obviously have been duality in the

 1    functioning of the command system of the Drina Corps.
 2            Document 181/5.  It is the submission of the Prosecution that on
 3    the 13th of July, the pass-over of duty took place, when the decree, as a
 4    legal basis, was non-existent.  This submission and thesis, amongst
 5    others, they're justified by the wartime circumstances that prevailed.  We
 6    feel that this thesis is untenable.  In practice, of course, it is
 7    possible under wartime conditions that some less important regulations and
 8    rules of service are not always respected because of the prevailing
 9    situation and circumstances, and this has been borne out many times by
10    witnesses here, and Defence Witness DB told us that too.
11            However, in the case in point, we are not dealing with an
12    unimportant rule.  We are not talking about the pass-over of duty of a
13    company commander, for instance, which might have, say, 150 men in it; we
14    are not talking about the pass-over of duty of a platoon commander
15    either.  What we are dealing with is the handover and takeover of duty of
16    a corps, which can number up to as many as 20.000 soldiers, so this is the
17    largest formation in the army.
18            Apart from that, not only are we talking about adherence to norms,
19    but under given circumstances, there was no need for the pass-over to take
20    place in the way as has been put forward in the submission of the
21    Prosecution.  In case there are extraordinary circumstances, like an
22    offensive or other active-combat operations, the corps commander, for
23    objective reasons, and these can be sudden disease or death, serious
24    wounding, disappearance, if he is prevented from fulfilling his duties
25    because of any of these situations, the chief of staff, who is at the same

 1    time the deputy commander, when the commander is unable to be present,
 2    takes over those duties and responsibilities.  Therefore, it was
 3    absolutely unnecessary to violate any rules and regulations and to appoint
 4    an ad hoc corps commander.
 5            In our concrete case, all the more so, as none of the stipulated
 6    circumstances were fulfilled.  There was no sickness, the hitherto
 7    commander was not prevented from attending.  Quite the contrary.  General
 8    Zivanovic was present all the time.  He was in the area of
 9    responsibility.  He took part in the operation itself from the 9th of July
10    and onwards, quite certainly up until the 20th of July, because he
11    himself, in document 181/5, says that on the 20th of July, he will
12    organise a send-off and be present.  According to the Rules of Service,
13    this is a ceremony at which the actual handover and takeover of duty is
14    conducted.
15            Furthermore, in interpreting this document and linking it up with
16    the Prosecution's submission that the handover took place on the 13th of
17    July, one would arrive at the conclusion that in fact two ceremonies of
18    pass-over had taken place; one, in the submission of my learned colleague
19    of the Prosecution, Mr. Harmon, on the 13th of July, when allegedly Mladic
20    performed this act at the command headquarters of the corps in Vlasenica;
21    and another one, when Zivanovic himself informed his subordinates on the
22    17th of July that a ceremony would be held on the 20th of July.
23            If that was, indeed, on the 13th of July, why then would this
24    pass-over ceremony be repeated and staged again on the 20th of July?  Is
25    it, as seems to be the prevalent submission, a banquet of some kind or

 1    that kind of ceremony?  Zivanovic, for all intents and purposes, would not
 2    have used all his prerogatives as Corps Commander and, in that capacity,
 3    informed subordinate units of the fact.
 4            Would anybody, on the 17th of July -- would it enter into
 5    anybody's head on the 17th of July - while in the zone of responsibility
 6    of the Zvornik Brigade there was a whole collapse in the system, and
 7    judging by the reports coming in, the threat of Zvornik falling was
 8    imminent, that was taking place on the one hand; and on the other, a part
 9    of the forces were engaged in military operations towards Zepa - so would
10    it have entered anybody's mind, given the prevailing circumstances, to
11    choose that particular time frame to organise a luncheon, a banquet?  Or
12    if it had an entertainment character.  Some of the testimonies that said
13    that this was sort of an entertainment.  We heard submissions put forward
14    and suggested in that way.
15            However, the Defence submits that that was not the kind of
16    ceremony it was, that it was the official handover and takeover ceremony
17    at which the most serious question related to the corps was being
18    resolved, that is to say, the actual commanding of the corps.  And those
19    whose duty it was to implement the decree of the President of the Republic
20    were duty-bound to execute it and decided that that would take place on
21    the 20th of July, regardless of the prevailing circumstances.  I say
22    "regardless of the circumstances" because it is with this document on the
23    pass-over of duty that the situation of command is regulated in the corps
24    de facto and de jure.
25            The other pertinent fact which throws quite different light on the

 1    pass-over of duty of the commander of the Drina Corps is the sojourn of
 2    General Krstic at Zepa in his role as Commander of the armed forces
 3    engaged in the operation which was code named Stupcanica 95 at the time.
 4    We must bear in mind the following in this regard:  Krstic was in Zepa and
 5    not in Vlasenica at the corps command headquarters there.
 6            Apart from that, at a meeting held in the Bratunac Brigade, on the
 7    11th of July, in the evening, General Mladic orders General Krstic that
 8    the same forces that took part in the Srebrenica operation should be
 9    prepared to take part in the Zepa operation.  If Krstic was to have been
10    appointed the commander on the 13th of July, why then would Mladic send
11    him to Zepa, and why then would Krstic remain at Zepa?  It would be
12    logical to expect that he would leave him at Vlasenica, at the command
13    post, and designate another commanding officer to be commander of the
14    forces at Zepa.  However, General Krstic was designated to be the one to
15    lead the forces towards Zepa.
16            Furthermore, Krstic does not appear in the area of responsibility
17    of the Zvornik Brigade, which was in a highly serious situation, nor does
18    he issue orders of any kind with respect to measures to deal with the
19    situation in that zone of the brigade which, had he been the corps
20    commander, this would have been a priority task of his.
21            This thesis and submission put forward by the Defence is borne out
22    by the combat report of the Zvornik Brigade, and it is OTP Exhibit 609,
23    dated the 15th of July, 1995, signed by Colonel Vinko Pandurevic, the
24    Brigade Commander.
25            Vinko Pandurevic, on that particular morning, the morning of the

 1    15th of July, returned from Zepa, and had Krstic been corps commander on
 2    the 15th of July, quite certainly this report would have been sent to
 3    Krstic at the forward command post, because Pandurevic knew that Krstic
 4    was at the Krivace forward command post at Zepa.  But similarly,
 5    Pandurevic also knew that Krstic was commanding only the forces engaged at
 6    Zepa and, therefore, he sent his report to the command of the Drina Corps
 7    in Vlasenica.
 8            The report dated the 18th of July, OTP Exhibit 675, also of the
 9    Zvornik Brigade, is sent by Colonel Pandurevic to Vlasenica.  Why to
10    Vlasenica if indeed Krstic was the corps commander?  Why not to the
11    forward command post?  Of course Colonel Pandurevic knew full well the
12    status of General Krstic, and, therefore, did not inform him of the state
13    of affairs in the area of responsibility but informed the command in
14    Vlasenica.
15            A similar report, OTP 614, also from the Zvornik Brigade, is sent
16    to the command post of the Drina Corps in Vlasenica.
17            The Prosecutor, furthermore, amongst all the documents and
18    particularly on the basis of document OTP 536 and 537, as well as OTP 483,
19    claims that Krstic was the Corps commander in the days when these reports
20    are being sent out.
21            In document OTP 483, which is an order to attack the Zepa
22    enclave - it is dated the 13th of July - the units are enumerated which
23    are to take part in those combat operations.  Krstic himself was at a
24    meeting on the 11th of July at the Bratunac Brigade in the evening at
25    which Mladic designated him Commander of the operation, and he had to plan

 1    and implement it.
 2            In an order issued, and the document is OTP 463, General Krstic
 3    issues orders to those units who have been designated to take part in the
 4    Zepa operation.  The order is that they search the terrain.  And this
 5    could be a normal operation after the fall of the Srebrenica enclave and
 6    possible surprises which the 28th Division might have in store for the
 7    troops when the 28th Division was engaged in its withdrawal.
 8            Therefore, it is by this order that the commander of the Bratunac
 9    Brigade, which had become within the composition of the units to take part
10    in the operation for Zepa, that is to say, the order of the 15th of July,
11    that combat report, in that combat report Colonel Blagojevic, and this is
12    OTP Exhibit 536, informs General Krstic at the forward command post,
13    because he issued the order to search the terrain.  However,
14    Colonel Blagojevic also informed the command of the Drina Corps at the
15    same time.
16            Had General Krstic, on the 15th of July, been the Commander of the
17    Drina Corps, Blagojevic would not have sent that piece of information,
18    that report, both to the command headquarters in Vlasenica and to the
19    forward command post at Zepa.
20            Similarly, this is what happened with respect to document OTP 537
21    of the 15th of July, where Colonel Milanovic this time sends a report both
22    to the forward command post and to the command headquarters in Vlasenica.
23            The Defence, throughout this trial, challenged the relevance of
24    the intercepts, intercepted conversations, because it deemed that they did
25    not have the probative value on the basis of which one would be able, with

 1    any certainty, to make any decision, regardless of what that decision
 2    would be, to the advantage or to the detriment of the accused and without
 3    wishing to elaborate the reasons, we have provided, set them out in our
 4    motion to the Trial Chamber in writing.
 5            However, in addition to this fact, the Defence would like to
 6    submit, regardless of the general attitude and stand with respect to the
 7    intercepted conversations, to go into an analysis of OTP Exhibit 556.
 8            Assuming that this intercept is an accurate one, and it is taken
 9    from the communication Major Jokic had with General Zivanovic, one could
10    conclude that General Zivanovic, on the 14th of July, was at the command
11    post in Vlasenica.
12            On line 3, after addressing Jokic and saying, "Go ahead,"
13    Zivanovic says, "Take this as an order.  Take this to be an order," and
14    that he should convey to Obrenovic, to tell Obrenovic what Obrenovic was
15    supposed to do.
16            It is quite obvious, in the submission of the Defence, on the 14th
17    of July, at 2038 hours, when this conversation was allegedly intercepted,
18    General Zivanovic issued an order.
19            In another intercept, intercept OTP 555, the person who
20    intercepted the conversation states in the heading that the conversation
21    took place at 0910 hours, between the Commander of the Drina Corps,
22    Milenko Zivanovic, and Major Jokic.  However, the person doing the
23    interception need not have known when the commanders were changed.  What
24    is important, however, is that Zivanovic, on the 14th of July, was at the
25    command post at Vlasenica, that he was there, and that he was giving Jokic

 1    a set of instructions as to what he should do.
 2            Among others, because of the situation we can only assume was
 3    taking place in the Zvornik Brigade area of responsibility, Zivanovic says
 4    that all they would have to do is inform Mane, the centre of public
 5    security.
 6            The next conversation, OTP 364/1, was conducted at 20 hours, 56
 7    minutes, between major -- between a major and General Zivanovic.
 8            The major says:  "How can I find out where General Zivanovic is?
 9    Because I've been waiting here for him on his orders since 1700
10    hours."  "He's here."  And several lines further down, Zivanovic says to
11    the major that they should read his conclusions, and the major says, "Yes,
12    sir.  Yes, I understand completely.  And then we'll focus on things down
13    there."
14            It is clear, in the position of the Defence, from that
15    conversation, at least as stated by a certain major as a correspondent in
16    this conversation, a major subordinated to General Zivanovic, it is clear
17    that General Zivanovic is issuing the orders, for if General Zivanovic at
18    that time did not have any command authority, the major would not be
19    waiting for him upon his orders, but he would be waiting for him as
20    agreed.  If Zivanovic has no command authority, why would he be telling
21    the major to read his conclusions and why would the major, fully in line
22    with a relationship between superior and subordinate, give the answer,
23    "Yes, sir," or, "I understand"?
24            In the opinion of the Defence, these intercepts also indicate that
25    General Zivanovic was in command and was issuing orders to subordinate

 1    units.  In the submission of the Defence, these intercepted conversations
 2    also negate the submission of the Prosecution that Zivanovic handed over
 3    command of the corps on the 13th of July.
 4            Also, the submission of the Prosecution that General Zivanovic
 5    handed over duty in the afternoon of the 13th of July cannot stand, in the
 6    submission of the Defence.  Document OTP 462 leads to the following
 7    conclusion:  Had the changeover taken place on the 13th of July, in the
 8    afternoon, in Vlasenica, and had General Krstic at that time, that is, in
 9    the afternoon and evening, been present in Vlasenica, why would have
10    General Zivanovic sent this order to the forward command post, when he was
11    personally with Krstic in Vlasenica?
12            It should be noted that this order was issued pursuant to an order
13    of the Supreme Command of the same date, that is, the 13th of July.  The
14    Prosecution is using this order as evidence to challenge the testimony of
15    General Krstic, according to which he was not aware of the existence of
16    prisoners of war.  In paragraph 3 of this order, it is stated that the
17    armed -- I mean the captured and disarmed troops should be accommodated
18    appropriately and the appropriate command reported to immediately.
19            This submission or this paragraph cannot be proof that Krstic knew
20    of the existence of prisoners of war.  From the quoted paragraph, it is
21    clear that reference is made to instructions as to how to act in potential
22    situations which existed at the time this order was issued.  And it can
23    also be seen that at that time, and according to this order, there were no
24    prisoners of war.
25            Zivanovic is not informing Krstic by this order that there are

 1    prisoners of war which need to be put in suitable buildings, but only how
 2    they should act should there be any prisoners of war.  Therefore, the
 3    testimony of General Krstic that he was not aware of the existence of
 4    prisoners of war at that time was quite truthful, and this order does not
 5    prove the opposite as submitted by the Prosecution.
 6            On the 11th of July, 1995, General Krstic received orders from the
 7    commander of the Main Staff, Ratko Mladic, to plan the Zepa operation.
 8    There is no written evidence of this, though we will come back to that a
 9    little later, but in his testimony, General Krstic and Witness DB shows
10    clear that that order was issued to the Bratunac Brigade.  The Defence has
11    proven that, in the period from the 13th of July to the 2nd of August,
12    General Krstic was at Zepa, and that he was in control and command of the
13    forces carrying out that operation.  Similarly, it can be accepted without
14    dispute that to plan this operation, the necessary documents had to be
15    compiled, the forward command post dislocated from Pribecevac to Zepa,
16    military units had to be gathered, prepared, and reinforced for that
17    operation, and for all this General Krstic and his staff needed a certain
18    amount of time.
19            This means that as early as the 12th of July, in the early
20    morning, and from then on, General Krstic was directly involved with the
21    Zepa operation, and as has been stated, he had to be engaged on the
22    preparations of the operation and, as of the 14th of July, its actual
23    execution.
24            In the submission of the Defence, bearing in mind the fact that
25    Krstic was in command of a part of the forces at Zepa, until the 20th of

 1    July, the command duties in the whole area of responsibility was held by
 2    General Zivanovic.
 3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Petrusic, excuse me for
 4    interrupting you, I was going to suggest a break.  But before that break,
 5    since we are at the very heart of the matter, I have a question for you.
 6    We know that for the Krivaja 95 operation, there was an order of the Main
 7    Staff, that is, General Mladic; after that there was an order from the
 8    Drina Corps Commander General Zivanovic addressed to several units.  Here
 9    there's no order.  Do I understand that correctly?  There are only oral
10    orders, no written ones.
11            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Mr. President.  At the meeting
12    on the 11th of July which was held at the Bratunac Brigade in the evening,
13    about 21 or 22 hours, an oral order was issued by General Mladic, the
14    Commander of the Main Staff, that Krstic, with a part of the forces,
15    should be dispatched to Zepa; and on the 13th of July, General Krstic
16    prepared the order for combat operations on Zepa.
17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  But according to the
18    rules, should there be a written order, or was it sufficient to have an
19    oral order?
20            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] According to the rules of control
21    and command, it is up to the commander to decide whether he will issue a
22    written and an oral order.  The commander has the authority to issue both
23    a written and an oral order, at least that is what the Defence expert
24    witness, General Radinovic, told us in his testimony.  It seems to me that
25    this way of issuing an order was not in any way challenged or contested in

 1    the course of these proceedings.
 2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] But would it have been more
 3    normal to issue a written order?
 4            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I cannot judge what would be
 5    normal.  But practice shows that in the military system of the former JNA,
 6    oral orders were also accepted.
 7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Okay.  Thank you very much,
 8    Mr. Petrusic.  I suggest we now have a break.  Would it be a good time for
 9    you?
10            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour.
11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well, then.  We're going to
12    have a half-hour break.
13                          --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.
14                          --- On resuming at 11.37 a.m.
15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So, Mr. Petrusic, you may
16    continue your oral arguments.  You have the floor.
17            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Mr. President.
18            In this part of its oral arguments, the Defence will focus on the
19    norms and regulations governing the system of command in the army of
20    Republika Srpska and the Drina Corps.
21            The headquarters and staff of the Drina Corps consisted of
22    departments and organs.  The departments were departments for operative
23    work and training, for intelligence, for personnel affairs, and the
24    branches, the armoured and mechanised units, the units of so-called ABHO
25    protection, that is, chemical and -- chemical warfare, engineers,

 1    artillery and rocket units, communication units, air defence units, and
 2    electronic reconnaissance units.
 3            In these departments -- these departments were headed by the
 4    chiefs of staff, who were at the same time the deputy corps commander, who
 5    was at the same time the deputy corps commander.
 6            In addition to the chief of staff in the Drina Corps command there
 7    were three assistant commanders, the assistant for morale, legal, and
 8    religious affairs; the assistant for security; and the assistant for
 9    logistics.  These assistants had under their command, organs and bodies to
10    carry out their main activities within their departments.  Thus, for
11    instance, the assistant commander for security had his officers or
12    assistants and units of the military police.  The assistant for logistics
13    again had bodies and officers for each logistics service who develop their
14    rear posts to provide logistic support such as quartermasters, technical,
15    medical, veterinary, and other services.
16            As the chief of staff is accountable to the corps commander,
17    similarly, the assistant corps commanders from these three departments are
18    also accountable to the corps commander.
19            The role and responsibility of the assistant commander for
20    security is a specific one with regard to the chief of staff and the other
21    two assistant commanders, and this role is regulated by the rules, an
22    excerpt of which is to be found in Exhibit D158.
23            What makes the role of the assistant commander for security
24    specific is a certain dual control and command function and the competence
25    of this assistant within the system of command of the corps.  The specific

 1    role of the assistant commander for security, in relation to other
 2    assistants, is regulated in the rules of the Security Service.  These
 3    rules, of course, have also been taken over from the army of the former
 4    SFRY.
 5            In addition to being accountable like the other assistants to the
 6    corps commander, the assistant for security has also his so-called
 7    functional command chain, a chain of command, according to which he is
 8    obliged to fit the Security Service of the corps within the Security
 9    Service of the Superior Command.  At the same time, he's obliged to link
10    the security service in subordinate units into a unified security service
11    of his corps.
12            Each assistant commander for security has a dual responsibility.
13    He is accountable to his own commander and to the assistant for security
14    of the Superior Command.  This duality almost regularly resulted in the
15    independent activity of the security department so that in fact there were
16    two chains of command, operational command, which was headed by commanders
17    of corps down the level to the lowest units, and a security system of
18    command headed by the assistant for security in the highest level command,
19    that is, in the Supreme Command.  And this was a constant source of
20    problems, and in the opinion of troop officers such as corps and brigade
21    commanders, there were frequent irregularities.  And there was an instance
22    when the Commander of the Zvornik Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Pandurevic,
23    requested, as early as 1994, that the security organ in his brigade should
24    be subordinated to him in every respect and not to the security organ in a
25    higher level command.  And this is also something that General Krstic

 1    testified about.
 2            There is no doubt that these problems existed in those days as
 3    well, because the Rules of Service of the security organs allowed it, and
 4    as will be borne out by all the events that occurred around Srebrenica in
 5    the period between the 13th and 17th of July, which shows that that is
 6    precisely how the security system functioned.
 7            It was almost the rule for the security system to function as a
 8    separate and independent chain of command and decision-making.  For most
 9    of the activities within the framework of the security department, which
10    are of a general nature and which are not directly linked to combat
11    security of the corps, the operational control and command system was not
12    informed.
13            As I have already indicated, a certain degree of independence on
14    the part of the assistant commander for security was contributed to by the
15    Rules of Service; or to put it differently, the Rules of Service provided
16    a basis for such conduct.  In the event of confidential operations, the
17    assistant for security had no obligation to inform the commander about
18    them, but he was obliged to inform the assistant for security of the
19    Superior Command, who was the person who could give him orders along those
20    lines.
21            The Defence has the impression that the Prosecution has not fully
22    appreciated in the proceedings against General Krstic this specific nature
23    of the security chain of command within the Drina Corps.  That is why the
24    Defence and General Radinovic, as an expert witness, have sought to fully
25    explain this duality of control and command and these parallel chains that

 1    resulted from this.
 2            When we come to the crimes described in the indictment and which
 3    occurred in the area of responsibility of the Drina Corps in July 1995,
 4    this duality of command certainly had a decisive impact on the nature of
 5    command competencies and command responsibilities of the senior officers
 6    of the Drina Corps, including General Krstic.
 7            It seems to me that General Radinovic, during his testimony,
 8    argued fully that a necessary logical consequence of this security chain
 9    of command was a situation in which the security system at all levels of
10    command took decisions regarding prisoners of war and what should be done
11    to them without informing the unit commanders about this, the commanders
12    within whose areas of responsibilities these crimes were committed.
13            The Defence will seek to prove, on the basis of certain
14    indicators, that this security system even used paramilitary units which
15    appeared ad hoc within the territory of the army of Republika Srpska and
16    which were not part of the system and were not under the command, allow me
17    to say, the commanders of the units belonging to the regular system of
18    control and command.
19            The chief of staff is, according to establishment and by his
20    functions, responsible for the functioning of the corps staff.  As the
21    person who is, according to establishment, responsible for operational
22    planning, the chief of staff has the authority to require from other
23    assistant commanders information which will make it possible for him to
24    plan combat operations in accordance with the concept of the commander.
25    However, that does not necessarily mean a priori that the assistant

 1    commanders were, in any sense, subordinated to him.  Only the staff
 2    officers are subordinated to the chief of staff, and they are the officer
 3    for operations and training, for communications, ABHO protection, air
 4    defence, which I have already listed at the beginning of this section.
 5            When analysing the command responsibility of General Krstic with a
 6    view to making him responsible for the acts which occurred in the area of
 7    responsibility of subordinated units and commands, the expert witnesses of
 8    the Prosecution and, above all, Mr. Butler, with all due respect for their
 9    professionalism and rank - I'm referring to Mr. Butler and his expert
10    report - they raise General Krstic to a level which he, in fact, did not
11    have and which, according to the rules of command in the army of Republika
12    Srpska, he did not have.
13            According to their understanding, the chief of staff is said to be
14    superior to the whole Corps Command except for the commander, including
15    the assistant commanders.  Both Mr. Butler and General Dannatt, when
16    making an organigramme of the corps staff, equates the staff with the
17    command.  So in so doing, they also place the chief of staff above the
18    level of assistant commander.
19            Through our expert witness General Radinovic, the Defence has
20    sought to prove that there is a substantive difference between the
21    understanding of the staff in the doctrines of West European armies, which
22    General Dannatt relied upon when interpreting the structure of the staff
23    and the position of the chief of staff, from the doctrine of control and
24    command which was in force in the army of Republika Srpska.
25            According to the latter doctrine, there is no direct command

 1    responsibility of the chief of staff over the assistant commander, but,
 2    rather, the chain of command going from the commander of the Drina Corps
 3    towards his assistants is the same and is based on the same model as
 4    towards the chief of staff.  So it is an identical level of command
 5    responsibility from the commander towards all three assistant commanders
 6    and the chief of staff and vice versa.  All three assistant commanders and
 7    the chief of staff have an identical level of accountability and
 8    responsibility towards the commander in the command.
 9            The chief of staff does not have a privileged position in any
10    sense within the framework of the Corps Command as claimed by
11    General Dannatt and Mr. Butler, and it would seem to me that their
12    interpretation helped the Prosecution to construe the responsibility of
13    General Krstic as chief of staff.
14            Apart from being in charge of planning of combat operations and of
15    his duty to communicate with other command bodies for that purpose, the
16    chief of staff has no other command authority towards command organs
17    outside the staff and its structures, nor towards subordinated units and
18    commands.  That kind of authority rests exclusively with the corps
19    commander.  That is his exclusive right, and it is, in the final analysis,
20    that which distinguishes him from all the other members of the Corps
21    Command or any other command regardless of the level.
22            The Defence has the impression that the role of deputy commander
23    also has not been sufficiently precisely defined within the whole
24    structure of the system of command.  It is true that General Krstic is the
25    Deputy Commander of the Drina Corps, but the function of deputy commander

 1    was not the result of a position in the establishment, because no such
 2    position in the establishment exists, but the function of deputy stems
 3    from the function of chief of staff in the establishment.  Therefore, the
 4    legislator has not provided for a special post of deputy commander in the
 5    establishment, probably believing that it was not necessary, for if it
 6    were a special post envisaged by establishment, the legislator would have
 7    regulated the competencies of that post in the rules as was done for all
 8    the other organs in the command and staff.
 9            The rules regarding competencies provide for the competencies of
10    the corps commander.  All those competencies apply also to his deputy, but
11    only when he is de facto performing the role of Commander-in-Chief.  This
12    means that the chief of staff assumes the competencies of the commander
13    only when the commander is unable to perform his duties when his deputy
14    has to take them over.
15            When it becomes quite clear that the commander is unable to
16    perform his command duties or when he's authorised to perform that role by
17    a document, only then does the deputy commander take over the control and
18    command functions of the commander.  In practice, this means that the only
19    privilege of the chief of staff is that he automatically takes over
20    command competencies and command responsibilities when the commander is
21    unable to perform them.  This also means that the legislator sought to
22    make it clear from the beginning who has the right to command and control
23    instead of the commander when he's unable to do so.
24            The very fact that somebody holds the position of chief of staff
25    does not give him any exclusive right of command if the commander is

 1    available and if he is capable of commanding.  Only as, what I have said,
 2    he is unable to perform his duties does the chief of staff take over in
 3    the role of commander.
 4            The Defence submits that General Radislav Krstic took over duty on
 5    the 20th of July, 1995, and he is seeking to prove that throughout the
 6    period when he was chief of staff while the current commander was
 7    General Zivanovic, General Zivanovic was available for commanding, he was
 8    capable of commanding of the units of the Drina Corps.
 9            In brief, Mr. President, the Defence would now like to focus on
10    the demilitarised zone or, rather, the demilitarisation of the safe area
11    of Srebrenica.
12            The Defence considers that one cannot speak about, nor raise to
13    the level of proof proper, the decision of the assembly of the Serbian
14    people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was signed by Mr. Krajisnik and which
15    was referred to in the closing argument by Mr. Harmon, that it was the
16    strategic -- that Podrinje was the strategic interest of the VRS, or,
17    rather, the abolishment of the border between Serbia and Republika
18    Srpska.
19            In this trial, during these proceedings, we did not present
20    evidence of this kind before the Trial Chamber.  However, as the
21    Prosecution has referred to the matter, the Defence will present certain
22    facts to refute that thesis.
23            Perhaps Podrinje was the strategic interest of the Serbs, but it
24    is quite obvious that Podrinje was also the strategic interest of the
25    Muslims as well.  Had that not been so, why, then, would the Serbs, in the

 1    autumn and winter of 1992 and 1993, in these regions, have experienced the
 2    greatest pogroms?  Why would they have left Srebrenica if there was no
 3    strategic interest of the Muslims vis-a-vis that area?
 4            But whatever it was, the fact remains that from the beginning of
 5    the war in the region, that there were combat activities between the two
 6    warring parties.  The UN Security Council, with its Resolution 189,
 7    proclaimed a safe area here as of the 16th of April, 1993, and those safe
 8    areas were Srebrenica, Zepa, and Gorazde.
 9            With the Additional Protocol of the Geneva Conventions, dated the
10    12th of August, 1994, Chapter 5, Places and Zones Under Special
11    Protection, Article 60, precisely devised the fact that the areas placed
12    under special protection regime must be demilitarised.
13            The demilitarisation, according to Article 60, envisages the
14    following: that for acts of hostility, no immobile military installations
15    and institutions be used; that from those areas, all soldiers be evacuated
16    as well as mobile weapons and others; that the authorities and the
17    inhabitants must not undertake any hostile acts towards the other warring
18    side or towards anybody in the enclave; that all activities must cease
19    with respect to the military effort.  It is also provided for that one
20    party in the conflict will be alleviated of its responsibilities with
21    respect to respecting the status of the safe area if the other
22    side infringes upon the four points of the agreement and engages in
23    material infringement.
24            The decision of the UN Security Council meant an agreement between
25    the Serbian side and the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the agreement

 1    which was subsequently signed was signed by General Mladic, on behalf of
 2    the Supreme Command of the army of Republika Srpska, and General Sefer
 3    Halilovic, in the name of the BH army.
 4            The first agreement was signed in April 1993, the second agreement
 5    was signed on the 8th of May, 1993, and the two contractual parties agreed
 6    that any military or paramilitary units must withdraw from the
 7    demilitarised zone and must surrender its weapons, munition mines,
 8    explosives, and all other lethal weapons.
 9            The second point of that agreement stipulated as follows:  "No
10    fighter will be allowed to have in his possession weapons, munition,
11    explosives, if he wishes to enter the demilitarised zone or finds himself
12    in it.  The only exceptions are the representatives of UNPROFOR."  It was
13    also provided that soldiers would not be allowed to enter the
14    demilitarised zone or to spend any time in it.
15            The Serb side behaved in conformity with the agreement.  The same
16    day that the agreement was signed, the Chief of Staff of the Main Staff of
17    the VRS, General Manojlo Milovanovic, sent to the command of the Drina
18    Corps an order, issued an order, which was wholly binding that everything
19    should evolve in conformity with the agreement, without any violation of
20    the stipulations of the agreement.
21            In presenting its evidence during the trial, the Defence showed a
22    number of documents that were adopted into evidence by this Trial Chamber,
23    and the documents range from D28 to D71, from which it is clearly
24    visible -- from which the following can be clearly deduced: that within
25    the safe area, there was a military establishment, an armed one, which

 1    numbered, depending on the source, from between seven to ten members [as
 2    interpreted].  First of all, they were the 8th Operative Group and later
 3    on they became the 28th Division.
 4            THE INTERPRETER:  7.000 to 10.000 members, I apologise.
 5            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] That the members of the 8th
 6    Operative Group or, rather, the 28th Division were systematically armed by
 7    their superior commands, the 2nd Corps of the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
 8    to which we have heard testimony by Generals Hadzihasanovic and
 9    Halilovic.
10            Furthermore, the Muslim forces from the enclave around Srebrenica
11    and Zepa stepped outside the enclave and went in depth into the territory
12    under the control of the VRS and the Drina Corps, where they carried out
13    sabotage and diversionary action and where they affected the same
14    operations towards the civilian population as they did towards the members
15    of the army.
16            Furthermore, another characteristic of all this evidence and
17    material is that the members of UNPROFOR did not prevent them in doing so,
18    or we do not have certain proof about that.  We do not have anything to
19    show that they disarmed them either, which was one of their tasks and
20    duties.
21            Following orders that the command of the 8th Operative Group or
22    28th Division received from their commander in Tuzla, it was clear that it
23    was their intention to inflict on the enemy a loss of manpower and to
24    conjoin in the north and northwest, towards the units of the 2nd Corps of
25    the BH army.  And in June of 1995, this became an all-out offensive.  So

 1    that on the one hand, the offensive was launched from the axis of
 2    Sarajevo, with the aim of deblocking Sarajevo and linking it up to
 3    Srebrenica and Zepa, and to draw away the forces of the Drina Corps units
 4    from the area; and on the other hand, from the axis and direction of the
 5    2nd Corps, an attack on the Birac Brigade, once again with the intention
 6    of linking up with the enclaves or, rather, the enclaves with the
 7    territory that was under the command of the 2nd Corps.
 8            It has already been stated that Defence Exhibits D28 through to
 9    D71, including D90, D91, and D92, indicated the clear cut intention of the
10    Muslim armed establishment and their synchronised action in order to link
11    up the units of the 2nd Corps with the units of the 28th Division.
12            On the other hand, the army of Republika Srpska and the Drina
13    Corps, at this period of time and particularly in June 1995, was on the
14    defensive, and the testimony of Mr. Butler testifies to this.
15            The Muslims forces from the demilitarised zone reached the
16    culmination of their operations towards the Drina Corps and in the depth
17    of the Drina Corps, and this culmination was attained in June 1995.  It
18    came to a head.
19            As an example, on the 26th of June, and this was -- evidence of
20    this was provided, the Muslim units sent nine sabotage diversionary
21    terrorist groups to behind the positions of the Drina Corps and set fire
22    to the village of Visnjica.  And in the combat report dated the 28th of
23    June, the 285th Eastern Bosnian Light Brigade sent to the command of the
24    28th Division and the command of the 2nd Corps -- it states that these
25    brigades in the rear of the Drina Corps had infiltrated nine terrorist

 1    groups who had killed 40 Chetniks.  The term "Chetnik" was the term that
 2    Muslims referred to the Serb soldiers and civilians by.
 3            I don't need to state that this behaviour on the part of the
 4    Muslim army was in complete opposition to the agreement on
 5    demilitarisation and gave the army of Republika Srpska the legitimate
 6    right, in view of the fact that UNPROFOR failed to act, to prevent any
 7    further losses to its army and attacks on its civilian population outside
 8    the enclave.
 9            Now, briefly I should like to talk about the Krivaja 95
10    operation.  This operation was effected by the auxiliary forces of the
11    Drina Corps; Prosecution Exhibit OTP 427 and 428.  And this was done
12    between the 6th of July up until the 11th of July, 1995.  We arrive at
13    these facts when we compare documents OTP 427, the preparatory order, and
14    428, the order for active military engagement.  Both documents are dated
15    the 2nd of July.
16            The first time that the officers from the command of the Drina
17    Corps appeared on the scene was noted and recorded at around the 30th of
18    June, and Mr. Butler testified about that, and it was in the area of
19    Bratunac.  A group of officers spent some time there, among them
20    General Radislav Krstic.  Regardless of whether this piece of information
21    is correct or not, we can consider with certainty that that particular
22    date, the 30th of June, was for a time when the process of planning for
23    Krivaja 95 began.  Until the order for the operation was issued, two days
24    went by.  With the issuance of the order, the planning process was
25    completed at that level of command.  The time that was left -- the time

 1    that remained for the implementation of the order for the corps commander
 2    was the 6th of July, and it is precisely that time where the subordinate
 3    commanders are given time to plan everything, to bring in the units, group
 4    the units, conduct additional reconnaissance, corrections of plans and
 5    decisions and things of that kind.
 6            So we can say that at the level of the corps, the planning of this
 7    operation could have lasted two days at the most.  If we start out from
 8    the fact that according to military doctrine which was in force with the
 9    VRS, the process of planning combat action at the level of the corps is
10    stipulated between five to seven days, we must conclude that Krivaja 95
11    was an operation which was planned speedily and as such was not planned in
12    all its details as is otherwise provided for by the provisions of military
13    doctrine.
14            This impression that the operation was not sufficiently well
15    thought out and the lack of time for its comprehensive planning, we're
16    able to say that on the basis of the fact that the plan for this operation
17    did not contain the series of operational acts and documents which would
18    otherwise be necessary and must accompany an operation of this kind.
19            When I talk about these documents, they are plans providing for
20    all types of security, for the engineers, for intelligence, for security,
21    plan of action for the artillery, for anti-aircraft defence, orders for
22    each operational and supporting activity for which separate -- a separate
23    plan is compiled and adopted.
24            None of these plans and orders were discovered except for the
25    preparatory order for active combat operations and the order for

 1    anti-aircraft defence, as well as a signals and communications plan.  It
 2    is our assumption that other plans, combat documents, and so on and so
 3    forth were not compiled at all, because the corps command started out
 4    from -- the corps command decided that the operation should be conducted
 5    as soon as possible, that it was limited in scope and target and that for
 6    its implementation, these kinds of documents were not absolutely
 7    necessary, the kind that were otherwise provided for by military
 8    doctrine.
 9            If we compare the preparation time and the time for the planning
10    of this operation at the level of the corps and the time that the corps
11    command allowed for planning at lower levels, we see that the operation
12    was planned at all levels in totality for four days.  The substantive
13    basic document on the basis of which Krivaja 95 operation was implemented
14    was the order on active combat.
15            The title of the document itself gives the same impression that I
16    described a moment ago, that it is -- this order for active combat was of
17    limited scope, and these combat operations for Srebrenica were not even
18    called an operation.  The term used was "Order for active combat or combat
19    activities."
20            Had the commander of the Drina Corps considered that it was combat
21    action of an operative type and not a tactical type, in his order he would
22    have called them attack operation, and then this document would bear the
23    title of "Order for attack operations."  Therefore, the commander
24    envisaged that these were tactical tasks with a -- of limited scope and
25    limited target.

 1            It is clear from this order which forces were engaged, which units
 2    were used, and which units participated in carrying out this order.  We
 3    may draw the conclusion that the planning and implementation of this
 4    operation was within the limits of a legitimate combat action.  Its
 5    legitimacy is based on the fact that it was launched against enemy forces,
 6    military forces which had launched action against the Drina Corps forces
 7    that suffered heavy losses, and the Muslim forces, without any form of
 8    camouflage, went counter to the demilitarised zone agreement and the
 9    United Nations Resolution 819 of April 1993, and that in their intentions
10    and operational goals, the Muslim army wanted to link up with members or,
11    rather, to link up, territorially speaking, with the army of the 2nd Corps
12    along the Tuzla and Kladanj axis on the one side and on the other to draw
13    away and engage the forces of the Drina Corps, because at that time, an
14    offensive was taking place to deblock Sarajevo.  This deblocking of
15    Sarajevo and these intentions were subjects that General Halilovic
16    testified to.
17            Bearing in mind all this, and especially the attacks that
18    culminated in the course of the month of June 1995, we cannot at any event
19    take the directives that were mentioned here, Directive 7 and 7.1, be
20    taken as a basis for a planned operation, the planning of the operation
21    that was called Krivaja 95.
22            Had Directives D7 and D7.1 actually been a foundation for
23    implementing the Krivaja 95 operation, then far earlier, perhaps already
24    in March or April, May or June, the forces of the Drina Corps would have
25    acted upon that directive, because, objectively speaking, they were in a

 1    far better operative and tactical position then than they were at the end
 2    of June or beginning of July 1995.
 3            Even at the beginning of June 1995, an operation was carried out,
 4    again of a limited scope, at Zeleni Jadar, the aim being to push back the
 5    forces of the 28th Division within the boundaries of the safe area.
 6    Directive 7 and 7.1 existed then too, but action was not taken pursuant to
 7    it because that was not the aim of the operation, just as the
 8    Operation Krivaja 95 was not the basis for this operation, rather, the
 9    directive was not the basis for Operation 95.
10            The principal and only basis for the ad hoc planning and execution
11    of Operation Krivaja 95 was to continuously inflict losses on units of the
12    Drina Corps and the civilian population by members of the 28th Division,
13    which this operation climaxed, as I have said, in June 1995.
14            It should be noted that according to some data of UN Observers and
15    the Dutch Battalion, there were artillery operations which went beyond the
16    level of operative requirements and effective achievement of military
17    goals as part of an offensive, and they even violated the principle of
18    military proportionality.
19            However, as regards the losses and casualties among Muslim
20    civilians and soldiers, and particularly taking into consideration the
21    level of destruction of Srebrenica, the Defence would like to submit that
22    the operation was of limited scope and the use of these resources was
23    limited.
24            According to the reports of the Chief of Staff of the 28th
25    Division, dated the 6th of July, 1995, it is not possible to infer that

 1    there were losses among civilians and the military, nor that there were
 2    large-scale destructions of civilian installations in the urban part of
 3    Srebrenica.
 4            Had such artillery devices been used to such an extent and had
 5    they been used against other targets than military ones, up to the 11th of
 6    July, there would have been far, far, far more victims; though we do not
 7    have reliable data to show that in active combat operations from the 6th
 8    to the 11th of July, the forces of the army of Republika Srpska or the
 9    Drina Corps had inflicted casualties on the enemy forces and particularly
10    not against the civilians.  I underline once again:  Had artillery been
11    used to the extent alleged, then the destruction of facilities in
12    Srebrenica and around it would have been disastrous.  However, the
13    numerous video clips that we saw during these proceedings provided no
14    evidence of such large-scale destruction.
15            This may not be of great importance, but it should be noted that
16    when the effectives of the Drina Corps reached the positions ordered,
17    according to the order on combat operations, there was chaos within the
18    28th Division, and its commander, in those days, Chief of Staff, Ramiz
19    Becirevic, was in command of the forces of the 28th Division.
20            We know that Naser Oric was the person who was the legitimate
21    commander of that military formation in Srebrenica; however, for certain
22    reasons, he had abandoned the area far before the operation took place so
23    that there is a great deal of speculation about this.  As I have said,
24    this may not be of importance for this case or for this defence, but we
25    have heard testimony from General Halilovic about that too.  There could

 1    have been a realistic -- realistically, it may have been possible to
 2    defend Srebrenica, but that is not relevant now.
 3            It should be noted in this context that it has been registered in
 4    the record, on pages 9479 to 9484, when a film was shown by the Defence in
 5    which the Muslims of Srebrenica and, in the first place, the commander of
 6    the police station, Mr. Meholjic, says that Srebrenica has been a sellout,
 7    that Srebrenica was a sellout, and this was an arrangement made at the
 8    highest state level of his country, when he charges Alija Izetbegovic and
 9    other high-level civilian and military officials for this.
10            As I am saying, this can be no justification for everything that
11    happened after the fall of Srebrenica, but it can be an indication, it can
12    be a clue, showing that all this was planned who knows where and who knows
13    by whom.  God knows whether Mr. Meholjic and his story are true.  Finally,
14    his conclusion is, "Only Alija and Naser know what their arrangement was
15    that night when they were left alone."
16            Simultaneously with these developments and the combat operations
17    towards the very end of Operation Krivaja 95, the President of Republika
18    Srpska, Radovan Karadzic, and the Supreme Command of Republika Srpska
19    decided that the forces of the Drina Corps should enter Srebrenica.  This
20    goal was achieved on the 11th of July, 1995, in the afternoon.  By doing
21    so, the Srebrenica operation was over.  I say that it was completed
22    because the goal set by the combat order to the Drina Corps Command by its
23    commander was to narrow down the enclave to the urban area and not to
24    capture Srebrenica.
25            This operative goal, a decision to change that operative goal was

 1    made at some higher level.  It should be said that the forces of the Drina
 2    Corps and the command of the Drina Corps, when entering Srebrenica --
 3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me, Mr. Petrusic, for
 4    interrupting you, but perhaps now would be a convenient time for a break.
 5    Would that suit you?
 6            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I'm afraid I lost track of the

14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Mr. President.
15            When talking about important figures, officers of the army of
16    Republika Srpska and the Drina Corps and their role in Operation
17    Krivaja 95, the Defence has the following to say:  It is quite clear that
18    General Krstic was the chief of staff of the Drina Corps and that in that
19    position, he was responsible for planning that operation, having received
20    the appropriate order to do so, to prepare it, to draft a decision for the
21    corps commander regarding the deployment of forces that would be used in
22    the operation and to subordinate units for bringing additional units to
23    the area of deployment and the like.
24            The planning documents for this operation do not include a single
25    document, nor in the combat order is there a single paragraph which could

 1    lead to the conclusion or from which it could be inferred that
 2    General Krstic, working on the basis of this order, violated the
 3    conventions of international humanitarian law or that he overstepped his
 4    competencies as prescribed by positive regulations.
 5            While the operation itself was ongoing, General Krstic did not
 6    make a single new proposal whereby the earlier decision taken by the Drina
 7    Corps Commander would be directed or changed as to the way in which the
 8    operation should be carried out or what its goals were to be.  The whole
 9    operation was developed according to plan and as envisaged by the order
10    for combat operations.
11            True, had there been any deviation from the decision contained in
12    the combat order, that is, had the forces of the -- it is true that the
13    forces of the Drina Corps entered Srebrenica, but this was not something
14    that was decided by Krstic at the forward command post, because as of the
15    9th of July, his immediate superior was there, that is General Zivanovic,
16    and his second superior, the Chief of Staff of the Main Staff,
17    General Mladic.
18            With respect to General Milenko Zivanovic, at the time of the
19    planning, preparation, implementation, and monitoring of Operation
20    Krivaja 95, he was the formal and factual Commander of the Drina Corps.
21    It was his responsibility to set out the main concept of the operation, to
22    instruct the corps staff, which was headed by General Krstic, to plan this
23    operation, and in doing so, he proposed the engagement of forces that were
24    necessary for this operation and how it should be carried out.
25            General Zivanovic issued two fundamental documents for the

 1    Operation Krivaja 95, and those are for the order for active combat
 2    operation, and before that, the preparatory order number one.  These are
 3    OTP Exhibits 427 and 428.
 4            It can be unequivocally alleged, on the basis of this, that during
 5    the planning, preparation, and execution of Operation Krivaja 95,
 6    General Zivanovic had the role of Commander in the Drina Corps, that he
 7    was the Commander of the Drina Corps, and that he remained in that
 8    position, according to the Prosecution until the 13th, and according to
 9    the Defence until the 20th of July.  There is no trace or indication to
10    show that General Zivanovic was absent from the area of responsibility of
11    the Drina Corps after the 11th of July or that he was replaced by the
12    Chief of Staff, General Krstic.
13            The Commander of the Main Staff of the army of Republika Srpska,
14    General Ratko Mladic, as the most superior commanding officer, appeared at
15    the forward command post at Pribicevac on the 9th of July, 1995, together
16    with General Zivanovic.  He was also there on the 10th of July, and
17    without any doubt, on the 11th of July, together with other members of the
18    Drina Corps, both General Zivanovic and General Krstic, and together with
19    them, he entered Srebrenica.
20            No one can deny the legitimate right of the Commander of the Main
21    Staff, General Mladic, to be present where combat operations were ongoing,
22    to give suggestions to the commander as to how and in what way a certain
23    order should be implemented and carried out, to make certain corrections
24    of any decisions, and even to issue orders to the commander as to how he
25    should act.

 1            However, in view of the situation as it was on the 9th, 10th, and
 2    11th of July, it is quite obvious that Mladic took over command of the
 3    units that were taking part in Operation Krivaja 95.
 4            The testimony of Witness DB clearly speaks in support of this
 5    assertion.  General Krstic also testified that General Mladic took over
 6    the command of the units participating in the offensive.  Both testimonies
 7    were convincingly corroborated by certain details; namely, Witness DB as
 8    well as General Krstic gave as an example the situation when Colonel
 9    Andric, who led parts of the Birac Brigade in that operation, informed
10    that he had reached the position assigned to him by the active combat
11    order, that General Mladic ordered him to continue the attack and to enter
12    Srebrenica.  This example of General Mladic issuing commands over the
13    radio was also referred to by Witness DC.
14            After units of the Drina Corps had entered Srebrenica, on the
15    video clip that we saw here repeatedly, in the submission of the Defence,
16    when Mladic said, "Go ahead, go ahead, on to Potocari," this is also a
17    statement that is an order.  So it shows that he was the alpha and omega
18    of everything that was going on in that area.  He was the alpha and omega
19    to subordinate commanders and subordinate units.  Neither Zivanovic nor
20    Krstic, quite clearly, were in command at that time.
21            Mr. President, Your Honours, this did not break the chain of
22    command of the Drina Corps de jure.  He did not, in the legal sense, take
23    a decision or issue an order orally or in writing, and he did not say,
24    "From now on, I am the commander of the Drina Corps."  No, that is not
25    the submission of the Defence.  What the Defence wishes to say is that by

 1    his behaviour, by his verbal addresses to subordinate units and his oral
 2    orders, General Mladic in fact took over command of the forces that were,
 3    at that point in time, there in the area.  Some later events linked to the
 4    17th of July provide corroboration for this submission.
 5            In the area of the Zvornik Brigade, which should have been under
 6    the control and command of the Drina Corps, it was General Mladic who
 7    appointed an officer of the Main Staff as the Commander-in-Chief in that
 8    brigade, and by doing so, in the submission of the Defence, he was
 9    actually the one who was also in command of the Zvornik Brigade; of
10    course, through an officer that he had designated to be the commander, and
11    that is Lieutenant Colonel Keserovic.
12            In this order, Exhibit 649, it says, "To command all these forces
13    and for the execution of this task, the officer for the military police
14    from the administration of the Main Staff of Republika Srpska army is
15    being appointed."  General Mladic also says that the command over combat
16    operations will be performed from the command post of the battalion of the
17    military police of the 65th Protective Regiment.  The military police of
18    the 65th Protective Regiment is, without any doubt, a unit of the Main
19    Staff.  It is headquartered in Nova Kasaba.
20            Had the commander of the Zvornik Brigade been the real commander
21    of his brigade at that point in time, then he would have been commanding
22    from his own command post or forward command post.  However, it is General
23    Mladic who takes upon himself the right to deal with things in the way he
24    sees fit, and he does so through this order.
25            The assertion by the Prosecution, and I shall agree in part, that

 1    this was an operation which was of limited scope between the 17th and the
 2    19th of July, it was materialised, if I could put it that way, or
 3    formalised through this act and in such a way.  We do not know, except for
 4    the testimony of General Krstic himself - and the Defence has reason to
 5    believe his testimony on that point - when General Mladic, at the meeting
 6    in Bratunac, said that he takes over command in that region, but I'll come
 7    back to that question a little later on.
 8            However, pursuant to this order in which, quite obviously, the
 9    units of the 65th Protection Regiment and the Commander-in-Chief was the
10    security officer, states that the operation was of limited scope from the
11    17th to the 19th of July, that is, that it had a limited time span.
12    However, the sentence after that paragraph reads that "The order for
13    further involvement towards Cerska will be proposed to me by Colonel
14    Keserovic on the 19th of July, 1995."
15            We do not know and have no proof and evidence in written form that
16    such an order was made.  But Mladic quite obviously has demonstrated his
17    intention that if that command status of Lieutenant Colonel Keserovic were
18    to continue after the 19th of July, without us having any proof of that,
19    then I raise the question as to why that command status, without any proof
20    and evidence in the form of an order, could not have existed even after
21    the 11th, after Mladic's words were spoken in Bratunac, that that was his
22    problem and that he would solve it.
23            When General Mladic made the decision for entry into Srebrenica,
24    the command of the Drina Corps quite certainly did not decide that issue,
25    regardless of whether it was Zivanovic, Krstic -- Zivanovic or Krstic.

 1            On the basis of OTP Exhibit 432, we can see that the document is
 2    from the Main Staff of the army of Republika Srpska.  It was given to the
 3    president of Republika Srpska, addressed to him, and sent to the forward
 4    command post of the Drina Corps, to General Gvero and General Krstic
 5    personally.  General Gvero was not at the forward command post at the
 6    time.
 7            From this document, we clearly see that agreement has been reached
 8    about the entrance into Srebrenica, but that agreement and who was sending
 9    out this document and to whom it was sent, so to the president of the
10    republic, to the Main Staff, that agreement has been reached at that
11    particular level, the level of the president of the republic and the
12    Supreme Commander, or in other words, the Main Staff and certainly not the
13    Drina Corps.
14            Let me briefly dwell on that meeting of the 11th of July, which
15    took place in the evening hours at around 2100 hours in the Bratunac
16    Brigade.  The meeting was chaired by General Mladic.  Attending the
17    meeting were, in addition to Mladic himself, General Zivanovic and Krstic,
18    the Commanders of the units which took part in the attack on Srebrenica.
19            According to testimonies, after a short speech pertaining to the
20    events surrounding the entrance into Srebrenica, General Mladic ordered
21    General Krstic to prepare and put into operation the Zepa operation.
22    That, therefore, took place on the evening of the 11th of July.
23            The Prosecution has attempted to state that that assertion is not
24    correct and that it was on the 11th of July, and in that light -- that it
25    was not on that date, and in that light, the expert witness Mr. Butler

 1    says nothing on the issue, just as if the event had never taken place.
 2            Not only did Mladic issue this order to Krstic, that is to say,
 3    mentioning the forces that took place at the Srebrenica operation and to
 4    send them to Zepa, but General Mladic also issued an order to another
 5    officer, the signals and communications commander who is directly
 6    subordinate to General Krstic and was an officer on his staff.  The order
 7    that he issued to that individual at that meeting was that he should set
 8    up a forward command post and a communications centre at Zepa.
 9            Witness DB, on page 7089 of the transcript, states the following:
10    "Mladic told Krstic that a plan should be devised straight away and the
11    units which had taken part at Srebrenica be transferred to Zepa."
12            He goes on to say that following this order of Mladic's, the
13    commander of the Zvornik Brigade, Pandurevic reacted, and he said that
14    that was not a good idea because they didn't know what had happened to the
15    28th Division and that the situation ought to be cleared up first and only
16    then engage in a new operation.
17            According to further testimony of DB, and this is found on page
18    7091 and I quote, Witness DB says:  "I cannot quote or paraphrase, but
19    generally interpreted, 'Regardless of that, everybody to Zepa.'"
20            When he says "regardless of that" -- when he says "regardless,"
21    he's thinking of Pandurevic's operation.  So regardless of Pandurevic's
22    opposition, the combat action on Zepa should be continued.  Therefore, on
23    the 11th of July, Mladic was stating his decision to General Krstic and
24    telling him to prepare and launch the Zepa operation.
25            Furthermore, Witness DB goes on to say, on page 7092, the

 1    following with respect to that situation:  "I think that Mladic had his
 2    own assessment of the situation on the basis of which he made the
 3    decision."
 4            So his own assessment was not to accept the proposal made by
 5    Pandurevic when he said that he didn't know what had happened with the
 6    28th Division and that that situation ought to be settled first, and then
 7    once that had been done, to go on to the next operation.
 8            No plan, no activities whatsoever at that meeting which was
 9    attended by General Krstic himself and the other officers who had
10    participated in the operations at Srebrenica were received.  No plan was
11    put forward.  They were -- received no assignments with respect to the
12    newly arisen situation in Potocari.
13            A meeting with the representatives of the Dutch Battalion, the
14    first meeting that was held before this particular meeting, was attended
15    by General Mladic, a certain Colonel Jankovic, and General Zivanovic.  It
16    was at that meeting that General Mladic, together with General -- I'm
17    sorry, the Colonel of the Dutch Battalion, Karremans, talked to -- talked
18    about the withdrawal of the Dutch Battalion, of the fact that the Muslim
19    population were to be got out, the participation of the Doctors Without
20    Frontiers organisation, as a non-government organisation, an undertaking
21    in the enclave.  And in fact, Mladic, on that occasion addressed Karremans
22    and asked him whether via the chief of staff of UNPROFOR in Sarajevo they
23    could ensure buses for the transport of civilians from Srebrenica, and
24    Karremans answered that they could reach an agreement about that.
25            Therefore, the question of that humanitarian problem that arose,

 1    and at the meeting at which General Krstic was not present was the first
 2    time that this topic was broached.
 3            We know full well how the meetings evolved.  We also know that the
 4    participants in these meetings, regardless of whether they were
 5    representatives of the civilian or military authorities of the Drina
 6    Corps, all of them except General Mladic were just mere observers.  Nobody
 7    took part in the proceedings; whether because they did not want to or did
 8    not dare to is left to surmise and conjecture.
 9            General Zivanovic, though, as a participant at that first meeting,
10    and quite obviously the problem was ensuring the means and resources for
11    the transport of the civilian population towards Kladanj on territory
12    under command of the BH army, therefore, General Zivanovic, the following
13    day, that is to say, on the 12th of July, issued an order to his
14    subordinate units to secure buses up until sometime in the afternoon on
15    the 12th of July, up to, I think, 1630, at the stadium in Bratunac, that
16    the buses were to be there by then.
17            The night between the 11th and 12th of July, in Potocari,
18    according to the testimony of witnesses appearing before this Trial
19    Chamber, evolved relatively peacefully.  It was a relatively calm night.
20    In the course of that particular night, no units were noticed belonging to
21    any army to upset the quiet night and to effect the refugees, which would
22    in any way be a violation of the humanitarian law.
23            The morning hours of the 12th of July, once again according to
24    testimony, the morning hours were quiet too, without incident.  What the
25    witnesses have been telling us here is that the night between the 12th and

 1    the 13th was a terrible one.
 2            From reports and testimonies by individual witnesses, members of
 3    the Dutch Battalion who followed the situation in the base itself and
 4    around the base and gained an impression of what, in fact, took place in
 5    that night between the 12th and the 13th, we arrive at the conclusion that
 6    the members - and we cannot identify them as being members of the Drina
 7    Corps - entered the base.
 8            One of the witnesses even said that he photographed nine bodies.
 9    A Prosecution witness, Bego Ademovic, testified and said that in the late
10    afternoon of the 12th of July, he himself saw these people, the people who
11    had entered the base and had killed 83 Muslims.  The Defence does not
12    challenge and cannot dispute the fact that that did not take place.
13    However, the question arises of the trustworthiness of the testimony of
14    Mr. Ademovic.  Regardless of the extent to which we respect him as having
15    been a victim, we nonetheless consider that such a large number of Muslims
16    who had been liquidated would have been noted, would have been seen and
17    noticed by a member of the Dutch Battalion, especially in view of the
18    manner in which the killings were performed.
19            We have General Krstic placed in Potocari on the 12th of July,
20    sometime after 12.00 noon, that is to say, after the meeting in Bratunac.
21    At that time when he was there, there was the tape that the members of
22    UNPROFOR had positioned.  Members of the opposite side, whether it was the
23    army or the police or civilians of Republika Srpska, they were not able to
24    cross that line that had been designated with the tape.
25            General Krstic stayed, and this is borne out by the testimony of a

 1    Prosecution witness that we heard in closed session, he stayed there for
 2    about one hour.  Together with him was his staff officer, who was
 3    responsible to him.  He was subordinate to General Krstic and responsible
 4    to him; he was the intelligence officer, Svetozar Kosoric.  After Krstic
 5    left towards Viogora, which is where the units were located, units of the
 6    Drina Corps which had taken part in the attack on Srebrenica because this
 7    was the position that they had reached and they had entrenched there,
 8    according to General Krstic, his staff officer went after him because he
 9    ordered him to come too, and that officer's name was Svetozar Kosoric.
10            It is a fact that in Potocari we now see the presence of
11    Lieutenant Colonel Vujadin Popovic as well.  He was there too.  However,
12    if we go back a bit to previous events, from the beginning of the combat
13    operation on Srebrenica, that is to say, the 6th of July or, rather, the
14    5th, in the afternoon, Svetozar Kosoric was together at the forward
15    command post with General Krstic, with Colonel Vicic, Major Jevdjevic, the
16    leader of the command, the staff command, Amovic.  So all these were staff
17    officers who were subordinate to General Krstic and to whom he was the
18    immediate commanding officer.
19            The fact is also that Lieutenant Colonel Vujadin Popovic, on the
20    11th -- was in Srebrenica on the 11th, at the entrance to Srebrenica, but
21    we don't see him at the forward command post of Pribecevac at all.
22    Vujadin Popovic was not there.
23            Now, who could have brought Vujadin Popovic there and given him
24    the order to be in Srebrenica on the 11th, 12th, maybe even later as
25    well?  It was his superior officer who could have done that, the first --

 1    first of all, the corps commander; and secondly, he could have been issued
 2    orders by virtue of the security chain of command, the assistant commander
 3    for security or, rather, the head of the security department.  At least
 4    based on the evidence put forward during the trial so far, neither Vujadin
 5    Popovic -- we did not see Vujadin Popovic at Pribicevac at all or in any
 6    way do we see his participation in that particular operation.
 7            Svetozar Kosoric was a participant at the meeting in the Fontana
 8    Hotel, together with representatives of the Dutch Battalion and the
 9    civilian authorities from Srebrenica and Bratunac, as well as the military
10    authorities from the Drina Corps, but there simply is no evidence
11    whatsoever to indicate any role whatsoever that that officer had or should
12    have had and be subordinate to the chief of staff, that is,
13    General Krstic.
14            Together with him, after the 11th, in the personnel structure of
15    the officer cadre taking part in the combat operations in Zepa, he is one
16    of them.  There's also Colonel Vicic as the Operations Officer;
17    Major Jevdjevic; the Commander of the headquarters, Amovic.
18            So if General Krstic was given the order for the planning and
19    execution of the Zepa operation, he and his team, if I may call it that,
20    consisting of those officers, their main concern and preoccupation was to
21    plan, prepare, and carry out that operation.
22            Consequently, with regard to these events that occurred on the
23    12th and 13th of the July, in the opinion of the Defence, General Krstic
24    cannot be responsible for three reasons.  First of all, as has been
25    stated, he was not the commander of the Drina Corps.  And even if he knew,

 1    and he did know, that process of evacuation of the population was about to
 2    begin and that this had been agreed at the Main Staff level or, rather,
 3    decided at the Main Staff level of the army of Republika Srpska with some
 4    participation of the Dutch Battalion and international forces, to what
 5    extent they participated is something we can't go into just now, but in
 6    any event, as he was not the commander, he did not know that in the
 7    execution of that operation, unlawful acts were being committed, and this
 8    applied to him and his subordinate officers.
 9            Furthermore, as the Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps, he had his
10    commander who was engaged in the area of responsibility of the corps and
11    who had still not handed over his command to anyone.  Krstic had no need
12    nor was it his duty to supervise, carry out -- or carry out that
13    operation.
14            The time when this operation was carried out or, rather, the time
15    of the events that took place between the 12th and the 13th, in the
16    afternoon on the 13th when the population was evacuated, this was a time
17    period which, in the submission of the Defence, Krstic was extremely busy,
18    both he and his staff, working on the preparations and execution of the
19    Zepa operation so that, in our opinion, he was not involved in any way in
20    the separation of men and the evacuation of the population from Potocari.
21            We cannot but challenge the submission of the Prosecution that
22    Krstic had in any way directly or indirectly, either he or his
23    subordinates, had participated in any way in the process of separation of
24    the male population in Potocari.
25            The time that General Krstic was there was just after 12.00, and

 1    on the video clip, buses can be seen in the background, but the actual
 2    evacuation and transport and boarding onto the buses had still not
 3    started.  At that time, that unfortunate column had still not been formed,
 4    the column that would set out along the road, after which men of a certain
 5    age group were separated.
 6            The video clip that we had occasion to see showing Zoran Petrovic,
 7    Pirocanac, we see the following:  In Potocari, there were no elements of
 8    the Drina Corps.  The police were present, a special MUP Brigade, but not
 9    the regular police of the Zvornik Security Centre.
10            On one of the shots, a certain member of that special unit was
11    identified, a person nicknamed Mane.  But that again is not Mane Djuric,
12    and I think the parties are agreed on that, who was the Deputy Chief of
13    the public security centre in Zvornik.
14            I feel free to allege that a representative of that special unit
15    is a certain man called Stalin, a Mr. Jevic, a personality which seems to
16    dominate and is in the forefront.
17            There is no evidence that Drina Corps units participated in this
18    process of separation or that they were present in Potocari.
19            Some witnesses whose testimonies we heard here, Prosecution
20    witnesses, said that that night, between the 12th and the 13th of July,
21    certain elements of the army of Republika Srpska were present, who were
22    described by them as soldiers with dogs.
23            In the structure of the Drina Corps, not a single unit had dogs
24    which it would use for any purpose whatsoever.  The only place - and this
25    was confirmed by Mr. Ruez in his testimony in this courtroom and he showed

 1    us photographs - the only place where any such unit was noted was in Nova
 2    Kasaba, and that is the location of the 65th Protective Brigade of the
 3    Police Battalion -- Protective Regiment of the Police Battalion, which is
 4    not linked to the Infantry Battalion of the 65th Protective Regiment which
 5    took part in the operation on Zepa.
 6            It is a fact, and we have elaborated on this in our final brief,
 7    that the capture of Muslims occurred mostly along the Konjevic Polje-Nova
 8    Kasaba road and the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road.  Those prisoners, in the
 9    submission of the Prosecution, were accommodated at the football stadium
10    in Nova Kasaba.  Various figures have been given as to the number of
11    people rounded up there, and we simply are unable to provide any evidence
12    to the contrary.  It is also a fact that most of those prisoners were
13    transported to Bratunac, and there, at various locations, either at the
14    Vuk Karadzic school or in the warehouse or in the buses and trucks, they
15    remained there during the night between the 13th and the 14th.
16            The Prosecution alleges that the town of Bratunac was in the area
17    of responsibility of the Bratunac Brigade and that it is the
18    responsibility of the Bratunac Brigade to put up to the prisoners in the
19    town or, rather, in the means of transportation that were being used.
20            Let me say, first of all, that the town of Bratunac and its
21    security is not the responsibility or was not the responsibility of the
22    army.  The army was at the front line.  It is the civilian authorities, on
23    the 13th of July, who were functioning in the whole town of Bratunac and
24    Republika Srpska.  The civilian police was able to perform its duties
25    unhindered in that area.

 1            If somebody was securing those men in the sense of making sure
 2    that they do not escape, then this certainly could not have been done by
 3    members of the Bratunac Brigade, firstly, because that is not within their
 4    competence and, secondly, because, on the 13th of July, members of the
 5    Bratunac Brigade had received an order from General Krstic to search the
 6    terrain south of the Konjevic Polje-Nova Kasaba road, and that road
 7    remains behind them and it is not within their area of responsibility.
 8    And for that reason, they could not have been in Bratunac in the night
 9    between the 13th and the 14th.
10            The Prosecution has not provided evidence to prove that members of
11    the MUP were under the command of the Drina Corps.  For them to be under
12    the command of the Drina Corps, an appropriate decision would have had to
13    be made at the level of the Minister of Internal Affairs; at least that is
14    what the laws and regulations say with respect to the police.  So the
15    minister of the police, in coordination with the minister of the army,
16    would have had the duty to regulate this matter, that is, the question of
17    attachment of units.  And had they been resubordinated, they could have
18    been resubordinated only to security organs of the Main Staff, because it
19    is at that level that the use and deployment of those units is decided.
20    So pursuing that logic, only a step -- the resubordination of those units
21    could be done only at that level.
22            During the proceedings at this trial, and also the analysis
23    provided by Mr. Butler gave the impression, in our submission, that
24    attempts are being made to draw the Bratunac Brigade into all these
25    developments.  There is no dispute that Zoran Kovacevic and Sreten

 1    Petrovic, who were members of the Bratunac Brigade, were seen in Potocari;
 2    at least there is no dispute as far as Zoran Kovacevic is concerned being
 3    the commander of one of the battalions of the Bratunac Brigade.  But his
 4    presence is on a personal basis, as an individual.  There is no organised
 5    element of the Bratunac Brigade at the level of a squad or platoon or
 6    battalion or any other formation that would indicate that those elements,
 7    as organised units, were present.
 8            Zoran Kovacevic could have been in Potocari for a thousand and one
 9    reasons.  First of all, he is an inhabitant of Bratunac.  He had spent
10    three years face to face with the enemy side there.  In the euphoria which
11    developed, everyone hastened to Potocari to share in the glory of victory,
12    and his presence could be attributed to any one of a multitude of reasons,
13    in the submission of the Defence, rather than as an officer of the
14    Bratunac Brigade who, by his acts, contributed, as the Prosecution puts
15    it, to the fulfilment of the plan which was adopted on the 11th of July.
16            The Prosecution tells us that every foot soldier knew of the
17    existence of the plan as to what should be done with those unfortunate
18    people.  Drazen Erdemovic, who testified in this Trial Chamber and who is
19    trusted with reason, stated that on the 16th of July, when he set off for
20    Zvornik and reached Zvornik together with his unit at Karakaj, that they
21    were not told where they were going.  This was on the 16th of July.  A
22    unit of this kind, which had been designated to take part in what it took
23    part in, a unit whose members were selected as being special, did not know
24    where they were going, as testified to by Erdemovic.
25            Can the submission of the Prosecution, therefore, stand that

 1    members of the Drina Corps participated in that bloody plan?  And who?
 2    When was that plan drawn up?  What evidence do we have that such a plan
 3    was adopted or that the Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps or even its
 4    Commander were informed of it, and that he was aware of it?
 5            Mladic's monologue, when addressing members of the Dutch Battalion
 6    and representatives of the Muslim civilian population that was repeated to
 7    survive or disappear, could that be an indication of such a plan?  In the
 8    submission of the Defence, no.  Mladic's verbal statements and
 9    intimidations cannot be equal to a plan and cannot, under any
10    circumstances, include other officers of the Drina Corps in the
11    implementation of the plan, which is one of the bases on which the
12    Prosecution is relying for its submissions.
13            Regardless of the -- my position regarding General Mladic,
14    nevertheless, the Defence submits that this was just stated rhetorically
15    as a means of intimidation.
16            Mr. President, Your Honours, with your permission, I would suggest
17    we adjourn for today and tomorrow morning I would complete my closing
18    arguments by the time of the break, after which my colleague Mr. Visnjic
19    will take over, as I had announced at the beginning.
20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well, Mr. Petrusic.  We are
21    going to adjourn for today, and tomorrow we will be resuming at 9.20 as
22    usual.
23                          --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at 3.00 p.m.,
24                          to be reconvened on Friday, the 29th day
25                          of June, 2001, at 9.20 a.m.
