 2                          [Status Conference]
 3                          [Open session]
 4                          [The accused entered court]
 5                          --- Upon commencing at 3.03 p.m.
 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  Will the registrar call the case, please.
 7            THE REGISTRAR:  Good afternoon, Your Honour.  This is case number
 8    IT-02-58-PT, the Prosecutor versus Ljubisa Beara.
 9            JUDGE BONOMY:  Can I take the appearances.
10            Who appears for the Prosecutor?
11            MS. ISSA:  May it please the Court.  Good afternoon, Your Honour.
12    It's Antoinette Issa on behalf of the Prosecution, along with my
13    colleague, Ms. Stewart.
14            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you, Ms. Issa.
15            For the Accused?
16            MR. OSTOJIC:  Good afternoon, Your Honour.  John Stojic on behalf
17    of the accused, Mr. Beara.
18            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you, Mr. Ostojic.  Now I can confirm that we
19    have one matter on hand at the moment and that is the proposed amendment
20    of the indictment.  I issued an order in that regard at the end of last
21    week.  I understand that Mr. Ostojic drew nothing to say on the matter,
22    and therefore when the Prosecution reply to me, I will be in a position to
23    deal with that, and I plan to deal with that fairly expeditiously.
24            Now, Ms. Issa, are there any issues that you wish to raise today?
25            MS. ISSA:  None today, Your Honour, thank you.

 1            JUDGE BONOMY:  Mr. Ostojic, any issues you wish to raise with me?
 2            MR. OSTOJIC:  None, Your Honour.
 3            JUDGE BONOMY:  Are there any matters that your client has drawn to
 4    your attention that you wish to address me on.
 5            MR. OSTOJIC:  None at this time, Your Honour.
 6            JUDGE BONOMY:  Thank you very much, Mr. Ostojic.
 7            Well, it seems to me that that concludes the business that we have
 8    to deal with at this Status Conference, except to fix the date of the next
 9    one.
10            Can I have some guidance on that, please?
11                          [Pre-trial Judge and the legal officer confer]
12            JUDGE BONOMY:  The deadline for the next Status Conference is the
13    15th of June.  That happens to be a Wednesday.  It's as good a day as any,
14    so we shall have the next Status Conference on Wednesday, the 15th of
15    June, at 3.00 p.m., unless you're advised to the contrary.
16            We are adjourned.
17                          --- Whereupon the Status Conference adjourned at
18                          3.08 p.m.
