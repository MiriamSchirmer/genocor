 2                          [Open session]
 3                          [The accused entered court]
 4                           --- Upon commencing at 9.07 a.m.
 5            JUDGE AGIUS:  Madam Registrar, call the case, please.
 6            THE REGISTRAR:  Good morning, Your Honours.  This is the case
 7    number IT-05-88-T, the Prosecutor versus Vujadin Popovic et al.
 8            JUDGE AGIUS:  I thank you so much, ma'am.  All the accused are
 9    here.  Mr. Meek is absent as per agreement.  So is Mr. Bourgon.  The rest
10    of the Defence teams are here.  The Prosecution teams, Mr. McCloskey,
11    Mr. Thayer, Mr. Vanderpuye.
12            All right.  Any problems with interpretation or with the monitors,
13    let us know, okay?
14            I think -- I see that the witness is not in the courtroom.  Are
15    there preliminaries that you would -- yes, Ms. Condon?
16            MS. CONDON:  Good morning, Your Honour, thank you.
17            JUDGE AGIUS:  One moment.  All right.  Yes, Ms. Condon.
18            MS. CONDON:  Thank you, Your Honour.  Can I first of all indicate
19    to the Court that the motion that I referred to yesterday evening has in
20    fact been filed this morning and a copy was -- a courtesy copy was
21    provided to the Court yesterday.  So I apologise for that.
22            JUDGE AGIUS:  I thank you for having provided our staff the
23    courtesy copy because it helped us prepare of course and enabled us to
24    come with a decision in due course this morning.
25            MS. CONDON:  Your Honour, the ballpark has changed somewhat this

 1    morning in terms of the witness Rutten is concerned from the Popovic
 2    perspective.  And that's because at 11.30 yesterday evening, we received a
 3    note of a proofing session in which the witness first of all was obviously
 4    shown the photo in question that is the subject of our motion, but also,
 5    and I'm just reading from the proofing note directly; what it says
 6    is:  "When he was asked what he meant when he testified that the man
 7    looked not like a plain soldier, he responded that the man clearly
 8    appeared to be in command and have authority."
 9            Now, in my submission, Your Honour, this is new evidence insofar
10    as the case against Mr. Popovic is concerned.  It is -- puts an entirely
11    different taint on what otherwise would be an identification which was
12    still obviously of significance to our case but combined with this
13    assessment, as to a position of power, in my submission, that places us at
14    a severe disadvantage in terms of being able to deal with this witness in
15    any proper form, either today or tomorrow, and I've already foreshadowed
16    that we certainly weren't in a position to deal with him immediately for
17    cross-examination.
18            The other aspect that in my submission it raises is that this is a
19    witness that surely should be examined in full rather than a 92 ter
20    witness which the Prosecution have made the application for him to be,
21    simply because this is evidence of sufficient significance insofar as our
22    case is concerned that it really doesn't warrant either procedure, 92 bis
23    or 92 ter.  And I also would indicate, and this is a matter that was
24    raised in the motion generally, in my submission, Your Honour, it's simply
25    unacceptable that the Prosecution would provide this information to us at

 1    11.30 prior to this witness giving evidence.  That is contrary to any
 2    principle of an accused having a fair trial, and I just have to register,
 3    certainly, my objection, because it is just unacceptable.  And I make this
 4    submission that this is simply too important for this witness to proceed
 5    today.  They are my submissions, Your Honour.
 6            JUDGE AGIUS:  I thank you so much, Ms. Condon.
 7            Who's is going to respond to that?  Mr. Thayer?
 8            MR. THAYER:  I will, Your Honour.
 9            JUDGE AGIUS:  You can stay where you are.  Unless there is an
10    objection, go ahead.
11            MR. THAYER:  Is this all right?
12            JUDGE KWON:  I'm fine with it.
13            JUDGE AGIUS:  Go ahead.
14            MR. THAYER:  Good morning, Your Honours.  The proofing notes
15    absolutely were sent out at that hour.  That is simply by virtue of the
16    fact that again this issue arose Sunday.  The witness at issue is full
17    time military duty.  He arrived in The Hague last evening at 8.30.  I was
18    sitting with him by 9.00.  By 10.00 we were done.  By 10.30 I'd finish
19    escorting him to the hotel, and by 11.00 these proofing notes were
20    disclosed in considerable detail to Defence counsel.  That was just the
21    hour that it got completed.  It's an unfortunate consequence of the way
22    this issue unfolded.
23            Now, with respect to the nature of the evidence, Your Honours,
24    this is perfectly consistent with the role that is, is alleged that the
25    accused Popovic has played throughout the indictment and throughout the

 1    pre-trial brief, notwithstanding the fact that it wasn't specifically
 2    mentioned as a particular act or conduct in either document.
 3            It is the Prosecution's position that this is evidence that is
 4    consistent with other evidence which the accused has been placed on notice
 5    about.  It is evidence that the Prosecution firmly believes can be
 6    adequately prepared for in time with this witness's appearance here at
 7    this time.  This is -- this is not surprise evidence in the nature of the
 8    evidence.  Obviously the notice is an issue but I believe that we've cured
 9    that.  The proofing notes that I had to provide last night were a natural
10    consequence of having to sit down and show this witness the photograph, as
11    my learned colleague has acknowledged, and it does not provide anything
12    substantively different from the testimony that is already in the Krstic
13    transcript.  I think the implication is clear when you read the transcript
14    when he says, "not a plain soldier," he's referring to somebody that
15    appears to be in command.  I asked him that specific question so it was a
16    clarified issue and I put that in the proofing notes.  There are other
17    material in the proofing notes - I won't burden the Court with the
18    details - but it's nothing that is substantially different from what's in
19    the Krstic testimony, what we have alleged his role to be throughout the
20    indictment and the pre-trial brief.  I would also add that to this day
21    this witness doesn't know the name of the individual he identified in the
22    photograph.
23            JUDGE AGIUS:  I thank you, Mr. Thayer.  Incidentally, let's do
24    some lateral thinking about all this.  Assuming for the time being, we
25    obviously haven't decided it as yet, but assuming that this witness will

 1    be a ter -- 92 ter witness, how long do you anticipate the additional in
 2    chief to last?
 3            MR. THAYER:  I think about 15 to 20 minutes, Your Honour.  It's a
 4    limited group of questions and frankly this photographic testimony will be
 5    two or three questions, max, itself.
 6            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.  Again, assuming that everything will go
 7    according to what would be scheduled, if all objections are turned down,
 8    which they aren't at the moment, Popovic Defence team, how much time do
 9    you reckon you would require with this witness?
10            MS. CONDON:  Your Honour, that is a difficult --
11            JUDGE AGIUS:  I know.
12            MS. CONDON:  -- question simply because there is the issue with
13    relation to the identification which would take a significant amount.  I
14    would say two hours to two and a half hours.
15            JUDGE AGIUS:  Two hours.
16            Beara team?
17            MR. OSTOJIC:  Your Honour, we join obviously the motion by our
18    colleague, and on principle I would say no cross-examination because it
19    comes at such a late hour.  However, if the Court and given the last few
20    weeks with the witnesses that you've given me some latitude on, at most it
21    would be 15 minutes.  But I truly believe that the Prosecution is trying
22    to bring witnesses in at the late hour and they should have their
23    evidence.  They should identify which witnesses are specifically against
24    which accused, as they have done in some instances, and I object to the
25    practice and it doesn't include me or involve me specifically or my

 1    client; however, I think the practice is specifically what I'm objecting
 2    to, Your Honour.
 3            JUDGE AGIUS:  All right.  Okay.  Thank you.  Nikolic Defence team?
 4            MS. NIKOLIC: [Interpretation] Good morning, Your Honour.  Defence
 5    of Mr. Nikolic will take no more than 20 minutes; however, we do endorse
 6    the submission of the Popovic Defence in the light of the submission of
 7    the Nikolic Defence.  This conversion of the witness statements really
 8    does constitute admission of new evidence.  Thank you very much.
 9            JUDGE AGIUS:  Mr. Lazarevic?
10            MR. LAZAREVIC:  Yes.  As for the cross-examination of Mr. Rutten
11    who is coming, I believe that we will have at least one and a half hours
12    for him and we would also like to back up Popovic Defence in their motion.
13            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.
14            MR. LAZAREVIC:  And further there is another issue raised
15    yesterday by Mrs. Fauveau, and I believe that she will address the Trial
16    Chamber regarding this, another issue, and it has to do with the
17    disclosure of some documentation related to Rutten, to Mr. Rutten, which
18    is in Dutch and which we still haven't received any --
19            JUDGE AGIUS:  It was raised yesterday.
20            MR. LAZAREVIC:  Okay.
21            JUDGE AGIUS:  That is indeed a problem.
22            Madam Fauveau, first, how much time you require for
23    cross-examination, please?
24            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Mr. President, 30 to 45 minutes.  As
25    to the problem raised yesterday, I would like to say that all the Defence

 1    teams have joined my application.  I would also like to react to what the
 2    Prosecutor said.  He said that we could cross-examine as to certain topics
 3    and that the witness could be brought back for further examination as to
 4    items covered by this.  But we don't know what is in the statement and if
 5    we start cross-examining a witness today, to continue later on, that would
 6    be a waste of time and I don't think it is very useful.  Thank you.
 7            JUDGE AGIUS:  You also have been told by Mr. Thayer that it is
 8    a -- practically repetition of what is contained in the other statement
 9    but in any case, I haven't been able, like you to read it at all because
10    it's in Dutch.
11            Mr. Josse or Mr. Krgovic?
12            MR. JOSSE:  Approximately 30 minutes.
13            JUDGE AGIUS:  And Mr. Haynes or Mr. Sarapa?
14            MR. HAYNES:  20 to 30 minutes and we stand foursquare with
15    Ms. Condon.
16            JUDGE AGIUS:  So we have five hours 30 minutes estimated cross
17    examination of this witness.  Plus 30 minutes or 20 minutes.  So actually
18    estimated six hours.
19            Now, we have three hours 30 minutes tomorrow, and we still have

20    this witness for another hour, hour and a half, at least.  So that would
21    leave us with about two hours today.  We can make it.  We can make it.
22    Technically, because of course we have to discuss the issue raised by
23    Ms. Condon and also the issue raised by Madam Fauveau.  We'll come to that
24    back to you, we'll come back to you on that later on after the first
25    break.
 1            Okay.  Any further preliminaries?
 2            I think we can bring the witness in, please.
 3                          [The witness entered court]
 4                          WITNESS:  WITNESS PW-131 [Resumed]
 5                          [Witness answered through interpreter].
 6            JUDGE AGIUS:  Good morning to you, sir, and welcome back.
 7            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Good morning.
 8            JUDGE AGIUS:  We are going to continue and finish with the
 9    cross-examinations.  So yesterday we had finished with the Nikolic team,
10    Defence team, examination.  Now it's the Borovcanin turn, Borovcanin's
11    team's turn to cross-examine you.  Mr. Lazarevic is lead council.  Go
12    ahead Mr. Lazarevic.  We are in open session.  Any time we need to be in
13    private session, please let us know.
14            MR. LAZAREVIC:  Yes, thank you, Your Honour, and I'll have it in
15    mind all the time.
16                          Cross-examination by Mr. Lazarevic:
17       Q.   [Interpretation] Good morning, Witness.
18       A.   Good morning.
19       Q.   Let us not repeat some of the mistakes that we committed
20    yesterday.  Please make a pause after the -- I finish my question before
21    providing your answer so that everything goes into the transcript and the
22    transcript is clear and unambiguous.
23            During these proceedings, we've had occasion to see a number of
24    notebooks and intercepts, as we call them here, and we saw certain
25    markings of these notebooks, type 21, 22, 23 or 21/1, 2, et cetera.  My

 1    question would be:  Were you the one who ascribed numbers to those
 2    notebooks or was this done in the platoons?
 3       A.   I cannot really specify, but I believe that we took a
 4    chronological order of numbers.  At the time when we handed them over to
 5    the ICTY, it was a strictly confidential notebook number 1, strictly
 6    confidential notebook number 2, et cetera, et cetera, and this is how we
 7    marked them.
 8       Q.   Thank you.  Could you tell us that these markings were put before
 9    handing them over to the ICTY or in the -- or in 1995?  Did I understand
10    you correctly?
11       A.   I believe that these markings were done in the period when we were
12    supposed to hand them over to the ICTY, if we are talking about the same
13    markings, the same numbers.
14       Q.   I presume that this is the case.  During your testimony, you
15    mentioned the term Paket service or Paket communication service.  Do you
16    remember that?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   Since we are laymen, we do not understand this very much, could
19    you understand -- could you explain what this is?
20       A.   From the north and south facility, we did not have the same
21    technical possibilities and capabilities in both cases.  From the north,
22    we had a wired connection and radio communication.  With the southern
23    facility, we had only Paket radio service, which means that the reports
24    that had been collated at such facilities were coded, packaged and sent
25    through the ether to the command post.
 1       Q.   Paket radio communication is a computer-protected information that
 2    is sent over the radio waves.  Would this be in laymen's terms what you
 3    said?
 4       A.   This is nothing laymen's about it.  You put it very well.
 5       Q.   Thank you very much.
 6            We have a piece of information examined by this Tribunal that
 7    towards the end of 1993, such a Paket radio communication was established
 8    between the 28th Brigade in Srebrenica and the command of the 2nd Corps in
 9    Tuzla.  Well, now, for me to provide the grounds for this question, I
10    presume that you know which the 28th Brigade is.  It was in Srebrenica; is
11    that correct?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   It was part of the 2nd Corps, which was headquartered in Tuzla and
14    which you were part of?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   Now, I'd like to ask you given that you were in the 2nd company --
17            MR. LAZAREVIC:  Perhaps we should move into private session.
18            JUDGE AGIUS:  Let's do that.

10                          [Open session]
11            JUDGE AGIUS:  We are in open session.
12            MR. LAZAREVIC: [Interpretation].
13       Q.   We can now turn to a different topic.  In response to the
14    questions put to you by John Ostojic yesterday about what you said in your
15    examination-in-chief, you said that in relation to certain persons, there
16    existed already dossiers in which you wrote some of their features, their
17    voices, and some of their personal features.  Do you remember that?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   And I suppose that that was done on the basis of long term work
20    and a large number of intercepts, that that was used to compile a dossier,
21    right?
22       A.   Yes.  That's correct.  I came to this unit in February of 1995 and
23    there already existed a certain database for certain persons.
24       Q.   The fact that many operations officers there heard the same voice
25    several times was also used as a basis for identifying the person whose
 1    voice they heard, right?
 2       A.   No.  Operations officers wrote down names and last names of
 3    persons who either used a code name or directly identified themselves, and
 4    you can see, if you go through the transcripts, wherever they were not
 5    sure of the identity of the person, they would denote that person either
 6    with an X or a Y.
 7       Q.   I'm interested in this:  If an operator heard some voice for the
 8    first time, a voice not heard before, could such an operator be able to
 9    identify that person?
10       A.   I personally don't think so, but he could always write that he
11    supposed that the identity was such and such.
12       Q.   There are situations in which certain assumptions of operators
13    were recorded, as you said, but that does not necessarily imply that they
14    were correct?
15       A.   Assumptions were confirmed at a higher level.  They did not
16    necessarily need to be correct, but were taken at face value, so that was
17    one of the positions taken.
18       Q.   When you said "at a higher level," what would that higher level
19    be?  Could you be more specific?
20       A.   I said yesterday that the data gathering is quite a broad process.
21    Intercepts are just one aspect of it.  It was our duty to provide the data
22    that we possessed in that field, and then data were collected from other
23    fields as well.  And all of that went to the intelligence department of
24    the command of the 2nd Corps.
25       Q.   To simplify, so the higher level that you spoke of was the
 1    intelligence organ of the 2nd Corps, correct?
 2       A.   Yes, in terms of my unit, that was the higher level.
 3       Q.   All right.  Just a few more things to conclude:  You served in the
 4    JNA.  You worked for many years on this type of work.  Are you familiar
 5    with the term "operations masking"?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   You became familiar with it back when you were with the JNA,
 8    correct?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   Can you tell the Chamber what that term denotes?
11       A.   Simply speaking, it means that by pronouncing certain phrases and
12    using certain expressions, you are masking the situation on the ground in
13    order to mislead enemy units.
14       Q.   Thank you very much.  I have no further questions for you.
15            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you.  It's Madam Fauveau now, who is defending
16    General Miletic, who will be cross-examining you.  How much time do you
17    require, Madam Fauveau?
18            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] I'll try to finish by the break,
19    Mr. President.
20            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you.
21                          Cross-examination by Ms. Fauveau:
22            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could we move to private session,
23    Mr. President?
24            JUDGE AGIUS:  Yes, let's do that.

20            JUDGE AGIUS:  But what do you mean to say by if the document is
21    not shown to the witness?  Because that's what I have in the transcript.
22    You mean to say if it is not broadcast, if it's shown to the witness only
23    but not outside this courtroom?  All right.  Okay.  So we understood.
24            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation].
25       Q.   Sir, is it right to say that in paragraph 2, or, rather, tell us
 1    first, do you recognise this document?
 2       A.   I think I do.
 3       Q.   Is this an order that you gave on the 22nd of June 1995?
 4       A.   Right now, I can't tell you exactly.  As I told you, there were
 5    many such orders.  Based on what I can read here, I can conclude that this
 6    is a squad or a section which was established pursuant to the order of the
 7    command of the 2nd Corps and at that time they were attached and they
 8    worked pursuant to the directives of the 2nd Corps command.  If I remember
 9    correctly.
10       Q.   Sir, isn't it an order that you gave to your unit that was
11    stationed in the south, according to which you asked them to follow --
12            JUDGE AGIUS:  One moment, Mr. Thayer?
13            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Mr. Vanderpuye.
14            JUDGE AGIUS:  Mr. Vanderpuye, yeah.
15            MR. VANDERPUYE:  I guess the nature of the objection is,
16    Mr. President, that if it is counsel's position that this is an order that
17    the witness gave and it's reflected in the document, perhaps the entire
18    document should be shown to the witness.  Maybe there is a signature or
19    some other indication on it.
20            JUDGE AGIUS:  I think we go by your objection and I think
21    Madam Fauveau would concur with that, too.  I think we need to show the
22    witness the entire document to give him the opportunity to be able to give
23    a more comprehensive answer or more reasoned answer.
24            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] I believe that we should show the
25    document on page 2.

 1            JUDGE AGIUS:  Yes.  I think we've seen enough.  Madam Fauveau, you
 2    may proceed with your question, either repeating it or whatever.
 3            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could we go back to page 1,
 4    paragraph 2, please?
 5       Q.   Sir, now that you've seen this document, can you tell us if, in
 6    fact, this is an order pursuant to which an information was given to the
 7    section that was in your southern area but also information -- in this
 8    document, we saw that the order was given to jam enemy communications; is
 9    that correct?
10       A.   Actually, you're right.  This is my order which was produced based
11    on the order that had arrived from the 2nd Corps.  Initially I said that
12    we had some amplifiers that were not very powerful so jamming them did not
13    produce much effect, but the command of the 2nd Corps instructed us to do
14    that kind of work nevertheless.
15       Q.   You're saying that this jamming did not really -- was not really
16    efficient but were they done?  Did you actually carry out the jamming
17    procedure?
18       A.   We did do the jamming, but I personally do not think that they
19    produced much of an effect.
20       Q.   Can you tell us if the people who were assigned to those
21    positions, to the -- who had the task to jam the communications between
22    people in the Republika Srpska, those same people, were they working in
23    the intercepting within the -- were they intercepting communications?  And
24    the technique that was used to jam conversations, was that technique
25    different than the one used to intercept conversations?

 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   You've told us on the 27th of November, page 24 of the transcript,
 3    that your units were checking frequencies from 200 to 900 megahertz.  Is
 4    it possible to check frequencies that were above 900 megahertz?
 5       A.   No.  By saying so, I mean that we transformed that information
 6    into speech, into voice signal that can actually be listened to.
 7       Q.   What device were you using to convert high frequencies to audible
 8    frequencies to the human ear?
 9       A.   I'll try to explain that.  There were three steps in that
10    procedure.  The first step was to procure a device whose band could be
11    expanded, band of frequencies.  The second step was to manufacture a
12    converter, which was a smallish device, so that this high frequency could
13    be converted to voice signal.  And this converter had a preamplifier, so
14    these three steps allowed us to listen successfully to the communications
15    up to 900 megahertz.
16       Q.   What devices were you using to catch frequencies between 266 and
17    630 megahertz?
18       A.   Those were mostly ham radio devices, RM 3.000, Collins, JVC.
19    These manufacturers are well known here in the western market as well, but
20    as ham radio devices, they had a very narrow band within which they could
21    communicate.  That was the problem.
22       Q.   While we are still talking about the equipment that your section
23    had to the south and the north, was there a difference regarding the
24    quality of the equipment?  The equipment in the north was it better than
25    the equipment that you had in the south or vice versa?

 1       A.   I can tell you that the equipment was similar.  If we took some
 2    ham radio equipment from Banovici and sent it to the facility in the south
 3    and then found similar equipment in another municipality, such as
 4    Srebrenik or Lukavac and send it to the north.
 5       Q.   [Previous translation continues] ... quality of the equipment in
 6    the north and in the south?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   Is it exact to say that the two places had difficulty to get
 9    electricity?
10       A.   Yes.  However, we had additional power supply in the form of
11    generators.  The ones in the facility in the south had remained from the
12    former JNA.
13       Q.   You've said yesterday, on page 22 of the transcript, that your
14    UHER equipment was very good.  Is it right to say that it would happen
15    that these equipment or that that equipment could actually break from time
16    to time?
17       A.   That is correct.  I said that during that period of time, the
18    equipment that we had was considered of high quality.  Furthermore, the
19    JNA used that equipment in their wiretapping centres.
20       Q.   Is it exact to say that those devices could break down from time
21    to time?
22       A.   Normal procedure requires, or rather normal procedure -- it is
23    normal for the equipment which is constantly used to occasionally be out
24    of order.
25       Q.   Is it exact to say that you had difficulty to obtain pieces, to

 1    change, to put in those devices?
 2       A.   That is true, but we had people who were very enthusiastic, who
 3    could produce something out of nothing.
 4       Q.   Is it true to say that you did not have maintenance products to
 5    maintain that equipment?
 6       A.   During that period of time, and during war, we did not have
 7    anything.  We had a short supply of everything, including the spare parts
 8    for UHERs.
 9       Q.   Is it exact to say because you didn't have maintenance products
10    and maintenance parts, that the quality was diminished, that you didn't
11    have such a good quality?
12       A.   I wouldn't be able to say, because very soon thereafter, we found
13    certain sources.  By that, I mean the radio station in Tuzla, where they
14    had a lot of equipment that we could use for spare parts.  The quality of
15    the recording mostly depended on the reels which had been used several
16    times.
17            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could the witness be shown 5D153,
18    please?
19       Q.   Sir, can we say that this is a report coming from the southern
20    area, written on the 13th of July 1995?
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   I would like you to take a look at paragraph 2, please.  In this
23    paragraph, we can see that there were some problems with a UHER which was
24    out of use at that time, is that right to say?  It's in the first sentence
25    of paragraph 2 that we see this.

 1       A.   I will provide a very clear answer to this question.  Such reports
 2    were sent to me and I would forward them to the 2nd Corps command, for the
 3    reason to refresh or replenish our stocks.  We would repair these
 4    breakdowns very quickly.  But we wanted something in writing to be sent to
 5    the command although we knew that we could receive little or nothing.
 6       Q.   And is it right to say that the last sentence of this paragraph
 7    states as follows:  "That this is why more and more conversations were
 8    being completely incomprehensible, so wiretap became totally
 9    incomprehensible or taping of the conversations became incomprehensible"?
10       A.   That statement can be taken as true but as I said, to get
11    something, and we will some reserves, we had to exaggerate to be able to
12    receive at least something.
13       Q.   I understand very well what you're telling us, sir, but can you
14    tell us today with certainty --
15            JUDGE AGIUS:  Mr. Vanderpuye?
16            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I have I think two
17    objections to make with respect to I guess the question and answer, with
18    respect to the exhibit they have just been displayed.  One is that I
19    believe my learned counsel referred to the last paragraph in the document,
20    and I believe translated that last sentence, maybe I'm incorrect, but she
21    referred to taping and/or listening and I'm not sure that the document
22    reflects that.  And secondly, I'm not clear on whether or not the
23    translation of intercepts is being converted into wiretaps or some other
24    expression.  I think there is a clear distinction between what an
25    intercept is of a radio communication and a wire tap and I'm concerned

 1    that that may lead to some confusion with respect to what the transcript
 2    later bears out.
 3            JUDGE AGIUS:  Do you wish to comment on that, Madam Fauveau?  We
 4    are not in a position to make an assessment.  We need feedback from the
 5    interpreters on this or anyone else who is, for that matter, following the
 6    proceedings, maybe in B/C/S.
 7            Madam Fauveau?
 8            MS. FAUVEAU: [No interpretation]
 9            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.  I'm understanding you but we don't have an
10    interpretation in English now.  And for the benefit of anyone who doesn't
11    understand French, if you don't mind repeating, please.
12            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Yes.  I was not referring to the
13    last paragraph but to paragraph 2.  But for the sake of clarity and to
14    make it easier, it's a short paragraph.  The easiest thing might to be
15    read it out in B/C/S for it to be interpreted by the certified translators
16    and interpreters.  They are the most competent.
17            JUDGE AGIUS:  But in the transcript indeed we have in line 7 on
18    page 23, your question as being, is it right to say that the last sentence
19    of this paragraph, but you're referring to paragraph 2, okay.
20            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Exactly, Mr. President.
21            JUDGE AGIUS:  We need to -- did you have that in mind,
22    Mr. Vanderpuye or not.
23            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Yes.  I do stand corrected.  The substance of if,
24    however -- the substance of the objection remains the same, which is I
25    believe that --

 1            JUDGE AGIUS:  Wiretapping or intercept?
 2            MR. VANDERPUYE:  That's correct.  Thank you, Mr. President.
 3            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you.  So the only thing, other thing, we need
 4    to clear up, unless you intend to clear it up with your next question,
 5    Madam Fauveau, is this question of whether we are having the correct
 6    translation of the words you are using in French into English.  I wasn't
 7    following you in French when you asked the question.  So I'm not in a
 8    position to know whether we have got the right interpretation or not, the
 9    correct interpretation or not.
10            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Mr. President, I think the best
11    thing would be to read the text again, as it stands in Serbo-Croat, and it
12    might be necessary to read the entire paragraph for the text to be
13    understandable.  It won't take too much time.
14            JUDGE AGIUS:  Agreed, agreed.  Go ahead.
15            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Thank you, Mr. President.
16            "What is being done to have more regular supplies for small spare
17    parts for UHERs?  One UHER has a dysfunctional drive disk so it's
18    completely out of repair and out of use.  What we need is regular supplies
19    of spare heads, new tapes and rubber bands, and we cannot even obtain
20    alcohol for the cleaning of magnetic heads.  And this is the sure reason
21    that more and more we have recordings of conversations which, when played
22    back, are hardly or completely unintelligible."
23       Q.   Sir, I've just read out a passage.  Did it indeed have to do with
24    the recording of conversations?
25       A.   Yes.

 1            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Mr. President, I don't know whether
 2    this is clear enough now or whether the Prosecutor would seek other
 3    elements on this point.
 4            JUDGE AGIUS:  Mr. Vanderpuye?
 5            MR. VANDERPUYE:  I'll accept the translation as was, as I heard
 6    it, any way, and I have no other objection.
 7            JUDGE AGIUS:  All right.  Thank you.
 8            Madam Fauveau, you may proceed.
 9            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Thank you, Mr. President.
10       Q.   Sir, if I understood you properly, you sometimes overstated the
11    problems you encountered but isn't it fair to say that it would happen
12    that you would send the reels with the recordings to the -- your higher
13    command?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   They, therefore, could ascertain the quality of the recording,
16    couldn't they?
17       A.   In essence, yes, but we did not send tapes from which we could not
18    play back voice information.  We whinged, we sought, but we did have
19    something up our sleeve in reserve as any diligent service, but we wanted
20    the command to provide more to us.
21       Q.   Do you know when the platoon for electronic surveillance was
22    established in the northern facility?
23       A.   As I already said, this was before my arrival to the service.  I
24    cannot remember precisely, but I think they were there in 1992.
25       Q.   Yesterday, you testified that the unit in the northern facility

 1    covered the area between Doboj and Zvornik, and you said that it was the
 2    Posavina area.  Is it fair to say that this very same area was also
 3    covered by a unit of the 21st Division that were located in the same
 4    place?
 5       A.   It is correct when you're talking about the points of the compass
 6    but the interpretation is not correct.  The northern facility covered the
 7    area from Doboj to Zvornik, and the unit from the 21st Division covered
 8    the area of Posavina, which overlapped 20, 30 per cent, with the 21st's
 9    area of responsibility in terms of deployment of its units and brigades.
10    We had a platoon of communications and monitoring for the 25th Division
11    and of course there is some overlap in surveillance because we are talking
12    about air waves and communication can come from any direction.  But the
13    main area of responsibility for the northern facility was to cover area
14    left of Doboj and right of Zvornik a supplementary task was to help the
15    southern facility and vice versa in case there were some major operations
16    in their areas of responsibility.
17       Q.   [Previous translation continues] ... area you have just defined
18    between Doboj and Zvornik, was it exactly the same as the one covered by
19    the units of the 21st Division that were located in the same place?
20       A.   I don't know which area was established through an order and given
21    to the 21st division but in terms of military hierarchy, you know and you
22    must know, that a division is subordinated to a corps.
23            JUDGE AGIUS:  Yes, Mr. Vanderpuye?
24            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Mr. President, the objection to the question is
25    simply that I believe it had already been answered in the prior -- with

 1    respect to the prior question and it's repetitive and I would just object
 2    on that basis.  Obviously, it's already been answered but I think twice is
 3    probably enough.
 4            JUDGE AGIUS:  It is different.  It is different.  Because the
 5    emphasis now is on the strict difference that there is between Doboj and
 6    Zvornik.  So the area covered earlier was more concentrated on the units
 7    of the 21st Division, as I see it.
 8            Anyway, let's proceed.
 9            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation].
10       Q.   With regard to the northern facility as such, your unit, your
11    platoon, and the unit of the 21st Division, would they exchange, swap,
12    information?
13       A.   It is a normal process to exchange information and data.  Our task
14    and their task was, if there were no activities in said area, or no
15    activities in the area of responsibility of the 21st Division, they would
16    turn their antenna and monitor communications in the south.  You must know
17    that apart from the platoon within each division, we had squads at brigade
18    levels and at any rate they could detect activities but such squads did
19    not have such a level of equipment that they could monitor in the way that
20    a -- division level and corps level units could.
21       Q.   I am going to put it to you directly.  The members of your unit in
22    the northern facility, did they know of intercepts done by units of the
23    21st Division?
24       A.   Members of our unit did not know about these intercepts, for the
25    reason that intercepts from the 21st Division were sent to the command of

 1    the 21st Division, and after processing these, their commander sent the
 2    same information to the corps.
 3       Q.   Did the members of your platoon know of intercepts by the DB unit
 4    that were positioned in the same northern facility?
 5       A.   In principle, no, but I cannot exclude mutual conversation which
 6    was aimed at support and help.  State Security Service was mostly
 7    interested in the intercepts of conversations of civilian or political
 8    structures, but they, to justify their existence, most probably monitored
 9    military communications as well.
10       Q.   Did it happen that you received from your platoon in the northern
11    facility reports regarding intercepts done by the DB?
12       A.   I cannot exclude this possibility but it would be a very rare
13    occurrence.
14       Q.   How could you receive intercepts done by DB?
15       A.   I did not understand your question.
16       Q.   How is it possible that you would receive conversations that were
17    intercepted by the DB unit?  On which channels did you get this
18    information?
19       A.   They would come to us in the following manner.  They would provide
20    their report to our unit, and we would package it and forward it to the
21    corps.
22       Q.   So there was, indeed, an exchange of information inasmuch as the
23    DB would send to your northern facility the intercepts they had done?
24       A.   I've already stated "very seldom," for the very simple reason.
25    One person cannot produce a volume of work greater than six or seven
 1    people could, and very rarely did they come up with something that we had
 2    not already obtained.
 3       Q.   You said on the 27th of November, page 44, that a signals platoon
 4    was in the northern facility and that the said unit used specific
 5    equipment or a room in which the head of the platoon and the person
 6    working there were allowed to enter.  Is it right to say that the DB
 7    personnel were allowed to enter that room?
 8       A.   I don't know, but I can freely tell you that DB members could not
 9    enter the premises of my KZ or cryptographer service or my units.
10            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Can we move to private session
11    because I'm about to mention a name.
12            JUDGE AGIUS:  Let's move to private session nor a short while,
13    please.

 3                          [Open session]
 4            JUDGE AGIUS:  We are in open session, Madam Fauveau.
 5            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation].
 6       Q.   On the 27th of November you stated that the commander of the
 7    platoon was the first filter in data analysis.  Could you tell us what
 8    that amounted to, this first filtering level on information or data?
 9       A.   I will try to make it understandable.  Commander sits with a
10    number of people together in one room and everybody is working.  If all
11    routes are occupied, he would determine the priorities.  And that would be
12    the first filter:  What is to be monitored and what is not to be
13    monitored, exclusively for the reason of limited technical capabilities of
14    the equipment at our disposal.
15       Q.   And the commander of the platoon had he been trained in data
16    analysis?
17       A.   Of course he would be informed because everybody sitting in a
18    single room and talking now I can hear this and I can hear the other
19    person.  They would perform analysis to transcribe faithfully or as
20    faithfully as possible the conversations intercepted.
21       Q.   There may have been a problem in the interpretation.  I'm going to
22    repeat:  The commander of that platoon, had he been trained in analysing
23    data?
24       A.   I believe he was in the -- within his purview.
25       Q.   On the 27th of November, page 40 of the transcript, you said that
 1    you were mainly interested in the contents of conversation, that you did
 2    not insist so much on the people speaking.  Would you allow for the
 3    possibility that there were some mistakes in identifying the speakers?
 4       A.   Our task, and I will reiterate, is correctly to interpret what was
 5    said and as -- and for the conversation to be transcribed on paper or
 6    in -- to be keyed into computer, as was.  We do not -- we were not
 7    interested in their names.  We drew conclusions on the basis of the forms
 8    filled in, on the basis of introductions of participants in conversations,
 9    or some other indications.  No person would be ascribed a name if they had
10    not introduced themselves or if there were no indications as to the
11    identity of the person.  We would put X, Y, even in cases where there were
12    many indications among our men that this could be a certain person.
13       Q.   [Previous translation continues] ... intercepts were not of the
14    same relevance.
15       A.   That's only normal.
16       Q.   You would receive reports from the northern and southern
17    facilities.  Did they distinguish between relevant and not so relevant
18    intercepts?
19       A.   No.  Their task, as I said, was to forward the reports as they
20    were to the superior command, but if there were some reports that were
21    urgent in terms of shelling, in terms of bombing, then this delay could
22    not happen and they had a duty to notify immediately.
23       Q.   The urgent reports regarding bombing or shelling, did they bear a
24    special mention, such as priority or urgent?
25       A.   If I can remember, there were markings urgent and priority, I

 1    think.
 2       Q.   And the marking was the same or there was no distinction between
 3    urgent and priority?  Was one more urgent than the other?
 4       A.   In essence, both such types of reports had the same or similar
 5    weight.  The only difference was the time of response.  As I already said,
 6    urgent, if they were planning to shell Tuzla from Ozren so that alarms can
 7    be sent, and priority meant that that information should be heeded but
 8    there would be more of a lag -- time lag between the sending and
 9    receiving.
10       Q.   You forwarded or you handed over various material, reels and copy
11    books, between 1998 and 2000.  Do you know when the ABiH received a first
12    request from the OTP for the handover of such documents?
13            JUDGE AGIUS:  Mr. Vanderpuye?
14            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I just see in the
15    translation a reference to copy books, and I just want --.
16            THE INTERPRETER:  Apologies by the interpreter, we meant
17    notebooks.
18            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Thank you for that clarification.
19            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you.  Go ahead.
20            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation].
21       Q.   Sir, do you know when the ABiH received a first request by the OTP
22    regarding this material?
23       A.   I will respond very briefly.  You should ask that somebody from
24    the federal Ministry of Defence or from the joint command.  I only know
25    when I received my superior officer's orders and this is when I started
 1    doing that job.
 2       Q.   You forwarded or handed over certain reels among this material.
 3    Where were they kept before they were handed over to the OTP?
 4       A.   These tapes were safeguarded within the unit.
 5       Q.   When you say "unit," could you be more specific?  Where was this
 6    unit located?
 7       A.   As far as I can recall, it was done in the northern facility.
 8       Q.   Sir, in the Krstic case --
 9            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Mr. President, it was in closed
10    session so I'd like to read out a paragraph from that transcript.  Can we
11    move to private session?
12            JUDGE AGIUS:  Certainly.  Let's move into private session, please.

19            JUDGE AGIUS:  And we'll have a 30-minute break starting from now.
20    Thank you.
21            One moment.  I seek the cooperation of the Defence teams.  We have
22    a new motion from the Prosecution regarding protective measures for the
23    December witnesses.  We are dealing with witnesses number 69, 134, 136 and
24    65, for whom a pseudonym, visual and image -- and vocal, and voice
25    distortion are sought, and 157, 77, and 81 for whom pseudonym and image
 1    distortion are sought.  The most important thing is that witness 69 in
 2    particular, although scheduled to start on the 1st of December won't be
 3    able to start on the 1st of December but he will certainly -- he will
 4    certainly start mid-next week.
 5            So if you could let us have your position, joint position, or
 6    whatever, latest Monday morning or Friday, this Friday or latest Monday
 7    morning, we would appreciate that.  Thank you.
 8            JUDGE KWON:  We are not sitting on Friday.
 9            JUDGE AGIUS:  No we are not sitting on Friday but they can inform
10    our Senior Legal Officer and we'll receive the communication.
11            Thank you.
12                           --- Recess taken at 10.32 a.m.
13                           --- On resuming at 11.08 a.m.
14            JUDGE AGIUS:  Yes, Madam Fauveau.
15            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation].
16       Q.   Sir, just before the break we were talking about archiving.  Is it
17    right to say that all official documents were archived in Sarajevo as of
18    1996?
19       A.   As far as I know, I'm not authorised to release such information,
20    but all of this went to Sarajevo.
21       Q.   And what about the books and all the notebooks that remained in
22    the northern part, the northern facility?  All those documents remained
23    there; is that right?  Those are the official documents?
24       A.   [No interpretation].
25       Q.   When you   gave the OTP those documents, did you inform the OTP

 1    that those are not official documents?
 2       A.   Nobody ever put such a question to me.
 3            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I believe that the
 4    previous answer was not recorded in the transcript.
 5            JUDGE AGIUS:  You are right.  And the question was,"And what about
 6    the books and all the notebooks that remained in the northern part, all
 7    these documents remained there; is that right?  Those are the official
 8    documents?"
 9            What did you -- what was your answer to that question?  I'm asking
10    you again because it didn't show up in the translation, in the transcript.
11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Notebooks and tapes, let me repeat
12    once again, were accidentally maintained.  The official document is the
13    written report, and the official documents are actually tapes that were
14    contained in the intelligence department.  When the representatives of the
15    ICTY expressed interest, at that time we were not considering in terms
16    what is official, what is not official.  We simply looked for original
17    sources and I think that I was clear enough in explaining this.
18            JUDGE AGIUS:  I thank you.  I think it's clear enough.  He's
19    making a clear distinction between what is official and what is not
20    official documents.
21            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could the witness be shown the
22    document P2312, 2312?
23       Q.   You've told us yesterday, sir, that the reports that were coming
24    from the northern facility to the southern facility, that those reports
25    were sent to your unit.  Can you explain to us why is it that on this

 1    report we see that the person who was to receive the document was the 2nd
 2    Corps intelligence organ?
 3       A.   I've already explained that the reports arrived in parallel to the
 4    unit and to the intelligence section of the 2nd Corps where there also
 5    existed an encryption department. They would only change the heading, so
 6    that above the line where it says, "intelligence section of the 2nd
 7    Corps," they would put a different text, PEB Company, and they would send
 8    it forward because, to people receiving it, it was important to know where
 9    such reports originated.
10       Q.   To be clear, all the reports from the northern facility and the
11    southern facility were sent automatically to the intelligence section of
12    the 2nd Corps and to your unit; is that correct?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   And the report that we have before us is the report that was sent
15    to the 2nd Corps?
16       A.   Yes.
17       Q.   You've told us yesterday that the initials that we see here under
18    the text designate a person, the person who would usually send the report
19    as well as the person who transcribed the conversation.  Did every report
20    contain an initial like this?
21  (redacted)
22  (redacted)
23  (redacted)
24  (redacted)
25  (redacted)

 1            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Mr. President, the witness mentioned
 2    the name of the northern facility.  It is not written down in the
 3    transcript but he did say it.
 4                          [Trial Chamber confers]
 5            JUDGE AGIUS:  So I think we need to redact also only the audio
 6    part, and that should be enough.
 7            Thank you.  Careful; we are in open session.
 8            Yes, Madam Fauveau, thank you for pointing that out.
 9            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation]
10       Q.   Sir, when a report contained many different conversations, these
11    initials were supposed to be put on top of each conversation or only at
12    the end of the report?
13       A.   The first initials, as you can see here, al ways the same.  That
14    person stayed there for 10 days in a shift.  If there were more reports
15    and if these reports were produced by the same person, that it was
16    sufficient for that person to put his initials at the bottom of each
17    report.
18            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could the witness be shown page 2 of
19    this exhibit, please?  Page 10, please, excuse me.   Maybe there was a
20    mistake in interpretation.  I was mentioning page 10.  Could the witness
21    be shown the end of the page, so the bottom part of the page?
22       Q.   Sir , is it right to say that no initials appear on this page?
23       A.   I can't see it.
24            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could the witness be shown the next
25    page, please?  Could the document be, yes, raised a little bit between the

 1    two conversations?  That's right.  This place.
 2       Q.   Sir, here we do not see any initials.  We do not see an initial at
 3    the end one conversation, for instance.
 4       A.   Yes.
 5            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could we turn to the next page,
 6    please?
 7       Q.   And at the end of this conversation, we also do not see an
 8    initial; is that right?
 9       A.   Yes.
10            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could we please take the following
11    page?  Could we please scroll the document down?
12       Q.   On this page there are no initials as well; is that right?
13       A.   Yes.
14            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] I would like the witness to be shown
15    the next page.
16       Q.   Sir, it is the end of the report and we still do not see an
17    initial.  When you would receive such a report without an initial, was
18    this a regular occurrence?
19       A.   Yes.  This was a typical situation.  As I said earlier, putting
20    initials down was not a legal requirement.  We asked for that in order to
21    recognise the work of certain servicemen, so there were very few people
22    who put down their initials and those are the people who worked 24 hours
23    in ten-day shifts and it was very easy to establish based on that who
24    produced what report because we had adequate notations in the notebooks.
25    So we could trace the work of a certain person; however, putting down the

 1    initials was not a legal requirement.
 2       Q.   I would like to take page 3 of this document.  I would like this
 3    page to be shown to the witness.
 4            Sir, is this a conversation that was intercepted by the DB?
 5       A.   I think so.
 6       Q.   And this conversation was sent from your section, from the
 7    northern facility; is that right?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   Do you know how members of your section got in possession of this
10    document or more generally speaking this DB document?  How did they get
11    this document?
12       A.   Yes.  As I have said, the state security, the DB, was tasked with
13    monitoring civilian communications.  This one here is a typical military
14    communication and they simply gave this communication on a diskette.  Our
15    person repackaged it and sent it to Sarajevo.  You can see that in the
16    right corner it says, "Very urgent."
17       Q.   Sir, you've told us yesterday that generally speaking, as an
18    average, there were 25 to 30 conversations during a day, between 20 and 30
19    reports were drafted in the course of one working day; is that right?
20       A.   I have said that it all depended on the traffic, density of
21    traffic on that day.  There were days when we had one, two or three
22    reports, and that did not depend on us.
23       Q.   And on the 14th of July 1995, according to you, was this a day
24    with a lot more conversations or not?
25       A.   From my point of view, I can tell you that there were more

 1    conversations than typical, than usual.
 2       Q.   And is it normal that under these conditions 16 reports would have
 3    been sent?
 4       A.   The number is completely irrelevant.  It can contain more
 5    conversations that were recording on more channels or it can contain one
 6    single conversation recorded on one channel.  And that could be the entire
 7    report.  It depended on the speed of typing of the operator doing this.
 8    Whenever there was a need to send a report, he would produce a short
 9    version or, if he had sufficient time, he would produce a longer version.
10       Q.   [Previous translation continues] ... say that problems regarding
11    dates would occur on these reports?
12       A.   In such a situation where people worked around the clock, 24 hours
13    a day, such mistakes were possible.
14       Q.   Do you recall that an order was given in the month of August 1995,
15    pursuant to which the date was to be automatically written down above each
16    conversation?
17            JUDGE AGIUS:  Don't answer.  Wait one moment.
18            Mr. Vanderpuye?
19            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It just appeared to me
20    that part of the previous question was missing.  I didn't hear it in the
21    translation and I don't see it on the transcript.  I don't know if maybe
22    counsel could either repeat the question or --
23            JUDGE AGIUS:  Either counsel or myself.  I don't see the reason
24    why counsel is speaking French.  I don't imagine that the witness is
25    following in French.  And still there is some overlapping.  Still there is

 1    some overlapping.  I've noticed it and even Judge Prost raised it with me
 2    earlier on.  There is some overlapping so I don't know what the cause of
 3    it.  Perhaps we can go back, if you could repeat your question, kindly
 4    repeat your question, please, Madam Fauveau, and then the witness will try
 5    to answer it again.
 6            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreters note, the counsel needs to wait for
 7    the English interpretation to conclude before asking the question.
 8            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] It was entirely my fault the missing
 9    portion of my question was, is it right to stay that problems regarding
10    dates would occur in these reports.
11            JUDGE AGIUS:  And what was your answer?
12            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I said that in such an environment,
13    it was normal for mistakes to occur.  Whenever you have a team playing,
14    you will always expect them to play even better.  That's the essence of
15    it.
16            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you.
17            Incidentally, Ms. Fauveau, I don't know in you're following the
18    transcript in English or not but the interpreters have pointed out that it
19    would be preferable and much easier for them if you waited until the
20    English translation is finished before you proceed with your questions in
21    French.  And that's according to them the reason why we have had some
22    problems.  All right?  I'm sure you can do that because the transcript
23    is -- will be scrolling in front of your eyes, so ...
24            MS. FAUVEAU: [Microphone not activated]
25            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.
 1            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] I really have to follow the
 2    transcript because I have to see also what is going on with French because
 3    I'll enter into collision with the French language as well.  So I really
 4    have to follow the transcript.
 5            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.  Thank you.
 6            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation].
 7       Q.   Sir, do you recall an order from the 20th of August 1995, in which
 8    an order was given that a date should be written on top of each
 9    conversation?
10       A.   Right now I do not remember that order.  There were many orders.
11    However, such orders, in such a form, typically came from the intelligence
12    department.  As I have said to you the purpose was to improve the work.
13    That was the only goal.
14            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could the witness be shown Exhibit
15    5D117, please?  Would it be possible to show the witness the bottom of the
16    page, please?
17       Q.   Sir, do we see your name at the bottom of this document?
18       A.   Yes.
19            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] And could the witness be shown what
20    is written on top of the page?
21            Mr. President, could we go into a closed session for just a few
22    moments while I discuss this document with the witness?

19                          [Open session]
20            JUDGE AGIUS:  We are in open session.
21            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Could the witness be shown 5D131,
22    the cover page more specifically?  This is notebook 00778815.  I don't
23    know whether the Prosecutor has the notebook.  It might be good to put it
24    on the ELMO.
25       Q.   Sir, whilst this is being done, whilst you're receiving the
 1    original, could you tell us whether this notebook that you can see on the
 2    screen is like the notebooks you would use in your unit?
 3       A.   I personally think that this is one of the notebooks used by the
 4    members of my unit.
 5       Q.   Sir, you stated that you would receive the notebooks from various
 6    sources.  Isn't it fair to say that part of them would come from the
 7    humanitarian aid destined to the children?
 8       A.   I have no idea about that, really.
 9            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] No further questions, Mr. President.
10      Thank you.
11            JUDGE AGIUS:  I thank you.
12            Mr. Josse or Mr. Krgovic?  I don't know who is --
13            MR. JOSSE:  We are not asking any questions, Your Honour.
14            JUDGE AGIUS:  And the Borovcanin -- Pandurevic Defence team have
15    already finished their cross-examination.  Is there re-examination, Mr.
16    Vanderpuye?
17            MR. VANDERPUYE:  No, there is not any re-examination.
18            JUDGE AGIUS:  All right.  So witness, we don't have any further
19    questions for you, which means that your testimony comes to an end here.
20    Our usher will escort you out of the courtroom and our, the rest of our
21    staff will assist to you facilitate your return back home.  On behalf of
22    the Trial Chamber, I wish to thank you for having come over and also
23    extend our best wishes nor a safe journey back home.
24                          [The witness withdrew]
25            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.  We can now proceed with the tendering of
 1    documents.  Mr. Vanderpuye goes first.  Prosecution.
 2            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Thank you, Mr. President.
 3            We would like to tender first the transcript of his prior
 4    testimony, which is P02309.  The pseudonym sheet P02310.
 5            JUDGE AGIUS:  Both of which will be under seal.
 6            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Yes, please.  Also we would like to tender --
 7    just bear with me for one moment.  I'm trying to get a document that I
 8    need myself.  Also like to tender P01067.  It's a copy of the record of
 9    transfer of archival material from the 2nd Corps to the --
10            JUDGE AGIUS:  All right.  Stop for a moment because we'll try to
11    economise on time as much as we can.  I suppose this list that is been
12    plead available to all the Defence teams.
13            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Yeah.
14            JUDGE AGIUS:  Can you confirm that, that you have had this list
15    made available?  You have therefore the list of all the documents that the
16    Prosecution seeks to tender.  Are there any objections from any of you,
17    any of the Defence teams, with regard to any of these documents?
18            Yes, Ms. Nikolic?
19            MS. NIKOLIC: [Interpretation] No, Your Honour.  If this is the
20    document submitted to us on the 28th of November, given that there were
21    two documents in circulation.
22            JUDGE AGIUS:  All right.  This is -- it's not dated and I don't
23    have the date on it.  Yes, it is dated in the bottom, 28th of November.
24    It ends with PIC 00050.
25            MS. NIKOLIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour, thank you.

 1            JUDGE AGIUS:  I take it there are no objections so all these
 2    documents are so admitted and they will be attributed the P number or the
 3    exhibit number that we have there indicated on this sheet, which I'm
 4    handing to the registrar.
 5            That is all?
 6            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Yes.  The only thing I wanted to add is perhaps
 7    for the Court to consider admitting P01075 under seal and also P01071
 8    under seal to the extent that they bear identifying information concerning
 9    the witness.
10            JUDGE AGIUS:  Which ones again, please?
11            MR. VANDERPUYE:  P01071 and P01075.
12            JUDGE AGIUS:  Yes.  I think that is necessary because he was
13    actually asked whether he recognises his own signature or whether he
14    prepared those documents.  So those two documents, I suppose, there is no
15    objection on any of the Defence -- on the part of any of the Defence
16    teams.  I hear none.  So those two documents will be kept under seal.  All
17    right.
18            So I take it that the Popovic Defence team would like to tender
19    some documents.
20            MR. ZIVANOVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, Your Honour.  We've submitted
21    our list of documents put forward to be tendered into evidence.
22            JUDGE AGIUS:  And I take it that the Prosecution has a copy of
23    this list.  They don't seem to have a copy of the list.
24            MR. VANDERPUYE:  Sorry.  In response to your question, I don't
25    believe we have a copy.

 1            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.  So now that you have more or less gathered
 2    what the practice will be, if in future you could make sure that the list
 3    is distributed both to your colleagues, and I'm addressing you because it
 4    happens to be you.  I'm addressing everyone.  Both your I have it will
 5    leagues and the Prosecution so we facilitate the process.
 6            I'll go through it very quickly.  The there are six documents.
 7    They are 1DP1068, 1DP1069, 1DP1071, 1DP1072, 1DP1075, 1DIC00049, as
 8    described in the piece of paper which I am handing signed by me to the
 9    registrar.  Yes, but it is IDP1071.  That would be the same one.  This
10    would be the same one and they would need to be under seal as well.  All
11    right?
12                          [Trial Chamber confers].
13            JUDGE AGIUS:  These documents will be so admitted; however, in
14    relation to 1DP1071 and 1DP1075, these will be kept under seal.
15            I would also like someone to check whether in relation to the
16    other documents, barring the last two, in other words, barring IDIC 00049
17    and the other one, which we haven't given a number as yet, archive
18    notebook in part, just pages 0204 to 0384 and 0204 to 0722 to what is
19    document bearing ERN number 02040772 to 02041112.
20            The others, registrar, needs to check whether in any part of the
21    witness's testimony there are references made to these documents which
22    could expose his identity.  I don't think there are but there may be.
23                          [Trial Chamber confers]
24            JUDGE AGIUS:  Yes, yes, yes.  It is only two pages.
25            So in relation to item 6, the two pages from the archived

 1    notebook, it's only those two pages of course that are being admitted as a
 2    1D -- Defence 1D exhibit and they will be given a number in due course.
 3    Any objection?  I hear -- makes me feel like conducting an auction.
 4            No objection?  No objection?
 5            MR. VANDERPUYE:  No, not at this time.
 6            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you.  So they will be so admitted.
 7            All right.
 8            JUDGE KWON:  Can I ask the number 2, 3, 4 items are same documents
 9    as Prosecution documents, aren't they?
10            MR. ZIVANOVIC: [Interpretation] Yes, they are.  We have an
11    instruction to submit such documents in this way, even if they are
12    included in the Prosecution's list of documents and to mark them in that
13    manner, and this is what we've done.  Of course, I will double check with
14    my team but I think that we have abided by your instructions.  Thank you.
15            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.  All right.
16            I think -- thank you very much.  I think that before proceeding
17    with the the next witness, you are all anxiously expecting our decision,
18    Madam Fauveau.  You have also some documents to tender?
19            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Yes, very much so.  We have the
20    list.  You have the list, I believe.
21            JUDGE AGIUS:  Yes.  And I can paraphrase it, summarise it, it's
22    5D152, 5D142 and 5D153, these being first list of members of the unit,
23    second order dated 22nd June, and third document dated 13th July 1995
24    respectively.  I'm handing a sleet to the registrar with my signature
25    which indicates the ERN number of these documents.  I thank you.
 1            Any objections?  I hear none.  So they are so admitted.  Madam
 2    Fauveau.  Can we proceed?  No other documents to be tendered?  Let's
 3    proceed now.
 4                          [Trial Chamber confers]
 5            JUDGE AGIUS:  Judge Kwon is rightly pointing out to me that it is
 6    preferable that the last document will be for the time being marked for
 7    identification pending translation thereof.  As soon as translation is
 8    provided and goes in the record, then obviously the document is formally
 9    admitted.  All right.  Thank you Judge Kwon.  That had escaped me.
10            Let's come to our next business on our agenda.  That's the next
11    witness.  Please comfort me when I say that this witness does not have any
12    protective measures and that you're not seeking any protective measures
13    for him.
14            MR. THAYER:  That is correct, Mr. President.
15            JUDGE AGIUS:  All right.  What is his current rank in the army,
16    the Dutch army.
17            MR. THAYER:  He is a Major in the Dutch army, Your Honour.
18            JUDGE AGIUS:  All right.  Thank you.
19            So this will -- what we are going to do now is we are going to
20    hand essentially two decisions, both related to the Prosecution motion
21    that I'm soon going to mention.  The decisions -- both decisions are going
22    to be oral.  If needs be, we can then have them incorporated in a single
23    or two written decisions but I don't think there will be a need for that.
24            The Trial Chamber is seized of the confidential Prosecution motion
25    to convert 92 bis witness Major Rutten to Rule 92 ter witness.  This

 1    motion was filed on the 28th of November.  That's yesterday.  And
 2    basically what it amounts to is Prosecution seeking the admission of
 3    Major Rutten, who was Witness number 23, Major Rutten's evidence tendered
 4    pursuant to Rule 92 ter instead of the previous Rule 92 bis.
 5            Now, the Popovic Defence team made oral submissions yesterday,
 6    which were followed by a proper formal response filed -- and motion
 7    actually filed earlier on today, opposing the Prosecution motion.
 8            We have noted that in their response, and in their submissions,
 9    the Popovic Defence asserts, in trying to sustain their request that I
10    will come to very soon, the Popovic team asserts that or submits that up
11    until this time, there never has been any allegation made by the
12    Prosecution that the accused Popovic was in the vicinity of the area of
13    the "White House" on 13th July 1995, and that, I'm quoting, "In these
14    circumstances it is unacceptable that three days prior to this witness
15    giving evidence, the Defence is informed of the Prosecution's intention to
16    rely upon this allegation."
17            We have also noted that in their response, the Popovic team
18    requests the Trial Chamber, first, to deny the motion and order that
19    Witness number 23, that's Major Rutten, appear pursuant to Rule 92 bis.
20    Second, to redact references in the transcript of that witness's prior
21    testimony which affects the acts and conducts of the accused Popovic, and,
22    third, to exclude the admission of document 65 ter number 1936, which we
23    understand to be a photograph, and, last, in the alternative, in a
24    subsidiary mode, to grant leave for further time to prepare -- further
25    time to the Popovic Defence to prepare for their cross-examination of

 1    Major Rutten.
 2            During this morning's first session, Ms. Condon for the Popovic
 3    Defence team further raised another submission in support of her request,
 4    namely that they had received information that in the course of the
 5    proofing session of Major Rutten, he is reported to have told the officer
 6    of the Prosecutor interviewing him that it appeared to him that the person
 7    he identified, although not by name, in the photograph document 65 ter
 8    number 1936, was a person -- appeared to be a person in command and not a
 9    plain soldier.
10            In our deliberations, we have considered the following.
11            We first considered that on the 12th of September of this year, we
12    handed down our so-called Rule 92 bis decision, in which the transcript of
13    Witness number 23, that's Major Rutten, was admitted pursuant to Rule 92
14    bis(D), without the requirement of a witness to appear for
15    cross-examination.  That was our first decision.
16            Subsequently, in reconsidering our decision, upon a request by one
17    or more of the Defence teams, on the 19th of October 2006, we modified our
18    previous decision, requiring Major Rutten to appear for cross-examination,
19    and of course confirming the introduction of his previous testimony
20    pursuant to Rule 92 bis(D).
21            We have also taken into account during our deliberations that the
22    photograph now in issue, namely document 65 ter number 1936, indeed was
23    not admitted in our 92 bis decision, as it was not strictly speaking an
24    exhibit that was admitted in the earlier trial as a result of witness
25    number 23, that's Major Rutten's testimony, but was only referenced by the

 1    witness during that testimony.  We followed up eventually in one of our
 2    decisions with a request to the Prosecution to also make available all
 3    these documents which included this particular document.  That was made
 4    available not only to us but also to all the Defence teams.
 5            We have also considered that approximately 34 lines of the
 6    transcript of this witness's previous testimony described the actions of
 7    an individual appearing in this photo, which the Prosecution alleges to be
 8    accused Popovic.
 9            Now that the Prosecution proposes to admit that photo or to tender
10    that photo in evidence, the relative written evidence in the transcript of
11    the accused's prior testimony implicates directly the acts and conduct of
12    the Accused Popovic as alleged by the Prosecution, with the consequent
13    result that such testimony would no longer be appropriate for admission
14    pursuant to Rule 92 bis because it goes to the acts and conducts of the
15    accuseds.
16            We have also considered that the Popovic Defence has had at its
17    disposal this photograph, which they could relate to the witness's
18    previous testimony upon reading the transcript of his prior testimony.
19    Having considered further that the alleged role, and this answers the
20    submission made by Ms. Condon earlier on this morning, we have considered
21    further that the alleged role of the Accused Popovic during the alleged
22    events in Potocari at the relevant time are clearly spelled out in the
23    indictment and such an indication is by no means affected by the proposed
24    testimony that the Prosecution seeks to adduce and that we considered
25    would be absolutely nothing new as Ms. Condon seeks to make us believe.

 1            The Trial Chamber therefore, in considering the -- both the
 2    written and the oral submissions of the parties, we are persuaded that
 3    granting the Prosecution's motion will not prejudice the accused so long
 4    as the Popovic Defence team is accorded sufficient time to prepare its
 5    cross-examination of Major Rutten, and where sufficient cause is shown or
 6    will be shown in subsequent written or oral submissions, the same Defence
 7    team will be permitted to recall other witnesses for cross-examination.
 8            So our decision in relation to the motion and response by the
 9    Popovic Defence team is as follows:  We hereby grant the motion of the
10    Prosecution mentioned earlier on and order that the written evidence of
11    Major Rutten, Witness number 23, is admitted pursuant to Rule 92 ter,
12    provided that the provisions of Rule 92 ter, paragraph A, are duly adhered
13    to and observed, and secondly, we hereby decide that on good cause being
14    shown, the Popovic team - by the "Popovic team," Witness number 23, that's
15    Major Rutten - will be required to be -- to appear for further
16    cross-examination by that team at a later date to be decided by the Trial
17    Chamber.
18            I am now moving to the matter raised by Madam Fauveau, which has
19    to my understanding been endorsed by all the other Defence teams.  So I
20    will be referring to it as your motion or your request, but the
21    understanding is that it applies across the board to all the other Defence
22    teams.  We are referring to the same Prosecution motion.  I don't need to
23    repeat the substance of that motion.
24            Earlier on this morning, Madam Fauveau submitted that one of the
25    documents that the Prosecution has disclosed to the Defence teams in

 1    relation to the proposed testimony of this witness, Major Rutten, consists
 2    in a previous statement which he brought here with him to The Hague, a
 3    statement that purportedly he gave to the Dutch authorities and which is
 4    in the Dutch language, which is not a language with which the Miletic
 5    Defence team, and for that matter the other Defence teams, are familiar
 6    with.  So it was suggested that in the absence of a timely translation of
 7    this statement, prior statement, of the witness, in a language which the
 8    various Defence teams can -- will be able to follow, they will not be in
 9    the position to conduct a full and well-informed cross-examination of this
10    witness.  As a consequence, Madam Fauveau, as endorsed by the other
11    Defence teams, sought two things:  Either the complete adjournment of this
12    witness -- postponement of this witness's testimony to a later date when
13    this is made available, preferably also with this witness coming forward
14    to testify in full, without having resort to Rule 92 ter or Rule 92 bis,
15    and also, in case such a request is not entertained by the Trial Chamber,
16    to have the cross-examination delayed until this translation of this
17    document has been made available.
18            We do not consider that the fact this document has not yet been
19    translated -- incidentally we are informed that it will probably be
20    translated as early as this coming Friday, if not also tomorrow -- we do
21    not consider the fact that this document has not been translated as an
22    absolutely sufficient reason for the testimony of Major Rutten to not
23    start and proceed as scheduled today.
24            However, we also understand the problem that the absence of a
25    translation of this prior statement may cause to the Defence teams, and so

 1    we are making a reservation that upon good cause being shown after a
 2    translation of the witness's prior statement to the Dutch authorities is
 3    provided to the Defence teams, Major Rutten may be required to appear
 4    again for further cross-examination by the Defence teams at a later date
 5    to be decided by the Trial Chamber.
 6            Incidentally, I'm also informed that not only will the translation
 7    be made available in time before the weekend, and we are not sitting on
 8    Friday, but that we have ensured that Major Rutten will also be available
 9    to continue his testimony on Monday morning.
10            So we have tried to cover as much territory as possible to protect
11    the various rights that you showed concern upon, but in the meantime we
12    are going to start and proceed with Major Rutten's testimony.
13            Thank you.
14                          [Trial Chamber confers]
15            JUDGE AGIUS:  Any further matters you would like to raise before
16    this witness walks in?  Do you prefer to have the break now?  I mean it's
17    up to you.  We can have the break now and continue in -- 30 minutes from
18    now, or have him come in, start and break after ten minutes from now.
19    It's whatever you prefer, Mr. Thayer.
20            MR. THAYER:  Your Honour, I think it would probably be smoother if
21    we just take the break now and then bring him out and then really get on
22    with it.
23            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.  So that's it.  Thank you.  We'll have a
24    30-minute break now because of the redactions we had to make.
25                           --- Recess taken at 12.21 p.m.
 1                          [The witness entered court]
 2                           --- On resuming at 12.56 p.m.
 3            JUDGE AGIUS:  Good afternoon to you, Major Rutten and welcome to
 4    this Tribunal.  You're start to giving evidence or you have testified
 5    before.  Our Rules require that before you do so, you enter a solemn
 6    declaration to the effect that in the course of your testimony you will be
 7    speaking the truth.  The text is going to be handed to you now by Madam
 8    Usher.  Please stand up, read it out aloud and that will be your solemn
 9    undertaking with us.
10            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth, the
11    whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
12                     WITNESS:  JOHANNES HENDRIKUS ANTONIUS RUTTEN
13            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you.  Let me explain very briefly what's going
14    to happen.  The testimony you gave in a previous case is going to be
15    admitted in whole pursuant to a rule we have a new rule, that's Rule 92
16    ter, so you don't have to testify the whole thing again.  However,
17    Mr. Thayer, who will be leading you, will give you a summary of that
18    testimony and then you will be asked a few questions, after which I will
19    then pass you on to the various Defence teams.
20            Now, one other thing before you start giving evidence is that
21    one -- during your proofing session, you brought with you a prior
22    statement that you gave to the Dutch authorities, which is in Dutch.  You
23    don't happen to have an English translation of it, by any chance, do you?
24            THE WITNESS:  No.
25            JUDGE AGIUS:  And you don't know if an English translation of it
 1    exists in the NIOD report or ...
 2            THE WITNESS:  No, I don't know.
 3            JUDGE AGIUS:  We want to make sure Mr. Thayer that we don't have
 4    further complications arising out of this matter so we are giving you a
 5    specific instruction, directive, to have this statement or that statement
 6    translated into English.  I think Madam Fauveau can live with that, too.
 7    Madam Fauveau?
 8            MS. FAUVEAU: [Interpretation] Certainly, Mr. President.
 9            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you.  I appreciate that, by no later than
10    Friday noon.  In order to make life easier for you, we are giving
11    instructions to the registrar, or to the Deputy Registrar here, to copy
12    and paste this part of our decision and have it transmitted to the
13    registrar or the respective unit within the Registry that deals with
14    translation.  We find it absolutely unacceptable that in the Netherlands,
15    in an institution where there are so many Dutch-speaking officers, this
16    cannot be translated by noon.  So the respective unit is to provide all
17    its assistance to make sure that this is made available to the Defence
18    teams immediately after noon on Friday.
19            So this is your responsibility.
20            Okay.  Thank you.  Having said that, I pass you on to Mr. Thayer.
21    Go ahead, Mr. Thayer.  Thank you.
22            MR. THAYER:  Thank you, Mr. President.
23                          Examination by Mr. Thayer:
24       Q.   Good afternoon, Major.
25       A.   Good afternoon.

 1       Q.   Before we begin, we'll both be speaking English so it is
 2    especially important for each of us to leave pauses in between my
 3    question, your answer and then the next question so that we leave enough
 4    time for the interpreters to catch up so that it's translated into the
 5    other languages, okay?
 6       A.   Okay.
 7       Q.   Now, Major, before we really get going, I want to review with you
 8    your military service history and I'm going to simply read to you a
 9    summary of that history.  And when I'm done you can tell meal if I've
10    missed anything or if there is anything to be corrected we'll do so.
11            Major, you joined the Royal Dutch Army in 1979 as a conscript and
12    served as an NCO stationed at a variety of bases until 1991.
13            Upon completing the officers' training school in 1993, you were
14    commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and served with the 41st armoured
15    infantry battalion where you trained the last company of conscripts.
16            In 1994, you began your service with the 11th air mobile brigade,
17    13th Battalion, as an anti-tank platoon commander and subsequently served
18    as deputy commanding officer of a company.
19            From January through July of 1995, you served with DutchBat 3 as a
20    fist Lieutenant during which time you were a patrol coordinator and
21    intelligence officer in Charlie Company.  Since your service in Bosnia
22    you've served as brigade, battalion and corps level as chief of
23    operational personal affairs, head of personnel and organisation, and
24    deputy branch chief, personnel management.
25            Those duties have involved preparing and forming missions abroad,

 1    such as various SFOR and KFOR missions and managing human resources
 2    related projects such as a headquarters reorganisation and implementing a
 3    new human resource application.
 4            And you also hold a degree in personnel policy and human
 5    resources.
 6            Major, does that accurately capture your service history?
 7       A.   Yes, it's quite correct, yes.
 8       Q.   Now, in meeting with me, in preparation for your testimony, did
 9    you have an opportunity to review your prior testimony in the Krstic case?
10       A.   Yes, I had, yes.
11       Q.   And you in fact read every page of that testimony; is that
12    correct?
13       A.   Yes, I did, that's also correct, yes.
14       Q.   And can you attest before the Trial Chamber that that testimony
15    which you read was a faithful and accurate transcription of the testimony
16    which you gave at the Krstic trial?
17       A.   Yes, it's also correct, yes.
18       Q.   Major, what I'd like to do now is read to you a summary of your
19    testimony in Krstic.  It may take a little bit of time and I'm going to
20    have to go a little bit slowly for the sake of the interpreters and I'd
21    just ask to you listen carefully because I'll ask you if there were any
22    changes or corrections that we need to make in my summary?
23            THE INTERPRETER:  Could the other microphone for the witness
24    please be switched on?
25            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.  I understand that the witness has switched it

 1    on himself.
 2            THE WITNESS:  They are both on.
 3            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you, Major.
 4            MR. THAYER:
 5       Q.   During the seven months then-Lieutenant Rutten served with
 6    DutchBat 3 he saw a decreasing -- he heard from the battalion that the
 7    Serbs were decreasing the movement of convoys by simply not giving them
 8    permission to go into the enclave.  There was not enough food for the
 9    civilian population and the situation in the enclave became so bad that
10    people would go through DutchBat's garbage when it was taken to the dump
11    site looking for something edible.  He identified a photograph he took
12    while on patrol of civilians surrounding a truck which was dumping
13    DutchBat garbage.  Other DutchBat soldiers saw the same thing.
14            On 10 July 1995, they heard severe impacts behind the compound
15    from a rocket launcher based in Bratunac.  Following the shelling they
16    found an unexploded rocket just behind the compound.  The shelling became
17    heavier in the following days and stopped during the late evening.  From
18    their position near OP Papa the Serbs fired more or less in a lane on the
19    Srebrenica-Potocari road and on or near DutchBat vehicles.
20            There were no real military targets in Srebrenica or Potocari and
21    his view of the purpose of the shelling was to intimidate DutchBat from
22    leaving the compound and as a terror act.
23            On Monday evening after the attack began, they heard from Bravo
24    Company that the situation in Srebrenica was growing out of hand and that
25    the refugees were on the move to Potocari.

 1            He then received an order to cut a hole in the rear side of the
 2    compound fence to let the refugees in, if necessary.  Bravo Company
 3    soldiers arrived on the evening of 10 July with the first refugees who
 4    were kept at the bus Remise because he had not received an order
 5    permitting them on the compound and the fence had to be closed again.  The
 6    only refugee brought to the compound was a heavily wounded woman taken to
 7    the battalion hospital.
 8            On Tuesday, 11 July, he was ordered to reopen the hole in the
 9    fence.  Lieutenant Koster led a group of DutchBat soldiers at the bus
10    Remise.  At this time he, Lieutenant Rutten, heard that large groups of
11    refugees were heading towards Potocari and that Bravo company had to leave
12    Srebrenica because of the shelling and chaos there.
13            The first groups of refugees began arriving at the rear side
14    guided by Koster and his men at the bus Remise.  Refugees arrived all day
15    until approximately 5.00 or 6.00 in the evening, at which time he was
16    ordered not to let in any more refugees because the factory hall itself
17    was completely filled.
18            He was then ordered by Major Otter at he shall to form three
19    groups of ten men to secure the area of the bus remise where the refugees
20    were.
21            He then identified an area marked expression bus compound on an
22    exhibit as the area to which he has referred as the bus remise and where
23    he and his ten men remained on the night of 11 July.  Lieutenants Koster
24    and Schotman each also had ten men in the area.  There were many refugees
25    in that area and they placed white tape around the whole area as the only

 1    means available to make it clear that it was a secure area under UN
 2    surveillance.
 3            They also patrolled the area and the DutchBat doctor provided
 4    first aid.
 5            In the morning of 12 July 1995, small arms fire was followed by
 6    mortar fire and Serb soldiers set fire to house in the area near the
 7    location of the refugees.  The first Serb soldiers to arrive were "more or
 8    less the Rambo types."  He informed one of the of the Serb soldiers who
 9    looked like a leader that they could not cross the tape because it was UN
10    territory and the refugees were under UN surveillance.
11            But the Serb soldier and the rest with him just laughed and
12    stepped over the tape and did as they pleased.
13            Serb soldiers also stole equipment and personal items belonging to
14    his men securing the bus compound.
15            On 12 July, he saw General Mladic and his body guards arrive
16    followed by a truck carrying bread and a fire truck with water.  The
17    distribution of the bread, water and candy was filmed.  Immediately after
18    the filming stopped, they also stopped handing out the bread, water, and
19    candy.  They even took back some of it from the refugees.  He did not see
20    the Serbs distribute anything else after that to the refugees on 12 or 13
21    July.
22            Later on 12 July, as the buses were arriving, Serb soldiers
23    threatened him to give up his weapon, flak vest and radio sets.  He
24    refused and told the soldiers that he needed to speak to their commander.
25    Subsequently a Serb soldier who appeared to be a commander arrived, and

 1    again demanded his equipment while another Serb soldier grabbed his
 2    weapon.  He again refused until the soldier pointed a gun at his head and
 3    demanded his radio set.
 4            He gave up one of his two sets then used the other to inform his
 5    superior officer that he had lost his weapon to the VRS.  His men then
 6    also gave up their weapons and vests at gun point.  He and his men were
 7    then taken to the bus compound and placed under guard of two Serb
 8    soldiers.
 9            He protested to a man he identified in an a photograph as Captain
10    Mane that he was being held and that they had lost their equipment but
11    Captain Mane sent him back to the rest of his group without looking at
12    him.
13            When Captain Mane returned a few hours later, Captain Mane sent
14    him and his ten men, that is Lieutenant Rutten and his ten men escorted by
15    two Serb soldiers, back to the compound where they spent the night.
16            Also on 12 July, he saw a Serb soldier make a sign by running his
17    finger across his throat at a man Lieutenant Rutten knew to be a Muslim
18    soldier with a gunshot wound.
19            On the morning of 13 July he was on duty in the operations room
20    where he heard that Lieutenant Versteeg saw two buses loaded with men
21    leave the vicinity of the "White House."  He ordered Versteeg to follow
22    the two buses because they were not leaving with the larger group of buses
23    ready along the road.
24            Versteeg followed the buss to Bratunac then radioed that the bus
25    was not going to Kladanj but turned in another direction and that he was

 1    being obstructed by Serb soldiers from following the bus.
 2            He instructed Versteeg to follow the bus.  Versteeg was unable to
 3    as the Serbs grabbed his car then hijacked it.  Consequently they never
 4    learned where those buses went.
 5            Because of this incident with Versteeg, he decided to go to
 6    the "White House" himself under the pretext of delivering a wheelbarrow
 7    with packages of water and accompanied by a Sergeant Major.  At the gate
 8    at the entrance to the "White House" he saw a huge pile of rucksacks and
 9    belongings.  A few metres further were all kinds of identity cards and
10    passports on the ground.
11            The "White House" was well guarded by Serb soldiers who refused
12    them entry.
13            Also in front of the house were two Dutch corporals who had been
14    given Lieutenant stars so the Serbs would think they were of higher rank.
15    He and the Sergeant Major then entered the left rear area of the house
16    which was actually two houses under one roof.  There they saw photographs
17    of men laid out in every room, which were empty.  They exited that area
18    and tried to look around an orchard area behind the house but were
19    prevented at gun point by two Serb soldiers.
20            They returned to the entrance and were able to enter after
21    offering Serb soldiers some water.  Once inside, he saw a Muslim man
22    hanging from the staircase by one arm so he asked a Serb soldier to lower
23    him so that his feet could touch the ground.  While this was being done he
24    tried to enter a room on the right side from which he had heard voices but
25    was prevented whether a Serb soldier in a green camouflage uniform put his

 1    gun in his face and eventually stuck it in his mouth.  He then stepped
 2    outside and saw a Serb soldier at the gate telling men arriving at the
 3    house to throw down their things and, a few metres later, telling them to
 4    throw their identity cards.
 5            While the Sergeant Major stayed at the staircase, Lieutenant
 6    Rutten went back inside and upstairs where he found two rooms filled with
 7    50 men and boys from age 12 to 55.  He photographed both groups of men but
 8    will to stop because a Serb soldier was arriving with more men.  They then
 9    left the house.  It was clear to him that this was no normal interrogation
10    as normal procedure with POWs would require a system of identifying the
11    prisoners whereas it was very clear to him that the men in the "White
12    House" would not need their IDs or belongings.  Later that evening the
13    Serbs set fire to the belongings and IDs which were outside the house.
14    The fire burned for two days.
15            He identified a photograph he took of the smoke rising from the
16    fire.  He did not see any signs of violence or torture during the times he
17    visited the "White House."  After leaving the "White House," he went to
18    the area where Lieutenant van Duijn was posted with a blockade of four
19    APCs.  At that location a local interpreter informed him that there were
20    rumours that men had been killed near a well near the road on the Budak
21    side.
22            He, Sergeant Major van Schaik, and Koster then passed through the
23    APC blockade and followed a dirt road.
24            They saw a woman who made a sign along her throat and pointed
25    further up the road.  In a very bushy area they found a small stream on

 1    the left behind a house near a meadow.  As soon as they saw the meadow,
 2    they saw some bodies lying along the stream.  He inspected the bodies,
 3    which were nine men in civilian clothes lying with their faces toward the
 4    stream.
 5            Two were on their sides.  All had small-calibre gun shots to their
 6    backs at heart level.  The men were approximately 45 to 55 years old.
 7            He touched the bodies which were warm.  The blood was still
 8    running and there were no flies on them.  They had not been shot long
 9    before.  He told van Schaik to pick up the identification that was on the
10    grass in front of the bodies and he took a photograph of Koster kneeling
11    between the bodies.  He also photographed all nine bodies.  At that point
12    there was firing at them.  After the first shot, he saw a woman running
13    out of one of the houses in the area chased by a Serb soldier.
14            He told van Schaik to drop all of the identification which he had
15    picked up and that they had to leave.
16            They heard more shooting nearby and reached the dirt road.  At the
17    blockade they grabbed a stretcher so it would look like they were helping
18    some refugees.  He reported what he had seen to Lieutenant Colonel
19    Karremans who told him that he would pass his report on to a higher level.
20            He then remained at the blockade where he took some pictures of
21    what the Serbs were doing and observed a DutchBat Lieutenant and some
22    DutchBat soldiers actually assisting the deportation of the Muslims though
23    trying to do their best to help the refugees.  Looking through the camera
24    it would not give too good an idea of what the UN was doing there.  The
25    situation was that DutchBat personnel had taped an area where about 60 to

 1    70 people could be placed who were then directed to the buses.  Behind
 2    another line were standing all of the rest of the refugees who were being
 3    helped and given water by other DutchBat soldiers.  Because there were
 4    Serb soldiers sitting all along the road with their weapons, DutchBat was
 5    more or less helping with the deportation and not an impartial party any
 6    more.
 7            He told this to van Duijn who had a different point of view.  On
 8    the other side of the line at the buses, Serb soldiers were carrying out
 9    the separation of the men from their families.  UN soldiers were not
10    working with the refugees at the point where the men were being separated
11    from the women.
12            When he returned to Holland he turned his film over to someone
13    from the army's intelligence branch but was later informed that something
14    had happened during its development.
15            He was then ordered by his company commander to escort the last
16    bus that is were leaving.  He and his driver prepared a jeep and parked it
17    next to the compound entrance while waiting for the last buses to leave.
18    As they waited, he told his driver to accompany him back to the "White
19    House" so that he could have as many witnesses as possible.  By that time,
20    the pile of belongings was huge and many more IDs and passports were
21    laying on the ground.  They went to the previously empty left side of the
22    house and saw two Serb soldiers on the staircase which was filled with
23    Muslim men.
24            He could see the total fear on the faces of the men and boys and,
25    though he never thought that it really existed, he could even smell death

 1    there because it was total fear.
 2            Serb soldiers in green camouflage uniforms were taking
 3    deutschmarks from Muslims at gun point.  They walked back to the front of
 4    the house and saw the balcony totally filled with men and boys.  They went
 5    to the right side of the house but could not get in.  He estimates that
 6    almost 300 men were in the house and on the balcony.  It was completely
 7    filled up.
 8            The two Dutch soldiers who were still posted in front of the house
 9    also said that it was completely filled.  He then spoke with a Dutch Major
10    and Warrant Officer Rave about getting the men out of the house.  Rave and
11    Major Kingori then spoke to the Serbs at the "White House" and sometime
12    later buses arrived to take the men away.
13            He could not escort the buses because he had to wait to escort the
14    last buses and no one else could escort them because all of the soldiers
15    who had tried to escort the convoys had been thrown out or their jeeps
16    hijacked by the Serbs.
17            It was no use to escort the buses when they lost all their
18    materiel and were brought back to the compound half an hour or a day
19    later.
20            The escort had not succeeded at all.
21            During his second visit to the "White House," he saw a man whom he
22    identified as being on the left-hand side of Exhibit 28/8.1, which is a
23    photograph depicting two males, one of whom is wearing a T-shirt and
24    facing the camera.
25            He saw this man, who did not look like a plain soldier, speaking

 1    to all of the Serb soldiers who came to the "White House," including
 2    soldiers in black uniforms who arrived in private cars that stopped in
 3    front of the "White House."  Some of these cars arrived from Srebrenica
 4    and others from Potocari.  Their occupants spoke to this man before
 5    driving away.
 6            By the time it was clear that the last buses were filled up, later
 7    in the day on 13 July, the battalion had stopped escorting the convoys
 8    because it was no use any more.  He asked his company ops room if he could
 9    make an attempt to escort the last buses and was given the okay.  So he
10    quickly drove to the head of the convoy which was heading toward OP Papa.
11    After driving approximately a kilometre to a kilometre and a half in
12    Potocari, a private car containing three Serb soldiers in green camouflage
13    uniforms came up behind them.
14            Next another car containing two Serb soldiers came from the side
15    of the road and blocked the road.  The soldiers were pointing weapons at
16    them.  The actions of the two cars appeared well organised.  At his
17    instruction, his driver then made a U-turn and returned to the compound.
18    As a result, the convoy was not escorted.
19            When he returned to the compound he was told to accompany a truck
20    and some medical personnel who were going into Srebrenica to pick up the
21    last elderly people left behind or along the road.  Enroute he was stopped
22    by Serb soldiers who ordered him, his driver and a Sergeant in the back
23    seat out at gun point.  The Serb soldiers told them that they would have
24    to continue on in the truck.  When they reached the Bravo Company
25    compound, he saw Serb looting the compound and driving Dutch APCs filled

 1    with stolen material.  The Serbs had also emptied the weapons collection
 2    point.  Along the road they found a few elderly people whom the medical
 3    personnel treated and placed in the truck.
 4            From what he saw, the Serb soldiers who were in command only had
 5    to say things once and everyone understood what he or what the senior
 6    commander meant, so you could easily tell who was in control.
 7            The Serbs knew exactly who was in charge on the Dutch side and
 8    more or less always addressed the Lieutenants who were around.  They asked
 9    him for his rank and did not speak to the soldiers.  When he was
10    threatened by Serb soldiers as he was gathering information he considered
11    the threats serious and his life could be in danger if he did his job.
12       Q.   Now, Major, that concludes the summary.  Are there any corrections
13    or additions as you sat there and listened to it that you'd care to make?
14       A.   No, there are not, no corrections.
15       Q.   I want to turn your attention in the time we have left to a
16    handful of areas that arise from your prior testimony, and the first is
17    that you testified that during your seven months with DutchBat 3, you
18    experienced a decreasing number of UNHCR convoys.  Do you recall when that
19    decrease began?
20       A.   The decrease began the end of February and the beginning of March
21    and it was a -- an intense decrease because we also got the news that the
22    warehouse in Srebrenica itself, where everything was assembled together,
23    all goods was getting more and more lower on stock.
24       Q.   And how about the DutchBat resupply convoys?  Did they experience
25    a decrease as well?

 1       A.   Yes.  At the same time, more or less, we were also on minimise.
 2    In fact the previous battalion from DutchBat 2 was also on minimise when
 3    we came in but it became more and more severe also the beginning of March.
 4       Q.   I want to turn your attention briefly to the actual VRS attack on
 5    the enclave.  Did you have an opportunity to see what was being struck by
 6    the shelling?
 7       A.   Yes.  Warehouses around the compound itself, what was in our line
 8    of sight and it warehouses near for instance Budak hill that was on the
 9    opposite of the compound.
10       Q.   And when you say compound you're referring to the Potocari
11    compound?
12       A.   Yes, I'm referring to the Potocari compound, yes.
13       Q.   Now, you also testified about the VRS firing along a lane on the
14    Potocari-Srebrenica road.  And that that firing was on or near DutchBat
15    vehicles.  Do you have any specific examples of such firing on or near
16    DutchBat vehicles that you can tell the Trial Chamber about?
17       A.   Yes.  There were more but one specific it was from the hills above
18    OP Papa, it was on a map on the JNA map the hills of Purici, they had
19    their different kinds of weapons there and they shot in a lane towards
20    Potocari, specific -- yeah, something that could even laugh about it
21    later, at least I did, is a story about a colleague, Major Boering, who
22    was in the S5 team came in driving and was shot at with his -- when he
23    came driving in with his jeep and I said to him -- and he was driving
24    quite fast.  And I said to him when he came into the building, "Are you
25    always driving that fast?"  And he couldn't see that as a joke but that is

 1    an example what really happened when every car or every vehicle that came
 2    out of Kadin [phoen] was fired at.
 3       Q.   Now, I want to turn your attention now and ask you a couple of
 4    questions regarding the several hours during which you were being held by
 5    the Serb soldiers after they had taken your weapons and some of your
 6    equipment as well.
 7            Now, after DutchBat withdrew on 21 July, you spent a couple of
 8    days in Zagreb before returning to Holland; is that correct?
 9       A.   Yes, that is correct.
10       Q.   And while in Zagreb, do you recall completing an ICTY, UN peace
11    keeper interview questionnaire?
12       A.   Yes, it's also correct.
13       Q.   And in that questionnaire, you were asked a series of questions
14    related to whether or not you had been captured or subject to restriction
15    on your freedom of movement, do you remember those questions?
16       A.   Yes, they were in the same as well.
17       Q.   One of those questions was can you identify the
18    military/paramilitary/police or other personnel taking you hostage.  Do
19    you recall what your answer was to that question as you sit here?
20            JUDGE AGIUS:  One moment.
21            What's the objection.
22            MS. CONDON:  I hate to interrupt my learned friend.  I would just
23    like a specific reference to the date thereof questionnaire and the page
24    number.
25            JUDGE AGIUS:  I that I that can be handled by Mr. Thayer.

 1            MR. THAYER:  Yes, Your Honour and I apologise.
 2            JUDGE AGIUS:  It's a fair intervention.
 3            MR. THAYER:  That is an undated questionnaire.  The -- it is on
 4    the second page of the document but it's listed on our exhibit list as I
 5    believe UN peacekeeper interview questionnaire, the ERN at the top is
 6    00565014 and I believe it is also the second page of the B/C/S
 7    translation.
 8       Q.   Now, Major, do you remember what your answer was to that question?
 9       A.   Yes.  I spoke to several soldiers and tried to make at least as a
10    normal contact and they had they told me that they were from a special
11    unit from Belgrade and special police unit, they said, because I couldn't
12    identify any symbols or insignia on the uniform.  It was a quite normal
13    conversation.  We spoke about how they came there and asked me also
14    where -- where I was from in Holland and so on, so to me it seemed a very
15    normal conversation with a true and honest belief to it, to what they said
16    at that moment.
17       Q.   You referred to the uniforms.  Do you recall anything in
18    particular about the actual uniform?
19       A.   Yes.  There was a difference because they didn't wear any flak
20    vests, the most of them.  Some of them had and this special police unit
21    had that were light blue flak jackets and they were very interested about
22    ours because we had our -- and they called it "pancir."  Our flak vests
23    were more protective than the ones they had.
24       Q.   How about the rest of the uniforms, do you recall anything
25    particular about the appearance of those?

 1       A.   They were also the camouflage uniforms, yeah.
 2       Q.   Now, what -- in what language were you conducting this
 3    conversation?
 4       A.   It was -- they were not that good on English but they spoke in
 5    mostly in German with some words Serbo-Croatian in between but in German
 6    they managed quite well.
 7       Q.   So when you use the term here special police, is that your term or
 8    is that the term that the soldiers used when you were speaking with them?
 9       A.   No.  They used the term "Specijalni," and that means such as
10    Special Forces, not the Special Forces that the word that we use in the
11    army then we mean Special Forces commandos and so on but they were special
12    police force, a force, especially with a special task that they said to
13    me.
14       Q.   And what if anything did they tell you about their relationship
15    with the army?
16       A.   They didn't tell nothing much about that.  They didn't go in
17    detail to that.  At least, as I tried they weren't giving any answers to
18    that.
19       Q.   Now, I want to turn your attention to the nine bodies.  With
20    respect to those nine bodies you discovered, you testified that you
21    observed identification documents scattered around those bodies.  Can you
22    describe those documents with any detail for the Trial Chamber, please?
23       A.   Yes.  Well, all kinds of identity cards.  We hadn't that much time
24    to review them specific but I saw them earlier used in the enclave, a kind
25    of working permit, small cards, with sometimes with pass photos on it and

 1    all kinds of papers were lying around those bodies, also including some
 2    passports.
 3       Q.   So specifically with respect to these documents that you saw
 4    around the bodies, did any of them bear photographs?
 5       A.   Yes, they did, yeah.
 6       Q.   And from what you saw, Major, did you observe any evidence that
 7    the bodies had been moved from one location to the other?
 8       A.   No, there were no traces of that, no.
 9       Q.   Any blood trails, for example, anything like that?
10       A.   No, no, no, no.  They were shot on spot there and were never
11    moved.
12       Q.   I want to turn your attention to your contact with Lieutenant van
13    Duijn.  You testified that you and then Lieutenant van Duijn had had a
14    difference of opinion as to the appearance and what you perceived to be
15    the consequences of his actions at the APC blockade on 13 July.  Now, was
16    there anything in particular about the separation process which you saw
17    that gave rise to your response or your opposition to what you saw
18    Lieutenant van Duijn doing?
19       A.   Lieutenant van Duijn was at a certain spot and I was more around,
20    and I saw more in detail what happened around the compound and I was also
21    along the line of buses so I could easier see also in the neighbourhood of
22    the "White House" what had happened over there, and to my opinion he
23    wasn't quite aware of what was really happening as a result of his actions
24    near to those four APCs.  So there was a difference in opinion.  And I was
25    behind those APCs making some photos and, yeah, if you look into a camera,

 1    it's, yeah, you see a different picture, a narrow picture, and then, yeah,
 2    looking -- it didn't look that good to me so that was the reason that I
 3    picked out the discussion with Lieutenant van Duijn.
 4       Q.   Now, you referred to a long line of buses.  Was there anything
 5    going on along that line of buses which contributed to your opposition or
 6    response to what Lieutenant van Duijn was doing?
 7       A.   In fact, he was assembling groups or helping with it and the
 8    moment the groups, the line was lowered, the group started moving to the
 9    buses, and it was on the front side so on the compound side that these
10    moved but at the back side of the buses where the houses were and also
11    where also that "White House," was there were all along that line Serb
12    soldiers and that it was not in the line of sight of Lieutenant van Duijn
13    so at that line, easily men and boys could pick -- pick out of the line
14    and were brought or sent to the houses directed by the Serbs.
15       Q.   And when you refer to the line are you referring to the line of
16    buses?
17       A.   Yes, I'm referring to the line of buss.
18       Q.   And did you actually see men or boys being separated out by those
19    soldiers that were along that line of buses?
20       A.   Yes, yes, I actually saw that, yeah.
21       Q.   Now, when we met first a couple of weeks ago do you recall that I
22    showed you an aerial photograph of the Potocari base?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   And at that time, did that photo have any names of any buildings
25    or landmarks marked on it already or did you identify those for me from

 1    your memory at that time?
 2       A.   It was a photograph with no identification on it and I marked them
 3    out again to clear the picture again, yeah.
 4       Q.   And you did that with little stickies that you placed?
 5       A.   Yes, the yellow stickers, yes.
 6       Q.   Did I also ask you to trace the route that you took to the
 7    location where you discovered the nine bodies?
 8       A.   Yes, you did.
 9       Q.   And you did that without actually marking the exhibit, just
10    showing me with ...
11       A.   With a pencil.
12       Q.   Now, did I subsequently show you a similar aerial photograph of
13    the Potocari base which you yourself had marked during your testimony in
14    the Krstic trial?
15       A.   Yes, you also did.
16       Q.   And do you remember that you were asked to mark -- let me withdraw
17    that question.  Do you remember what you were asked to mark during the
18    Krstic trial on that exhibit?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   And what was that, sir?
21       A.   That was the spot of the -- where I found that nine bodies, yeah.
22            THE INTERPRETER:  Interpreter's note:  Could you please make a
23    pause because of overlap, please.
24            MR. THAYER:  Yes, I'm receiving a message from the interpreters.
25    I apologise.

 1            JUDGE AGIUS:  Thank you.  Please comply.
 2            MR. THAYER:
 3       Q.   In addition to the spot, Major, did you also indicate the route on
 4    that exhibit that you took to that?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   Group of bodies?
 7       A.   It's also marked out, yes.
 8       Q.   And when you compared the route that you had traced for me with
 9    the route that you showed in Krstic, how were they in terms of their
10    similarity or lack of similarity?
11       A.   To me they were exactly the same.
12       Q.   At this time, if we could be shown 65 ter 1522, please?  Or
13    P02179.  Either way.
14            Do you have an image on your screen, sir?
15       A.   Yes, I have the image, yes.
16       Q.   And do you recognise that document?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   And what is that document, sir?
19       A.   That document is the place where I marked the route and the place
20    where I found the bodies and this is the situation that I found in 1995,
21    July 1995, and also marked this one out in the Krstic case.  It's the
22    same.
23       Q.   Okay.  Now, in some of your prior statements and on the sketch you
24    drew in connection with the so-called Kodak team investigation, you
25    referred to a location where you saw Muslim men being taken on the first

 1    day of the transportations.  Do you know or can you tell the Trial Chamber
 2    what that general area or location was called on the first day of the
 3    transportations?
 4       A.   It were the houses what you see between the yellow line there and
 5    also already the "White House," it's in the opposite of the compound?
 6       Q.   Now, focusing your attention to the 12th, you referred to two
 7    houses?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   Was that near an area that went by any other name?
10       A.   Yes.  That was the area of the car wash, the blue -- a blue
11    building, yeah; it was a former car wash.
12       Q.   If you would with Madam Usher's assistance just take the stylus
13    that's next to the --
14       A.   Okay.  So --
15       Q.   Would you just circle the area you're referring to as the car wash
16    and just write "car wash" next to that?
17       A.   [Marks].
18       Q.   And if you would identify the two houses that you referred to
19    where you saw Muslim men being taken on the first day of the
20    transportations, and if you would just next to that write, "First day"?
21       A.   [Marks].
22       Q.   Okay.  Now, would you please mark the area where you were held by
23    the special police soldiers with an A?
24       A.   [Marks].
25       Q.   Again, keeping your attention on the 12th of July, can you just

 1    mark with small letter Rs the areas where the refugees were located on the
 2    12th?
 3       A.   [Marks].
 4       Q.   And how about in relation to the -- let me ask you first question.
 5    On this photograph, can you identify the area where those four APCs that
 6    you referred to are located and if you could just write APCs next to that?
 7       A.   [Marks].
 8       Q.   And on the 12th, can you mark again with some small Rs where the
 9    refugees were who were waiting to pass through that blockade as we have
10    referred to it were located?
11       A.   This is the line of of the refugees here?
12       Q.   On the 12th, how far back did that line extend?
13       A.   It was almost along the road.  It's here, it's almost -- this
14    whole area was packed until the APCs -- the line behind the APC.
15       Q.   For the record describing a rectangular area emanating from a
16    circle in the centre of an image at the top of which is a letter R.
17            MR. THAYER:  I see that we are right up against the break,
18    Your Honour.  I think we'll have to initial this and save it and then work
19    with it a little bit more tomorrow?
20            JUDGE AGIUS:  Yeah.  You need to put your signature top right-hand
21    corner, please.  You can write it with the stylus.
22            THE WITNESS:  [Marks].
23            MR. THAYER:  Your Honour, I have just a few more questions.  I
24    should be able to finish in five to ten minutes tomorrow.
25            JUDGE AGIUS:  We can't overstay because we will be keeping the

 1    other Trial Chamber starting on time.
 2            Major, we won't finish tomorrow and Friday we are not sitting, so
 3    that means we will continue and finish with you on Monday.
 4            THE WITNESS:  Okay.
 5            JUDGE AGIUS:  I thank you so much for everything and.
 6                          [Trial Chamber confers]
 7            JUDGE AGIUS:  In the meantime, it is important that between now
 8    and tomorrow and then after tomorrow until Monday, you do not communicate
 9    or let anyone communicate with you in relation to the matters that you are
10    testifying upon.
11            THE WITNESS:  Okay, sir.
12            JUDGE AGIUS:  Okay.  Thank you.  We stand adjourned until tomorrow
13    morning at 9.00.  That's it.  Thank you.
14                           --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at 1.46 p.m.,

15                          to be reconvened on Thursday, the 30th day of
16                          November, 2006, at 9.00 a.m.
