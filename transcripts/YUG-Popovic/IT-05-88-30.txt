          3                 [The witness entered court]
          4                 --- Upon commencing at 9.35 a.m.
          5                 [The accused entered court]
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          7  morning, ladies and gentlemen; good morning,
          8  technicians; good morning, interpreters.  I can see
          9  that they are there.  Good morning to our assistants,
         10  representatives of the Registrar.  Good morning,
         11  counsel for the Prosecution, counsel for Defence.  Good
         12  morning, General Krstic.
         13            Good morning, Witness J.  Have you had a good
         14  rest?
         15            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, I have,
         16  Your Honour.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Did you
         18  have a nice weekend here in The Hague?
         19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, it was
         20  good.  Thank you.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Let me just
         22  remind you, Witness, that you are still under oath, and
         23  you will continue answering questions that will be put
         24  to you by Mr. Cayley, whom you know already.
         25            Mr. Cayley, you have the floor.

          1            MR. CAYLEY:  Good morning, Mr. President,
          2  Your Honours, counsel.
          3                 WITNESS:  WITNESS J [Resumed]
          4                 Examined by Mr. Cayley:  [Cont'd]
          5       Q.   Good morning, Witness J.
          6       A.   Good morning.
          7       Q.   Now, Witness J, I'm just going to refresh
          8  your memory as to where we were on Friday and what you
          9  said to the Judges --
         10       A.   Yes.
         11       Q.   -- so that I can give you the point in time
         12  which we reached in your testimony.
         13            Now, you explained to the Judges that on the
         14  12th of July of 1995 you found yourself in a meadow, in
         15  a place called Lolici.  Do you recall that?
         16       A.   No, we were not there on the 12th, we were in
         17  Lolici on the 13th.  And on the 12th we were still in
         18  Jaglici.
         19       Q.   Yes, you're quite right, Witness.  Thank you
         20  for correcting me.  And I think you explained to the
         21  Judges that the Bosnian Serb soldiers searched you for
         22  money; do you recall that?
         23       A.   Yes, they did.
         24       Q.   And I think you also said to the Judges that
         25  you heard someone whisper in front of you that there

          1  were about 2.000 Muslim men on the meadow; do you
          2  recall that?
          3       A.   Yes.  Yes, I do.
          4       Q.   I think we got to a point in time when you
          5  explained that water was brought to you and a man in
          6  front of you complained that he had not had any water,
          7  and then a soldier beat him and then shot him.
          8       A.   Yes, and he killed him.  The soldier killed
          9  the civilian who had asked for water.  He said that
         10  somebody had had water two times already and that he
         11  hadn't had any water so far, so two soldiers kicked
         12  him; one kicked him on the left side of his head, the
         13  other on the right side, and he started bleeding from
         14  his mouth.  So one of them then grabbed him by the neck
         15  and the other took him as well, and they dragged him
         16  away some six metres and they shot him, and he remained
         17  there, lying dead.
         18       Q.   Now, I think the next thing that happened to
         19  you is some Bosnian Serb soldiers recognised a Muslim
         20  police officer amongst you; do you recall that?
         21       A.   Yes, I recall that.  They recognised a
         22  policeman who was a neighbour of mine, who used to work
         23  in Vlasenica during peacetime.  So they pointed their
         24  finger at him and one of them called him out.  He
         25  addressed him by his last name and he told him, "Come

          1  here."  So he came up and five or six soldiers gathered
          2  around him, they said hello to him, all of them, and I
          3  was glad to see that because I thought, well, here's
          4  someone who knows us, so they might help us.
          5            But they took him away to a house that was
          6  situated on the left-hand side, and they stayed there
          7  for about one hour, one hour and a half, and after
          8  that, three of them came back with him.  And they stood
          9  next to us, on the left side, and he called his brother
         10  and he said, "Give me your jacket," so he did and they
         11  asked him, "Who is this guy here?" and he said, "This
         12  is my brother."  And then he turned around and he
         13  called his second brother.  So they left again, they
         14  went in the right direction, towards the house where
         15  the wounded were, and I don't know what happened to
         16  them.  I didn't hear shots but I never saw them again.
         17       Q.   Now, Witness, these three men, they were
         18  taken away by Bosnian Serb soldiers.
         19       A.   Yes, the soldiers, and ever since then we
         20  haven't heard of them.
         21            JUDGE RIAD:  Excuse me.  He said they were
         22  taken to the house where the wounded were.  Who was
         23  wounded?
         24       A.   Above the house, behind the house where the
         25  wounded were.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  There were wounded people behind
          2  the house?
          3       A.   The wounded were in the house, and the three
          4  brothers were taken above the house, to the right-hand
          5  side, and I haven't heard of them ever since.
          6            MR. CAYLEY:
          7       Q.   Witness, were there Muslim wounded in the
          8  house to which the three brothers were taken?
          9       A.   Yes, there were wounded in the house.
         10            MR. CAYLEY:  Your Honour Judge Riad, does
         11  that answer your question?
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes.  Thank you very much.
         13            MR. CAYLEY:
         14       Q.   Now, Witness, there was a road that ran in
         15  front of the meadow where you were sitting.  Do you
         16  recall --
         17       A.   Yes, an asphalt road.
         18       Q.   Do you recall at any time seeing buses or
         19  trucks on that road?
         20       A.   Both buses and trucks were passing and they
         21  were travelling from Potocari towards Milici.  They
         22  were transporting civilians from Potocari.
         23       Q.   Did you see the people on those buses and
         24  trucks?
         25       A.   Yes, there were people, including women and

          1  children.
          2       Q.   Did you recognise them as your people?
          3       A.   I couldn't recognise anyone.  I wasn't really
          4  watching.  I kept my head down because I kept thinking
          5  only about my fate.
          6       Q.   Now, while you were in Lolici, I think the
          7  Bosnian Serb soldiers asked for 30 volunteers from the
          8  men.  Do you recall that?
          9       A.   Yes, I recall that.  They came to us and they
         10  said that they needed about 30 young men, aged
         11  approximately 25.  So 30 of them came out and they
         12  boarded a truck.  They gave them some shovels and the
         13  truck left.  I don't know what happened to them.  I
         14  don't know where they were taken, but any trace of them
         15  was lost.
         16       Q.   I think there came a time when a VRS officer
         17  came to the meadow, do you remember that, and gave
         18  assurances that everything would be all right.
         19       A.   First they searched us, looking for money,
         20  asking for money.  And there was one person whom they
         21  addressed as Madzarevic, and Madzarevic -- people were
         22  from Visnjica.  One of them had blonde hair and a
         23  ponytail, and he had some kind of black bandanna on his
         24  head.  So they searched us and they took six marks from
         25  me and -- 600 marks and some necklaces that belonged to

          1  my daughter.
          2            And then Mladic came and he spoke to us.  The
          3  first thing he said was, "Isn't this better than to get
          4  killed?  Naser has abandoned you.  He fled to Tuzla.
          5  It is not a very good idea to wage war with Serbs.  We
          6  have almost evacuated all of our families and they have
          7  been put up in Tuzla, Kladanj, and Zivinice, and most
          8  probably within a day or two you will be exchanged as
          9  well.  Everyone will find his family.  Nobody is going
         10  to beat you.  Nobody is going to provoke you.  You will
         11  be given food and you're very hot here so we will find
         12  you some shade."
         13            So everybody applauded, saying "Thank you,
         14  sir.  Thank you, General."  He kind of encouraged us.
         15  But I wanted to speak to him and he said, "What's the
         16  problem?"  I said, "General, you see I'm barefoot, I've
         17  lost my boots.  I have a pair of shoes in my backpack.
         18  Can I go and get them?"  And then he told me, "You will
         19  get a pair of shoes."  And then I said, "Thank you,
         20  General."  And then he left.
         21            Then 15 -- 20 minutes later, the one who was
         22  wearing a civilian uniform, without any insignia, he
         23  said -- he told us to make a column by four.  So the
         24  one who had given this order was a few metres away from
         25  us.

          1       Q.   If I could interrupt you just to clarify one
          2  thing.  Did Mladic say to you that your families had
          3  been evacuated to Tuzla, Kladanj, and Zivinice?
          4       A.   Yes.
          5       Q.   Thank you.  Now, you then said 30 minutes
          6  later you were instructed to --
          7       A.   Between 20 and 30 minutes later.
          8       Q.   -- you were instructed to make a column for 4
          9  by 4.  Can you tell the Judges once you formed that
         10  column where you went?
         11       A.   I didn't know the area.  When I -- after I
         12  had come out with the person who had been with me in
         13  the warehouse, he told me that we were somewhere near
         14  Kravica.  They brought us to a warehouse and both sides
         15  of the column, there would be a Serb soldiers every six
         16  metres armed with automatic rifles.  They had
         17  ammunition belts across their chests, and they were
         18  marching us a warehouse where a bus was parked just
         19  outside the warehouse.  And I entered the warehouse
         20  through the second door, not the first one.
         21            So the warehouse was completely full, and I
         22  found a seat in one of the corners of the warehouse.
         23  And the soldier who was standing at the right side of
         24  the warehouse, he cursed at me and he told me to sit
         25  down.  And I told him that I wanted to stand, to lean

          1  against the wall because I had back pain.  And this is
          2  how I sat down in that warehouse.
          3       Q.   Witness, before we move to the next part of
          4  your testimony.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
          6  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/4, please.
          7       Q.   The column of men that you described to the
          8  Judges, do you recall how long that column was?
          9       A.   According to my estimate, because I could see
         10  it when we turned around the curve, I was somewhere in
         11  the middle of the column.  I think that the column was
         12  between 400 and 500 metres long.  I couldn't tell the
         13  exact number, but this is according to my estimate.
         14  Because we were all terrified.  We didn't know what was
         15  going to happen to us.
         16       Q.   I understand that, Witness.  When you entered
         17  the warehouse, how full was it with Muslim men.  Do you
         18  recall?
         19       A.   The warehouse was completely full.  If you
         20  had thrown a lighter or a match inside, it would have
         21  stayed on somebody's shoulder or in somebody's lap, it
         22  couldn't have fallen on the ground.
         23            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. Usher, if you could first of
         24  all put the photograph in front of the witness and let
         25  the witness look at it.

          1       Q.   Now, Witness, I've shown you this photograph?
          2       A.   This is the first door, the first entrance
          3  and this is the second one [indicates].  And this is
          4  where I entered through the second one, and this is
          5  where I got out, through this door.
          6            The truck, the excavator was there when I got
          7  out the night between Thursday and Friday.
          8       Q.   Witness, if you could stop for a moment.
          9            MR. CAYLEY:  And Mr. Usher, if you could
         10  place the photograph on to the ELMO.
         11       Q.   Witness, what I want you to do now, I don't
         12  want you to speak, I just want you to point to the door
         13  in the warehouse through which you entered, and you can
         14  use the pointer.
         15            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. Usher, if you could give the
         16  witness the pointer.
         17       A.   It is through this door that I entered
         18  [indicates].
         19       Q.   Witness, you'll need to point on the
         20  photograph.  Can you see which door?
         21       A.   This door here [indicates].
         22       Q.   If you could keep the pointer on that door.
         23            MR. CAYLEY:   Mr. Usher, if you could help
         24  the witness.
         25            Let the record show that the witness is

          1  indicating a small door on the right-hand side of the
          2  photograph.  It's a small door with some writing above
          3  it and it's the last door on the extreme right hand of
          4  the photograph.
          5       Q.   And that's the warehouse, is it, Witness,
          6  which you entered?
          7       A.   Yes.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Usher.
          9       Q.   Witness, if you could explain to the Judges
         10  what you recall happened next?
         11       A.   In the warehouse, when we got in, when the
         12  last person entered through the same door where I had
         13  entered, he didn't have a place to sit down, so he
         14  remained standing.  And he was kicked by a Serb soldier
         15  in the back.  And the soldier told him -- he cursed at
         16  him and he told him to sit down.  And this man turned
         17  around and he said, "I have no room to sit down."  And
         18  then there was a burst of gunfire that mowed him down.
         19  And all of a sudden there was a lot of shooting in the
         20  warehouse, and we didn't know where it was coming
         21  from.
         22            There were rifles, grenades, bursts of
         23  gunfire and it was -- it got so dark in the warehouse
         24  that we couldn't see anything.  People started to
         25  scream, to shout, crying for help.  And then there

          1  would be a lull, and then all of a sudden it would
          2  start again.  And they kept shooting like that until
          3  nightfall in the warehouse.
          4            I managed to reach an outside gate, a little
          5  booth, and I found a neighbour of mine there, and he
          6  told me to lie down.  And I asked him if he was wounded
          7  and he wasn't, and he asked me if I was wounded and I
          8  wasn't either.  And there was blood underneath and I
          9  couldn't take it any longer.  I pulled a dead body over
         10  me, and this is how I remained for about 24 hours in
         11  the warehouse.
         12            In the next morning, one could tell that it
         13  was dawning.  This neighbour of mine stood up, and he
         14  said that he needed to urinate because he was thirsty,
         15  he couldn't take it anymore.  So I grabbed him --
         16  pulled him by his coat and told him to lie down but
         17  then there was a burst of gunfire and he fell down.
         18            So I spent the whole day of the 14th of July
         19  in the warehouse.  I didn't know what time of day it
         20  was.  Somebody asked us at one point if there was
         21  anyone healthy amongst us to join their army.  So a
         22  couple of people went out but I didn't watch.  So I
         23  don't know who left.
         24            And there was a sound of a truck that left,
         25  but I don't know in which direction it left.

          1            All of a sudden, I could hear a voice
          2  crying, "Salko, Salko," for about 15 times.  And then
          3  somebody cursed us about our Turkish mothers.  And then
          4  we heard a voice, "Is there anybody alive amongst you?"
          5  And then we heard a shoot and then everything went
          6  quiet.  After one hour, perhaps an hour and a half,
          7  somebody started to shout, to cry, "Adila, Adila, get
          8  me some water."
          9            And then again, we could hear curses and
         10  somebody asked if anyone was still alive.  And then we
         11  heard shots and everything went quiet again.  Everybody
         12  was silent.
         13            I forgot to tell you that they had asked
         14  about wounded.  They wanted to know if anybody was
         15  wounded, and they said that there would be an ambulance
         16  that would take them to the hospital.  So the wounded
         17  people crawled out, and they were killed immediately
         18  outside the warehouse.
         19            When this guy who was crying for water was
         20  killed, nobody spoke a word in the warehouse.
         21            Then we heard a sound and I thought that the
         22  vehicles were passing on the asphalt road and I could
         23  tell that the sound was approaching but I didn't know
         24  what was happening.  When it became dark, we heard
         25  voices, "Cover the asphalt with the hay," and that

          1  there was a truck that arrived and somebody said, "It's
          2  enough for today."  So they covered the whole area with
          3  hay and I thought they wanted to set it on fire, but
          4  they didn't.
          5            When it became dark, I realised that nobody
          6  was alive in the warehouse.  I couldn't hear a single
          7  voice, a single sound.  So I began to crawl out, and I
          8  sat down.  But I was so weak and I couldn't -- couldn't
          9  leave.  I just sat there for about one hour, an hour
         10  and a half.  I was trying to stretch a little bit to
         11  get my bearings.
         12            But then at one point I had heard a whisper
         13  and I didn't know whether it was coming from inside the
         14  warehouse or outside the warehouse, because I was
         15  sitting next to a door.
         16            And I tried to walk across those dead bodies
         17  towards the whisper and I found two persons in the
         18  warehouse and I told them let's flee, let's get out of
         19  here.  One of them was very young, he was a tall guy
         20  and he said we couldn't go together.  I said, "I don't
         21  know where to go.  I don't know where I am."  But he
         22  said, "We couldn't go together."  And I asked him where
         23  he was from.  He said he was from Lolici.  And I wanted
         24  to go with him, because he knew the area.  But he kept
         25  telling me that we couldn't go together.  So I wanted

          1  to know where the other guy was from and he addressed
          2  him by his first name, but he told me that this other
          3  person couldn't hear very well.
          4            So I stood up, I wanted to go with them, but
          5  they wouldn't let me.  So I came out and I was standing
          6  behind the excavator.  It was a very bright night, and
          7  the visibility was very good.
          8            All of a sudden, somebody said
          9  [indiscernible] and I heard a soldier and at one point,
         10  I lied down.  And the voice said, "Get up."  But I kept
         11  lying down.  And he went on like that for about two or
         12  three times and then he said, "Stand up."  And all of a
         13  sudden I jumped up, and I went -- I left the warehouse
         14  which was on my left-hand side and I went towards the
         15  river, towards the brook where I drank some water.
         16       Q.   Witness, at this point I want to ask you a
         17  few questions about what happened in the warehouse.
         18            I know that you're now talking about your
         19  escape from the warehouse.  So if you could just listen
         20  to a few questions that I have about the warehouse.
         21            Now, you said in your evidence that when the
         22  shooting subsided, you went and hid.  You reached an
         23  outside gate, a reception booth.  Do you recall that?
         24       A.   In the warehouse.
         25       Q.   In the warehouse.  Do you recall that?

          1       A.   When I was getting out of the warehouse?
          2  When I left it?
          3       Q.   No.  I want you to think about when you were
          4  actually in the warehouse, and I think you survived by
          5  hiding in a reception booth.
          6       A.   Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
          7       Q.   You were in a sort of an office --
          8       A.   It was a kind of reception booth, yes, rather
          9  like that, a small hut.
         10       Q.   And it was inside the warehouse.
         11       A.   Yes, it was.  Next to the warehouse, attached
         12  to the warehouse.
         13       Q.   Was it inside the warehouse building or was
         14  it outside, completely outside the warehouse?
         15       A.   From the warehouse I entered that reception
         16  booth.  It was all under one roof, but it was separate
         17  from the warehouse where the dead were.  But there were
         18  some dead there too, inside the warehouse where I was.
         19       Q.   Now, in the reception booth, you covered
         20  yourself with a dead body; is that right?
         21       A.   A body, yes.
         22       Q.   And do you recall how long you lay under that
         23  dead body?
         24       A.   I lay there for 24 hours, in the warehouse,
         25  under a dead body.  I was brought to the warehouse on a

          1  Thursday, about 4.00, 4.30, and the next Friday, on the
          2  14th, I left the warehouse.
          3       Q.   Could you see any of the concrete floor
          4  around you, or were there bodies covering the whole
          5  floor?
          6       A.   No where could you stand on the concrete
          7  floor without stepping on a dead body.  The dead bodies
          8  had covered the entire concrete.
          9       Q.   And your clothes, did you have blood on your
         10  clothes?
         11       A.   I brought my sweater to Zivinice, which was
         12  bloodstained, when this Muskic from Cerska, when he was
         13  killed at Baljkovica.  And there were people who saw
         14  how bloodstained my sweater was.  I couldn't throw it
         15  away because it was cold at night, but it stank to me,
         16  never mind other people, but still I had to put it on
         17  again.  And I reached Zepa with it, and from Zepa, with
         18  that sweater, I got to Zivinice.
         19       Q.   Now, you mentioned that when you walked out
         20  of the factory, you saw an excavator; do you recall
         21  that?
         22       A.   I do.  When we went out, I heard someone say
         23  that they were collecting the dead and loading them
         24  onto this truck.  And when they were washing the
         25  asphalt, it was covered in blood, so they brought the

          1  water tank to wash it.  And what we heard was the
          2  loading of the dead onto the truck.  Where they took
          3  them, I don't know.
          4       Q.   Was there a time when you feared that you
          5  would be loaded alive onto a truck with all of these
          6  bodies?
          7       A.   What normal person would not be afraid?  I
          8  kept thinking, why didn't I get killed, or I might get
          9  loaded onto the truck alive.
         10       Q.   Did you hear the excavator loading bodies?
         11  Did you hear the engines of the excavator loading
         12  bodies?
         13       A.   Of course I heard it loading, only I didn't
         14  know what it was until they said that the excavator
         15  should park.
         16       Q.   Now, I think you've already explained to the
         17  Judges that there came a time when you escaped from out
         18  of the warehouse and a Serb soldier saw you as you were
         19  crossing the road; do you recall that?
         20       A.   We weren't crossing the road.  I reached the
         21  road; he was to the right of the asphalt road, I was on
         22  the left-hand side when he stopped me.  I lay down.
         23  The third time he yelled "Get up," I jumped up, I ran
         24  towards the river, the warehouse was left behind me to
         25  the left, and there wasn't a shot fired behind me.  I

          1  didn't hear him shout "Stop" again.  I crossed the
          2  river to some maize fields.
          3       Q.   Witness, when you say that "he" yelled at you
          4  and "he" said get up, are you referring to the Bosnian
          5  Serb soldier?
          6       A.   I imagine it was a soldier.  Why he didn't
          7  shoot, whether he thought it was one of them -- I
          8  believe he must have thought it was one of them,
          9  because they were 100 per cent sure that there was not
         10  a living soul left in the warehouse.
         11       Q.   Now, the next part of your evidence you
         12  simply need to answer my questions yes or no.
         13            I think you eventually managed to get to the
         14  town of Zepa on the 26th of July, with some of your
         15  colleagues; is that right?
         16       A.   But for five days I was in Podbrdze and then
         17  I reached Zepa.  This person new Podbrdze well, the one
         18  who escaped with me.  For five days he led me around
         19  Podbrdze.  If it hadn't been for him, I would have
         20  never got out.  He knew the ground; he knew every
         21  village.  And every night we tried to cross the asphalt
         22  road but they were controlling it all night and all
         23  day.
         24            So during the night we would go into the
         25  woods and they would cry out, "Come on, balija, come

          1  down."  They swore at Alija.  Then they would call out
          2  Muslim names, "Zulfa," "Mustafa," "Alija, come on, come
          3  down.  Surrender.  No one will hurt you."  I thought
          4  they must have noticed someone.  So we couldn't cross
          5  the road.  I tried to persuade him to go to Zepa.  He
          6  wouldn't.  He knew the road to Baljkovica.
          7            We reached a place called Jela.  We found
          8  some more of our men there; I knew some of them.  I
          9  tried to persuade them to go to Zepa, that we should go
         10  together.  Then one of them answered, "My child is
         11  hungry, he will die of hunger."  "He will die anyway if
         12  there is no food, I said."  One man was wounded.  A
         13  bullet had entered here [indicates] and come out here
         14  [indicates] but no real damage was done.  He was a
         15  relative.  He told me that there was a forester who had
         16  a transistor radio and that Zepa still hadn't fallen.
         17  So I said, "Let's go to Zepa."  This one from Cerska
         18  wouldn't.  He insisted on going to Cerska.
         19            While we were sitting there in a garden, we
         20  were looking for apples or pears or anything to eat, we
         21  heard bursts of fire above the village of Jela.  These
         22  bursts of fire were heard, we hid, and then somebody
         23  appeared in an olive-grey shirt, with a long beard.  I
         24  thought it was a Serb soldier.  Then I pointed my
         25  finger at him, to this one from Cerska, but he said,

          1  "No, no, he's one of us."
          2            Then two came, both were deaf and dumb, and
          3  they stayed on with this man from Cerska.  And then me
          4  and two others headed towards Zepa.  They asked me, "Do
          5  you know the way?"  I said, "I don't.  If only I could
          6  see Rogac, then I would be able to find my way."  And
          7  so we went through the woods.
          8            Up above Jela, on a hilltop, we saw eight
          9  dead.  Those dead were found when they went to collect
         10  the bones.  I told them where we had seen them.  I
         11  reached Rogac.  I should have crossed Koprivne, which I
         12  knew very well because I went hunting there.  I had to
         13  go around a house that had some very dangerous
         14  watchdogs.  I heard a voice.  The three of us went to
         15  the right.  We sat down in a grass field, and after
         16  four or five minutes, I saw two men appearing where we
         17  had been.  I didn't say anything to the others.  Then
         18  one of them noticed and said, "Look.  Do you see
         19  that?"  And I said, "I do."  "What are we going to
         20  do?"  "Well, they can't see us."  And when the two of
         21  them headed towards us, across the field -- the grass
         22  hadn't been cut and they were heading towards us.  So I
         23  said, "Let's run," and then the other said, "Well,
         24  let's see, maybe they are ours."  And then I said,
         25  "Well, how come we are here?"

          1            They came up close, then the last one slipped
          2  and I saw that he had something on his back and I
          3  realised he was one of ours.
          4       Q.   Witness, I realise that the trip that you
          5  made to Zepa was very difficult and very frightening,
          6  but I would just like you to simply confirm a number of
          7  points to the Judges by simply answering yes or no.
          8  Otherwise, I think we're going to be here a very long
          9  time, and I know you want to go home to Bosnia
         10  tomorrow.  So simply answer yes or no.  Do you
         11  understand?
         12       A.   Why should I say yes or no to your
         13  questions?
         14       Q.   Did you arrive in Zepa on the 26th of July.
         15       A.   On the 26th of July, I arrived in Zepa, about
         16  3.00 in the afternoon.
         17       Q.   And then I think, on the 29th of July, Zepa
         18  fell, you --
         19       A.   On the 29th, Zepa fell.
         20       Q.   You left Zepa and you spent a long time --
         21  Witness, listen to my question and simply answer yes or
         22  no to the question.
         23            I think you left Zepa on the 29th of July and
         24  you spent over 40 days wandering in Bosnian Serb
         25  territory, and then you eventually made your way to the
          1  free territory on the 17th of September of 1995.  Is
          2  that right?  Just yes or no.
          3       A.   Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
          4       Q.   Thank you, Witness.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I have no further
          6  questions for the witness.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness J,
          8  you are now going to answer questions that
          9  Mr. Petrusic, the Defence counsel, is going to put to
         10  you.
         11            Mr. Petrusic, you have the floor.
         12            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, and
         13  good morning, Your Honours, my learned friends
         14  opposite.
         15                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         16       Q.   Good morning, Witness.  I shall do my best,
         17  in the course of this examination, not to take you back
         18  too much to your experiences, terrible experiences, and
         19  as a wise man, I hope we will understand one another
         20  and be able to cooperate well.
         21            Before I begin with my questions, I should
         22  like to raise a purely technical matter so as to
         23  facilitate the work of the interpreters and all of us
         24  here present, and that is that when I put a question to
         25  you, as we speak the same language, could you wait a

          1  couple of seconds before giving your answer?
          2       A.   I will.
          3       Q.   Witness J, at the beginning of your
          4  testimony, you said that the assembly of Muslim men was
          5  held in Jaglici.
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   And only able-bodied men attended.
          8       A.   There were men; there were boys of 15 to 17
          9  years of age.
         10       Q.   Did anyone of the military leaders of
         11  Srebrenica give you an order to gather at Jaglici?
         12       A.   We were informed by couriers that Srebrenica
         13  was to fall.  On that day, I spent the day collecting
         14  hay.  The couriers came, "Srebrenica has fallen.  The
         15  old men, women, and children are going to Potocari and
         16  the others to the woods."  The assembly was held at
         17  Jaglici, so we rallied there on the 11th, in the
         18  evening.
         19       Q.   If we can call this an order to go into the
         20  woods, was it accepted by all the men who had rallied
         21  there?
         22       A.   Of course it was accepted to go towards Tuzla
         23  and be what may.
         24       Q.   There were no opposite opinions?
         25       A.   I was not able to notice any.  We were

          1  there.  I went from Jaglici, on the 12th, at twenty to
          2  one.
          3       Q.   Do you perhaps know, or did you perhaps hear
          4  from men who went through all this with you that there
          5  was a conflict in Jaglici between two different
          6  currents of members of the 28th Division?
          7       A.   Between whom and whom, do you mean?
          8       Q.   That there were two groups.  One group was in
          9  favour of Potocari and the other was in favour of
         10  making a breakthrough.
         11       A.   That was above Ravne Njive.  Those who had to
         12  go to Potocari went to Potocari, and those who went
         13  into the woods went towards Jaglici.  At Ravne Njive
         14  they separated from their families, who went to
         15  Potocari, and we went towards Jaglici.
         16       Q.   Yes, I understand that you separated from
         17  your families.  But when you rallied at Jaglici, were
         18  there any incidents there, and even weapons being used
         19  by various commanders?
         20       A.   At Jaglici there were no incidents while I
         21  was there.
         22       Q.   Thank you, Witness J.  Buljim Brdo was within
         23  the enclave, wasn't it?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   And access to it was not open to Serb

          1  forces.
          2       A.   We crossed their lines.  I didn't see anyone
          3  there, on their lines.  I saw their bunkers and
          4  trenches very well, but I didn't see any soldiers,
          5  until we reached a macadam road below Buljim.  When we
          6  got there, the column was stopped.  Some asked, "What
          7  are we waiting for?"  And they said that the column had
          8  been broken up and then the shooting started.
          9       Q.   So at Buljim, where their front line was,
         10  there was no one.
         11       A.   Whether they had moved away and hid, I don't
         12  know.  But anyway, I didn't see anyone at Buljim.  I
         13  just saw the bunkers and the trenches but no soldiers,
         14  no one alive.  No persons.
         15       Q.   Witness J, at the beginning of your testimony
         16  on Friday, if my memory serves me, you said that when
         17  searching you, the Serb soldiers took 100 German
         18  marks.
         19       A.   I gave 100 German marks involuntarily.  When
         20  I wandered to the asphalt, there were two of them
         21  standing there, they searched our pockets, our belts.
         22  They told us to put our hands behind our heads and
         23  said, "Give us your money."  I had 100 marks here in my
         24  pocket and I gave them the 100 marks.  But I had some
         25  more in the lining of my jacket, and they found this,

          1  600 marks, two necklaces, and ten gold coins.
          2       Q.   You said that the column, when it was formed
          3  four by four, that according to your estimate, it was
          4  400 to 500 metres long.
          5       A.   Yes.
          6       Q.   Who accompanied it?
          7       A.   It was accompanied or escorted by Serb
          8  soldiers.
          9       Q.   Did you notice anything in particular about
         10  the way it was escorted?
         11       A.   No, I didn't notice anything, except when we
         12  got close to Kravica, I saw an UNPROFOR personnel
         13  carrier.  Who was on it, I don't know.  Whether it was
         14  the Serbs or UNPROFOR.  But in any event they didn't do
         15  anything.  We passed by it.
         16       Q.   At the front of that column, was there a
         17  soldier with a dog?
         18       A.   Yes, he had a dog and he had a 53 or an 84
         19  rifle.  I'm not sure because he was quite a way from
         20  me.
         21       Q.   You mean a light machine-gun, don't you, an
         22  M-53 or M-54 or M-84?
         23       A.   Yes.  Yes.
         24       Q.   Witness J, when you entered this warehouse, a
         25  picture of which is on the ELMO, could you tell us the

          1  size of that warehouse?  I know it is difficult to
          2  think back and remember these things.
          3       A.   In my estimate, it seemed to me between 40
          4  and 50 metres long and maybe 15 metres wide.
          5       Q.   So 40 to 50 metres long?
          6       A.   Yes.
          7       Q.   You said that the Serb soldiers entered.  As
          8  far as I understood your testimony, they opened the
          9  door and fired.
         10       A.   They fired through the door and they threw
         11  grenades through the windows and used rifle grenades,
         12  and all sorts of things.  It was really a disaster.  I
         13  don't know what kind of a nation they can be to kill
         14  people like that.  Let everyone live as they will.
         15       Q.   Did you say they were using Zoljas?
         16       A.   They used anything at all, whatever they
         17  could get hold of.
         18       Q.   Witness J, I assure you that it is not my
         19  intention to revive those terrible memories for you,
         20  but I have to, so could you explain.  You were a
         21  soldier?
         22       A.   I was.
         23       Q.   A Zolja is a deadly weapon or ammunition that
         24  destroys man, personnel and causes burning in a closed
         25  area?

          1       A.   No one needs to ask me anything.  There's
          2  proof on the walls and the blood samples, and they have
          3  proven everything.
          4       Q.   Yes, but I'm just asking you whether what I'm
          5  saying is correct?
          6       A.   What I heard firing was not just automatic
          7  weapons.
          8       Q.   Witness J, could you explain why, in fact,
          9  you went into the woods?
         10       A.   I went into the woods.  I had to go somewhere
         11  to save my life, as anyone else would do to get a hold
         12  of free territory.  I already had occasion to see since
         13  1992 what was done in the places that fell before
         14  Srebrenica.  There was burning and killing regardless
         15  of whether people were young or old.  They hit cows and
         16  calves.
         17            My daughter was watching the cattle.  One of
         18  them was wounded.  Why is he shooting my daughter if I
         19  am on the front line?  She is innocent.
         20       Q.   Witness J, do you know that from the other --
         21  the Muslim side, the same things were done?
         22       A.   Yes.  What did we have, and what did they
         23  have?  They were sitting on the -- on Rogac, like a
         24  gentleman, whether he wants to shoot Zepa or I don't
         25  know what he could do.  What about us?  We started

          1  defending ourselves with hunting rifles, with homemade
          2  devices.  Everything went to the Serb army.  We were
          3  left without anything.  You also know in that period --
          4  we didn't have a tank or a personnel carrier or a
          5  mortar or a howitzer.  They had everything.
          6       Q.   Do you know that in the period of spring,
          7  summer, autumn, winter of 1992 to 1993, that tens of
          8  villages and dozens of villagers were killed of Serb
          9  ethnicity?
         10       A.   We weren't the ones to start the war.  We
         11  were attacked.  We had to defend ourselves.  That has
         12  been proven.  They first attacked Slovenia and then
         13  Croatia and then Bosnia-Herzegovina and now they are
         14  attacking Kosovo, and now they want Sandzak too.  It is
         15  an aggressor.
         16       Q.   Witness J, my question was focussed on the
         17  municipality of Srebrenica and the spring, summer,
         18  autumn of 1992 and the beginning of winter 1993
         19  inclusive -- until the arrival of the UN mission or
         20  rather the formation of a protected zone.
         21            When it was protected, why did it let such a
         22  disaster happen?  That is my question.  Do you know
         23  that in that area and in that period, dozens of Serb
         24  villages were burnt down and that hundreds of civilians
         25  were killed?

          1       A.   Understand what I'm saying.  We had to defend
          2  ourselves.  How many people surrendered in Vlasenica?
          3  Where are they today?  It would have been the same with
          4  Srebrenica and Zepa.  All they wanted was to destroy us
          5  so we wouldn't exist.
          6       Q.   And these acts that were committed in that
          7  time and the area that we are referring to, did they
          8  have the same aim in mind?
          9       A.   What do you mean?
         10       Q.   If the Serbs wanted to destroy the Muslims.
         11       A.   Did we Muslims attack the Serbs or did the
         12  Serbs attack Muslims?  Who attacked whom?
         13       Q.   I don't want to take any more time.  I'm just
         14  asking this witness to answer my question.  Did it
         15  happen or did it not?
         16       A.   As they attacked us, we had to defend
         17  ourselves.  That is number one.  Only if we had the
         18  equipment they had, we wouldn't have acted in that
         19  way.  We defended ourselves with hunting rifles and
         20  devices.
         21       Q.   Did you have infantry weapons?
         22       A.   I only had a hunting rifle throughout the
         23  war, and I brought it to Jaglici.
         24       Q.   Did you have an armed army, military unit?
         25       A.   Who would arm them if somebody bought a

          1  weapon or captured a weapon.  That's what they had.
          2       Q.   So you are claiming that there were no
          3  infantry weapons or automatic rifles or machine-guns
          4  mortars?
          5       A.   In our local community, there wasn't a single
          6  light machine-gun.  We may have had eight carbines and
          7  hunting rifles.  And perhaps somebody prior to the war
          8  may have purchased an automatic rifle.  That's all we
          9  had.
         10            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         11  Mr. President, Your Honours, I have no more questions.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         13  very much, Mr. Petrusic.
         14            Mr. Cayley, any re-examination?
         15            MR. CAYLEY:  No.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Judge Riad.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         18                 Questioned by the Court:
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  Good morning, Witness J.  I'll
         20  have to call you J and not to call you by your name.
         21            We do appreciate your coming here to testify,
         22  and we fully realise how painful it is for you.
         23            I'll not prolong your ordeal, but we would
         24  like to see more clearly some of the events you
         25  mentioned in a few questions.
          1            I'll start by what you mentioned about your
          2  being in the Bosnian army.  How long did you stay in
          3  the Bosnian army?
          4       A.   From the 17th of April, 1992 until 1996.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  And what was your grade?
          6       A.   I didn't have any.  I simply went to the
          7  line, I was there.  I was a member of the civil --
          8  before I was a member of the civil protection service,
          9  I worked in the logistics department and it was like
         10  that until 1996 when I was demobilised.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  But you said that on the 11th of
         12  July, 1995, you were a farmer in the village in this
         13  Srebrenica enclave.  Was that right?
         14       A.   Yes.  I had been working on my land all my
         15  life.  This was my source of income.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, we go to the warehouse.
         17  I'm sorry if I have to evoke your memory, and the
         18  memory because there is some kind of -- it doesn't look
         19  very clear to me what happened there.
         20            You said the warehouse was so full that a
         21  match would not fall on the ground, it would fall on
         22  the head of people.  And then during these events --
         23       A.   Yes.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  Apparently nobody was left alive
         25  after they were killed, I mean how were they killed.  I

          1  mean killing people who were sticking to each other.
          2  How was it?  Was it through a bomb?  How could you kill
          3  a place and nobody was left?  Can I just ask you this
          4  very sad memory, how it happened?  Was it by grenades,
          5  was it by -- because you can't shoot people standing
          6  almost totally stuck to each other.
          7       A.   Take the example of the men who left the
          8  warehouse with me.  He had been hit with shrapnel all
          9  over his body, on his legs.  I wasn't wounded at all.
         10  So he managed to reach Baljkovica and he was killed,
         11  that's where he died.  But I had not been wounded.  I
         12  was just lucky.  It was my fate, that I survived.
         13            When we were going to Zepa there were four of
         14  us in a column.  Actually, there were nine of us.  I
         15  was the fourth one in the column, and the one behind
         16  stepped on a mine.  And the one who was the seventh in
         17  the column also stepped on a mine and lost two legs.
         18            Afterwards, when they went back to the area
         19  to look for the bodies, look for the bones, they
         20  managed to find those bodies as they were clearing up
         21  the road.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  You mentioned that -- when you
         23  were answering the Defence counsel, you mentioned that
         24  the Serbs shot people young and old as well as animals,
         25  as well as the cat, I suppose, you mentioned --

          1       A.   The same.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  -- why did they have to collect
          3  people in the warehouse.  They can shoot them
          4  everywhere.  Did they shoot people wherever they found
          5  them, and whether they are; men, women?
          6       A.   While I was walking around in Pobude, I saw a
          7  number of dead bodies in brooks and rivers.  They just
          8  wanted to get rid of people.  They didn't pay attention
          9  to whether somebody was young or old.  They just wanted
         10  to destroy them.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  What happened to your daughter?
         12       A.   My daughter was watching after cattle in a
         13  field.  There was another girl with her from a
         14  neighbouring village, and shelling took place and one
         15  of my daughters was killed and the other one was
         16  wounded.
         17            The girl who was from the neighbouring
         18  village was also wounded.  She didn't manage to reach
         19  Srebrenica alive, but the other one spent 17 days in
         20  the hospital and she survived.
         21            One of my oxen was killed, a cow was also
         22  killed in that shelling.  Everything was destroyed.  I
         23  have lost a number of relatives and cousins and people
         24  who could have helped me, but today I have to help
         25  their children, and it's very difficult for me to help

          1  anyone.  I am barely surviving.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  We are very happy that you have
          3  survived.
          4       A.   Yes, I was lucky.  Yes, that's what I keep
          5  telling myself.  But what's it worth now?  My life has
          6  been damaged, my health.  When I have to sit for a long
          7  time and then when I have to stand up, it's very
          8  difficult for me to stand up on my right leg
          9  from rheumatism.
         10            JUDGE RIAD:  Well, I think that will pass
         11  with time.  You're still a young man.
         12       A.   If I were allowed to go back to my land, yes,
         13  but they wouldn't let me go back.  And lots of
         14  criminals are still at large and the world is simply
         15  watching, and the world could have helped us.
         16            JUDGE RIAD:  The world is listening very
         17  carefully to what you are saying, so be fully aware of
         18  that.
         19            Now, just my last question:  Those people who
         20  were in this warehouse, all of them, were they
         21  soldiers, were they military people, or were they
         22  civilians?
         23       A.   They were civilians, most of them.  Most of
         24  them were very young children, elderly people.  There
         25  were people of 60 years of age or more.  They didn't

          1  dare go to Potocari.  They thought it would be easier
          2  for them to go through the woods.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  You mean they collected them
          4  from the woods?
          5       A.   Who collected them?  They were capturing them
          6  in the woods, and then they took them to Lolici, and
          7  after they had been gathered in Lolici, from there they
          8  were taken to Kravica.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  That's the answer I wanted.
         10  Thank you so much, and I wish you luck.
         11            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You're
         12  welcome.  Thank you.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         14  Judge Riad.
         15            Judge Wald.
         16            JUDGE WALD:  Witness J, you told us that when
         17  Srebrenica fell, a courier came to tell people, and it
         18  had been agreed upon that the men would go through the
         19  woods, and the women and children and others would go
         20  on to Potocari.
         21            Now, had that kind of agreement been arrived
         22  at by the leaders of the Muslim community in
         23  Srebrenica, or was it, as the Defence counsel
         24  suggested, an order from the members of the 28th
         25  Brigade or the Muslim army?

          1       A.   They informed the civilians, the population
          2  in the villages, that Srebrenica had fallen, and they
          3  said that we should go to the woods or to Potocari.
          4  There were two options and we could choose between the
          5  two.
          6            JUDGE WALD:  Who is the "they" that told you
          7  that?  What do you mean by "they"?
          8       A.   Well, probably the United Nations who were
          9  protecting Srebrenica, they probably said that
         10  Srebrenica had fallen, that the enclave had fallen, and
         11  then our people conveyed the message to us, our
         12  superiors.
         13            JUDGE WALD:  "Superiors" meaning your
         14  superiors in the Bosnian army or your leaders in the
         15  community?
         16       A.   Probably those who represented the
         17  municipality, the municipal authorities.  They told the
         18  military and the civilians that Srebrenica had fallen
         19  and that we should leave.
         20            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  At the time that you
         21  left, were you still a member of the Bosnian army?
         22  Even though you were farming your land, you were still
         23  in the Bosnian army when you left to go to the woods?
         24       A.   Yes, I was a member of the civilian defence
         25  when I left, and then after about -- I spent about

          1  three months in the civilian defence.
          2            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.  When you were
          3  going through the woods and you met your first and
          4  second ambushes that you told us about, was the first
          5  firing by the Serb armies, or did, in any case, the men
          6  in the woods initiate the fire?
          7       A.   It mostly came from the left side of the
          8  hill.  We could hear someone shouting, "What are you
          9  waiting for?" and then they cursed at us and at that
         10  moment shooting started.  Lots of people remained
         11  there, lots of wounded and dead.  But nobody paid
         12  attention to anybody else.
         13            JUDGE WALD:  Did some of the people in the
         14  column that was marching towards Tuzla, did they return
         15  the fire?  When they were shot at, did they shoot back?
         16       A.   Nobody returned fire.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  Nobody returned fired.
         18       A.   Nobody even thought of returning fire --
         19            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.
         20       A.   -- because we were surrounded.
         21            JUDGE WALD:  Now, my next question deals with
         22  when General Mladic came.  I want to make sure I have
         23  the dates right.  General Mladic, I think you said, but
         24  you can tell me if I'm wrong, he came on the 13th and
         25  assured the people gathered there in the field that you

          1  would be taken care of and given shade and given food,
          2  et cetera.  Was that the 13th?  And then on the 14th
          3  was when the shooting --
          4       A.   On the 13th.
          5            JUDGE WALD:  Right.  And then on the 14th,
          6  the shooting occurred in the warehouse; is that right?
          7       A.   On the 14th was the shooting.
          8            JUDGE WALD:  So that was the day after
          9  General Mladic --
         10       A.   General Mladic arrived on Thursday, in
         11  Lolici, and on Thursday we were brought to the
         12  warehouse.  The shooting started on Thursday, around
         13  4.00 or 5.00 in the afternoon.  And on Friday, that is,
         14  on the 14th, I spent the whole day in the warehouse.
         15  On the night between Friday and Saturday, I left the
         16  warehouse.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Now, in the warehouse, I
         18  think you told Judge Riad, in answer to one of his
         19  questions, that there were a lot of men collected from
         20  the column, from the woods, who had either surrendered
         21  or been captured.  To the best of your knowledge -- to
         22  the best of your -- could I --
         23       A.   Columns of people were brought in from the
         24  woods.  We didn't get there altogether.  People kept
         25  arriving in groups, because we had surrendered up in

          1  the hills and people started brandishing white shirts
          2  on sticks.
          3            JUDGE WALD:  But to your knowledge, to the
          4  best of your knowledge, were all the people in the
          5  warehouse people who had either been captured or
          6  surrendered in the woods?  None of them were people who
          7  had stayed in Potocari and were bused out of Potocari.
          8  Is that right?
          9       A.   No.  Nobody from Potocari was there.  Just
         10  people who had gone to the woods, they were there in
         11  the warehouse.
         12            JUDGE WALD:  All right.
         13       A.   What happened in other places, I don't know.
         14  I just know what happened when we were surrounded at
         15  Kamenica.  I don't know what happened to other people.
         16  Whether they had surrendered or whether they had been
         17  captured, I don't know.  I just know what happened
         18  where I was.
         19            JUDGE WALD:  Now, my last question is:  You
         20  said that you got back to Zepa on September 26th.  Now,
         21  when you got back there, was Zepa still under siege?
         22  That was before its surrender on the 29th.  Was it
         23  under assault and being besieged by the Serbian forces
         24  when you got there?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1            JUDGE WALD:  Do you have any knowledge of how
          2  long it had been under siege before that?
          3       A.   It wasn't on the 29th.  Zepa fell on the 29th
          4  of July, not September.
          5            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  I see.  So Zepa had
          6  fallen already in July.
          7       A.   Yes, in July, on the 29th of July.  And it
          8  was on the 26th that I reached Zepa.
          9            JUDGE WALD:  Of September.
         10       A.   In September I left for Tuzla.  It was on the
         11  9th of September that I left for Tuzla.
         12            JUDGE WALD:  Just to clarify it once and for
         13  all, when did you get to Zepa?  When did you reach
         14  Zepa?
         15       A.   I reached Zepa on the 26th of July, around
         16  3.00 in the afternoon.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  So my question, then,
         18  still is:  Was Zepa under siege, or had it already
         19  surrendered by the time you got there?
         20       A.   No.  No, it had not surrendered yet on the
         21  26th of the July.  The last convoy left Zepa on the
         22  26th.
         23            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  So do you know how long
         24  Zepa had been under military siege by the time you got
         25  there?

          1       A.   Until the 29th.
          2            JUDGE WALD:  No, but when had it begun?  Do
          3  you know when the siege, the military siege, of Zepa
          4  had begun?
          5       A.   It began, I mean the attack on Zepa, as soon
          6  as Srebrenica fell.
          7            JUDGE WALD:  So that would have been around
          8  July 10th or 11th.  Okay.  Thank you.
          9            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You're
         10  welcome.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness J,
         12  let me turn the situation a little bit.  You said that
         13  the fate had it so that you survived.  Let me try to
         14  tell you something.  You are here with us, you have
         15  told us a story, and you have a story to tell to the
         16  world so that these terrible things could be avoided,
         17  independent of who is responsible for them.
         18            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.  Thank
         19  you, Your Honour, very much.  I'm in favour of that as
         20  well.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, I'm
         22  very glad to hear that we share the same opinion,
         23  Witness J.  Thank you very much for coming here to
         24  testify.  We hope that you will continue to be witness
         25  of these terrible events, and I hope that by doing so

          1  you will do a great service to humanity.  Thank you
          2  very much once again.
          3            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, of course,
          4  Your Honour.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Cayley,
          6  I don't think we have any exhibits to take care of.
          7            Mr. Petrusic, I don't think that there's
          8  anything that we should settle in that respect.
          9            Could the usher please show the witness out
         10  of the courtroom.
         11                 [Trial Chamber and legal officer confer]
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         13  what is next, or Mr. Cayley?
         14            MR. CAYLEY:  Sorry.  You said "Mr. Harmon,"
         15  so I thought my colleague would answer.  We do have
         16  another witness, Mr. President, yes.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Any
         18  protective measures?
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  He will be known by a pseudonym,
         20  and he will have the same protection as this last
         21  witness.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So the
         23  conditions are the same as for this witness.
         24            Mr. Petrusic.
         25            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] We agree to

          1  that, Your Honour.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          3  very much.
          4            For the public, let me just say that it will
          5  be a public session.
          6            Mr. Cayley, you may sit down.
          7            Witness J, please do not move.  We will leave
          8  the courtroom and you will leave the courtroom after
          9  that.
         10            For now, we will have a 20-minute break,
         11  after which we will resume the hearing.
         12                 --- Recess taken at 10.54 a.m.
         13                 --- On resuming at 11.18 a.m.
         14                 [The witness entered court]
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         16  morning.  Can you hear me?
         17                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
         18            THE WITNESS:  Good morning.  Yes, I can.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness,
         20  would you please read the solemn declaration that the
         21  usher will give you.
         22            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will
         23  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
         24  truth
         25                 WITNESS:  WITNESS K
          1                 [Witness answered through interpreter]
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          3  you may be seated now.
          4            Mr. Dubuisson.  Mr. Dubuisson is going to
          5  show you a piece of paper with your name written on
          6  it.  Could you please have a look at the piece of paper
          7  and tell us by saying simply yes or no if this is,
          8  indeed, your name.
          9            THE WITNESS:  Yes.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So this is
         11  your name, Witness.
         12            THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well
         14  then, Witness, you will first answer questions that
         15  will be put to you by Mr. Cayley who is on your
         16  right-hand side.
         17            Let me just thank you for coming to the
         18  International Tribunal.
         19            Mr. Cayley, you have the floor.
         20            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         21                 Examined by Mr. Cayley:
         22       Q.   Witness, for your protection, I will be
         23  addressing you as Witness K throughout your evidence.
         24            Witness, you are Bosnian by nationality; is
         25  that correct?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   And you were born a Muslim by faith; is that
          3  correct?
          4       A.   Yes.  Yes, that's correct.
          5       Q.   In July of 1995, you were inside the
          6  Srebrenica enclave; is that correct?
          7       A.   Yes, in 1995, I was in Srebrenica.
          8       Q.   And at the time you were a member of the
          9  Bosnian army inside the Srebrenica enclave; is that
         10  correct?
         11       A.   Yes.  I was a member of the army of
         12  Bosnia-Herzegovina.
         13       Q.   Inside the Srebrenica enclave, can you
         14  describe to the Judges what kind of army the Bosnian
         15  army was?
         16       A.   There was an army, but we didn't have much
         17  weaponry.  We started to defend ourselves in the war
         18  with hunting rifles.  And in doing so, we would seize
         19  weapons from Bosnian Serbs from time to time, and we
         20  would use those weapons to defend ourselves.
         21            The soldiers that were in Srebrenica, I mean
         22  the army that was in Srebrenica, was not a disciplined
         23  army.  The United Nations were there, and we were not
         24  allowed to hold our lines because they had their
         25  checkpoints.

          1       Q.   Witness, did you have a uniform?
          2       A.   No.  No.  I never put on a uniform.  I was
          3  never issued with a uniform.
          4       Q.   What weapon were you armed with in July of
          5  1995?
          6       A.   I didn't have any weapon.  They were in
          7  warehouses, what weapons there were.
          8       Q.   What was the name of the unit to which you
          9  belonged, the name of the Bosnian army unit to which
         10  you belonged?
         11       A.   282nd Brigade.
         12       Q.   I want you now to think back to the 11th of
         13  July of 1995.  And I think on that day, you set off
         14  towards Jaglici; is that right?
         15       A.   Yes.  Yes, that's right.
         16       Q.   I think you then started to make your way in
         17  a very large column towards Tuzla and the free
         18  territory; is that right?
         19       A.   Yes, that's right.
         20       Q. (redacted),
         21  (redacted)
         22  (redacted)
         23       A.   (redacted)
         24  (redacted)
         25            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown

          1  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/A/2.
          2       Q.   Now, Witness, I know that the journey through
          3  the woods was a very difficult one and that there was
          4  shooting and there was explosions, and a large number
          5  of people were killed, but I would like you to move
          6  forward in time to the point where you, and a large
          7  group of other men, surrendered to the Bosnian Serbs.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  But, first of all, if the
          9  exhibit could be placed on the ELMO.
         10       Q.   And if you could indicate to the Judges what
         11  is represented by the dotted line on that exhibit.
         12       A.    This is the village of Jaglici [indicates]
         13  and this is where we crossed the line.  There used to
         14  be a UN checkpoint here, and to our right where we
         15  crossed the line that was held by Bosnian Serbs.  This
         16  is where we crossed the line [indicates].  There were
         17  many people in the column one by one.
         18            We had set off through the woods in the
         19  direction of Tuzla.  I will show you the route we
         20  took.  This is the way where we went [indicates], and
         21  this is just approximately.  And we surrendered to the
         22  Bosnian Serbs at Konjevic Polje at this place here.
         23  This is where we crossed the asphalt road, and we were
         24  assembled here on a meadow.
         25       Q.   And let the record show that the witness has

          1  indicated on Prosecutor's Exhibit 8A/2 that the dotted
          2  line on that map represents the approximate route that
          3  he took through the forest on the 12th and 13th of
          4  July, and that where that dotted line bisects the road
          5  between Konjevic Polje and Bratunac, which runs through
          6  Kravica, is the point at which he surrendered to the
          7  Serbs on the 13th of July.
          8            Now, Witness, if you could tell the Judges
          9  what happened to you after you surrendered to the Serbs
         10  on the 13th of July.  And if you would speak for a
         11  minute, minute and a half and then take a pause, I may
         12  have a few questions to ask you to clarify your
         13  testimony, or I may just ask you to proceed on with
         14  your story.  Can you do that?
         15       A.   Yes, I can.
         16            After we crossed the asphalt road, they
         17  searched us, and we were moving in a column one by
         18  one.  They were taking away our money, our gold,
         19  watches; everything we had that was of any value.
         20            We had backpacks with food, but none of us
         21  had any weapons.  Those who had weapons had thrown them
         22  away in the woods.  We didn't dare surrender with
         23  weapons.
         24            So we gathered in a meadow, and there were
         25  quite a few of us.  I was in the first column, and I

          1  think that we were about 1.000 in that column,
          2  approximately.  I cannot tell you the exact number of
          3  people in the column at that moment, so this is just an
          4  estimate.
          5            They were standing around us, and we sat
          6  down, one next to the other, and we were facing the
          7  asphalt road.  On my right-hand side, in a corner where
          8  people were sitting, there was a tank, and on the right
          9  side of the tank there was a Praga, which would, from
         10  time to time, open fire and shell in the direction of
         11  the woods.  They were firing mortars but I couldn't see
         12  them.  They must have been near the houses that were to
         13  my left side.
         14            There were many wounded amongst us.  There
         15  were also children of maybe 14 or 15 years of age.
         16  They selected younger people, and they also stopped
         17  buses that were coming from the area of Potocari,
         18  towards Kladanj, evacuating people.  Those young boys
         19  would be then put onto buses and sent towards Kladanj.
         20            There were lots of wounded amongst us, and
         21  they were being taken away to some houses that were
         22  situated some 50 metres away from us, on our right-hand
         23  side, maybe more, to protect them from the heat.  It
         24  was very hot on that day.
         25            Then at one point they would sprinkle us with

          1  water from a water tank; I remember they did that on
          2  three occasions.  From time to time somebody would go
          3  to fetch water.  Mostly it was younger boys who would
          4  go to get water because they didn't allow older people
          5  to leave the group.
          6            We spent a couple of hours sitting in the
          7  meadow, and then the second column arrived, the Bosnian
          8  Serbs brought the second column of people.  Some had
          9  helmets, some had some kind of caps, multicoloured
         10  uniforms, and they were armed with automatic weapons,
         11  automatic rifles.
         12            On our left side, next to the houses, there
         13  was an anti-aircraft gun, a three-barrelled
         14  anti-aircraft gun, which was also firing in the
         15  direction of the woods, where we had come from.
         16            After that, after the second column had
         17  arrived, I recognised two men who were from Skelani,
         18  from my neighbourhood.  They were two brothers, Ahmed
         19  and Dzemo, and they were put away -- they were
         20  separated and put next to the tank.  I knew them
         21  because they were my -- they knew them because they
         22  were their neighbours.  And the others were placed in
         23  the same meadow where we were.
         24            One man tried to escape, one of us.  He had
         25  accompanied a wounded man towards the house, which was

          1  on our right side, but they managed to catch him.  They
          2  captured him and they brought him to the tank, and the
          3  one who was driving the tank came to him and he hit him
          4  with his fist.  The man fell down and fainted.
          5            The other group, the people who had arrived
          6  in the meantime, I don't know who they were, maybe some
          7  members of the special forces from the Serbian army,
          8  but as far as I could tell, they were respected by
          9  others.  I could tell by the attitude of other soldiers
         10  that they were respected.  They had kind of black
         11  T-shirts with short sleeves; they had brand new boots,
         12  uniforms.
         13            Their commander, who was ahead of us, who was
         14  standing in front of us, kept brandishing his knife and
         15  he said that he would take revenge upon us for his
         16  brother who had lost his life in the war.  He didn't
         17  touch anyone; he just played with his knife.  But when
         18  people would bring water, we were very thirsty, he
         19  would fire a bullet or two from his automatic rifle to
         20  calm us down because at that moment we would run
         21  towards the water because we were thirsty.
         22            The one who was wearing a black T-shirt, at
         23  one point, took an automatic rifle, with a round clip
         24  which can hold much more ammunition, I don't know how
         25  much exactly, he approached the soldier who had been

          1  hit near the tank and he stood above him and he simply
          2  fired several bursts of gunfire in his chest.  And then
          3  he ordered two men from my group who were there in the
          4  meadow, two Muslims, to come out and to throw him away
          5  some 20 or 30 metres away from us in the meadow.
          6       Q.   Witness, that's a good point for you to
          7  pause.  I just have a number of questions to ask you,
          8  to clarify what you've already said.
          9            Now, you said in your evidence that when you
         10  arrived at the meadow that "they searched us" and "they
         11  were standing around".  You mean by that Bosnian Serb
         12  soldiers?
         13       A.   Yes, I mean the Bosnian Serb soldiers.  They
         14  searched us.  They took everything of value, money,
         15  gold, watches, valuables, and backpacks, and they threw
         16  them all into a pile.  They would search each of the
         17  soldiers to make sure there were no weapons.  And we
         18  had to sit in the meadow; we were surrounded to make
         19  sure that we wouldn't disperse.
         20       Q.   Now, these Bosnian Serb soldiers, how were
         21  they dressed?
         22       A.   They had camouflage uniforms on.  Some of
         23  them had helmets, some had caps, some had nothing on
         24  their heads, like me, for instance.  They had
         25  bulletproof jackets; some were camouflage and some were

          1  SMB or olive-grey.
          2       Q.   Then you described another unit that were
          3  wearing black uniforms and you said that that unit was
          4  respected by the other soldiers.  How long after you
          5  arrived in the meadow did the soldiers that were
          6  dressed in black arrive?
          7       A.   A couple of hours later, something like
          8  that.  That's my impression, very approximately.
          9       Q.   Now, the soldier who shot the man next to the
         10  tank, how was he dressed?
         11       A.   As I said, he took an automatic rifle from
         12  the man who was playing around with the knife and he
         13  killed this man of ours, a Muslim.  He had a black,
         14  short-sleeved T-shirt on him and the trousers were
         15  camouflage; he had new boots.  So that as far as I
         16  could have noticed, their own soldiers held them in
         17  high esteem.  They were valued more than ordinary
         18  soldiers.
         19       Q.   How, to the best of your memory, were all of
         20  the Muslim men who were sitting in that meadow dressed?
         21       A.   They were all in civilian clothes.  I didn't
         22  notice anyone wearing a camouflage uniform or a part of
         23  a military uniform.  They were all in civilian
         24  clothes.
         25       Q.   Were there people amongst you that were

          1  wounded?
          2       A.   There were.  There were wounded.
          3       Q.   After a couple of hours, what was the state
          4  of these wounded?
          5       A.   Some of those wounded, because it was
          6  extremely hot, as I just said, they sprayed us with
          7  water from a tank on three occasions, they cooled us
          8  off so we wouldn't faint, and these wounded men, I saw
          9  quite a number of them faint.  And whoever was next to
         10  them would pour water over them.
         11       Q.   Now, after the arrival of the second group of
         12  Muslim men, can you estimate how many men there were in
         13  the meadow?
         14       A.   You mean in all?
         15       Q.   Approximately how many men there were in the
         16  meadow.
         17       A.   Perhaps around 3.500 to 4.000, that's my
         18  estimate, maybe 3.000, 3.500, 4.000.  I don't know
         19  exactly.  I didn't count them.
         20       Q.   After the men in the black uniform, the
         21  Bosnian Serb soldiers in the black uniforms had
         22  arrived, what is the next significant event that you
         23  remember?
         24       A.   We were all facing the road in the meadow and
         25  watching to see what would happen to us.  We were all

          1  in great fear and panic.  The tank driver climbed the
          2  anti-aircraft gun and pointed towards us as if he would
          3  shoot, but he didn't.  He would merely intimidate us.
          4            And then buses from Srebrenica arrived with
          5  the women, children, and the elderly, heading towards
          6  Kladanj, and I recognised a number of women in the
          7  buses as they went by.  And the younger persons, there
          8  were some girls in the meadows too.  The buses would be
          9  halted and they would be boarded onto the buses, and
         10  they left towards Kladanj.
         11            After that, after a while, I don't know how
         12  long, General Mladic arrived with his bodyguards, maybe
         13  five or six men, and he stayed there for maybe 10 or 15
         14  minutes in the meadow, roughly.
         15       Q.   Did General Mladic say anything to you while
         16  he was in the meadow?
         17       A.   He addressed us.  I cannot remember the exact
         18  words he used.  He addressed us, saying that nothing
         19  wrong would happen, not to be afraid, that they were
         20  good, that not a hair on a head would be hurt, that we
         21  would all be exchanged for their Serbs, that we would
         22  be evacuated to Tuzla or Kladanj, that we would all
         23  rejoin our families in safety, and that we should not
         24  worry at all.
         25       Q.   After General Mladic left, do you recall what

          1  happened to you next?
          2       A.   After that, I don't know after how long
          3  exactly, this commander who was standing in front of us
          4  all that time with a knife in his hand, he would select
          5  us, the more able-bodied amongst us, and he would say,
          6  "You, you, and you," pointing a finger at us, and we
          7  would go out and he would say that we would be
          8  exchanged for their Serbs, "who was imprisoned by your
          9  Muslims," as he said.  "we're exchanging you for our
         10  Serbs," that's what he said to us.
         11            And then we got to the road.  Buses were
         12  waiting for us, two to three buses.  I was among those
         13  who were in the bus.  We were loaded, very many of us.
         14  It was so hot, it was stifling, and I noticed
         15  immediately that the bus wasn't taking us towards
         16  Konjevic Polje or Kladanj, but rather that we were
         17  going in the direction of Bratunac.  And then after I
         18  don't know how many minutes, it wasn't a long ride, the
         19  bus took a turning to the right and they drove us in
         20  front of a warehouse of some sort.  That was Kravica.
         21            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         22  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/3.  If that could be placed on
         23  the ELMO, please, Mr. Usher.
         24       Q.   Witness, do you recognise this place?  Can
         25  you just identify the location?

          1       A.   I know this place very well.  I'll show you
          2  now where they took us and where we got off.
          3       Q.   If you could just wait one moment, Witness.
          4            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness --
          5       Q.   Could you tell the Judges the name of this
          6  place, if you know?
          7       A.   This place is called Kravica.  Before the
          8  war, in peacetime, I would pass by here often, but I
          9  never noticed those warehouses then.  I know that I was
         10  close to Kravica.  Maybe this was not the centre of
         11  Kravica that I was familiar with.  I think this place
         12  is called Sandici or Kravica, between Konjevic Polje
         13  and Sandici.  And so we were driven there to Kravica,
         14  to these warehouses.
         15            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could now be
         16  shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 8A/2.
         17       Q.   Now, you said, Witness, in your evidence,
         18  that you thought that you were being taken to the free
         19  territory, you were taken to be exchanged.  But then
         20  you realised that the buses turned in the wrong
         21  direction and went to Bratunac.  Could you indicate to
         22  the Judges in which direction you drove when the buses
         23  left on the map that you see in front of you?
         24       A.   From here towards Bratunac [indicates].  That
         25  was the direction we took.

          1            MR. CAYLEY:  So let the record show that on
          2  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8A/2 that the witness travelled
          3  from the dotted line that crosses the road between
          4  Konjevic Polje and Bratunac to Kravica.
          5       Q.   And after you'd been told that you were to be
          6  exchanged, where did you think that you should have
          7  been going?  Where should the Serbs have taken you if
          8  they were to exchange you?
          9       A.   Towards Kladanj [indicates].  In this
         10  direction.
         11            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show on
         12  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8A/2 that the witness is
         13  indicating from where the dotted line bisects the road
         14  at Konjevic Polje towards Konjevic Polje.  And, in
         15  fact, the direction is indicated by an arrow pointing
         16  towards Konjevic Polje.
         17            If the witness could now be shown a new
         18  exhibit which is 1/19.
         19            Mr. Registrar, on this exhibit, the witness
         20  has placed his name and signed it because it was
         21  attached to a statement.  So if the redacted copy to be
         22  placed on the ELMO and the copy with the signature and
         23  the name of the witness can be placed in front of the
         24  witness, that way the witness will remain protected.
         25       Q.   Now, Witness, this, I believe, is a diagram

          1  that you drew for the investigators from the Office of
          2  the Prosecutor in 1998 showing the approximate
          3  locations of buildings at the Kravica warehouse
          4  complex; is that right?
          5       A.   That is correct.
          6       Q.   Could you indicate, first of all, to the
          7  Judges, the building that you were taken into by just
          8  pointing to that building?
          9       A.   I can [indicates].
         10            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show on
         11  Prosecutor's Exhibit 1/19 that the witness pointed to
         12  the large rectangle nearest the road between Konjevic
         13  Polje and Bratunac which is parallel to that road and
         14  has two smaller boxes beneath it.
         15       Q.   The two smaller boxes, Witness, one with the
         16  cross in it, could you inform the Judges what they are
         17  below the building to which you were taken?
         18       A.   What do you mean below the building?  Above
         19  the building?
         20       Q.   There's a box which indicates the factory
         21  into which you were taken.  Below that?
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   There are two small boxes, and one has a
         24  cross inside it.  Can you explain to the Judges what
         25  they represent?

          1       A.   These are buses [indicates] that drove us
          2  there.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          4  three small rectangular boxes on this diagram, on
          5  Prosecutor's Exhibit 1/19, that the witness has
          6  indicated are buses.
          7       Q.   Now, the box with the cross inside it, what
          8  does the cross represent?
          9       A.   This is the bus [indicates] that I was in.
         10  And when they quickly ordered us to get off as quickly
         11  as we could and enter the warehouse, there's an opening
         12  here, and that is the one I went through.  So they
         13  unloaded us there, and we were told to get inside as
         14  quickly as we possibly could.
         15            MR. CAYLEY:  And finally if the witness could
         16  be shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/1.  And if that could
         17  be placed on the ELMO.
         18       Q.   Now, do you remember, Witness, yesterday I
         19  showed you this photograph, and I indicated to you that
         20  it was aerial imagery that had been taken on the 13th
         21  of July of 1995 at the Kravica warehouse at the time
         22  that you were there.
         23            The two white boxes below the warehouse, can
         24  you tell the Judges what you told me they were
         25  yesterday when you saw this photograph?

          1       A.   There are two buses here [indicates], and we
          2  came from this direction [indicates].  Then we turned
          3  right and we passed this warehouse [indicates], then
          4  another right turn and then a left turn.  When I got
          5  off, I saw some warehouses were there.  We were
          6  unloaded from the buses and we went inside, and I
          7  confirm, personally, that that is the exact spot where
          8  I was.  I was in that warehouse here just in front of
          9  this first bus I got off and went in.
         10            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         11  witness, although I think it's quite clear from the
         12  transcript, identified that the two rectangular white
         13  boxes immediately in front of the warehouse are the
         14  buses which he drew on the diagram which he provided to
         15  the Office of the Prosecutor.  And that he confirmed
         16  that the bus on the right-hand side of the photograph
         17  is the bus from which he alighted and that is where he
         18  entered into the warehouse.
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  If we could now have, I think,
         20  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/4, please.
         21       Q.   Now, Witness, what is this a photograph of?
         22       A.   It's the warehouse that I was in.
         23       Q.   Can you indicate the door through which you
         24  entered the warehouse?
         25       A.   I can [indicates].

          1            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          2  witness is indicating the entrance on the extreme left
          3  of Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/4, it's on the extreme left
          4  of one of three entrances that are joined together.
          5       Q.   Witness, were there any?
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me,
          7  Mr. Cayley, for interrupting you.  I have a small point
          8  of clarification.  Can we go back to Exhibit 8/1?  I
          9  think that the usher has that exhibit.
         10            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. Usher, that's the aerial
         11  photograph.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Could it be
         13  possible to ask the witness where was the door of the
         14  bus through which he got on and got off the bus.  On
         15  what side was it?
         16            MR. CAYLEY:
         17       Q.   Witness, if you understood that question,
         18  could you do as the President asked and indicate the
         19  door on the bus from which you alighted into the
         20  factory?
         21       A.   It was on the right-hand side.  I can show
         22  you on the photograph.
         23       Q.   Please.
         24       A.   [Indicates]
         25            MR. CAYLEY:  Although I think the point is a

          1  little large, the witness is indicating that the door
          2  and, indeed, said the door on the bus was on the
          3  right-hand side of the bus.  That's on Prosecutor's
          4  Exhibit 8/1.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  If Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/4
          6  could be placed on the ELMO again.
          7       Q.   Now, Witness, you've just explained to the
          8  Judges that you went into the warehouse on the
          9  left-hand side.  And now I have a question for you:
         10  Were there Bosnian Serb soldiers in and around the
         11  warehouse?
         12       A.   Yes.
         13       Q.   Could you explain to the Judges how those
         14  soldiers were dressed?
         15       A.   I didn't know.  When I entered the hangar, I
         16  didn't know that there were Bosnian Serb soldiers on
         17  guard duty around there.  But when I escaped from the
         18  hangar, I jumped out of the window of the hangar, then
         19  I saw that there were guards.  And I jumped out during
         20  the night, and I didn't see how they were dressed.  I
         21  just saw those who were in front entering the warehouse
         22  during the daytime.  They had camouflage uniforms, but
         23  one of them had a blue UN helmet on his head and they
         24  had flak jackets on.
         25       Q.   So these were Bosnian Serb soldiers that you

          1  could see as you were looking outwards from the inside
          2  of the factory?
          3       A.   Yes.  And who would enter inside while we
          4  could see, it was still daylight.
          5       Q.   Now, after you entered the factory, what did
          6  you do?
          7       A.   They shoved us into this warehouse.  Where I
          8  was, it was full of men so that I was somewhere in the
          9  middle.  I don't know exactly, as far as I could
         10  notice.  They ordered us to sit down.  We sat down as
         11  we could, one next to another.
         12            After that, I could see two younger men.
         13  They provoked us.  They demanded that they make a
         14  confession they didn't know.
         15            After that, they brought them back to where
         16  they were.  Then they took watches off people; gold,
         17  money, whatever people had, and they threatened us.
         18            If somebody failed to give up his money and
         19  money was found on him, he would be killed.  And people
         20  who had anything, one by one, they went up and handed
         21  it over.  I, too, personally, had little change,
         22  although they had taken my ring in the meadow, not my
         23  wedding ring, though, I had that too.  I said it was a
         24  souvenir from my girlfriend, because it wasn't a
         25  wedding ring, it was a gold band.  And I gave them my

          1  watch and the chain and this gold band, everything I
          2  had; I didn't have any money on me.  And this applied
          3  to everyone.  Whoever had anything, they handed it
          4  over.  And they wrote it down on small bits of paper.
          5            When I went up and handed over these
          6  valuables, they would take down my name and surname, as
          7  if they would be so nice as to return those things to
          8  us one day, and then we would go back to the place
          9  where we had been before.
         10       Q.   Now, you said in your evidence that "they
         11  provoked us" and "they demanded that they make a
         12  confession they didn't know".  Now, are you saying that
         13  Bosnian Serb soldiers demanded that Muslim men amongst
         14  you make confessions?
         15       A.   Yes.  They interrogated people, not many of
         16  them.  I saw two young men being taken out.  They were
         17  told to stand up against a wall.  They shouted at
         18  them.  They asked them about some places, I don't know
         19  which ones; I don't remember what we were interested
         20  in.  But these two young men, of course, didn't know
         21  anything about that.  They were not beaten; they were
         22  brought back to their places.
         23            From time to time they would bring water in
         24  buckets, in white buckets, with Jupol letters written
         25  on it, and we would then fight amongst ourselves for

          1  this water.  (redacted)
          2  (redacted)
          3  (redacted)
          4  (redacted)
          5  (redacted)
          6  (redacted) because we were sitting behind and we
          7  could never get any water.  People would shout.  We
          8  were all very thirsty.  We had not been drinking or
          9  eating for quite some time.
         10       Q.   Witness, how full of men, how packed was the
         11  section of the warehouse that you were in?
         12       A.   In my estimate, there were approximately
         13  1.000, between 1.000 and 1.500 people, roughly.  I'm
         14  not sure either.  Maybe less, maybe more.  This is just
         15  my rough estimate.  This is how it seemed to me while I
         16  was there, inside, but I was in fear.
         17       Q.   I understand that.  How close was each man to
         18  the other inside the warehouse?
         19       A.   One next to the other, shoulder by shoulder.
         20       Q.   So each man was touching the other inside the
         21  factory building.  There was no --
         22       A.   Yes.
         23       Q.   There was no space between all of the men
         24  inside the factory at all.
         25       A.   No, not at all.  There was no space

          1  whatsoever.  People were touching each other, they were
          2  sitting next to each other, so that nobody could walk
          3  between two people.  Only if you lean on one side, one
          4  could perhaps walk slowly.
          5       Q.   What was the atmosphere like in the factory
          6  at this time?  How did you all feel?
          7       A.   Terrible is all that I can say.  We were in
          8  great panic, all of us.  I was fearful.
          9            When we were brought there, I knew what was
         10  in store for us, I knew it already.  I mean, as soon as
         11  we were crowded into those buses and when I realised
         12  that we were not going towards Tuzla but Bratunac, I
         13  knew what was happening, what would happen, especially
         14  when we were brought to the warehouse.
         15       Q.   Now, you've explained to the Judges that the
         16  Bosnian Serb soldiers took your belongings, that some
         17  interrogations took place.  Can you recall what
         18  happened after that?
         19       A.   Yes, I remember that very well.  After that
         20  the night fell, it was in the evening.  When we came
         21  there, it was still daylight.  I don't know what time
         22  it was but it was getting dark.
         23            After it became dark, some shelling started.
         24  I heard shots and I realised that shells were falling
         25  around, and I heard a sizzling noise of shell

          1  fragment.  And then they told us, "See how we're
          2  guarding you?  We're not hitting you, we're not beating
          3  you.  We're good to you.  We'll let you go peacefully
          4  towards Tuzla, and your people are now shooting at us
          5  and they will not let you through peacefully."  But I
          6  cannot believe, and I still don't believe, that our
          7  people were shooting at us.  They didn't have any
          8  mortars.  While we were going through the woods, I
          9  didn't see any mortar, any shells.  We didn't have such
         10  things.
         11            So this created even greater panic, but after
         12  a while everything became quiet.  They would take out
         13  two of our people, as if to -- they were saying that
         14  they needed them to pick up their wounded members
         15  because they didn't dare, they were afraid of being
         16  shot.  I didn't see those people, I didn't see the
         17  people who were supposedly being brought by our people,
         18  by Muslims.  They were simply being taken out two by
         19  two, and then they would be brought back.
         20            So after a while, after everything went
         21  quiet, they became very angry, the Bosnian Serbs.  Four
         22  or five of them would enter the warehouse, yelling at
         23  us, shouting, cursing us, and this lasted for a while
         24  and then they became quiet.  Some of them wanted to
         25  open fire on us, but there was one guy there who was

          1  wearing a multicoloured uniform and he had an automatic
          2  rifle in his hands, and he said, "Do not touch these
          3  people.  It's not their fault.  They're not guilty of
          4  anything."
          5            So this lasted for a while and then it became
          6  dark.  At one point, while I was still in the
          7  warehouse, while it was still daylight -- I forgot to
          8  mention this -- buses were passing by, from Potocari,
          9  travelling in the direction of Kladanj, carrying women,
         10  children, and elderly, people who were being
         11  evacuated.  So while buses were passing by, everything
         12  would be quiet.  They didn't shout at us at that
         13  moment, but after a bus had gone by they would start
         14  yelling at us again.
         15            And then as I told you, after it became dark,
         16  one of them came in.  He had a very long beard, dark
         17  sunglasses, he had very long curly hair, and he was the
         18  first one who opened fire from his automatic rifle on
         19  us, and I think that maybe three or four of us fell
         20  down immediately.  The one wearing dark glasses was the
         21  first one to have opened fire.  As soon as that
         22  happened, I threw myself on the ground and I fell down,
         23  and immediately after that chaos ensued.
         24       Q.   Now, Witness, I know that this was a terrible
         25  scene, but as best you can, if you can explain to the

          1  Judges what, if anything, you could see going on around
          2  you and for how long the shooting continued inside the
          3  warehouse.
          4       A.   While I was inside the warehouse, they fired
          5  from all kinds of weapons.  They first fired infantry
          6  weapons, automatic rifles.  Then they would stop doing
          7  that.  They would shoot for about half an hour, then
          8  take a little rest, and then there would be a new
          9  series of shooting.  They would throw hand grenades
         10  through the windows, and grenades fell some two or
         11  three metres away from me.  I could just feel the
         12  explosion, the detonation, and as a result of that I
         13  was injured by small shrapnel coming from those
         14  shells.  So I got wounded, I was injured, but I felt
         15  well.  I wasn't seriously injured.
         16            People started screaming, and it was
         17  terrible.  It is hard for me to describe it.  I haven't
         18  seen anything like it in any of the horror movies that
         19  I saw.  This was far worse than any film.  And this
         20  lasted all night long, with short breaks.  Bosnian
         21  Serbs would take some rest, make a short break, and
         22  then they would resume.
         23            They opened fire from anti-aircraft weapons
         24  that were positioned on the asphalt road, with Zoljas
         25  as well.  All I saw was some kind of lightning coming

          1  from weapons.  A bullet hit me which came from, I
          2  believe, an infantry weapon, but I'm not sure.  I was
          3  hit above my right knee.  It was a gunshot wound but I
          4  didn't feel any pain.  I was only concerned about
          5  losing my limb.  I was worried that it might be a
          6  fragmentation bullet.
          7            After one of such breaks, when things became
          8  quiet, when they stopped shooting, I grabbed myself by
          9  my heel.  I just wanted to make sure that my heel was
         10  there because for a while I couldn't feel it at all.
         11  And probably, it turned out later on, when I had some
         12  medical examination by medical specialists, that a
         13  tendon had been cut, and this is why I couldn't feel my
         14  heel for a while.  But at the moment I grabbed it, I
         15  realised it was still there.  I was glad it was there.
         16  I didn't feel any pain.  It was just a slight burning
         17  feeling, as if from a cigarette.
         18            I don't know what time it was, but it was
         19  past midnight, things went quiet, and at that moment I
         20  tried to escape, I tried to leave the warehouse.  There
         21  was a kind of container to my left, a kind of container
         22  that is part of a truck.  It was not a big container.
         23  It was on the lower part of the wall.  And above the
         24  container there was a window which was open, so I
         25  climbed onto the window and I jumped through the

          1  window.
          2       Q.   Witness, can you describe the scene around
          3  you as you made your way to the window?  Can you
          4  describe to the Judges what was on the floor all around
          5  you?
          6       A.   (redacted)
          7  (redacted)
          8  (redacted)
          9  (redacted)
         10  (redacted)
         11  (redacted)
         12            After the shooting, I felt a strange kind of
         13  heat, warmth, which was actually coming from the blood
         14  that covered the concrete floor, and I was stepping on
         15  the dead people who were lying around.  But there were
         16  even people who were still alive, who were only
         17  wounded, and as soon as I would step on him, I would
         18  hear him cry, moan, because I was trying to move as
         19  fast as I could.  I could tell that people had been
         20  completely disembodied, and I could feel bones of the
         21  people that had been hit by those bursts of gunfire or
         22  shells, I could feel their ribs crushing.  And then I
         23  would get up again and I would continue towards the
         24  container.
         25            So I first made a few attempts, trying to

          1  figure out where exactly I could get out.
          2       Q.   Witness, if you could pause there.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, would it be an
          4  appropriate time to take a break?
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
          6  Mr. Cayley.  Thank you very much for your attention.
          7            We will have a 20-minute break now -- I'm
          8  sorry, half an hour break, a 30-minute break, so that
          9  the witness can have some rest.
         10                 --- Recess taken at 12.22 p.m.
         11                 --- On resuming at 12.56 p.m.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         13  Mr. Cayley.  You may continue.
         14            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         15       Q.   Witness, before the break, we had got to a
         16  point in time where you were trying to make your escape
         17  from the factory, and I just want to ask one question
         18  about a point in time before that.
         19            Do you recall when you were taken from the
         20  meadow to the factory at Kravica in a bus?
         21       A.   In the afternoon?
         22       Q.   Yes.  Do you recall that?
         23       A.   Yes.
         24       Q.   On the bus, were there any guards?  Were
         25  there any Bosnian Serb soldiers?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Can you describe how they were dressed?
          3       A.   In camouflage uniforms, camouflage.
          4       Q.   Now, you said, prior to the break, that there
          5  was a container in the warehouse which you were going
          6  to use to make good your escape.  Can you explain to
          7  the Judges whereabouts this container was located
          8  inside the warehouse?
          9       A.   What do you mean?  In relation to me, where I
         10  was inside, or when you're looking inside from the
         11  entrance?
         12       Q.   If you could explain where the container was
         13  in relation to the back wall of the factory.
         14       A.   I was roughly in the middle, and if I were to
         15  face the entrance that I passed through when I entered,
         16  the container was to my left, diagonally.  Above the
         17  container were the windows, separated.
         18       Q.   Can you explain to the Judges how you used
         19  this container to make your escape?
         20       A.   When everything was quiet again, I got up and
         21  I tried to save myself, to escape.  So that I was
         22  treading on dead people, on the wounded.  I reached the
         23  container.  I looked to my right from where I had
         24  entered the warehouse.  I saw outside that they were --
         25  that there was some cigarettes lighted.  All I could

          1  see was the cigarettes alight.  They were Bosnian Serbs
          2  that were smoking cigarettes.
          3            I jumped because the container wasn't very
          4  high, so I was able to climb onto it.  And then I
          5  stepped on to the window and jumped outside to the
          6  ground.
          7            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
          8  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/9, please.
          9       Q.   Was there anything covering the window that
         10  you jumped through?
         11       A.   No, it was open.  It wasn't covered with
         12  anything.  There were -- there was no glass in the
         13  window.  It was open.
         14            MR. CAYLEY:  If the exhibit could be placed
         15  on the ELMO.
         16       Q.   If you can recall, could you indicate to the
         17  Judges which window it was that you jumped through?
         18       A.   I don't know exactly which window now.  I can
         19  roughly show you.
         20       Q.   As best you can remember, Witness.
         21       A.   It may have been one of these two
         22  [indicates], or maybe this one, the third one.  One of
         23  these.  One of these three or four.  I don't know
         24  exactly which one it was because I wasn't looking when
         25  I jumped.  I didn't remember.  I didn't turn around to

          1  look at the windows.
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  So let the record show on
          3  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/9 that the witness indicated
          4  that the window that he jumped through was one -- I
          5  think he was most certain about the three small windows
          6  on the back of this building, so -- this is actually
          7  the rear of the warehouse, but as this photograph
          8  appears, the witness indicated that he jumped from one
          9  of three or four small windows that can clearly be seen
         10  on this photograph in the centre of the building.
         11       Q.   Now, Witness, can you describe to the Judges
         12  what you could see around you at this point, if
         13  anything at all?
         14       A.   When I jumped from the window and fell to the
         15  ground, I just heard a voice from the corn field.  I
         16  didn't know that there were guards around, and that
         17  there were guards.  If I had known, I wouldn't have
         18  dared jump.  I wouldn't have had the courage, because
         19  they would have killed me.
         20            So when I jumped and fell to the ground, I
         21  just heard a voice saying, "There's one that just
         22  jumped."  And then when I fell to the ground, I saw in
         23  front of me, to my right, there were two dead men lying
         24  on the ground.  Most probably, they had also tried to
         25  save their lives and escape and, unfortunately, they

          1  failed.
          2       Q.   Now, you mentioned that you heard a voice,
          3  let me get this right, coming from the corn field.
          4            Can you indicate to the Judges on this
          5  photograph, the corn field that you're referring to?
          6       A.   Yes, I can [indicates].
          7            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          8  witness is identifying on Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/9 that
          9  the piece of ground covered in snow which is
         10  immediately in front of the building and which has some
         11  plants growing on it, corn, old corn growing on it is
         12  the corn field to which the witness is referring.
         13       Q.   Now, it was summertime when you were there,
         14  it was July.  Was the corn higher than is shown in this
         15  photograph?
         16       A.   Yes, of course it was much higher.  And it
         17  was still green, it hadn't ripened yet, but it was very
         18  high.  So if I were to stand up straight, though I
         19  didn't stand up straight, if I were to stand up
         20  straight, it would be higher than me, the maize.
         21       Q.   Now, you said today that you saw that there
         22  were two dead men lying on the ground and that they had
         23  tried to save their lives, and you stated
         24  unfortunately, they failed.  Can you recall what
         25  happened to you next?

          1       A.   Yes, of course I remember.  When I heard this
          2  voice from the maize, "There's one that's just jumped
          3  out," immediately a man headed towards me through the
          4  maize.  And the searchlights went on, and the person
          5  who passed by me, I could feel.  I wasn't looking at
          6  him.  I was facing the wall from which I had just
          7  jumped, the window, rather.  He was carrying this
          8  searchlight which had been switched on and, of course,
          9  he carried a rifle, but I didn't see that.
         10            But I could feel the flash of the light
         11  against the wall.  And this Serb soldier was
         12  approaching me.  I knew that was my end.  I didn't try
         13  to run, though I could have tried, but I didn't want
         14  to.  I waited for him to kill me.  So that if I had
         15  tried to run, he would have certainly killed me.  There
         16  were several of them.  I waited for him to kill me.  He
         17  approached two metres from me and he shot a single
         18  bullet at me, so that he hit me in the back, my right
         19  shoulder blade.  It was an entry and exit wound.  I
         20  kept quiet; I didn't speak or say anything.  He asked
         21  me, "Do you want more?"  I remained silent, without
         22  uttering a sound, to try and persuade him that I was
         23  dead.  I pretended to be dead, and of course I
         24  succeeded, he really thought I was dead, but luckily I
         25  was alive.

          1            Then he cried out that his clip had fallen
          2  out, so that a second man approached him and they found
          3  the clip.  And they left me, they went back into the
          4  maize.
          5            After that I continued to hear bursts of fire
          6  and shots being fired at people in the warehouse where
          7  I was, I heard them killing people there, so that I
          8  remained there all night, until morning.
          9       Q.   Witness, if you could just pause there for a
         10  moment.
         11            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         12  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/9, which is the one I think that
         13  was on the ELMO.
         14       Q.   If you could indicate to the Judges on this
         15  photograph where you lay that night, approximately.
         16       A.   Here [indicates].  Here [indicates], perhaps
         17  half a metre from the wall, here [indicates], on the
         18  grass.  To my left was the maize field.  My head was
         19  turned towards the river, or rather towards Kladanj,
         20  and my legs towards Bratunac, shall I put it that way.
         21       Q.   That's very clear, Witness.
         22            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         23  witness has indicated, on Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/9,
         24  that he was lying on some grass between the factory
         25  building and the cornfield, with his head facing

          1  towards the left-hand side of the photograph and his
          2  legs to the right-hand side of the photograph.
          3       Q.   Now, Witness, you said that you stayed there
          4  all night.  Did anybody come and check your body during
          5  the night?
          6       A.   No, no one came.
          7       Q.   Can you tell the Judges what you recall from
          8  the next day, from the next morning, what happened to
          9  you?
         10       A.   When it dawned?
         11       Q.   When it dawned, Witness, yes.
         12       A.   I was still lying there.  I didn't dare move
         13  because I was thinking and I was afraid that someone
         14  might come to check whether I was still on that spot or
         15  whether I had escaped.  So when the sun rose, I heard
         16  yells and a noise.  People were yelling and asking
         17  whether anyone inside was left alive, in the
         18  warehouse.  Of course there were some people who were
         19  alive.  So they promised them, I heard a voice saying,
         20  the Bosnian Serbs promising and saying that the Red
         21  Cross had come and that the first aid people had come
         22  to take them to the hospital to treat them.  And
         23  whoever could walk and crawl out of the warehouse, they
         24  came out.  I didn't see them coming out.  I didn't see
         25  them taking them out.

          1            And probably they sat down there somewhere; I
          2  don't know because I couldn't see it.  And then this
          3  one man, of course I assume it was the leader who was
          4  giving the orders, who was in command, he ordered them
          5  to sing songs, Serb songs, Chetnik songs, rather.  As
          6  far as I could hear, I remember well that they sang the
          7  song "From Topolje to Ravne Gora, there are all our
          8  guards of General Draza," and many other songs that I
          9  had remembered but I've forgotten in the meantime.
         10            After that, they went on singing for about
         11  half an hour or an hour, I'm not sure, then I heard
         12  bursts of fire.  The fire went on for some time, I
         13  don't know for how long, a certain amount of time.
         14  They killed those wounded, and later I didn't hear
         15  anything anymore, I never heard them singing those
         16  songs.  But they were dragging them inside, into the
         17  warehouse.
         18            After that I heard a voice, one of those
         19  Bosnian Serbs said, "There are some dead around the
         20  building.  They need to be collected."  So I was even
         21  more afraid there.  I panicked because I thought they
         22  would collect me and they would see I was alive and
         23  then they would kill me.  Then another one said, "Well,
         24  they are not a problem.  We'll collect them later.
         25  Let's deal with those who are inside."

          1            Then they were shooting them in their heads.
          2  I heard them inside, they were saying something like,
          3  "I think this one is still alive.  Shoot him in the
          4  head," and then you would hear a bullet, one, two, or
          5  several, shooting at those they thought were still
          6  alive.
          7            After that I heard a loud noise inside, in
          8  the hangar.  The excavator, the dredger, was collecting
          9  the dead, and in my view they were probably loading
         10  them onto a truck and driving them to graves.  I could
         11  not see the direction they took.  So that I still
         12  remained in the same spot, lying there.
         13            After a while I heard somebody walking
         14  through the maize field toward me.  It was a Bosnian
         15  Serb soldier.  I realised immediately that it was the
         16  soldier who had shot me the previous night.  He came to
         17  a metre from me, perhaps.  Judging by the sound, he
         18  stopped very close to me.
         19            I was stinking like a corpse, covered in
         20  blood.  There were flies all over me.  As I said, the
         21  sun was high and it was hot.  And when he approached
         22  me, the flies flew off me, they flew away.  And he was
         23  there for maybe half a minute or a minute; I don't know
         24  exactly, anyway, very briefly.  So he didn't say
         25  anything, he didn't touch me, he just broke off a leaf

          1  from the maize plant and he sounded as if he had a
          2  cold, he was sniffing.  And then he went back again
          3  through the maize field.  While he was approaching me,
          4  I held my breath so that he couldn't notice that I was
          5  breathing, so in that way I managed to make him believe
          6  that I was dead.  When he left, no other person came
          7  close.
          8            After that I raised my head a little and I
          9  looked in front of me.  I was all stiff because I
         10  didn't dare budge all night.  Then I stretched my arms
         11  and legs a little, and I saw that everything was all
         12  right, that I could walk, it wasn't too painful.  Then
         13  I turned to look around behind me, and I saw the hangar
         14  behind me and I saw Bosnian Serbs entering, entering
         15  the other hangar.
         16            On that hangar they were entering, I saw some
         17  red letters but I don't remember what was written on
         18  that hangar.  The letters were written in a straight
         19  line, vertically, in red.
         20       Q.   Witness, if you could wait there for a
         21  moment.
         22            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         23  Prosecutor's Exhibit 116.
         24       Q.   Now, Witness, you and I viewed a video
         25  yesterday afternoon, which I think is Prosecutor's

          1  Exhibit 8/9.
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  It's a video that's in
          3  evidence.  I'll give the Court a number in a moment.
          4  It's actually Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/13, the video that
          5  Your Honours saw of the Kravica warehouse.
          6       Q.   In fact, you noticed on this video that the
          7  lettering that you saw on the building is -- if the
          8  photograph could be put centrally.
          9            Could you point to the lettering, the
         10  vertical lettering, that you saw when you got up on
         11  that day, in July, on the other building?
         12       A.   Yes, of course I'll show it.  They are these
         13  letters [indicates].
         14            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         15  witness is indicating, on Prosecutor's Exhibit 116, a
         16  series of seven letters that are set vertically on a
         17  white building, a part of the factory complex in
         18  Kravica, and they are located just above and to the
         19  right of the door, which is just off centre in the
         20  photograph.
         21            If the witness could then be shown
         22  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/2.
         23       Q.   If you could just indicate on this photograph
         24  the building on which those letters were written from
         25  which you saw Bosnian Serb soldiers entering.

          1       A.   Of course I'll show you.  It's this building
          2  here [indicates].
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          4  witness is indicating, on Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/2, to
          5  the part of the factory complex, the warehouse
          6  building, which is furthest to the left.  It's above
          7  the road and it's the building furthest to the left,
          8  and it's perpendicular to the road that runs from the
          9  left to the right of the photograph.
         10       Q.   Now, after you'd got up, after you'd seen
         11  this lettering, what did you do next?
         12       A.   I sort of stretched out a little while I was
         13  still lying down.
         14       Q.   Sorry, Witness, it's just we need that
         15  photograph again, and rather than have the usher bring
         16  it back.
         17            MR. CAYLEY:  It's Exhibit 8/2.  You can just
         18  leave that Mr. Usher.
         19       Q.   I'm sorry to interrupt you, Witness, you said
         20  that you stretched out a little.  You were still lying
         21  down.  What happened to you next?
         22       A.   Yes.  As I was saying, I stretched my legs
         23  and arms.  I looked to the left through the maize.  I
         24  saw them entering again, Bosnian Serbs.  It was a
         25  little way away from me.  They were entering the lower

          1  hangar and to my left.  I'll show it to you on the
          2  picture [indicates].  They were entering this hangar.
          3  This one.
          4       Q.   If you could just wait there, Witness.
          5       A.   By this hangar, next to this hangar.
          6            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          7  witness is indicating on Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/2 the
          8  white rectangular building which is furthest in the
          9  background of the photograph and has a striped effected
         10  front, the front of the building has -- appears to have
         11  black and white stripes.
         12       Q.   Please continue, Witness.
         13       A.   In the course of the night, in this building,
         14  I will show you now [indicates], in this building, I
         15  heard to my left, I think it was in this building, that
         16  there must have been cows screaming, something was
         17  squealing like pigs.  I don't know what it was.  To me,
         18  it sounded like cows.  There were some cries anyway and
         19  screams.
         20            And, as I have just said, I saw those Bosnian
         21  Serbs, two or three of them I saw.  Once when I had
         22  decided to run from the place I was lying, I saw them
         23  entering this hangar to my left.
         24            And then, I crawled to the left through the
         25  maize for a distance of some two or three metres, maybe

          1  more.  So I entered a line of the maize and I headed --
          2  if I'm looking at the picture, as I am now, towards the
          3  river.  I'll show you now.  And I crawled as far as the
          4  river.  From here to the right [indicates].
          5            I reached this corner here [indicates].  I
          6  looked to the right to make sure there were no Bosnian
          7  Serbs to see me there.  And while I was crawling
          8  through the maize, I was going very slowly so that no
          9  one would notice any movement.  I saw two or three
         10  bodies here [indicates].  The soil was clay near the
         11  river, and the maize couldn't grow from the clay soil,
         12  it was very small, very short, maybe only half a metre
         13  from the ground, maybe even smaller.
         14            And I saw three Muslim men dead there.  One
         15  of them had a shot wound in his head.
         16       Q.   Witness, if you could just indicate again,
         17  without speaking, the route that you took from behind
         18  the warehouse, and I'll describe it so that it's on our
         19  transcript.  So if you can just indicate, with the
         20  pointer, the route that you took from behind the
         21  warehouse?
         22       A.   What do you mean?  While I was crawling or
         23  while we were on the bus?
         24       Q.   While you were crawling.
         25       A.   I see.  I'll show you.  This is where I was

          1  [indicates], and this is the distance that I covered
          2  crawling to my right side in the direction of the
          3  river, if you're looking at the picture the way I am
          4  now.  So this is the way I took, and this is the spot
          5  where I actually entered [indicates] the brook, the
          6  creek.  I stayed five minutes -- for about five minutes
          7  there.  I drank some water.  I washed myself a little.
          8  And I saw another dead body here [indicates] who also
          9  had a gunshot wound in his head.  It must have been a
         10  Muslim who had tried to save his life, but didn't
         11  manage to.  So I crossed the river --
         12       Q.   Witness, if you could wait.
         13            MR. CAYLEY:   Let the record show that the
         14  route that the witness took on Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/2
         15  is a route that he indicated immediately behind the
         16  main factory building which is in the centre of the
         17  photograph, immediately behind that building to its
         18  extreme right end, and then up diagonally into an area
         19  that appears to have bushes and trees where he
         20  indicated there was a brook.
         21       Q.   Now, Witness, you said that you went into a
         22  brook where you washed yourself and you drank some
         23  water.  Do you recall that?
         24       A.   Yes, of course I recall that.
         25       Q.   How long did you spend in that small river?

          1       A.   About five minutes, at least I think it was
          2  five.  I didn't have a watch.
          3       Q.   And after you left that little brook, where
          4  did you go after that?
          5       A.   I'll show you on the picture.  At this corner
          6  here [indicates], this is where I drank some water,
          7  where I washed myself at the brook.
          8            So I moved maybe five or ten metres upwards
          9  and then I turned back.  And then I turned towards the
         10  warehouse and I could still hear the sound of the
         11  excavator collecting dead bodies from the warehouse.
         12            I was looking for a bottle or a container of
         13  some kind so that I could take some water for me for
         14  later on to refresh myself, but I couldn't find
         15  anything.
         16            So I crossed the brook and I entered another
         17  cornfield.  This is the other cornfield [indicates].
         18  And I walked through the cornfield, through one line of
         19  the corns, and I reached a small path which cannot be
         20  seen on the picture, and this is where I entered the
         21  woods.
         22            Again, I felt very weak.  I was about to
         23  faint.  And this is where I found an empty can.  I
         24  continued for about 20 to 30 metres along that path and
         25  I came up to a brook again.

          1            MR. CAYLEY:  If the record could just show
          2  that the route that the witness indicated was a
          3  cornfield in the top right-hand corner of the
          4  photograph and that he left through the cornfield and
          5  then followed a path which is not shown on this
          6  photograph.
          7       Q.   Witness, you said you found an empty can and
          8  you continued for 20 to 30 metres along a path and you
          9  came to a brook again.
         10            Now, I know from you and I having spoken that
         11  you had quite a difficult journey after this, but I
         12  want to cut matters short.  I think I'm right in saying
         13  that you eventually found yourself in the town of Zepa
         14  on, I think, the 26th of July of 1995; is that correct?
         15       A.   I don't know exactly what date it was.  I
         16  know only that I was in Zepa, that's true.  But it was
         17  before the fall of Zepa at any rate.
         18       Q.   Do you know when Zepa fell?
         19       A.   I don't know, because I had left before the
         20  town fell, and the Bosnian Serbs had already entered
         21  the area.  Maybe it was two, three, four, maybe five
         22  days later, and I stayed a while in the hospital in
         23  Zepa.
         24            So when we went down to Zepa, the 12 of us
         25  who were wounded, we decided to join a convoy with the

          1  civilian population; women, children, and elderly
          2  people towards Kladanj.
          3       Q.   While you were in Zepa, were you registered
          4  by the Red Cross?
          5       A.   Yes.  When I came to Zepa, together with a
          6  colleague of mine, a friend of mine whose name was
          7  Senad.  I forgot his last name.  He's from Voljavica.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  I want to show you your Red
          9  Cross certificate which is Exhibit 118.
         10            Mr. Usher don't put this on the ELMO because
         11  it has the witness' name on it, but if copies of it
         12  could be given to the witness and Judges.
         13       Q.   Witness, don't read anything from this
         14  certificate, but can you just confirm that this is the
         15  Red Cross certificate confirming that you were
         16  originally registered in Zepa and then subsequently
         17  visited at the Rogatica military camp?
         18       A.   Yes, that is correct.  I was registered
         19  together with everybody else.  There were, I believe,
         20  12 of us who had been wounded.
         21            We entered the UN Compound where the Ukranian
         22  Battalion was stationed, and this is where the Red
         23  Cross people came and registered us.
         24            The Bosnian Serbs, the military, had already
         25  entered the town of Zepa, and they were walking around

          1  the area.  They were together there while the
          2  evacuation of civilians was taking place towards
          3  Kladanj.
          4            Then French doctors came and examined us
          5  together with a Serb doctor.  This doctor examined me
          6  as well, and then they were selecting wounded people.
          7  They wouldn't let them do it.  They let some of them
          8  go.  There were quite a few elderly people there;
          9  people who could not walk, could not move, and they
         10  were evacuated by the French military in their APCs.
         11  Some of the wounded were put on buses, but the 12 of us
         12  who remained, they didn't let us go --
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Cayley,
         14  I'm sorry to interrupt you at this point because the
         15  text has already disappeared from the screen.  The
         16  exhibit that we saw was 5/18 and the transcript on page
         17  91 which is no longer here stated 6/18.  I would just
         18  like to make sure that it was 5/18.
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I
         20  know that after the proceedings, the stenographers
         21  actually go through the recorded -- the record and
         22  actually correct all of these numbers.  So it will be
         23  done.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         25  then, because I didn't say 5/18 or 6/18.  I said --

          1  well, if a correction is going to be made, then it will
          2  be corrected, because I wanted to say that it was not
          3  Exhibit 1/18, yes, but the exhibit number 5/18.
          4            I'm sorry, I see 5/18 once again.  As far as
          5  I can see, it's 5/18 and I wanted to say 118.  That is
          6  118.  I'm sorry.  It's my mistake.  I'm sorry.
          7            MR. CAYLEY:  Well, Mr. President, you have
          8  success at the end.  You have 118 on the transcript.
          9       Q.   Witness, in summary, and if you could just
         10  answer yes or no, the Defence may have some more
         11  detailed questions than this, but am I right in saying
         12  that you were promised that you would be taken to free
         13  territory and, in fact, you found yourself in the
         14  Bosnian Serb prison camp at Rogatica.  That's where the
         15  Bosnian Serbs actually took you?
         16       A.   Yes, that's correct.
         17       Q.   And I think you stayed in that camp until the
         18  15th of January, 1996, and you were then taken to Kula
         19  prison and exchanged at Sarajevo airport on the 19th of
         20  January of 1996; is that right?
         21       A.   Yes, that is correct.
         22       Q.   If I could just briefly show you Prosecutor's
         23  Exhibit 117, which, again, Mr. Usher, is a document
         24  that's not to go on the ELMO.
         25            (redacted)

          1  (redacted)
          2  (redacted).  I'm not going to go through them all, but
          3  if you could just confirm that these are your medical
          4  records which you provided to the Office of the
          5  Prosecutor a number of years ago, I think two years
          6  ago.
          7            Are these your medical records?
          8       A.   Yes, these are my medical records.
          9       Q. (redacted)
         10  (redacted)
         11  (redacted)?
         12       A.   Yes, that's right.
         13       Q.   (redacted)
         14  (redacted)
         15       A.   (redacted).
         16       Q.   Now, I know you suffered some trauma as a
         17  result of these events, and that's shown in your
         18  medical records.  How do you feel now?
         19       A.   I don't feel very well.  That's all I can
         20  tell you.  But all in all it's okay.  I cannot
         21  complain.
         22       Q.   Do you still have any night-time recollection
         23  of the events at Kravica?  Do you still have dreams or
         24  nightmares about these events?
         25       A.   Yes, of course I do.  I have dreams.  I wake

          1  up in the middle of the night and I shiver.  I become
          2  anxious, I start trembling, and everything comes back
          3  to my mind, my journey from Srebrenica to Tuzla.
          4  Everything sort of passes through me once again and it
          5  makes me fearful again.  It's difficult to describe how
          6  I feel.
          7       Q.   Witness, thank you very much, indeed, for
          8  your patience.  I have no further questions for you.
          9            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I can now offer
         10  the witness for cross-examination.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         12  very much, Mr. Cayley.
         13            I think we should have a break now because
         14  one member of the Chamber has an urgent obligation.
         15            I don't know how much time you will need,
         16  Mr. Petrusic, for your cross-examination.  Could you
         17  tell us that now?
         18            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         19  of course it will depend on the answers given by the
         20  witness, but we hope to finish before the end of the
         21  day.  However, this is not a 100 per cent reliable
         22  estimate, but we will do our best to complete the
         23  cross-examination today.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] But in any
         25  case we have to have a break.  We will have a 15-minute
          1  break, and after that we will continue.
          2            Thank you very much, Mr. Petrusic.
          3            A 15-minute break now.
          4                 --- Recess taken at 1.47 p.m.
          5                 --- On resuming at 2.03 p.m.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] As you can
          7  see, Judge Fouad Riad was unable to rejoin us, and in
          8  line with Rule 15 bis we're going to continue with the
          9  testimony of this witness.
         10            Mr. Petrusic, you have the floor.
         11            Witness, you are now going to answer
         12  questions put to you by Counsel Petrusic.
         13            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         14  Mr. President.
         15                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         16       Q.   Good afternoon, Witness K.
         17       A.   Good afternoon.
         18       Q.   At the very beginning, I should like to ask
         19  you, where did you start out from in the direction of
         20  Jaglici, on the 11th of July, I think it was?
         21       A.   We headed towards Tuzla.
         22       Q.   But where from?  You yourself.
         23       A.   From Srebrenica.
         24       Q.   A group of able-bodied men rallied in
         25  Jaglici, did they not?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   So could you please wait a couple of seconds
          3  after my question, since we speak the same language,
          4  for the benefit of the interpreters.  Just three
          5  seconds or so.
          6            So this group went on along which road?
          7       A.   I'm afraid I didn't understand your
          8  question.
          9       Q.   When you got together in Jaglici, you headed
         10  towards which position, along which path, which route?
         11       A.   We headed towards Tuzla, through the woods.
         12       Q.   You said in the course of your testimony
         13  today that you were not armed.
         14       A.   I beg your pardon?
         15       Q.   During the examination-in-chief, you said
         16  that you were unarmed.
         17       A.   When?  Where?
         18       Q.   I mean Jaglici and on from there.
         19       A.   Yes.  The majority were not armed, of the
         20  men, of course.
         21       Q.   In your statement to the Agency for
         22  Investigation and Documentation, AID, on the 16th of
         23  February, 1996, you said, on page 2 --
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Could I ask
         25  the usher for his assistance, please.  Could the

          1  statement be given to the Chamber, the Prosecution, and
          2  the witness.
          3            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] It will be
          4  Exhibit D14.
          5            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
          6       Q.   So on page 2, the first sentence:  "After a
          7  short lull, the Chetniks opened fire at us again,
          8  demanding that we surrender our weapons, which we did
          9  not agree to."
         10       A.   Yes.
         11       Q.   Therefore, this was an armed group.
         12       A.   No, they didn't see that.  But they called on
         13  all of us, whoever had any weapons, to surrender them,
         14  or if they had any, to surrender them.  They thought
         15  that we were all armed and we were not.  Very few men
         16  had rifles.
         17       Q.   Witness K, you said that you didn't agree to
         18  surrender your weapons, so my question is:  Was yours
         19  an armed group of men or not?
         20       A.   I don't understand.  Do you mean a small
         21  group or all the men who were heading towards Tuzla?
         22       Q.   The group that you were in.
         23       A.   The group I was in?  They called on all of us
         24  to surrender, anyone who had any weapons.  All men who
         25  were armed were called on by them to throw down their

          1  weapons, or to surrender.  Of course, when the
          2  surrender occurred, no one reached them with their
          3  weapons on them.  They wouldn't give themselves up
          4  armed.
          5       Q.   You're talking about the group you were in,
          6  and you said that you didn't accept their offer, shall
          7  we call it that.
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   Therefore, that group did have weapons.
         10       A.   We did, but we didn't surrender together with
         11  our weapons.  The moment that I decided to go and
         12  surrender, together with a group of men, none of us had
         13  any weapons because people threw away their weapons in
         14  the woods.  They didn't dare surrender with their
         15  weapons on them, of course.
         16       Q.   So let us make this quite clear.  The moment
         17  that you were called upon, did you and your group have
         18  weapons on you?
         19       A.   The moment they called on us, I did not have
         20  a weapon just then.
         21       Q.   So you are claiming that the statement you
         22  made to AID is not correct.
         23       A.   What do you mean?
         24       Q.   Regarding this part that we're referring to.
         25       A.   I don't understand that.

          1            MR. CAYLEY:  Objection.  Your Honour, I think
          2  it should actually be made very clear what the witness
          3  said in his statement, and I think there is a slight
          4  degree of misrepresentation that is taking place by
          5  Mr. Petrusic.
          6            The witness did not state in his statement
          7  that he refused to do anything, and Mr. Petrusic has
          8  actually offered it to the witness in that fashion,
          9  "You refused to lay down your arms."  If I read from
         10  the English version, it states:  "After a short
         11  silence, the Chetniks opened fire on us again,
         12  demanding that we surrender our weapons to them, which
         13  we refused to do."
         14            The witness has been asked on a number of
         15  occasions whether or not there were armed persons in
         16  the column.  He's acknowledged that.  He said that
         17  there were a number of people that were armed in the
         18  column.  Mr. Petrusic is asking essentially the same
         19  question over and over again, to which he's getting the
         20  same response.  So I think he should be asked to move
         21  on with his cross-examination, and I think that the
         22  witness has satisfactorily answered the question.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         24  Mr. Petrusic, what is your response?  What is your
         25  reaction to this?

          1            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] My response,
          2  Mr. President, is that I am not misrepresenting what
          3  the witness said, I'm just asking him whether what he
          4  said was correct or not.  Maybe we can put the question
          5  in that way.
          6            The sentence that has been quoted from his
          7  statement, does it reflect the real state of affairs at
          8  that point in time, on the 11th of July, and at that
          9  spot where he was?
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         11  Mr. Petrusic, but I think that the witness has already
         12  explained, in a way.  But if the witness has answered,
         13  maybe you should move forward and go on to another
         14  question.
         15            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Very well,
         16  Mr. President.
         17       Q.   Thank you, Witness K.
         18            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I should like
         19  to ask the usher to be kind enough to put on the ELMO
         20  Prosecutor's Exhibit 8/4.  Could you please move it to
         21  the right a little, the photograph to the right, to the
         22  right.  Thank you.
         23       Q.   In relation to the left part of the
         24  photograph, where we see these two pillars, below the
         25  sign saying "Kravica", can the witness tell us where

          1  the buses stopped?
          2       A.   Yes, I'll show you on the photograph.
          3       Q.   The front part of the bus, where did it stop?
          4       A.   Here [indicates], further to the left, off
          5  the photograph.
          6            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] So for the
          7  record, it can be noted that it is to the left of the
          8  area shown on the photograph, underneath the first
          9  window.
         10       Q.   You disembarked from the bus, and can you
         11  then explain where you went to?
         12       A.   On the photograph?  You want me to show you
         13  on the photograph?
         14       Q.   Describe it, and then we'll see for the
         15  record.
         16       A.   I got off the bus.  I entered the first
         17  entrance there.  Just in front of this pillar where it
         18  says "Kravica".  To the left of the first pillar.
         19       Q.   Did you pass in front of the bus?
         20       A.   What do you mean in front?  How?
         21       Q.   The bus, the bus was at a standstill.  It was
         22  stopped.  You got off the bus.  Did you have to pass in
         23  front of the bus, the driver's side?
         24       A.   Yes, I did.  I passed around the front of the
         25  bus, and we were quickly pushed into the warehouse.

          1       Q.   This part of the warehouse which has these
          2  two supporting pillars, is it partitioned in relation
          3  to the left closed part of the warehouse?
          4       A.   What do you mean left, which side?
          5       Q.   On the left of the photograph.  You see the
          6  part of the warehouse which is closed in.
          7       A.   I can't see it being closed in.  I can only
          8  see the outside wall.
          9       Q.   In relation to the outside wall that you can
         10  see, and in relation to the front part with the two
         11  supporting pillars, is there any partition between
         12  these two premises?
         13       A.   Between the two pillars?  I don't
         14  understand.
         15       Q.   Between the open part of the warehouse and
         16  the part where we can only see the outside wall that is
         17  walled in; is there a partition there?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   And is there a door on that partitioning
         20  partition?
         21       A.   I didn't see it.  There was some kind of a
         22  fence, like a fence that was broken or something, as
         23  far as I could see.
         24       Q.   Did that go the whole length of the
         25  building?  That fence, did it go along the whole

          1  breadth of the building, rather?
          2       A.   I didn't notice that.  I don't know.  I was
          3  unable to register whether it did or not.
          4       Q.   Could you tell us how long, how high that
          5  fence was?
          6       A.   How could I know?  I didn't measure it.
          7       Q.   Did it look like a door?
          8       A.   No, it was a fence, like any fence.  Like
          9  this external fence that is shown on the photograph,
         10  rather like that, something like that.  Now how high it
         11  was, I don't know.
         12       Q.   Were you placed behind that fence to the
         13  left?
         14       A.   What do you mean?
         15       Q.   I mean the part of the building that we only
         16  see the outside wall of?
         17       A.   Yes, to the left.  When we went inside and
         18  sat down, I was looking in front.  To my right was the
         19  entrance where I went through, and in front of me was
         20  the fence and the wall, the partition, some kind of a
         21  partition.
         22       Q.   Perhaps it will be easier if we look at
         23  Exhibit 8/9.
         24            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]  So as not to
         25  waste time, Mr. President, I can give the usher a copy

          1  myself.
          2       Q.   Witness K, in relation to these two windows
          3  through which we can see the panorama behind the
          4  warehouse, were you in this right-hand wing of this
          5  warehouse?
          6       A.   Yes, I'll show it to you [indicates].  In
          7  this area, in this part [indicates].
          8       Q.   Does this include the part where you
          9  encircled two open windows, those that you can see
         10  through?
         11       A.   I don't know that.
         12       Q.   Was your whole group in that part of the
         13  building?
         14       A.   What do you mean the "whole group"?
         15       Q.   All of you who came from Lolici.  And
         16  according to your estimate, there were 1.000 to 1.500.
         17  Were they all accommodated there?
         18       A.   All the people who came in the buses, as far
         19  as I saw, were unloaded and placed in those hangars.
         20  When I entered the warehouse, I didn't see outside
         21  whether others may have, perhaps, been taken to another
         22  warehouse because we were very much afraid.
         23       Q.   You said that there was a fence, Witness K?
         24       A.   Yes.
         25       Q.   Were you all on one side of that fence?

          1       A.   All of us who were there with me, yes, who
          2  were with me.  As far as I was able to see, we were all
          3  there on one side of the fence.
          4       Q.   Let me -- delete that, please.
          5            I know that you were fearful, that you
          6  probably didn't notice many details, but could you
          7  roughly tell us the size of the premise that you were
          8  in?
          9       A.   Roughly, let me try.  It would be, perhaps,
         10  the length of the warehouse where I was, it seemed to
         11  me to be maybe about 30 metres long, 40, maybe less.
         12  That's how it looked to me.  And the width was maybe 15
         13  metres, I don't know, maybe less, maybe more.  That is
         14  very roughly my estimation.  I don't know exactly.
         15       Q.   These two young men who were taken out of the
         16  warehouse allegedly to assist in collecting the
         17  wounded, did they come back to the warehouse?
         18       A.   Yes, they did.
         19       Q.   Did you ask them where they went, in fact?
         20       A.   No, it never occurred to me.
         21       Q.   Not one of those from your group?
         22       A.   No, I didn't hear them.
         23       Q.   Did they, themselves, say anything?
         24       A.   No, we just kept quiet to see what was going
         25  to happen.  We were all in a panic and great fear.

          1       Q.   Were there any injuries on them?
          2       A.   No.
          3       Q.   Witness K, as you said, you were crammed into
          4  that warehouse very close to one another so that, as
          5  you put it, you couldn't move left or right an inch?
          6       A.   Not quite like that.  You misunderstood me,
          7  sir.  It's not true that we really couldn't budge.  But
          8  I said, and I am saying, that we were crammed full so
          9  if you would try to get up and go out, you couldn't
         10  stand on the ground, on the concrete.  You'd have to
         11  lean against someone else for a person to try and
         12  get -- walk out, if somebody wanted to get out.
         13       Q.   It was obviously very crowded there, but when
         14  the Serb soldiers entered and started shooting, you
         15  said that you threw yourself on the ground?
         16       A.   Yes.
         17       Q.   Can you explain to me where did you throw
         18  yourself to in view of the fact that you were so
         19  crowded?
         20       A.   I threw myself on the ground.  The Serb
         21  soldier who opened fire lay on -- I lay on my stomach,
         22  and I remained lying like that on the ground.
         23       Q.   So when the soldier opened fire.  So in view
         24  of the fact that it was so crowded, as you said a
         25  moment ago, now, suddenly, you have enough space to

          1  throw yourself face down on the ground?
          2       A.   Let me explain in greater detail, sir.  I see
          3  that it is not clear to you, so I want to make sure you
          4  understand me properly.
          5            The Serb soldier, when he opened fire, after
          6  that, a couple of others, maybe five or six of them, I
          7  don't know how many, I don't know exactly.  When they
          8  opened fire, there was panic, and people jumped to
          9  their feet, one on top of another.  We saw what was
         10  happening and they were going to kill all of us.
         11            So when the people jumped up off the ground,
         12  in view of the terrible fear that was widespread, I
         13  threw myself on the ground, though there wasn't too
         14  much space, but I sort of stuck to the ground without
         15  getting up.  And after that, people started falling on
         16  top of me; dead, wounded.
         17       Q.   Witness K, before you climbed the container
         18  to get to the window and jump out, did you cross this
         19  fence?
         20       A.   No, I didn't cross the fence.  The container
         21  was below the window to my left or, rather, as we can
         22  see on the photograph.  It was to the left of me.  So I
         23  went diagonally towards the window and towards that
         24  container.  I climbed on the container so that I
         25  stepped on to the window sill and then I jumped out.  I

          1  fell to the ground.
          2       Q.   How long did you remain beneath this window,
          3  below the window?
          4       A.   For the whole night.
          5       Q.   And after that, as you have already
          6  explained, you went to the creek, to the small river,
          7  rivulet.  And there were Serb soldiers everywhere
          8  around you?
          9       A.   What do you mean "everywhere"?
         10       Q.   Well, in the immediate vicinity, in relation
         11  to this small river.
         12       A.   Of course I didn't know that they were
         13  there.  If I had known that they were there, that they
         14  had surrounded the warehouse, I wouldn't have dared
         15  jump out because they would have killed me.  I thought
         16  they weren't there.  I thought that only those outside
         17  the entrance of the hangar were there next to the
         18  road.  When I jumped out and fell to the ground, I
         19  heard a voice from the maize saying, "There's one
         20  jumping out," and then I realised that there were
         21  guards there, Serb army guards.
         22       Q.   The machine that you describe as a dredger or
         23  excavator which was collecting the bodies, you didn't
         24  see it?
         25       A.   No, I didn't.

          1       Q.   And in which part of the warehouse was this
          2  machine?
          3       A.   You mean -- I didn't see it, but I heard the
          4  noise.  This was in the same direction that I jumped.
          5       Q.   In relation to this photograph?
          6       A.   Well, that was my impression.
          7       Q.   Could you show us on this photograph on the
          8  ELMO.
          9       A.   Yes, I can.  You want me to show you where
         10  this excavator was?  Is that what you mean?
         11       Q.   Yes.  Exactly.
         12       A.   Here [indicates].
         13            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] For the
         14  record, the witness is showing the back part of the
         15  warehouse, viewed from the direction of Bratunac,
         16  Kravica.  Yes, Bratunac, Kravica.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         18  Mr. Petrusic, you mean the right part of the
         19  photograph, right-hand side of the photograph?
         20            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Yes.  I was
         21  trying to describe the direction of the road, but I
         22  quite agree with you that it is the right-hand side of
         23  the photograph.
         24       Q.   After that you reached Zepa.
         25       A.   Yes.

          1       Q.   On the 26th of July.
          2       A.   I don't know the exact date when I arrived.
          3       Q.   Immediately after your arrival in Zepa, did
          4  representatives of the International Red Cross give you
          5  an ID card?
          6       A.   No, not straight away.  I was in hospital for
          7  four or five days.
          8       Q.   You were promised evacuation.
          9       A.   Yes, we were promised that by the Bosnian
         10  Serbs, and the Red Cross made this promise.
         11       Q.   And then you went to prison in Rogatica.
         12       A.   No.  Together with 12 wounded and some
         13  elderly men and women and children from Zepa, we headed
         14  towards Kladanj.  We had a rest at Boksanica.  There
         15  was the Ukrainian checkpoint.  Night fell while we were
         16  there.  And I heard there that Ratko Mladic had come,
         17  General of the Bosnian Serb army, with a helicopter.  I
         18  saw the helicopter.  And the commander of Rogatica came
         19  with an escort, asking where we came from, but they
         20  didn't hurt anyone.
         21            After that we continued towards Kladanj.  I
         22  don't know the places but I heard them mention the name
         23  Luka.  We got close to Kladanj and then the army of
         24  Republika Srpska stopped the buses.  Of course, they
         25  had lists from the Red Cross that had registered us,

          1  they had listed all of us and the wounded, and they
          2  read out from the lists and ordered us to get off and
          3  to board other buses.  There were quite a number of old
          4  men too there; they probably needed them for labour, as
          5  this proved to be later.  And then they drove us
          6  towards Rogatica, the camp there.  That's where we
          7  ended up.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          9  Mr. Petrusic, excuse me for interrupting you, but I
         10  would like to know whether you intend to finish today
         11  or whether we should leave the cross-examination for
         12  tomorrow.  Let's try and finish with the witness so as
         13  not to make him come tomorrow.  But I would like to
         14  know whether you need a lot more time or not.
         15            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] I will bear in
         16  mind your suggestion, Mr. President.  I'm almost done.
         17  A couple of minutes more.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
         19  case, Mr. Petrusic, would you make your questions
         20  precise and concrete?  Then the witness will answer in
         21  a similar fashion.  Thank you.
         22            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         23       Q.   Witness K, in your statement given to an
         24  investigator of this Tribunal, on the 26th of November,
         25  1998, you stated that you had been taken off the bus

          1  because you had a pair of military trousers on.
          2       A.   That I was taken off the bus?
          3       Q.   "I assume that I had been taken off the bus
          4  and that I was not evacuated because I was wearing
          5  military trousers."
          6       A.   Which location do you have in mind?  Where?
          7       Q.   I'm reading from your statement, the
          8  statement that you gave on the 26th of November, 1998.
          9       A.   Sir, I asked you about the location where I
         10  was taken off, where I was separated, whether it was in
         11  Zepa or at Luka.
         12       Q.   If we disregard the exact location, because
         13  you're not referring to it in your statement, I should
         14  like to know whether this is, indeed, what you stated.
         15       A.   While I was in hospital in Zepa, while I was
         16  wounded, I found a pair of multicoloured trousers of
         17  Russian make, and that was the only clothing that I
         18  could get hold of.  It was the bottom part of the
         19  clothing.  I couldn't walk around naked.  I also had a
         20  pair of cowboy boots on.  This is what I had found
         21  somewhere in the forest after I had fled the execution
         22  site in Kravica.  Because I was barefoot, I had to
         23  throw away my shoes at one point, and then in one
         24  discarded backpack, I found a pair of cowboy boots, and
         25  this is how I reached Zepa, wearing those boots.
          1            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
          2  I have no further questions.
          3            Witness K, thank you very much.
          4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you too.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          6  Mr. Petrusic.
          7            Do you have any further questions,
          8  Mr. Cayley?  No.  Thank you.
          9            Judge Wald.
         10                 Questioned by the Court:
         11            JUDGE WALD:  Just a very few questions,
         12  Witness K.
         13            You say you were a member of the Bosnian army
         14  at the time that you joined the column moving towards
         15  Tuzla.  Were all the men in that column members of the
         16  Bosnian army, and if not, what proportion would you say
         17  were not?
         18       A.   I couldn't give you the exact number.  Of
         19  course, I was a member of the army.
         20            JUDGE WALD:  Would you say the majority of
         21  people in the column were members of the Bosnian army
         22  or the majority were not and were just civilians?
         23       A.   The majority were civilians.
         24            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  My second question is:
         25  Why did you surrender?  I mean, what were the

          1  circumstances when you had started on the march that
          2  made you and your fellow marchers surrender?
          3       A.   Bosnian Serbs had encircled us from all
          4  sides.  I had already spent one night there, and when
          5  it dawned, we reached a meadow just above Konjevic
          6  Polje -- I don't know the name of the place but it was
          7  near the wood -- and I continued like that for about
          8  100 metres, in the direction of the asphalt road, and
          9  this is where I found a large group of people who were
         10  unarmed, had no weapons.  They were simply standing
         11  there.  They were confused; they didn't know where to
         12  go, what to do, whether to surrender or not.  And the
         13  Bosnian Serb army had completely surrounded us, we had
         14  no where to go, and this is how we decided to
         15  surrender.
         16            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  At the point that you
         17  escaped from the Kravica warehouse by jumping out of
         18  the window, you told us that you didn't know that there
         19  were soldiers on the outside or you might not have
         20  jumped.  But were there soldiers guarding the prisoners
         21  on the inside of the warehouse, and if so, roughly how
         22  many?
         23       A.   Yes, occasionally they would enter the
         24  warehouse.  Five or six of them would always be
         25  inside.  Sometimes only three would remain; sometimes

          1  there would be five of them.  They would watch us, walk
          2  around, and then leave.
          3            JUDGE WALD:  How, then, do you think you were
          4  able to get over to the container, get on top of the
          5  container and jump out without one of them seeing you?
          6       A.   Well, they were inside before they opened
          7  fire on us.  This was before.  But after that, when
          8  everything became quiet and the smoke dispersed, then
          9  one by one they would enter and throw in hand grenades,
         10  or they would finish off those who had remained alive,
         11  wounded.  So when they thought that everybody had been
         12  killed, there was a longer lull in shooting, and at
         13  that point I decided to jump through the window to save
         14  myself.
         15            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  My last question is:
         16  When you were in Zepa, you mentioned that they were
         17  beginning to evacuate, or they were evacuating not only
         18  the wounded but some women and children and others.
         19  Were you in a position to see some of that evacuation
         20  taking place?  I mean, were you in a position so that
         21  you saw some of the civilians in Zepa being evacuated?
         22       A.   Yes, of course, I was there.
         23            JUDGE WALD:  So if that's right, are you able
         24  to tell us whether or not, in that evacuation, the men
         25  were separated from the women and children, and the

          1  women and children were put on vehicles and evacuated
          2  but the men were not?
          3       A.   I didn't see men being separated.  The
          4  able-bodied men had gone to the mountain, those who had
          5  weapons, and only civilians remained together with us,
          6  the wounded.  The wounded were separated and taken to
          7  the Ukrainian Battalion compound.  But I could observe
          8  the evacuation of people from Zepa, and they included
          9  women, children, and the elderly.
         10            JUDGE WALD:  But there was no formal process
         11  that you observed of separating the men out from the
         12  women and children for evacuation, of those that were
         13  there?
         14       A.   No, I didn't observe that.
         15            JUDGE WALD:  And the Red Cross was observing
         16  the evacuation; right?
         17       A.   Yes.
         18            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you, Witness K.
         19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your
         20  Honour.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Cayley
         22  and Mr. Petrusic, what is the status of our exhibits?
         23  I can see that there are several of them.
         24            MR. CAYLEY:  Yes, Mr. President.  If I could
         25  apply for admission into evidence of the following:

          1            The first exhibit is Prosecutor's Exhibit
          2  8A/2, which is a map which the witness used to
          3  demonstrate to the Judges the route that he took.
          4            Exhibit 118, which is the witness'
          5  registration by the Red Cross.  That certificate should
          6  remain under seal because it has the witness' name and
          7  date of birth upon it.
          8            The next exhibit is Exhibit 119, which is a
          9  sketch which the witness produced when he was
         10  originally interviewed by the OTP.  That document
         11  should remain under seal because it has upon it the
         12  signature of the witness and his name.  There's also
         13  119 bis, which is a public document, which is the
         14  redacted version.  It has the signature and name of the
         15  witness removed.
         16            Exhibit 117, which are the medical records of
         17  the witness concerning the injuries he suffered at
         18  Kravica, that document should remain under seal because
         19  it has identifying features.
         20            And then the last exhibit is Exhibit 116,
         21  which is the still taken from a video, showing letters
         22  in a perpendicular fashion on one of the factory
         23  buildings.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.
         25            Mr. Petrusic, any objections as regards the

          1  exhibits tendered under seal?
          2            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] No, we do not
          3  object to the exhibits tendered by the Prosecutor.  We
          4  would also like to tender D14 into evidence.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Cayley,
          6  any objection to this one, D14?  No.  Thank you very
          7  much.
          8            Therefore, Exhibit D14, Prosecutor's 8A/2,
          9  118, 119, and 117 will be admitted into evidence,
         10  including two exhibits admitted under seal.
         11            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes,
         12  Mr. President.  These exhibits have been admitted.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  Thank
         14  you, Mr. Dubuisson.
         15            Mr. Cayley, any remarks?
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  It's my fault, actually,
         17  Mr. President, because I gave you the exhibits out of
         18  order.  There's also Exhibit 116, which I actually
         19  mentioned last on the list but which you didn't mention
         20  when you were admitting these exhibits into evidence.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  Maybe
         22  you didn't get the interpretation, but I remember
         23  mentioning it.  Exhibit 116, is that the one?  Yes.
         24  Very well, then.  Thank you very much, Mr. Cayley.
         25            Before we adjourn for the day, I should like
          1  to tell the parties that we would like to have a short
          2  Status Conference on the 13th of this month, this week
          3  therefore.  We will have to finish the session at ten
          4  minutes past two and we will try to have a
          5  20-minute-long Status Conference.
          6            The reason for this Status Conference is that
          7  I should like to see where we are in relation to the
          8  plan that was established at the beginning, that is,
          9  how can we save even more time and speed up things a
         10  little bit.  So I should like to hear the Prosecutor as
         11  regards the possibility of finishing his case, the
         12  Prosecution case, before the summer recess, and also I
         13  should like to hear the Defence and the plans as
         14  regarding their case, because we have to bear in mind
         15  the schedule.
         16            We will after that try to set up a calendar,
         17  after this Status Conference, taking into account all
         18  the possibilities that remain open.  So this was all
         19  that I wanted to tell you for the time being.
         20            I should also like to address the witness
         21  before he leaves.  Witness K, you have finished your
         22  testimony before the International Criminal Tribunal.
         23  Thank you very much for coming to testify here.  We do
         24  hope that you will have a long life and that you will
         25  be able to change your opinion, what you mentioned

          1  here.  You said that you had seen a number of horror
          2  films and that which you experienced was much worse.
          3  We do agree with you, but we also hope that you will be
          4  able to find courage to change that perspective in
          5  life.  Thank you.
          6            So tomorrow at 9.30 we will gather here
          7  again.  Thank you very much.
          8                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned at
          9                 2.53 p.m., to be reconvened on Tuesday,
         10                 the 11th day of April, 2000, at
