          6  very much, Mr. Harmon.  Could I have the appearances

         11            My name is Nenad Petrusic, I am representing
         12  General Radislav Krstic, together with my colleague, my
         13  co-counsel Mr. Tomislav Visnjic.  Thank you very much.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         15  Mr. Petrusic.  We're now going to open the present
         16  case, and as I have already stated, I will give the
         17  floor to Mr. Harmon for the opening statement.
         18            Mr. Harmon, you have the floor.
         19            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         20  Again, good morning, Your Honours.
         21            Following the conquest of the UN safe area of
         22  Srebrenica by the Bosnian Serb army in July of 1995,
         23  the victors abandoned all semblance of humanity and
         24  committed atrocities of a type and on a scale not seen
         25  since the Second World War.

          1            Over a period of about five days, thousands
          2  of Bosnian Muslim civilians and Bosnian Muslim
          3  soldiers, who had laid down their arms, were
          4  systematically murdered by members of the Bosnian Serb
          5  army.
          6            This is a case about the triumph of evil, a
          7  story about how officers and soldiers of the Bosnian
          8  Serb army, men who professed to be professional
          9  soldiers, men who professed to represent the ideals of
         10  a distinguished and Serbian past organised, planned,
         11  and willingly participated in genocide or stood silent
         12  in the face of it.  The authors of these foul deeds
         13  have left a legacy that has stained the reputation of
         14  the Serbian people and has disgraced ...
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me,
         16  Mr. Harmon, for this interruption, but I think that
         17  General Krstic cannot follow us.
         18            General Krstic, can you hear me now?
         19            THE ACCUSED:  Yes.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Okay.
         21  Thank you very much.
         22            I'm sorry, Mr. Harmon, for this
         23  interruption.  Please continue.
         24            MR. HARMON:  I was saying these particular
         25  deeds have disgraced honourable profession of arms.

          1            In their wake, they murdered thousands of
          2  defenceless men and boys and shattered the lives of
          3  generations of Bosnians.
          4            The only way to attempt to eradicate this
          5  stain and to deliver justice to the victims of this
          6  tragedy is to expose the individual criminal
          7  responsibility of those persons who perpetrated and
          8  assisted in the commission of these heinous crimes.
          9            The Prosecutor in this trial will prove the
         10  criminal responsibility of one of those individuals,
         11  General Radislav Krstic.
         12            Now, let me put the events described in the
         13  indictment in the proper historical context of the war
         14  in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I'm going to do so in a
         15  cursory fashion, because I intend to introduce into
         16  evidence the report of the Secretary-General on
         17  Srebrenica and copies of all the relevant resolutions
         18  relating to the conflict.
         19            The Secretary-General's report sets forth in
         20  great detail a description of the events and the UN
         21  responses to them.
         22            The former Yugoslavia was a federal state.
         23  It was comprised of six republics and two autonomous
         24  provinces.  In late June of 1991, Yugoslavia began to
         25  disintegrate and a succession of wars was fought first

          1  in the Republic of Slovenia and then in the Republic of
          2  Croatia as the governments of those republics declared
          3  their independence.  On the 6th of March, 1992, the
          4  government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
          5  declared its independence and a wide-scale war ensued.
          6            As in Croatia, the federal army of
          7  Yugoslavia, the JNA, fought alongside rebel Serb forces
          8  in order to secure territories declared to be part of
          9  newly emerging self-proclaimed Serbian entities.
         10            The Bosnian Serbs led by Dr. Radovan Karadzic
         11  were supported politically and militarily by rump
         12  Yugoslavia's government, which was in the hands of
         13  Slobodan Milosevic.
         14            Because of the combined military superiority
         15  of the JNA, paramilitary and police forces from Serbia
         16  proper, and Bosnian Serb forces, large areas within
         17  Bosnia and Herzegovina, the newly sovereign state,
         18  quickly seized and fell under the control of the Serb
         19  authorities.
         20            The military operations of the entities
         21  involved were coordinated and systematic, and by the
         22  end of 1992, this campaign resulted in the deaths or
         23  forced displacement of approximately two million
         24  non-Serbs who had been perceived to be a threat to the
         25  creation of an ethnically homogenous Serb-dominated

          1  entity.
          2            The Security Council of the United Nations
          3  adopted a series of resolutions for the purposes of
          4  establishing peace commencing with Resolution 713,
          5  which implemented an arms embargo on the delivery of
          6  weapons and military equipment to Yugoslavia.  This
          7  resolution, however, had negative ramifications and
          8  simply cemented the military imbalance between a
          9  well-armed JNA and rebel forces on one side and the
         10  poorly-armed forces opposing them.
         11            However, as a result of international
         12  pressure, the JNA was required to withdraw from Bosnia
         13  by the 19th of May, 1992.  The actual withdrawal was
         14  deceptive as, in reality, substantial numbers of JNA
         15  personnel and significant amounts of war materiel were
         16  left behind in Bosnian Serb hands.  The resulting
         17  vacuum was seamlessly filled by the nascent Bosnian
         18  Serb army known as the army of Republika Srpska.  Its
         19  commander, a JNA serving officer by the name of Ratko
         20  Mladic, who in 1991 had commanded the JNA units
         21  actively supporting Serbian territorial claims in
         22  Croatia, took over command of this entity.  Many other
         23  officers of the JNA, including the accused, Radislav
         24  Krstic, became members of the VRS, and I'll be
         25  referring to the army of Republika Srpska as "VRS"

          1  throughout my remarks.
          2            The VRS was the blunt instrument of a
          3  political agenda that had as its goal the creation of
          4  an ethnically-pure independent Bosnian Serb entity
          5  within Bosnia and Herzegovina that would eventually
          6  unite with Serbia, Montenegro, and the breakaway
          7  republic of Serbian Krajina in Croatia to form a
          8  Greater Serbia.  Non-Serbs were ethnically cleansed
          9  from the territories occupied by the VRS in a
         10  systematic and well-organised fashion.
         11            Now, let me turn my attention to the events
         12  in the Srebrenica area from the outset of the war, and
         13  let me first begin by locating for you where the
         14  municipality of Srebrenica is in Bosnia and
         15  Herzegovina.  My assistant has placed on the ELMO for
         16  your viewing a map of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and on
         17  the right-hand side, you can see, marked in yellow, the
         18  municipality of Srebrenica.  I see Mr. Dubuisson is
         19  handing to you as well hard copies of the items that
         20  I'm going to be referring to throughout my opening
         21  remarks.
         22            Srebrenica, according to the 1991 census, was
         23  a predominantly Muslim municipality, with 75 per cent
         24  of the population being Bosnian Muslims and 25 per cent
         25  being Serbs.  Despite their numerical superiority at

          1  the beginning of the war, the Muslims in the Srebrenica
          2  municipality were expelled from their homes and
          3  subjected to inhumane treatment by members of Bosnian
          4  Serb armed formations.  Muslims were driven from their
          5  homes, many Bosniaks were murdered, and many other
          6  homes burned to the ground.
          7            However, the Bosnian Muslims reorganised
          8  themselves and took initiatives to reclaim the town of
          9  Srebrenica.  In May 1992, they succeeded in this
         10  endeavour and continued to attempt to expand control of
         11  the territory around Srebrenica and were eventually
         12  able to link up with Zepa, a town to the south of
         13  Srebrenica.  During this period of the conflict,
         14  Bosnian Serb civilians suffered.  Many were killed,
         15  many were driven from their homes, and Bosnian Serb
         16  homes were destroyed.  On the 7th of January, 1993,
         17  Serbian Orthodox Christmas, the village of Kravica was
         18  attacked by elements from Srebrenica, and according to
         19  Serb sources, many civilians were killed.
         20            The events at Kravica galvanised the Bosnian
         21  Serb military resolve to extinguish the military threat
         22  that was in the enclave, and a Bosnian Serb
         23  counter-offensive ensued.  The counter-offensive was
         24  swift, effective, and brutal.  As a result, Bosnian
         25  Muslim villages were overrun and tens of thousands of

          1  Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in and around the
          2  besieged town of Srebrenica.  The plight of these
          3  refugees became desperate as there was inadequate
          4  shelter and food for them.
          5            With the attention of the world focused on
          6  the plight of these refugees and the siege of
          7  Srebrenica, General Morillon, the French UNPROFOR
          8  commander in Bosnia, arrived to the besieged town on
          9  the 11th of March, 1993, and he told the people of
         10  Srebrenica that he would not abandon them.  Now, this
         11  dramatic promise was captured on film and was aired
         12  throughout the world.
         13            About a month later, Bosnian Serb commanders
         14  threatened to enter Srebrenica, and three days later,
         15  on the 16th of April, 1993, the Security Council,
         16  acting pursuant to Chapter VII of its Charter, adopted
         17  Resolution 819.  This resolution demanded that the
         18  parties treat Srebrenica as a safe area which should be
         19  free from any armed attack, and demanded the immediate
         20  withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces from the area around
         21  Srebrenica.
         22            Two days later, the 18th of April, 1993, an
         23  agreement was signed between the commander of the
         24  Bosnian Serb forces, General Ratko Mladic, and the
         25  commander of the Bosnia government forces, General

          1  Halilovic.  Under the terms of this agreement,
          2  Srebrenica was to be demilitarised and UNPROFOR troops
          3  were permitted to be deployed into the area.  On the
          4  8th of May, a more comprehensive agreement was signed
          5  by these two Generals covering both the Srebrenica
          6  enclave and the Zepa enclave.
          7            Now, as a result of these agreements,
          8  enclaves were created, and if I could have my assistant
          9  place on the ELMO a map, I will show Your Honours where
         10  those enclaves were in Bosnia.  You'll see from this
         11  exhibit, there are three enclaves; the Srebrenica
         12  enclave, the Zepa enclave, and the Gorazde enclave, all
         13  located in the eastern part of Bosnia and all located
         14  within territory controlled by the Republika Srpska.
         15            Now, as a result of these events that I have
         16  described, Mr. President and Your Honours, the
         17  situation in Srebrenica stabilised.
         18            On the 18th of April, a small contingent of
         19  UNPROFOR soldiers from Canada entered Srebrenica, and
         20  their task initially was to oversee the
         21  demilitarisation of the town of Srebrenica.  They
         22  remained deployed in Srebrenica until January of 1994
         23  when they were replaced by elements of the Dutch
         24  Battalion.
         25            Following these resolutions and agreements,

          1  an uneasy calm came over the Srebrenica enclave.
          2  However, the enclave itself was never fully
          3  demilitarised, and an armed unit of the army of
          4  Bosnia-Herzegovina remained in it, making forays out of
          5  the enclave and attacking Serb targets in order to
          6  acquire food and ammunition.  Because of the military
          7  threat that was posed by the presence of an armed unit
          8  within the heart of the Republika Srpska, valuable
          9  military assets of the VRS that were needed elsewhere
         10  in the war were frozen around the enclave in order to
         11  contain the perceived threat that was within the
         12  enclave.
         13            By 1995, the tide of war had changed, it had
         14  shifted against the VRS, and the valuable military
         15  assets that were frozen around this enclave were needed
         16  elsewhere.  Therefore, a decision was taken at the
         17  highest political and military levels within the
         18  Republika Srpska to attack the safe areas.  Thereafter,
         19  a military plan to attack Srebrenica, code named
         20  "Operation Krivaja 95" was prepared by General Krstic
         21  and others.  It envisioned attacking the enclave
         22  through the south.
         23            On the 6th of July, 1995, Operation
         24  Krivaja 95 commenced and five days later the town of
         25  Srebrenica was captured.  I'm going to go into greater

          1  detail about that attack later, but I want to turn my
          2  attention now to the accused and tell you about him.
          3            General Krstic is a career soldier who at the
          4  time of the crimes described in the indictment was a
          5  capable and experienced senior officer who was trained
          6  in and familiar with his responsibilities and
          7  obligations under international law during the time of
          8  war.
          9            General Krstic was born on 15th February,
         10  1948 in the municipality of Vlasenica.  He was educated
         11  in military academies in Sarajevo and in Belgrade, and
         12  after he graduated he was commissioned an officer and
         13  held a series of positions in the JNA.
         14            His first assignment was to the Centre of
         15  Military Schools in Sarajevo, where he served from 1972
         16  until 1981.  Thereafter, he was sent to the General
         17  Staff Academy in Belgrade and from there he was
         18  transferred to Kosovo where he held a number of command
         19  and staff positions.  At the time he left the JNA, he
         20  held the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.
         21            Now, after the war started in Bosnia, the
         22  accused, like many other officers of the JNA, joined
         23  the VRS.  The accused became a brigade commander of
         24  the 2nd Romanija Motorised Brigade which was part of
         25  the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps.  In November of 1992, this

          1  unit became part of the Drina Corps, and the accused
          2  remained its commander until September of 1994, when he
          3  assume the concurrent post of Chief of Staff and Deputy
          4  Commander of the Drina Corps.
          5            On the 29th of December, 1994, the accused
          6  stepped on an anti-personnel mine which resulted in a
          7  serious injury to his leg, part of which was
          8  amputated.  Following his recovery and his
          9  rehabilitation, he returned and re-assumed his post as
         10  Chief of Staff/Deputy Commander of the Drina Corps.  In
         11  May of 1995, he was promoted to the rank of
         12  General-Major in the VRS.
         13            Now, our evidence in this case will show that
         14  on the 13th of July, 1995, General Krstic issued orders
         15  under the title of Commander of the Drina Corps, and
         16  his subordinate units accepted and implemented those
         17  orders.  Moreover, on the 14th of July, 1995, General
         18  Krstic's appointment as commander of the Drina Corps
         19  was formalised by the Supreme Commander of the VRS,
         20  Dr. Radovan Karadzic.  This formal appointment became
         21  effective the day after it was issued.
         22            General Krstic remained the commander of the
         23  Drina Corps until the 21st of November, 1995, when he
         24  was then sent to the School of National Defence in
         25  Belgrade where he remained until September of 1996.  In

          1  that same month, he became the Chief Inspector of the
          2  VRS.
          3            In 1998, General Krstic was appointed to the
          4  rank of Lieutenant Colonel-General, which is the
          5  equivalent rank of a two-star General in the United
          6  States army or the British army.  At the time of his
          7  arrest by SFOR forces, General Krstic was the commander
          8  of the VRS 5th Corps.
          9            Now, Your Honours, I'd like to turn briefly
         10  to describe for you the structure of the VRS and
         11  identify some of the personalities about whom you'll be
         12  hearing about during the course of this trial.
         13            The JNA had been one of the most professional
         14  armies in Eastern Europe, and after its departure, the
         15  VRS retained its basic structures.
         16            So if I could have my assistant put on the
         17  board the first exhibit I'd like to show you.  Your
         18  Honours should have a small copy of this in front of
         19  you.
         20            This, as you can see --
         21            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone for the counsel,
         22  please.
         23            MR. HARMON:  This, as you can see, is the VRS
         24  Main Staff structure.  The Commander-in-Chief, the
         25  Supreme Commander, was Dr. Radovan Karadzic.  He's not

          1  shown on this.  But directly subordinate to him was
          2  General Ratko Mladic, who was the Commander of the Main
          3  Staff.  And the command from the Main Staff went
          4  directly to subordinate corps which are identified at
          5  the bottom, and you will see in the middle the Drina
          6  Corps with the commander being General Krstic.  And
          7  you'll see this chart has been populated by individuals
          8  who have been identified in other responsible positions
          9  of command.  Now, this chart reflects the structure at
         10  or about the 13th of July, 1993.
         11            Now, in addition to the direct chain of
         12  command flowing from General Mladic to the corps,
         13  General Mladic also had a staff at the Main Staff over
         14  which he had command.  I'd like to identify for you
         15  some of the individuals who you'll be hearing about
         16  throughout the course of this trial.
         17            You will notice in the middle under "Staff
         18  Branches," where I am pointing, the name Lieutenant
         19  Colonel Ljubisa Beara.  Colonel Beara was the Chief of
         20  Security for the Security Administration of the Main
         21  Staff.  You'll be hearing a lot about this man
         22  throughout this trial.  Another individual about whom
         23  you will be hearing is
         24  Colonel Jankovic, who was the Assistant Chief of
         25  Intelligence Operations for the Intelligence

          1  Administration of the Main Staff, and you'll be seeing
          2  film footage with Colonel Jankovic during the course of
          3  this trial.
          4            Now I'm going to show Your Honours another
          5  chart, and it will reflect the structure and
          6  personalities of the Drina Corps at or about the time
          7  of the 13th of July, 1993.
          8            Now, Your Honours, coming down from the Main
          9  Staff command, from General Mladic, was the Drina
         10  Corps, and the commander of the Drina Corps, on or
         11  about the 13th of July was General Krstic.  He had
         12  direct command over his subordinate units which are
         13  found at the bottom of this chart, and you will see
         14  these are various brigades, the Zvornik Brigade, the
         15  Bratunac Brigade, and the like.  You will be hearing
         16  the names of some of the people who populate this
         17  particular exhibit.  For example, you will be hearing
         18  the name Colonel Vinko Pandurovic.  Colonel Pandurovic
         19  was the commander of the Zvornik Brigade.  And you will
         20  be hearing about his assistant Major Dragan Obrenvic,
         21  who was his Chief of Staff.  You will be hearing some
         22  of these other names who were the brigade commanders
         23  throughout this trial as well.
         24            Your Honours, like the Main Staff, the corps
         25  had a staff of its own, and General Krstic had command

          1  over the people within his staff.  You're going to be
          2  hearing a number of these names as well throughout the
          3  trial.
          4            Let me start with Lieutenant-Colonel Popovic,
          5  who was the Assistant Commander for Security.  Let me
          6  continue with the name Lieutenant-Colonel Kosoric who
          7  was the Chief of Intelligence.  His assistant, Major
          8  Pavle Golic.  You will be hearing about Lazar Acimovic,
          9  who was the assistant for rear services.  You will be
         10  hearing the names of, as well, other people who are
         11  identified throughout this particular chart.
         12            Now, Mr. President and Your Honours, in
         13  addition to the structure, the military rules and
         14  regulations and doctrines of the JNA were also adopted
         15  by the VRS.  There was neither the time nor the
         16  inclination to reinvent the wheel, if you will.
         17            The central tenent of the VRS and the JNA was
         18  the concept of senior and superior command, which meant
         19  that members of the army were obliged to execute orders
         20  of a superior officer, unquestionably, completely, and
         21  on time.  The only exception to this principle was
         22  found in the Laws Governing the Conduct of War, which
         23  both the former Yugoslavia and the Republika Srpska had
         24  adopted.
         25            On the 13th of May, 1992, General Radovan

          1  Karadzic signed an order obligating the VRS to apply
          2  and to respect the international laws of war including
          3  treaties signed and ratified by the Socialist Federal
          4  Republic of Yugoslavia, Customary International Laws of
          5  War, and the General Accepted Principles of
          6  International Laws of War.  Under the terms of this
          7  decree, commanders of all units and members of the VRS
          8  were required to abide by these rules and every
          9  superior officer was duty-bound to initiate legal
         10  proceedings against individuals who violated these
         11  rules.
         12            Let me give you an example of one such
         13  regulation.  I'm referring to paragraph 21 of the
         14  Instructions on the Application of the International
         15  Laws of War on the Armed Forces.  This rule states and
         16  I will quote:
         17            "An officer shall be personally liable for
         18  breaches of the Rules of the Laws of War if he knew or
         19  should have known that units subordinate to him or
         20  other units or individuals were planning the commission
         21  of such breaches and at the time, when it had been
         22  still possible to prevent their commission, failed to
         23  take the measures to prevent such breaches.
         24            "The officer will also be held personally
         25  liable who, aware that breaches of the rules of law had

          1  been committed, fails to institute disciplinary or
          2  criminal proceedings against the offender or if
          3  instituting the proceedings does not fall into his
          4  purview, fails to report the breach to the superior
          5  officer in charge."
          6            The similarities of this rule to our Statute
          7  are quite obvious.
          8            Interestingly, paragraph 20 of this same
          9  document states, and I quote:
         10            "Perpetrators of such criminal acts may also
         11  answer before an international court if such a court
         12  has been established."
         13            From his military education and from the
         14  rules and regulations of both the JNA and VRS, there is
         15  no doubt that General Krstic was fully aware of his
         16  obligations under international law.  He chose instead
         17  to violate, with impunity, every fundamental duty
         18  imposed upon him as an officer and as a commander, and
         19  that is the reason he sits before you today in
         20  judgement.
         21            Turning now to the indictment that Your
         22  Honours have before you.  We have charged General
         23  Krstic with eight counts.  One count of genocide, one
         24  count of the complicity to commit genocide, five counts
         25  of crimes against humanity, and one count of a

          1  violation of the laws and customs of war.
          2            All of the acts described in the indictment
          3  occurred within the Drina Corps area of responsibility,
          4  the area that was under the command of General Krstic,
          5  and all of these acts relate to the events that
          6  occurred during and after the fall of the UN safe area
          7  of Srebrenica, acts which resulted in the ethnic
          8  cleansing of the Bosnian Muslims from the Srebrenica
          9  enclave.
         10            The counts of the indictment can be divided
         11  into two broad categories.  The first category is the
         12  deportation and forcible transfer of an estimated
         13  20.000 to 30.000 Muslims from the Srebrenica enclave by
         14  members of the VRS on the 12th and 13th of July 1995.
         15  The second broad category is the systematic, organised
         16  mass murder of thousands of Muslim civilians and
         17  soldiers who had laid down their arms by members of the
         18  VRS.  Most but not all of these executions occurred
         19  between the 11th and the 17th of July, 1995.
         20            Under Article 7(1) of our Statute, we have
         21  charged General Krstic with committing, planning,
         22  instigating, ordering or otherwise aiding and abetting
         23  and the planning, preparation, or execution of these
         24  charges.
         25            We've also charged General Krstic, under

          1  Article 7(3) of our Statute for failing to prevent his
          2  subordinates from committing the crimes identified in
          3  the indictment and for failing to punish them for
          4  having done so.
          5            The direct and circumstantial evidence that
          6  we will present to Your Honours will prove beyond a
          7  reasonable doubt both forms of this criminal
          8  liability.
          9            Now, during the course of this trial, you're
         10  going to be confronted with a number of issues.  The
         11  first issue you're going to confront is when did
         12  General Krstic become the commander of the Drina
         13  Corps.  Now, I've mentioned previously in my remarks
         14  evidence that we will present that will demonstrate
         15  that General Krstic was the commander of the Drina
         16  Corps and exercised his authority as commander during
         17  the relevant times of this indictment.
         18            Another issue, Your Honours, that you're
         19  going to confront is did the Bosnian Muslims leave the
         20  Srebrenica enclave on the 12th and 13th of July
         21  voluntarily or were they forcibly expelled and
         22  deported.  Our evidence, which I'm going to address
         23  shortly, will describe how they were forcibly deported
         24  and expelled from the enclave.
         25            Another issue that you will face in this

          1  trial and must decide is whether thousands of Bosnian
          2  Muslim civilians were summarily executed by the VRS as
          3  described in paragraph 24 of the indictment and whether
          4  those acts constituted genocide.  The evidence that
          5  these large-scale murders occurred, as described in the
          6  indictment, is overwhelming, and we assert that they
          7  constituted genocide.
          8            Another issue that you will decide in this
          9  case is this:  Did General Mladic take over exclusive
         10  command of the Drina Corps and create a separate chain
         11  of command that went around General Krstic for purposes
         12  of committing genocide?
         13            Now, in this regard, Your Honours, the High
         14  Command case from the Nuremberg jurisprudence addressed
         15  the question of whether or not a commander becomes
         16  responsible for actions committed within his command,
         17  pursuant to orders passed down independent of him.  The
         18  tribunal stated that under such conditions, the
         19  commander had four choices:  (1) he could issue an
         20  order countermanding the order; (2) he could resign;
         21  (3) he could sabotage the enforcement of the order
         22  within a somewhat limited sphere; and (4) he could do
         23  nothing.
         24            The tribunal went on to say, and I
         25  quote:  "Under basic principles of command authority

          1  and responsibility, an officer who merely stands by
          2  while his subordinates execute a criminal order of his
          3  superiors which he knows is criminal violates a moral
          4  obligation under international law.  By doing nothing,
          5  he cannot wash his hands of international
          6  responsibility."
          7            Our evidence will show that the crimes that
          8  were committed by members in units of the VRS Main
          9  Staff and the Drina Corps were crimes that were
         10  committed jointly.  These units were working together,
         11  and General Krstic participated in and was fully aware
         12  of these crimes when they were being committed and he
         13  actively supported their commission.
         14            Another issue that Your Honours will face in
         15  this case is whether General Krstic was even aware of
         16  these killings that are described in the indictment
         17  during and after their commission.  Our evidence is
         18  going to show, Your Honours, that General Krstic was
         19  fully aware of these killings while they were being
         20  committed.
         21            Those are some of the principal issues that
         22  you'll face in this case and we'll be addressing
         23  throughout this trial.
         24            I would now like to return to the invasion of
         25  the Srebrenica enclave by the VRS.  As I mentioned to

          1  you earlier, the invasion started on the 6th of July,
          2  1995, and it included attacks on Dutch observation
          3  posts that ringed the enclave.  As a result of the VRS
          4  attacks on these observation posts, Dutch soldiers
          5  yielded their positions to the advancing VRS, and many
          6  of them were taken hostage by the VRS and later
          7  threatened with death if the airstrikes being conducted
          8  by NATO continued.
          9            Between the 6th of July and the 11th of July,
         10  the invasion into the enclave proceeded in fits and
         11  starts.  The VRS advance met little or no resistance
         12  from armed Bosnian elements from within the enclave, or
         13  from UNPROFOR soldiers.  During the advance into the
         14  enclave, soldiers of the VRS systematically burned
         15  Muslim homes.
         16            Now, as the VRS soldiers advanced into the
         17  enclave, the Muslim inhabitants panicked, they were
         18  terror-stricken, and they fled to the town of
         19  Srebrenica and gathered around the UN compound in
         20  Srebrenica.  On the 11th of July, the VRS shelled the
         21  UN compound.  They killed a number of Muslim refugees
         22  within the compound and injured a number of them, and
         23  this created absolute panic and terror among the
         24  thousands of refugees who had gathered in and around
         25  the town of Srebrenica.  They were terrified, and as a

          1  result they fled from the UN enclave in Srebrenica to
          2  the UN base in Potocari, a distance of about three or
          3  four kilometres.
          4            During the course of this trial, we are going
          5  to present to Your Honours video footage of these
          6  events, and you'll see for yourselves the absolute
          7  panic and despair of these people as they fled from
          8  Srebrenica to Potocari.  It was sheer pandemonium and
          9  chaos.  But by the morning of the 12th of July, 1995,
         10  an estimated 20.000 to 30.000 refugees had arrived
         11  around the enclave -- I'm sorry, around the UN compound
         12  at Potocari.
         13            We are also going to present video footage
         14  for Your Honours that was taken on the 11th of July,
         15  showing General Mladic, General Zivanovic, General
         16  Krstic, and other high-ranking members of the VRS
         17  triumphantly entering the deserted town of Srebrenica.
         18  During their victory march, a Serb war correspondent
         19  interviewed General Mladic, and in that interview,
         20  General Mladic said, and I quote only a part of his
         21  interview, "that the moment had finally come to take
         22  revenge on the Turks here."  By "Turks," he meant the
         23  Muslims of Srebrenica.  General Krstic was present in
         24  Srebrenica with General Mladic when he made these
         25  remarks.

          1            We will also present the testimony of
          2  Mr. Drazen Erdemovic, who was a member of the 10th
          3  Sabotage Detachment, an elite military unit that was a
          4  part of the Main Staff.  Mr. Erdemovic participated in
          5  the invasion of the enclave and entered into the town
          6  of Srebrenica itself on the 11th of July, 1995.
          7  Mr. Erdemovic will describe to Your Honours the
          8  cold-blooded execution of a military-aged, unarmed
          9  Muslim who had been captured by his unit, and at the
         10  order of his commanding officer, a member of the 10th
         11  Sabotage Brigade killed the Muslim.  This
         12  killing portended the tragedy of things that were to
         13  come.
         14            Mr. President and Your Honours, not all of
         15  the Muslims who had fled, fled in the direction of
         16  Potocari.  Another group of approximately 15.000
         17  Muslims fled in the direction of Jaglici and
         18  Suesnjari.  This group of people included members of
         19  the armed military formations that were inside the
         20  enclave; it included civilians; it included women; it
         21  included children, and these people fled in the
         22  direction of Tuzla, which is located on this map here
         23  [indicates].  This was their ultimate destination.
         24  Now, about a third of this column, the people in it had
         25  light arms, they had rifles, and the object of this

          1  particular indictment deals, in part, with --
          2                 [Technical difficulty]
          3            MR. HARMON:  There's a technical problem,
          4  Mr. President, so I'll stop.  Ready to proceed?
          5            As I said, thousands of these people in the
          6  column who had fled eventually surrendered or were
          7  captured by the VRS and were later murdered.
          8            On the evening of the 11th, when the column
          9  had departed from the enclave, other significant events
         10  occurred.  There were two meetings that were held at
         11  the Hotel Fontana in Bratunac.  The first meeting
         12  occurred at 8.30 in the evening, and its participants
         13  included General Mladic, General Zivanovic, and Colonel
         14  Karremans, who was the UNPROFOR Dutch commander.  This
         15  meeting was quite short, and at this meeting, General
         16  Mladic insisted on knowing whether or not Colonel
         17  Karremans had ordered airstrikes against his troops.
         18  This was an intimidating meeting.  You'll see full
         19  footage of it.  He also demanded that the Dutch
         20  commander return at 11.00 that same evening with a
         21  representative of the Muslim people, and we are going
         22  to present to Your Honours video footage of that
         23  meeting, and you'll see the context, the ambience, in
         24  which this occurred.
         25            Now, the second meeting did occur, it

          1  occurred at 11.00.  Colonel Karremans did, indeed,
          2  return to the Hotel Fontana with members of his staff,
          3  and he brought with him a man who was a representative
          4  of the Muslim people, a teacher by profession, a man by
          5  the name of Nesib Mandic.  This particular meeting was
          6  designed to intimidate Mr. Mandic and send a message to
          7  the Muslims who were still within the enclave.  At this
          8  meeting, in front of Mr. Mandic was the town sign of
          9  Srebrenica.  Symbolically, it was broken.
         10            During this meeting, General Mladic informed
         11  Mr. Mandic that he wanted a clear position from
         12  Mr. Mandic whether the Muslim people wanted to stay,
         13  survive, or disappear.  He demanded that the Muslims of
         14  Srebrenica lay down their arms, and if they didn't do
         15  so, he threatened their destruction.
         16            Now, to reinforce the import of these remarks
         17  and to increase the psychological terror on Mr. Mandic,
         18  at the time that General Mladic was making these
         19  remarks, a pig was being slaughtered outside the window
         20  of this meeting, and its death cries could clearly be
         21  heard.  Sitting alongside General Mladic when those
         22  menacing remarks were made was one of General Mladic's
         23  principal subordinates, General Krstic.
         24            At the conclusion of this meeting, General
         25  Mladic insisted on another meeting the following

          1  morning at 10.00, and he insisted that Muslim
          2  representatives appear, and he was going to wait to
          3  hear their decision.  And we're going to present to
          4  Your Honour the video footage of this second meeting.
          5            The next morning, on the 12th of July,
          6  Colonel Karremans and members of his staff returned to
          7  the Hotel Fontana, and with them they had three Muslim
          8  representatives, including Mr. Mandic.  At this
          9  meeting, General Mladic again threatened that the
         10  Muslim people could either survive or disappear, and
         11  once again, at his side when these remarks were made,
         12  was the accused, General Krstic.  General Mladic
         13  insisted that members of the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina
         14  surrender their arms, and then he informed the Muslim
         15  representatives that the civilians within the enclave
         16  could stay if they wanted, or they were free to leave.
         17  The meeting didn't last long.
         18            In the afternoon of the 12th of July, 50 or
         19  60 buses and trucks arrived in Potocari and the
         20  deportation began.  Our evidence is going to show that
         21  General Krstic played a central role in ordering and
         22  coordinating the arrival of the buses that were to
         23  deport the Muslims from the enclave.  Our evidence will
         24  also show that after the buses arrived, General Mladic,
         25  General Krstic, and other high-ranking members of the

          1  Drina Corps staff were in Potocari.  Members of the VRS
          2  included Lieutenant-Colonel Popovic, the Drina Corps
          3  Assistant Commander for Security, and
          4  Lieutenant-Colonel Momir Nikolic of the Intelligence
          5  and Security Service of the Bratunac Brigade, again,
          6  names you are going to be hearing throughout the course
          7  of this trial.
          8            Our evidence will show that in the period of
          9  the 12th and 13th of July, members of the VRS
         10  terrorised the refugees before they were expelled
         11  thereby facilitating their removal from the enclave.
         12  During the 12th and the 13th of July, members of the
         13  VRS committed indescribable acts upon members of the
         14  refugee community, including murdering them, raping
         15  them, committing acts of mayhem on them.  These
         16  barbaric acts absolutely panicked the refugees, and
         17  some of them became so desperate that they committed
         18  suicide or attempted to do so.
         19            As the refugees fled toward the buses, Muslim
         20  men and boys were separated from their families and
         21  detained in Potocari.  The process of collecting the
         22  victims had begun.  Those who had been separated were
         23  robbed, some were beaten, some were summarily executed
         24  in Potocari.  While these events were occurring,
         25  members of the Main Staff and the Drina Corps were

          1  present in Potocari.  Following their separation from
          2  their families, the men and the boys were forced onto
          3  buses and they were driven from the enclave to distant
          4  locations that their captors did not want the world to
          5  see.
          6            This became obvious when DutchBat soldiers
          7  who had been assigned to escort these buses on the
          8  orders of their commanders, in order that no harm
          9  befell the occupants of those buses, were
         10  systematically stopped by the VRS.  Their equipment was
         11  taken, their vehicles were confiscated, and, as one
         12  Dutch soldier was to remark later, "it was as though
         13  they were trying to remove our eyes and our ears."  In
         14  retrospect, it is clear from these actions that the
         15  Bosnian Serbs did not want anyone to interfere with
         16  their genocidal plans.
         17            The expulsion of all the Bosnian Muslims from
         18  Potocari took a little over a day and was finished by
         19  2000 hours on the 13th of July.  During this period, an
         20  estimated 20.000 to 30.000 Muslims were deported from
         21  the enclave.  However, a few Muslims did remain in the
         22  enclave, hidden in and around their homes.  They were
         23  hunted down with dogs and they were slaughtered.  The
         24  grim reality for the Bosnian Muslims was that remaining
         25  in Srebrenica was not an option.

          1            One of the only Muslims who was permitted to
          2  remain in the enclave after the deportations were
          3  completed was Mr. Nesib Mandic, the representative I
          4  previously mentioned.  He remained sequestered in the
          5  UN compound in Potocari.  On the 17th of July, a
          6  Bosnian Serb representative appeared at the UN compound
          7  with a prepared declaration, and he insisted that
          8  Mr. Mandic and a Dutch officer sign this declaration.
          9  It was eventually signed under duress by Mr. Mandic and
         10  Major Franken, a Dutch officer.
         11            The declaration stated inter alia that the
         12  meeting that had been held on the 12th of July was
         13  convened at the request of the Muslim civilian
         14  authorities, which was patently false.  It asserted
         15  that, and I quote:  "The evacuation was carried out by
         16  the Serb side correctly ... that there were no
         17  incidents and that the Serbs had abided by the Geneva
         18  Conventions and the international laws of war."  The
         19  declaration identified General Krstic as being present
         20  at that meeting.  This document was created solely for
         21  propaganda purposes.  In the days that followed, the
         22  VRS and the Republika Srpska propaganda machines
         23  attempted to shield their ugly crimes with this false
         24  document.  It was constantly referred to.
         25            Now, Mr. President and Your Honours, I'd like

          1  to turn my attention to another subject, and that is
          2  the killings.
          3            Our evidence will show that a minimum number
          4  of 7.574 persons from Srebrenica are missing and
          5  presumed dead as a result of the events that I've been
          6  describing.  Both members of the Bosnian army who were
          7  armed and unarmed civilians within the column that was
          8  fleeing in the direction of Tuzla were killed by Serb
          9  gunners as the column advanced and fought its way
         10  through Serb occupied territory.  We don't know how
         11  many people in this column were killed.  The exact
         12  number of those killed will never be known to us.
         13            These people who were in the column and
         14  killed as it advanced towards Tuzla are not, in the
         15  legal sense, the victims of the crimes alleged in the
         16  indictment.  Our indictment, instead, focuses on the
         17  fate of thousands of Bosnian Muslim men and boys who
         18  were separated in Potocari and were captured by or
         19  surrendered to the VRS after they fled from the enclave
         20  on the 11th of July.
         21            We will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
         22  they were systematically murdered by members of the VRS
         23  who were under the command and control of the VRS Main
         24  Staff and the accused.  The manner in which these
         25  people perished and the scale of this atrocity is truly

          1  incomprehensible by every standard of humanity.
          2            When the Office of the Prosecutor conducted
          3  exhumations at various locations, including those
          4  associated with killing sites identified in
          5  paragraph 24 of the indictment, we found the mortal
          6  remains of 1.866 victims.  The remains of another
          7  estimated 2.571 victims are believed to be in grave
          8  sites that have been probed by the Office of the
          9  Prosecutor but not yet completely exhumed.  In
         10  addition, other grave sites remain to be located.
         11            In the course of conducting these
         12  exhumations, we found a number of pieces of
         13  identifications on the bodies confirming that the
         14  deceased were from Srebrenica.  I'm going to ask my
         15  assistant to place an example of one such piece of
         16  identification that we found on the ELMO.
         17            You will see, Mr. President and Your Honours,
         18  there is a name of this individual, the name
         19  Srebrenica.  The town of Srebrenica is located at the
         20  bottom left-hand side of this document.  This
         21  individual is an individual who is identified as
         22  missing on the ICRC list.
         23            Now, we also found, in the course of our
         24  exhumations, photographs on some of the victims.  I'm
         25  going to ask my assistant to place one such photograph

          1  on the ELMO.  Will you lower it, please.  Thank you.
          2            These artefacts that we found are poignant
          3  reminders of happy moments long past.  It's images like
          4  these, like this one on the ELMO, that touch our
          5  humanity and remind us that the victims of these crimes
          6  include the living as well as the dead.
          7            Now, let me tell you what else we found.  We
          8  found blindfolds like this.  Indeed, Mr. President and
          9  Your Honours, this particular blindfold that I am
         10  showing you is a blindfold -- is this blindfold that is
         11  found on this person who we discovered in a grave site
         12  in Kozluk.  His hands were bound.  He was blindfolded
         13  like many of the other individuals who were pulled out
         14  of this particular grave site and out of countless
         15  others that we exhumed.
         16            Contrary, Mr. President and Your Honours, to
         17  the VRS and the Republika Srpska propaganda, these
         18  individuals were not the collateral casualties of
         19  battle.  They were people who were liquidated as part
         20  of the genocidal plan perpetrated by the VRS against
         21  the Muslim population of Srebrenica.  These cowardly
         22  acts were planned and meticulously organised and
         23  executed by members of the VRS Main Staff and members
         24  of the Drina Corps in a joint operation that lasted for
         25  several days.  They weren't simple military operations

          1  but actions that involved extensive planning and
          2  coordination at a time when active combat was occurring
          3  in the Drina Corps area of responsibility, particularly
          4  in the Zvornik area.
          5            Most but not all of the mass execution sites
          6  are located in the Zvornik area.  Those sites include
          7  the Branjevo Military Farm, Pilica, the Dam, Orahovac,
          8  and you can see that these sites are located far away
          9  from the enclave in Srebrenica.  Not all of the mass
         10  execution sites were located so far away.
         11            You will be hearing evidence about a mass
         12  execution that took place at the Kravica warehouse,
         13  very close to the enclave and very close to the town of
         14  Bratunac where the meetings with General Mladic and
         15  General Krstic occurred.  You will be hearing about a
         16  mass execution site that occurred in the Cerska Valley,
         17  but the bulk, the majority of the mass executions took
         18  place far to the north.
         19            Now, I'd like for Your Honours to consider
         20  for a moment what was required to conduct an operation
         21  of this scale.  First, it involved the issuing, the
         22  transmitting, and the dissemination of orders to all
         23  units that participated in the movement, the killing,
         24  the burial, and the reburial of the victims.  It
         25  involved the assembling of a sufficient number of

          1  vehicles and buses, trucks, to transport the thousands
          2  of victims from the location of their capture and
          3  surrender to detention centres that were located near
          4  the execution sites.  It involved obtaining fuel for
          5  these vehicles, and one must bear in mind that at the
          6  time there was a fuel embargo and that fuel was
          7  extremely precious.
          8            This operation involved providing guards and
          9  security for each of the vehicles that moved north
         10  toward the killing sites.  It involved identifying
         11  detention centres that were secure enough and in close
         12  proximity to the execution fields.  It involved
         13  providing secure routes for prisoner convoys.  It
         14  involved obtaining sufficient numbers of blindfolds and
         15  ligatures so these prisoners could be bound before they
         16  were executed.  It involved obtaining sufficient men to
         17  secure the actual detention facilities themselves, to
         18  guard the prisoners for the days or for the hours that
         19  they were kept there before they were executed.  It
         20  required obtaining transportation to take the prisoners
         21  from the detention facilities to the killing sites
         22  themselves.  It required obtaining the killing squads,
         23  organising the killing squads, and arming the killing
         24  squads.
         25            This operation required, as well, the

          1  requisitioning and transportation of heavy-duty
          2  equipment necessary to dig the large mass graves, and
          3  it required men to bury the thousands of victims who we
          4  were later to discover.
          5            It also required, Mr. President and Your
          6  Honours, preparing and coordinating propaganda from the
          7  Drina Corps and at all levels of military and political
          8  establishment in order for the Republika Srpska to
          9  attempt to refute the well-founded claims that
         10  atrocities had taken place.
         11            These extermination operations involved the
         12  cooperation, knowledge, and participation of countless
         13  members of the army.  They were known to the civilian
         14  population.  General Krstic was fully aware of these
         15  plans, and he and his subordinates actively assisted in
         16  them, even though the evidence may show that General
         17  Krstic was, at times, in the area of Zepa conducting a
         18  military operation to take over that particular safe
         19  area.
         20            Now, when it became apparent, Mr. President
         21  and Your Honours, that the International Community was
         22  aware that thousands of Muslims were missing and had
         23  been executed, General Krstic and his colleagues, units
         24  under his command, persons under his command, engaged
         25  in a systematic effort to cover up their crimes.  What

          1  they did was they went back to their original killing
          2  fields.  Many of the victims of these mass executions
          3  were buried at the sites where they had been executed.
          4            In September, in that area, these locations
          5  were dug up and the bodies from these various locations
          6  were transferred a considerable distance to these
          7  remote and isolated locations on the Cancari road and
          8  the Hodzici road.
          9            There are a number of secondary grave sites.
         10  We have visited those grave sites, and we have
         11  conducted exhumations of some of those gave sites, and
         12  Your Honours will also see aerial images of the
         13  cover-up in progress.
         14            Now, let me show you, Mr. President and Your
         15  Honours, a photograph.  This is a photograph,
         16  Mr. President and Your Honours, that was taken at the
         17  Kozluk site.  Again, we conducted an exhumation at this
         18  site.  The earth that was on these bodies originally
         19  was taken off, and you will see this photograph
         20  illustrates how clumsy and inept they were when they
         21  attempted to cover up their crimes.
         22            This large trough is a mark caused by an
         23  earth digger that was used by the VRS to pull out the
         24  bodies.  Obviously, as you can see here in this
         25  photograph, they missed a significant number of those

          1  bodies.  They also severed some of the bodies.  But our
          2  evidence will show that this was part of the effort to
          3  cover up the crimes.
          4            Now, you'll also note in this picture, and
          5  you'll have an opportunity later to study it, but a
          6  number of these people have their hands behind their
          7  backs.
          8            When Your Honours consider the scale and the
          9  coordination and the planning of these reburial
         10  efforts, it will be apparent to Your Honours that
         11  General Krstic was fully aware of this and that this
         12  operation required significant logistical support and
         13  planning.
         14            Now, Mr. President and Your Honours, since
         15  one of the issues in this case is whether there were
         16  executions that took place at all, particularly those
         17  identified in paragraph 24 of the indictment, I'd like
         18  to summarise briefly for you some of the evidence that
         19  we're going to present in respect of those specific
         20  allegations.
         21            I'd like to turn first, Mr. President, to the
         22  execution that occurred at the Kravica warehouse.  Now,
         23  this execution, our evidence will show, took place on
         24  the 13th of July, 1995.
         25            Kravica is located near -- let me show you.

          1  When the column left in the direction of Tuzla, it fled
          2  from the village of Susnjari, and it attempted to make
          3  its way in the direction that I'm using my pointer to
          4  indicate.  The road that you see on this illustration
          5  is a road that was ringed with elements of the VRS and
          6  other units, and the column had extreme difficulty in
          7  penetrating in this iron of steel that was ringing
          8  their escape route.  Many thousands of Bosnian Muslims
          9  surrendered to the VRS at these locations along the
         10  road, and they were collected and they were gathered at
         11  various sites, including a football field and the
         12  like.
         13            A significant number of the people who had
         14  been captured and who had surrendered were taken to an
         15  agricultural facility located in Kravica, and at this
         16  particular location, the individuals were jammed into
         17  that particular agricultural facility when the facility
         18  itself -- parts of that facility were fully packed, the
         19  VRS soldiers opened fire on the people who were inside
         20  that facility.
         21            I put on the ELMO, for your viewing, a
         22  portion of the facade of this particular facility, and
         23  you can see the pockmarks of heavy machine-gun fire
         24  that was directed into the facility.  In addition,
         25  grenades were thrown into the facility, and all but a

          1  few people in that facility were killed.
          2            The few survivors who remained, some of them
          3  cried out for help.  They were summarily executed.  And
          4  from this particular episode, only three persons are
          5  shown to have survived.  Two of them will testify
          6  before you.  They will testify, among other things,
          7  that after these killings took place, heavy equipment
          8  arrived at the scene and started to take these people,
          9  these victims, these bodies, and bury them.  They were
         10  buried, many of them, at a location, Glogova, that I'm
         11  pointing to.
         12            Now, during the cover-up that took place
         13  probably in September, the bodies at Glogova were
         14  reburied, were exhumed and reburied a considerable
         15  distance away.  They were hidden along a forested and
         16  not-often-travelled mountain road near Zeleni Jadar in
         17  five particular secondary sites.
         18            The next location that I'm going to describe
         19  to Your Honours is Tisca, and I'm pointing to it with
         20  my pointer.  Now, Tisca was a location where the buses
         21  that had taken the people from the enclave drove, and
         22  it was at this location where the people on those buses
         23  were taken off the buses and permitted to walk six
         24  kilometres to Bosnian Muslim-held territory, but Tisca
         25  was the final separation and screening point for men

          1  who had somehow gotten on those buses and not been
          2  detected.  At that location, men, and some women, were
          3  separated from the people who had disembarked from the
          4  buses.  The men were put in a school, the Luka school,
          5  and they were detained there by the VRS.  Then they
          6  were taken in trucks to execution fields.  Your Honours
          7  will hear the testimony of the sole survivor of one of
          8  those trucks.
          9            The next location, Your Honour, that I'll
         10  talk about is Orahovac.  Now, Orahovac is a small
         11  village north of the enclave, and on the 14th of July,
         12  hundreds of Muslim men who had been detained in
         13  Bratunac were transported to the school nearby, the
         14  Grbavci school and detained in it.  They were later
         15  blindfolded and transported in trucks to the village of
         16  Orahovac, and they were summarily executed.  Members of
         17  the Zvornik Brigade participated in the executions and
         18  participated in the burials of the victims.  We will
         19  present forensic evidence that will corroborate the
         20  testimony of the victim-survivors that you will be
         21  hearing from.
         22            Our evidence is going to show that this mass
         23  grave site was exhumed and the bodies were then
         24  transported to various secondary sites along the
         25  Hodzici road.

          1            The next cited was the Dam, another site of a
          2  mass execution.  This Dam was located near a village of
          3  Petkovci, where on the 14th of July, hundreds of
          4  Bosnian Muslims were transported and detained in the
          5  Petkovci school.  At that location, many of them were
          6  summarily executed.
          7            During the evening of the 14th of July and
          8  the morning of the 15th, VRS military personnel
          9  transported those individuals to the Dam, where they
         10  murdered them.  The victims were buried at the Dam, and
         11  they were later reburied in remote locations in order
         12  to conceal the crimes.
         13            We're going to present to Your Honours the
         14  testimony of survivors from that execution.
         15            Now, our evidence is going to show,
         16  Mr. President and Your Honours, that on the 15th of
         17  July, 1995, at 10.00 in the morning, Colonel Beara, who
         18  was the chief of security for the Main Staff, had a
         19  conversation with General Krstic on an open line.
         20  Colonel Beara complained to the defendant that he had
         21  "3.500 parcels to distribute and he had no solution."
         22  "Parcels" was a codename for Bosnian Muslims, and
         23  "distribute" was a code for murdering them.  He asked
         24  General Krstic for more men for the job and the
         25  defendant endeavoured to assist him.  At the time of

          1  this conversation, there were still thousands of
          2  Muslims yet to be executed.
          3            Now, the next location that I'll describe to
          4  Your Honours is the Cerska Valley, which is located
          5  here.  Between the 14th and the 21st of July, a mass
          6  execution occurred there as well.  We will present the
          7  testimony of an individual who had fled with the column
          8  and who concealed himself in the woods above the area
          9  of Cerska.  In the time frame -- sometime in the time
         10  frame that I have described, he saw three buses full of
         11  Muslim men heading up that main road, a small road,
         12  into the Cerska Valley.  Those buses were followed by
         13  heavy equipment.  From his advantage point, he heard
         14  soon thereafter repeated rounds of small-arms fire.
         15            He descended from his position and he
         16  discovered the execution site.  He directed members
         17  from my office to this location, and we conducted an
         18  exhumation at that site, and there we were able to find
         19  150 bodies of males, aged from approximately 14 to
         20  50 years old.  Many of the victims were bound with wire
         21  ligatures, and I am holding and will present into
         22  evidence later, Your Honours, one of the wire ligatures
         23  that we recovered from the execution site.  Your
         24  Honours, I've asked my assistant to place on the ELMO a
         25  copy of a photograph that we took at the Cerska Valley

          1  site, and Your Honours can see in it the wrist bones of
          2  an individual and you can see the wire ligature that is
          3  around the wrist bones.
          4            Mr. President and Your Honours, I'm going to
          5  now tell you about the executions that took place at
          6  the Pilica school, the Branjevo Military Farm, and the
          7  Pilica Cultural Dom.  Now, I'll indicate where those
          8  locations are with my pointer.
          9            If Your Honours can see, these are extremely
         10  north of the enclave [indicates], and these killings
         11  that took place at the Pilica school occurred between
         12  the 14th and the 16th of July.  The murders that took
         13  place at the Branjevo Military Farm and the Pilica
         14  Cultural Dom occurred on the 16th of July, 1995.
         15            We are going to prove that these executions
         16  took place, Mr. President, through the testimony of a
         17  number of survivors -- not many, but a number of
         18  survivors who were able to make their way through to
         19  freedom after these executions took place.  We're also
         20  going to present to Your Honours forensic evidence that
         21  will corroborate their testimonies.
         22            We will present for Your Honours'
         23  consideration the testimony of Mr. Drazen Erdemovic,
         24  who was a member of the 10th Sabotage Detachment, who
         25  participated in these executions.  He also witnessed

          1  the executions at the Pilica Cultural Centre.
          2  Mr. Erdemovic has been convicted by this Tribunal and
          3  he's been sentenced by this Tribunal for his
          4  participation in these events.
          5            Now, these mass graves that were located at
          6  the sites of these particular killings were also
          7  exhumed.  They were exhumed probably in September, and
          8  the remains of the victims from the Branjevo Military
          9  Farm were reburied along the Cancari road, far to the
         10  south.
         11            After these particular executions at the
         12  Branjevo Military Farm and Pilica Dom had been
         13  completed, our evidence will show that Lieutenant
         14  Colonel Popovic, who was General Krstic's Assistant
         15  Commander for Security, called the Drina Corps
         16  headquarters and asked for General Krstic.  General
         17  Krstic wasn't present, and Colonel Popovic left a
         18  message for the accused that he had "finished the
         19  job."
         20            Lastly, Mr. President and Your Honours, we're
         21  going to present evidence of an execution that occurred
         22  at Kozluk.  I'm indicating that location on the chart
         23  [indicates].  That site of that particular mass
         24  execution occurred within a kilometre of the
         25  headquarters of the Drina Wolves, one of the units that

          1  was subordinate to General Krstic in the Drina Corps.
          2            At this location, Mr. President and Your
          3  Honours, hundreds of Muslims were summarily executed.
          4  They were buried there.  I've shown you two large
          5  images from that particular execution site.  In
          6  September, the VRS returned to dig up some of the
          7  bodies that were buried there and reburied them along
          8  an isolated road far from Kozluk.
          9            When we conducted exhumations at the Kozluk
         10  site, we found the remains of 340 individuals.  Most of
         11  the victims were bound with ligatures.  The remains of
         12  another 158 victims related to these killings were
         13  found at one of the secondary sites along the Cancari
         14  road.
         15            Mr. President and Your Honours, I have
         16  concluded my opening remarks.  Let me just say in
         17  conclusion that the Office of the Prosecutor will
         18  present evidence that will prove beyond a reasonable
         19  doubt that the crimes alleged in the indictment
         20  occurred and that General Krstic was a full participant
         21  in each of them.
         22            Thank you.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         24  Mr. Harmon.
         25            We are now going to have a break, a

          1  half-an-hour break, so that the Prosecutor has an
          2  opportunity to prepare himself for the presentation of
          3  his evidence.  We will be back at 11.30.
          4                 --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.
          5                 --- On resuming at 11.34 a.m.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Can you
          7  hear me, General Krstic?  General Krstic, can you hear
          8  me?  Very well.
          9            Now, pursuant to Article 85, we shall proceed
         10  to the production of evidence by the Prosecution.
         11            Mr. Harmon, you have the floor.
         12            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President; thank
         13  you, Your Honours.  I would like to call Jean-Rene
         14  Ruez.
         15                 [The witness entered court]
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         17  morning, Mr. Jean-Rene Ruez.  Can you hear me?  You
         18  will now take the solemn declaration, please.
         19            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, I can hear
         20  you very well, Mr. President.  But I shall testify in
         21  English.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         23  This is one of the official languages of the Tribunal.
         24            THE WITNESS:  I solemnly declare that I will
         25  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
          1  truth.
          2                 WITNESS:  JEAN-RENE RUEZ
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You may be
          4  seated.  I believe you are already accustomed to this
          5  procedure.  You will now be invited to answer questions
          6  which Mr. Harmon will be asking of you, and after that
          7  you will answer the questions that will be posed to you
          8  by the Defence.  Be at ease.  You're a master of
          9  sorts.
         10            Yes, Mr. Harmon.
         11            MR. HARMON:  Thank you.
         12                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
         13       Q.   Good morning, Mr. Ruez.
         14       A.   Good morning.
         15       Q.   Could you state your name, please, and spell
         16  your last name for the record.
         17       A.   My name is Jean-Rene Ruez, R-u-e-z.
         18       Q.   Mr. Ruez, what is your current occupation?
         19       A.   I'm an investigation team leader at the ICTY
         20  since early -- I arrived at the Tribunal in April 1995,
         21  and I've been in charge of this investigation since
         22  that time.  I was officially nominated team leader here
         23  in 1987 -- 1997, sorry.
         24       Q.   Since you have been employed at the Tribunal,
         25  the Office of the Prosecutor, have you been working

          1  exclusively on the Srebrenica investigation?
          2       A.   Yes.  Exclusively on this topic since July
          3  1995.  The first mission in the territory was 20 July
          4  1995 and arrival in Tuzla 21 July 1995.
          5       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, to your right is Prosecutor's
          6  Exhibit number 2.  It's a large map.  First of all, can
          7  you identify that map and can you tell the Judges where
          8  it was acquired?
          9       A.   This map is part of a collection of documents
         10  which were seized at the headquarters of the Zvornik
         11  Brigade in January 1998.  It's one among many other
         12  documents which were seized during the search of that
         13  headquarters.  This map is a description of the
         14  military operation as seen by those who did it.
         15       Q.   Can you please approach the map and with a
         16  pointer can you explain significant features about that
         17  map to the Judges?  There's a microphone there.
         18       A.   So first of all, this map is not an
         19  operational map which was used during the time of the
         20  operation.  This is a map which has been done
         21  afterwards in order to show what happened on a military
         22  point of view.
         23            The important elements on this map are that
         24  it shows the attack from the -- coming from the south
         25  of the enclave.  As we know, indeed the first

          1  operations, military operations conducted there
          2  happened in the south.  This map is confirming this
          3  element.
          4            The arrows show the penetration of the Serb
          5  forces towards Srebrenica and the takeover of
          6  observation posts.  I will not discuss that element
          7  now.  A military analyst will testify about all these
          8  details, as well as Dutch peacekeepers who were in the
          9  area at that time.
         10            It also shows that after having entered
         11  Srebrenica, the operation here stops and then other
         12  forces are coming north, from Bratunac, and penetrate
         13  the enclave and arrive in Potocari here.
         14            Other elements that can be seen is that there
         15  was indeed military activities conducted in an area
         16  south-west of the enclave, which is called the Bandera
         17  triangle.  When you look at daily SITREPS, situation
         18  reports, from UNPROFOR at that time and also comments
         19  which Mladic was making, General Mladic was making,
         20  heavy combat apparently was going on in that part of
         21  the enclave named Bandera triangle.
         22            What it shows also is the concentration of
         23  the refugees and military people who tried then to flee
         24  the enclave, start to go assemble the 11th, in the
         25  evening, in the area north-west of the enclave which is

          1  the area of Susnjari, which is the neighbourhood of a
          2  little hamlet but it is the entire area here we are
          3  talking about.
          4            On 11 July, indeed the population understood
          5  that the enclave would fall and took two courses of
          6  action.  The women, the children, and the elderly, but
          7  also a certain number of men who decided to take that
          8  chance and face the Bosnian Serbs who would enter the
          9  area, they probably thought that since they had nothing
         10  personally to hide, they would not be harmed, but
         11  apparently they made a wrong decision on that.
         12            All the other ones who didn't want to face
         13  the risk of being captured decided to take off from the
         14  area, and following instructions which were in fact to
         15  follow the power line which is running all around --
         16  all along the stretch of road between Bratunac and
         17  Konjevici, the intersection here, decided to go cross
         18  country and take the direction of Udrc Mountain and
         19  then towards north.
         20            These are all elements that we found out from
         21  witnesses, and who are now confirmed by the map of
         22  those who did the operation.  The map is not very
         23  precise.  The arrow here shows a straight line between
         24  Susnjari and the intersection of Konjevici.  In
         25  reality, the track was different.  First the people

          1  took the direction a little bit here north-west and
          2  were walking closer to the ridge of hills which are
          3  along this asphalt road, much closer than it shows on
          4  the map.  We will return on this later on.
          5            The very important detail which is marked on
          6  this map is the blocking position that the Bosnian Serb
          7  army put in place in this area here, which is an area
          8  we call Konjevic Polje, which is in that location here,
          9  and Nova Kasaba, a little town a bit more south.
         10            On July 12, once the Bosnian Serb army
         11  realised what in fact was happening, which was that a
         12  huge column of men was trying to flee the area and
         13  indeed take this direction.  Initially there was an
         14  element of surprise, so no possibility to challenge
         15  that column.  Part of that column was armed.  The first
         16  group was organised in brigades.  The forces inside
         17  Srebrenica were quite structured, and they recreated
         18  brigades at the moment they were assembling.  Those who
         19  had weapons were mainly walking in front.
         20            So then the blocking position was put in
         21  place.  The army managed to walk through.  When I say
         22  the army, it was, in fact, those who were carrying
         23  weapons and those who were with them, but once these
         24  people passed, then this was completely blocked and no
         25  one could walk through any more.

          1            Then the map shows that the trail taken by
          2  this column goes towards Udrc Mountain.  Here also it
          3  is not very precise because it goes straight above
          4  Udrc, which is quite a high mountain, 1.042 metres high
          5  and very difficult to walk through here.  Later they
          6  made the tour.
          7            Here it shows battles which took place in
          8  this location.  I won't deal with that also but around
          9  the 13th and 14th July --
         10            THE INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.
         11       A.   The microphone does not work?  Sorry.  What
         12  did you miss here?
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Just a
         14  minute, please.
         15       A.   I was saying the map is not very precise here
         16  because the arrow goes straight above Udrc Mountain,
         17  which is not realistic since it's a quite high
         18  mountain, very difficult terrain in reality.  The
         19  movement was much less precise than that.  They were
         20  turning around.
         21            Once they arrived in the area here which is
         22  the south-west of Zvornik, ambushes were set to block
         23  this column, but these ambushes were not successful.
         24  In fact, the column punched through these Serbs
         25  positions, managed to capture equipment, anti-aircraft

          1  guns, mortars, and even managed to capture Serb
          2  prisoners.
          3            More details will probably be given later on
          4  about this, but this is really not the main topic of
          5  the investigation.
          6            The important part here also is that on the
          7  16th July 1995, it shows how the column managed to
          8  break through the lines.  In fact, there was some
          9  agreement initially to let the column go through, but
         10  very quickly this agreement also was breached and
         11  combat had to take place in order for that column to
         12  pass the Bosnian Serb lines.  The date of that event is
         13  marked on it.  It's the 16th July 1995.
         14            A very important aspect here is the 14th of
         15  July and part starting the 13th.  The Bosnian Serb army
         16  realised that this column was causing a very severe
         17  threat to the town of Zvornik.  The reason is that all
         18  the forces who were in this area, not all of them were
         19  but let's say the main forces in this area were down
         20  towards Srebrenica to conduct the Srebrenica
         21  operation.  So there was a decision to mobilise all men
         22  who were able to carry a gun, and all these people were
         23  then sent under military and police control to a secure
         24  Zvornik area.
         25            There is an important element.  Several

          1  witnesses will at some point probably develop on that
          2  and explain what consequences they think it has for
          3  them.
          4            The important aspect also you will see when
          5  we switch on the other map, is that this area here is
          6  close to locations where we have detention sites and
          7  execution sites.  But these sites are not connected
          8  with the military operation.  The dead bodies that we
          9  will talk about in the area are absolutely not
         10  connected with these combat activities, but they happen
         11  nearby.
         12            That is all I would say on this map at this
         13  stage.
         14            MR. HARMON:
         15       Q.   Mr. Ruez, while you're standing, does this
         16  map indicate the boundary of the Drina Corps area of
         17  responsibility?
         18       A.   Yes, indeed.  Critical element.  We will
         19  notice when we switch on the other map that all the
         20  crime scenes we are talking about are within the
         21  precise limits of the Drina Corps.
         22            This map marks the north limit of the corps,
         23  which is here, and you will see that the identified
         24  crime scene that we have most at the north of our map
         25  is the area of Pilica, which is this area here; so just

          1  under the north border of the Drina Corps.  All the
          2  rest of the crime scenes are indeed within these
          3  limits.
          4       Q.   Mr. Ruez, you can have a seat again.  Thank
          5  you very much.
          6            MR. HARMON:  If I can have the assistance of
          7  the usher.  We have our next exhibit underneath,
          8  Exhibit 2, and if I can ask you, Mr. Usher, to remove
          9  this exhibit and expose the next exhibit.
         10            Now, Your Honours, what's before Your Honours
         11  is the large map that I used in my opening statement.
         12  It's been marked as Exhibit 1E.
         13       Q.   Mr. Ruez, what I'd like you to do for the
         14  Judges is to summarise the principal events relating to
         15  your investigation and use this exhibit as a means to
         16  illustrate various points in your testimony.  So if you
         17  would kindly -- if you want to stand up, use the
         18  microphone and the pointer, would you please commence
         19  your testimony.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President and Your Honours,
         21  we have a legend that we're going to identify later and
         22  introduce for this particular map that will be marked
         23  Exhibit 1E bis.  We don't have additional copies.  We
         24  can put one now on the ELMO for Your Honours, and we
         25  will present later to Your Honours a copy.

          1       A.   So, indeed, this is the map which summarises
          2  the view that we have of these events from the
          3  investigation.  The colour codes are very important to
          4  understand, indeed, these locations.
          5            The triangles represent areas where prisoners
          6  were concentrated.  The red triangles mark execution
          7  sites, but small-scale execution sites.  In reality,
          8  what we consider small-scale execution sites in this
          9  environment is roughly under 100 individuals.  At the
         10  red circles, we have mass execution sites.  Then we
         11  have yellow circles which indicate the locations where
         12  mass graves can be found, those that we call primary
         13  mass graves, undisturbed mass graves.  The ones which
         14  have a cross in it are disturbed mass graves, because,
         15  as you know, there was a robbing operation of all these
         16  graves, which I will not develop at this stage but at
         17  the next one.  The result of that operation is the
         18  creation of secondary mass graves scattered in the area
         19  in order -- that in case we would discover some of
         20  them, we would never be able to demonstrate how many
         21  people, indeed, had been massacred during this
         22  operation.  So there are a number of them already
         23  marked on the map, but we will enter these details at a
         24  later stage.
         25            So based on this map, the reconstruction of

          1  the event is that, as I said, the people from the
          2  enclave took two courses of action.  The ones who
          3  decided to flee towards Potocari and seek the
          4  protection of the United Nations at the UN base went to
          5  Potocari.  The evacuation of this group started on July
          6  12, after the meetings which were held in Bratunac
          7  between General Mladic, members of his staff, and
          8  representatives of the Muslim population, and it
          9  started 12.00 -- after 12.00, around 2.00 p.m.
         10            The people were taken on board buses, driven
         11  through Bratunac, towards Konjevic Polje, then towards
         12  Vlasenica, in order to reach the confrontation line
         13  which was before Kladanj.  The last stop was in the
         14  area here [indicates], and then the people had to walk
         15  through a canyon towards Kladanj which was, at the
         16  time, under the control of the Muslim forces here
         17  [indicates].
         18            On the way, a lot of separations took place.
         19  There were checkpoints set along the road.  The UN
         20  personnel who tried to follow the convoys in order to
         21  make sure that the people would reach their destination
         22  were stopped.  The UN personnel was stripped of their
         23  equipment and couldn't fulfil their mission and find
         24  out exactly what was going on.
         25            At many instances, we have witnesses talking

          1  about soldiers checking the contents of the buses and
          2  taking out men who were in it, even young boys.  The
          3  women will tell you that they had to dress kids as
          4  girls in order to make sure that they would not be
          5  taken off of the bus.  Some men still managed to get on
          6  board these buses and reach Kladanj, mainly at the
          7  beginning of the operation.  The more we enter the
          8  operation, then the less men would be able to go
          9  through, and at one point, no one is going through.
         10            The men who tried to get on board of the
         11  buses in Potocari had special treatment.  They are
         12  separated at the moment that they try to get on board,
         13  and they are taken to a specific location in Potocari
         14  which we call the White House.  Inside that house,
         15  people were jammed, and once there were enough numbers,
         16  specific buses were waiting for them and they were
         17  loaded only on these buses, and from there taken to
         18  Bratunac.  In Bratunac, they were kept in various
         19  locations.  This lasted during the two days of the
         20  evacuation, the 12th and the 13th.
         21            We only know these locations from men who
         22  managed to survive later on their execution, but we
         23  know that a large number of men at one point were,
         24  indeed, in Bratunac town.  I will have to return to
         25  Bratunac later on, since Bratunac will then become the

          1  main concentration area for all the prisoners captured
          2  in this part of the territory.
          3            Those who tried to flee through the woods,
          4  approximately 15.000 men, we cannot be more precise
          5  than that.  This is the number which is given by nearly
          6  all the people who were there at the time.  It's an
          7  assessment which is, indeed, very difficult to make, we
          8  cannot either confirm or deny it, but we will keep that
          9  figure since it is the one generally considered, as
         10  well as the figure of 25.000 people who were taken out
         11  of the enclave and bused to Kladanj.  That number is
         12  also very difficult either to confirm or to deny.
         13            The flight through the woods started on the
         14  11th, in the evening, during the night.  People waited
         15  until night-time to try and sneak out, and they had to
         16  cross the minefields at the border of the enclave.  So
         17  first they had to open a one-metre-large path in these
         18  minefields, and then it was a very long process to get
         19  out of the area.  This created a very long column of
         20  men which stretched all along the area here
         21  [indicates], in order to pass here [indicates], at
         22  12.00 -- at the end of the afternoon.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I'm sorry
         24  to interrupt you, Mr. Harmon, but it will be perhaps
         25  convenient to say the names of the villages that we can

          1  find on the map, instead of saying "here" and "there."
          2  Because, as you know, we have the transcript, and now
          3  that we have a map, it's easy, but if we only look at
          4  the transcript without the map, it's going to be
          5  difficult.  So if you can please state the name of the
          6  village as well.  Thank you.
          7            MR. HARMON:
          8       Q.   Mr. Ruez.
          9       A.   So at 12.00 in the afternoon, one part of the
         10  column is already reaching the area of Konjevic Polje;
         11  meanwhile, others are still stretched all along the
         12  ridge of the hills which is along the asphalt road
         13  between Bratunac and Konjevic Polje, just in the area
         14  to the south of Kravice.
         15            Several ambushes were set on the way, and
         16  also shelling of these columns in order to break it
         17  into smaller parts.  One main ambush occurs at 12.00 in
         18  the afternoon, or at the end of the afternoon, just
         19  south of the village of Kravice, in a place we call
         20  Kamenica, because there's a little hamlet there called
         21  Kamenica.  Unfortunately, there are many villages
         22  called Kamenica, and this can create some confusion
         23  with an area north that the people know as being
         24  Kamenica.  That is the reason why we will call this
         25  area here [indicates] Cancari.

          1            Following this ambush, a lot of panic is
          2  already instilled among the people who were trying to
          3  flee.  Most of the people don't really know the
          4  ground.  Most of the refugees who are in the Srebrenica
          5  enclave are not from Srebrenica.  The population inside
          6  of the enclave are people who were "ethnically
          7  cleansed" in 1992 and were coming from Bijeljina, from
          8  Zvornik, from Vlasenica, and from other municipalities
          9  in the vicinity.  So they don't know the area and
         10  that's the reason why they had this guideline, to
         11  follow the power line.
         12            But after that, many of these people didn't
         13  know where to go.  Serb forces begin to infiltrate the
         14  column, people talk about the wounded being killed, and
         15  no one is trusting anyone.  At some point, people start
         16  shooting at each other, thinking that they are
         17  confronted with enemies.  So a huge panic is happening
         18  in this place.
         19            The consequence of that is that on the 13th,
         20  in the morning, all of these people decide, in fact, to
         21  surrender.  Many try to prevent them from doing so
         22  since they witnessed that at the moment of surrender
         23  people are executed on the spot.  We're talking here
         24  about small-scale executions, individuals or groups of
         25  two or three.  Nevertheless, the decision is made, in

          1  fact, and a massive movement of surrender starts.
          2            On the 13th, in the morning, the people begin
          3  to go down a valley and arrive in the area of Sandici.
          4  They also arrive in the area nearby which is not marked
          5  on the map which is Lolici.  In fact, when surrendering
          6  starts, it happens in many locations.  We're not only
          7  talking about the massive ones.
          8            On the 12th, in the evening, I also said that
          9  the spearhead of the column managed to pass through the
         10  Serb lines, but the rest of it was trapped behind.  So
         11  we have the same situation on the 13th, in the morning,
         12  in the area of Konjevic Polje as we had south of
         13  Kravice.  Surrendering starts.  So we have at that
         14  moment, the day of the 13th, in the morning, people who
         15  are assembled in meadows; one meadow of Sandici and one
         16  soccer field here [indicates] in Nova Kasaba.
         17            I also have to say that this movement of
         18  surrender was encouraged by the illusion that
         19  protection would be provided to those who surrendered.
         20  The Bosnian Serb forces who were present in the area
         21  and who stripped the UN personnel of their equipment
         22  used that equipment to lure the people and make them
         23  believe that they would be under the protection of
         24  UNPROFOR.  Soldiers were wearing blue helmets.  Bosnian
         25  Serb soldiers who were using UN APCs always gave the

          1  feeling to the refugees who were trying to escape that
          2  there was some kind of protection which would be for
          3  them.  Also, soldiers were shouting messages through
          4  megaphones, inciting the people to surrender and
          5  telling them that they would be under the protection of
          6  the International Red Cross, present in the place,
          7  according to what they were saying.
          8            The fate of those who were on these meadows
          9  is that most of them were taken on board of buses or
         10  trucks and taken back to Bratunac, but there are
         11  exceptions to this.  On the 13th, a large group of
         12  prisoners is assembled on the meadow of Sandici.  At
         13  the beginning of the afternoon, the General passes in
         14  this area, makes a speech to the prisoners, and then
         15  leaves the place.  Shortly afterwards, a first group is
         16  taken on board the buses and taken to Kravice, jammed
         17  inside an agriculture warehouse.  A second group,
         18  larger than the first one, is then also marched towards
         19  the Kravice warehouse and jammed into it.  We will
         20  return to the events there in detail.
         21            But then once the people were inside the
         22  warehouse, the soldiers who were guarding them started
         23  to open fire from all the openings of the building and
         24  throwing grenades inside, and the people who were
         25  inside the warehouse were killed, but not all of them,

          1  since we have also survivors of this execution.
          2            Many small-scale executions happened in this
          3  vicinity which are not even marked on the map.  The
          4  witness --
          5            THE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness slow
          6  down, please.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Ruez,
          8  you've been asked to slow down, please.  It is
          9  necessary to bear in mind all the time that there are
         10  interpreters between the two of us.  So please slow
         11  down.  Thank you.
         12       A.   I'm sorry.
         13            The situation at the soccer field at Nova
         14  Kasaba is different than in Sandici.  There is no
         15  massive execution happening at Nova Kasaba.  There are
         16  few executions happening there.  The fate of the
         17  prisoners assembled here [indicates] is transportation
         18  towards Bratunac.
         19            So on the 13th of July, Bratunac begins to be
         20  packed with these prisoners.  We know that several
         21  buildings were used; the Vuk Karadzic school was used;
         22  an old school behind the Vuk Karadzic school was used
         23  as well; one hangar, which is yet not identified, but
         24  the investigation is still ongoing on that and as well
         25  as on many other aspects, this warehouse also was

          1  used.  It seems, in fact, that the few facilities
          2  available were jammed with people, since several
          3  witnesses will explain that they were staying on board
          4  of the buses and trucks which were in lines, and we
          5  have three lines of buses and trucks filled with
          6  prisoners in Bratunac town.
          7            We will pinpoint them on the map later on,
          8  but we have one line of trucks waiting in front of
          9  Vihor garages, one line of trucks waiting in front of
         10  the Vuk Karadzic school, and one line of trucks at the
         11  outskirts of Bratunac town, at the west of it.
         12            During these days, the 12th and the 13th, the
         13  deportation of the population within the enclave was
         14  still going on.  So you had movements of buses, in
         15  fact, going towards Kladanj, but you also had movements
         16  of trucks and buses going towards Bratunac.
         17            The men who were separated at the last
         18  checkpoint, which was in the place called -- little
         19  place called Luke, where there is only one little
         20  building which is an elementary school, were put inside
         21  the school.  From there the 13th, in the evening --
         22  this process might have happened many times but we only
         23  know about once since there is only one person who
         24  managed to survive that process -- the men were taken
         25  on board of little trucks, driven towards Vlasenica.

          1  Vlasenica they turned left, which is, in fact, north of
          2  Vlasenica, in an area of hills, of wooded hills, and
          3  somewhere in this area the people were executed.  We
          4  have never managed to find the precise spot where this
          5  execution took place.
          6            We also know, from witnesses who were blocked
          7  on a hill just above Konjevic Polje, that indeed people
          8  who were captured or surrendered were executed in this
          9  area, but we are talking here about one, two, or three
         10  bodies, and we have never found these locations and we
         11  will not.  The main location, we have found it, but can
         12  implement -- the witnesses who talks about these events
         13  is one witness who witnessed a massive execution
         14  happening here.  Not massive according to the code that
         15  I previously gave, but still it talks about three
         16  groups of prisoners, one group of 30, a second group of
         17  30, and then a larger group of about --
         18            THE INTERPRETER:  Could the witness slow
         19  down, please.
         20            MR. HARMON:
         21       Q.   Mr. Ruez, will you slow down.
         22       A.   And he witnessed how these people got shot on
         23  a meadow.  We will return on that meadow later on.  We
         24  managed to find this one and process the crime scene.
         25            Also, at a date which is still difficult to

          1  fix, but it will probably happen at the time the
          2  witness will be coming here, several witnesses talk
          3  about an event which happened in the valley of Cerska.
          4  I will give all the details about it when we will be
          5  talking about that precise location, but we have an
          6  execution site of 150 people in the valley of Cerska.
          7  They were transported by bus into the valley and shot
          8  there.  I will provide you with the details of that
          9  later on.
         10            We also have a smaller execution of
         11  16 people at the intersection between the Jadar River
         12  and the Drljaca River.
         13            The situation during the night of the 13th
         14  and the 14th is -- in Bratunac is the preparation of
         15  the evacuation of all these prisoners towards other
         16  locations.  There are several versions about what
         17  happened at that time, and I must admit it is a bit
         18  difficult for us to explain all the details at this
         19  moment since indeed the investigation is ongoing and we
         20  are, at the moment, in contact with witnesses from all
         21  sides.  We are still collecting and we are still
         22  collecting information from them, and everything we are
         23  saying during this proceeding is helping the people a
         24  lot.  We are trying to find out exactly what their role
         25  and implication was in these events.

          1            Nevertheless, what can be said on Bratunac
          2  was that the version served by those who witnessed the
          3  events from the inside is that there was a fear that
          4  the town will be captured by all these prisoners who
          5  were inside Bratunac town.  The alleged reason is that
          6  the town is empty of military forces, when we know a
          7  lot of forces are in this area.  Therefore, the
          8  prisoners had to be guarded by old people carrying
          9  guns, and by children, and there was a threat that
         10  revenge would be taken on them.  So that justified the
         11  need to evacuate the town.
         12            In reality, what happens in terms of
         13  evacuation is that the 14th, in the very early morning
         14  hours, indeed the first convoy of prisoners is leaving
         15  Bratunac town.  That convoy does not take the asphalt
         16  road that goes towards Konjevic Polje, probably because
         17  of still some combat activities and the cleaning of the
         18  area going on at that moment, so the convoy took the
         19  road that goes north of Bratunac and then recaptures
         20  the road that goes towards Zvornik.
         21            That first group of prisoners was -- there
         22  was a promise of exchange which was done the day
         23  before, on the 12th, in the evening, by General Mladic,
         24  who went to visit some of these spots, and told to the
         25  prisoners that they had nothing to worry about and that

          1  they will be later on exchanged.
          2            Indeed, this first group of prisoners
          3  believes that this is going to happen since they take
          4  the direction of Zvornik.  They pass Zvornik.  They
          5  arrive in Karakaj.  At Karakaj they turn left, take the
          6  asphalt road that leads towards Tuzla, arrived at an
          7  intersection which is an intersection that leads to a
          8  village which at that time was completely destroyed,
          9  the village of Kriljevici, which is not marked on this
         10  map.  They stop and they unload the buses.  All the
         11  prisoners have to enter a school which is the Grbavci
         12  school, and during the day several convoys are coming
         13  from Bratunac and the prisoners are entering the gym of
         14  that school.
         15            At a later stage of the day, once the gym is
         16  full, General Mladic is witnessed coming to the school
         17  and gives a little speech to the prisoners.  After his
         18  departure, the prisoners are taken out of the school,
         19  of the gymnasium of the school in little groups, loaded
         20  on a little TAM truck -- TAM is a trademark of the
         21  truck -- and taken very nearby to a field where an
         22  execution squad is waiting for them, and during all the
         23  afternoon of the 14th and part of the night of the
         24  14th, all the prisoners who were at the Grbavci
         25  gymnasium are executed at the site we call Orahovac.

          1            That same day, the 14th July, at the same
          2  moment probably, other convoys of trucks and buses full
          3  of prisoners are leaving Bratunac town, taking the same
          4  direction towards Zvornik.  They pass Karakaj, and they
          5  turn left towards a place called Petkovci where there
          6  is a school also.  There is no gymnasium in that
          7  school.  It is just a school building.  The prisoners
          8  are put into classrooms.  Once these classrooms are
          9  full -- we know for the first floor for sure because of
         10  survivors, but they believe that the ground floor was
         11  also full of prisoners.
         12            At the end of the afternoon, the prisoners
         13  are taken towards the Dam of Petkovci.  We will give
         14  details about the location.  The fact is that from the
         15  evening of the 14th, also through part of the night,
         16  group after group, an execution squad is waiting for
         17  the trucks bringing in the prisoners and all the
         18  prisoners are executed there.  Luckily also, some
         19  managed to survive and will be able to tell you the
         20  story of what happened here.
         21            During that time, there are still prisoners
         22  in Bratunac.  Prisoners who are in the old school are
         23  not evacuated before the 15th of July, despite all the
         24  allegations of officials in Bratunac who declared to us
         25  that the town was emptied in one day, the 14th of

          1  July.  We know it's not true.  The 15th, some prisoners
          2  were still in the old school and evacuated that day
          3  towards Zvornik, going north, passing Kozluk, even more
          4  north.  And just under the border of the Drina Corps
          5  which we saw on the previous map -- the border would be
          6  here -- they were brought to a school which is the
          7  Pilica school in a hamlet called Kula.
          8            They were jammed inside that school.  We are
          9  suddenly talking here about a large number of people.
         10  When we will look into the details of this crime scene,
         11  you will see the size of that school.  It's a big one
         12  which has also the gym and the classrooms.  Obviously
         13  they were used to kill the prisoners.
         14            We believe that for the reason that during
         15  the night of the 15th to the 16th, one bus of prisoners
         16  came and the prisoners were not taken inside the
         17  school.  They were executed outside the school.  The
         18  probable reason for that is there was no space any more
         19  to keep them inside.
         20            The next day, the morning of the 16th, the
         21  people are taken out of the school and driven towards
         22  the Branjevo farm where an execution squad composed of
         23  members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment and members of
         24  another unit are waiting for them and execute them
         25  all.  The other unit is the Bratunac Brigade.  We'll

          1  give details later on about the involvement of the
          2  Bratunac Brigade in the extermination of all the
          3  prisoners of the Branjevo farm.
          4            The key witness for this execution, aside the
          5  survivors, because here also are survivors, is Drazen
          6  Erdemovic, who will again testify about these events.
          7            After the execution at the Branjevo farm was
          8  finished, the same execution squad was tasked to go and
          9  kill prisoners who were inside the house of culture of
         10  Pilica.  The commanding officer who instructed the
         11  squad to go and kill these people mentioned a number of
         12  500.  We have no idea of how many people were inside,
         13  but this man seemed to know how many were in it.
         14            That same day, the 16th or the 17th, we
         15  cannot be very precise on this, we will explain later
         16  on why, we have knowledge also of another execution
         17  which took place in this area.  We believe that the
         18  prisoners who were executed there were initially kept
         19  in a school called Orahovac.  These prisoners were
         20  taken to Kozluk, and at the edge of the Drina River
         21  there was also an execution squad waiting for them in
         22  that location and the people were killed here.  Our
         23  figure was 500 people killed here, which was indirect
         24  information.  We will enter all these details also when
         25  we talk crime scene by crime scene, and we can confirm

          1  indeed that number here.
          2            So this is roughly -- this is a summary of
          3  the chain of executions which happened after the
          4  takeover.  What happened later on, but this also will
          5  be part of the separate demonstration, is that before
          6  the signature or even -- at the moment, the Bosnian
          7  Serb Army realised that the war was going to be ended
          8  and not necessarily the way they expected but through
          9  an agreement, the decision was made to try to erase the
         10  evidence of the crime committed.
         11            It was already clear that there would be an
         12  investigation on this.  Journalists had already started
         13  to investigate the place.  Some even had tried to enter
         14  and have entered the area.  So there was no doubt in
         15  their mind that there would be a full investigation on
         16  such events.
         17            Therefore, the decision was made to erase all
         18  the evidence from the mass graves and transfer the
         19  bodies in hidden locations, which was indeed done, and
         20  all the triangles mark the positions of individual
         21  graves, each of them having a content between 80 and
         22  180 bodies in them.  These areas are scattered mainly
         23  in the south-west of Zvornik and at the south of the
         24  Srebrenica enclave.
         25            We'll give details later on about how the

          1  secondary sites connect with what we call the primary
          2  sites.
          3            I think at this stage, that's what we have to
          4  say.
          5       Q.   Have a seat please, Mr. Ruez.
          6            MR. HARMON:  Just to inform Your Honours, I
          7  intend to call Mr. Ruez back later, at a different
          8  stage of the trial, to explain these additional aspects
          9  of this, particularly the secondary grave sites.
         10       Q.   But let me turn now, Mr. Ruez, to a film
         11  which I would like you, first of all, to inform the
         12  Judges in advance what's on this film, what it shows,
         13  where it was acquired, who filmed it.  Could you do
         14  that, please, and just give a brief summary, and then
         15  during the showing of this film, I'd like you to
         16  narrate the various aspects.
         17       A.   Yes.  The film we're going to see is going to
         18  show several aspects of the operation at the time it
         19  was happening.  We will see people from Srebrenica
         20  leaving Srebrenica town on one piece of that footage.
         21  The footage is coming from a journalist named Zoran
         22  Petrovic.  He was present in the enclave at the time of
         23  the events.  He was obviously in agreement with the
         24  Bosnian Serb Army to be there, since he's driving in a
         25  military vehicle and is constantly in the presence of

          1  Bosnian Serb military personnel.
          2            The fact is that in the film, it doesn't make
          3  that very clear, since some people ask him questions
          4  about his presence once he presents himself as an
          5  independent journalist of Studio B in Belgrade.  At
          6  another moment, he presents himself like the police.
          7  The fact is that he was there and could film quite a
          8  lot of interesting sequences.  He didn't do that in the
          9  purpose of assisting the Tribunal, that's clear, but
         10  nevertheless, he sold bits of his film later on to
         11  international press journalists.
         12            Before doing that, he edited his film in
         13  order to make sure we would not get access to pictures
         14  that would implicate too heavily the Bosnian Serb
         15  Army.  So there are some blank spots in this film.  One
         16  journalist could see the entire version of it.  The
         17  missing parts are not extremely relevant, in fact.
         18  They don't show murders.  They don't show a lot of dead
         19  bodies, but they show prisoners, as an example, but we
         20  will come on it later, in the White House of Potocari.
         21  He initially had a sequence showing men sitting on the
         22  balcony, which is, in fact, also interesting, because
         23  it shows that the house was indeed really packed with
         24  people, but that sequence was erased in his film.
         25            Nevertheless, the film has been extremely

          1  useful for the investigation, both for -- to have a
          2  better view of the events but also to identify a
          3  certain number of very interesting individuals.
          4            Also, this film implements some parts of the
          5  stories told by the witnesses, which no one would ever
          6  have a chance to implement without live pictures at the
          7  time of the events.  The film shows, as an example, a
          8  Bosnian Serb soldier on the asphalt road between Lolici
          9  and Sandici, wearing a blue helmet.  This -- we would
         10  not have been able to confirm that without this film.
         11            In the footage we're going to see, in fact,
         12  is a mixture of footage, as there are -- also part of
         13  it are extracts of news from RS television.  In fact, I
         14  discover a bit the synopsis of the tape at the moment
         15  I'm talking about it.
         16            So we will see refugees leaving the enclave.
         17  Then we will also see Serb forces entering Srebrenica.
         18  We will see Milan Jojovic, who is the commander of a
         19  special force unit the Drina Wolves, which is -- in
         20  fact at that time was a unit part of the 1st Zvornik
         21  Brigade, giving some instructions to his troops.
         22            We can see also General Mladic, General
         23  Krstic, General Zivanovic entering Srebrenica town.
         24  The piece of footage showing the speech of General
         25  Mladic, which is not translated on the tape but I

          1  assume you will be provided later with a full
          2  transcript of the tape where General Mladic talks about
          3  the fact that it is now time to take revenge on the
          4  Turks, which is the name a certain number of Bosnian
          5  Serbs used to designate Muslims.
          6            We will also see films on Potocari, of
          7  refugees, of women arriving, of General Mladic talking
          8  with these refugees and giving them some reassurances,
          9  General Mladic giving an interview also which is not
         10  translated on the footage you will see.  I will make
         11  some comments probably at the moment the film is
         12  rolling.  And various views of Potocari, which will be
         13  interesting, but I think I better make the comments at
         14  the moment the film is unfolding.
         15            After Potocari, part of the film will be
         16  extracts of Zoran Petrovic's videotape, and these will
         17  be pictures of military activities going on in between
         18  Bratunac and Konjevic Polje.  At some points, but we'll
         19  return later on on this when we will be talking crime
         20  scene by crime scene, we will return to these pictures
         21  because for some of them we can identify very precisely
         22  the location, and this is an identification we have
         23  made very recently and we will expose it to you.
         24            Then it will show Srebrenica town, which is
         25  also an interesting thing for us to have since you will

          1  see on this film how the mosque in Srebrenica, the main
          2  mosque of Srebrenica looks like at the moment it was --
          3  the place was captured by the Bosnian Serb army, and I
          4  will then show you photographs of that same mosque in
          5  1996, 1997, and in 1998, and you will see the slow
          6  destruction of that building until it is transformed
          7  into a parking lot.
          8            Then you will have a little piece of footage
          9  which is undated, where we can see refugees arriving in
         10  Kladanj, and finally the film will end with a piece of
         11  footage of BiH television news, which is the arrival of
         12  the first military men coming out at the area of Nezuk,
         13  where the members of the 28th Division, which was the
         14  Muslim division inside the Srebrenica enclave, managed
         15  to exit that part of the territory.
         16       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, as we roll the film, if you
         17  want to make comments to inform the Judges about what's
         18  being seen in the images, please feel free to do so.
         19  If we could dim the lights, and if we could start the
         20  video, it's Prosecutor's Exhibit number 3.
         21                 [Videotape played]
         22       A.   That was the UN compound in Srebrenica called
         23  Company B.  At this moment, the people ...
         24            THE INTERPRETER:  The interpreters are sorry,
         25  but this cannot be interpreted.  It needs to be stopped

          1  for the interpreters to hear the comments.
          2       A.   Do you have the sound when the film is
          3  ongoing?
          4            MR. HARMON:
          5       Q.   Could you rewind the film please.  Keep the
          6  volume down, and we'll start again.
          7       A.   The first sequence in black and white is, in
          8  fact, a moment of panic in Srebrenica town where the
          9  population realises the enclave is going to fall, and
         10  the men are discussing what to do.  And this is, in
         11  fact, the key moment where massively the decision to
         12  flee either towards Potocari, either towards the woods
         13  and try to find a way to exfiltrate the area.
         14            Very shortly, in fact, after that, or even
         15  before that, the crowd was entering the UN compound,
         16  and General Mladic, the day before, had threatened the
         17  United Nations that no refugees should be accepted
         18  inside the compound.  If not, the compound would be
         19  shelled.  It is hard to say if what happened next is an
         20  on-purpose act or "an accident," but the fact is a
         21  mortar shell hit in the middle of that crowd, and an
         22  unknown number of people were killed and injured at
         23  that moment.
         24       Q.   Mr. Ruez, was this film taken by Zoran
         25  Petrovic, or is this additional film footage that's

          1  been inserted in this exhibit?
          2       A.   This is an additional insertion.  We would
          3  have to double-check where it's coming from exactly.  I
          4  think it's either coming from a Bosniak Muslim video
          5  footage or Dutch footage.
          6       Q.   All right.  Now if we could proceed with the
          7  film, and proceed to make your comments, Mr. Ruez, as
          8  we progress.
          9                 [Videotape played]
         10       A.   The building here is Company B in Srebrenica
         11  town.  This is a crowd which is at the UN compound.
         12  Nearby, they are trying to decide what course of action
         13  to take.  At that moment, everyone knew it was already
         14  lost.
         15            These are the first refugees arriving at the
         16  UN base.  The first ones will arrive in trucks and
         17  buses.  The United Nations personnel, they are trying
         18  their best to go and collect as many people as
         19  possible.  But the main column arrived walking.  Some
         20  shelling was happening on the way, but not targeting
         21  the population; in fact, channelling the population
         22  towards Srebrenica.  Several were wounded by the
         23  shelling, but the shelling was not designed to kill the
         24  people, but to make sure that they would go like
         25  organised cattle towards Potocari.

          1            This is the commander of the Drina Wolves
          2  giving instructions to his troops to yell like wolves
          3  in order to scare off probably the opponent.
          4            This is the area south of the enclave at the
          5  moment the military operation is going on.  Probably --
          6  the people we just saw were probably in the vicinity of
          7  the forward command post of Krivaca, which is a hill
          8  just east of Srebrenica town, south-east of Srebrenica
          9  town, which enables us to have an overview of this
         10  area.
         11            Here you can see the Drina Wolves yelling.
         12            This is a picture of a tank.  This is
         13  probably the Republika Srpska news.
         14            This is General Mladic entering Srebrenica
         15  town, greeting individuals wearing black camouflage
         16  uniforms, which are members of the 10th Sabotage
         17  Detachment.  We know several of them by name.  He's
         18  calling General Krstic and General Zivanovic, asking
         19  them to speed up.  Greeting here, you can see members
         20  of the unit of the Drina Wolves.  They have this
         21  armband with a blue patch with a black wolf yelling in
         22  it.
         23            You have here various people, including the
         24  brother of General Zivanovic.  The identification of
         25  faces and names might come at a later stage, when we

          1  will discuss, in detail, the responsibilities.  When he
          2  says "Krle," he refers to General Krstic.
          3            An element of the 2nd Romanija Corps, which
          4  was also a unit which participated in the takeover of
          5  the enclave.  Here we can see General Krstic greeting
          6  his colleague from the 2nd Romanija Corps.  You can see
          7  several people of top interest; we will discuss them
          8  later.
          9            This is the piece of footage where General
         10  Mladic ends by saying that the time of revenge on the
         11  Turks has arrived.
         12            This is a group of Bratunac Brigade people
         13  from the reconnaissance unit who are entering
         14  Srebrenica -- Potocari first.  Bosnian Serb forces in
         15  Potocari, next to the White House.  Behind it is an
         16  electrical substation.  The people are coming from a
         17  hamlet above.  They are directed towards the asphalt
         18  road.
         19            This is a view of a crowd of refugees in
         20  Potocari next to the Express Compound.  General Mladic
         21  explaining to the crowd what is going to happen, that
         22  the woman, the children, and the elderly are going to
         23  be evacuated first, that the turn of the men will come
         24  after that part of the evacuation will be completed,
         25  that no one will harm them.  The very precise location

          1  of that footage is known.  I'll show you later on
          2  pictures of that location.  There are ground features
          3  which are easily recognisable.
          4            You can see the person wearing the blue flak
          5  jacket, this is Major Kingori, a United Nations
          6  military observer who was present there and who has a
          7  lot of interesting details to give.
          8            In this interview, General Mladic is just
          9  giving technical comments regarding the ongoing
         10  operation, what is going to happen; all the good things
         11  that he is currently doing for these people, providing
         12  them with water and food.  I believe this is also the
         13  footage where he explains that the operation is not
         14  directed against UNPROFOR, nor the civilian population,
         15  but only against army people.  The men surrounding
         16  Mladic are his bodyguards.  You will constantly see
         17  them in his presence.  In every footage where General
         18  Mladic appears, you will see them.  They are his
         19  bodyguards.
         20            This is the separation line which is nearby
         21  the Express Compound, just in the area where General
         22  Mladic was just giving his interview.  At this moment,
         23  this is a little piece of propaganda where the soldiers
         24  are handing, for the sake of the RS television,
         25  chocolate and bonbons to the children.

          1            This is a view of the refugees waiting for
          2  the buses in the vicinity of the Express Compound, just
          3  at the location where General Mladic was talking.
          4  These are the faces of men in that little compound.
          5  The men will all be separated and taken to what we call
          6  the White House.
          7            This is a view of the Express Compound, one
          8  of the factories in Potocari where the refugees were
          9  jammed inside, waiting for a chance to flee that place,
         10  and we will explain why they needed to flee.
         11            This is a scene where the people are cleared
         12  to go on board the buses.  Soldiers in the vicinity of
         13  the buses.  All these buses are coming from all over
         14  the area.  There was even an appeal to the public to
         15  provide transportation.
         16            All these men are men who were in the White
         17  House and who are going to take separate buses.  You
         18  will see at one point individuals who try to go on the
         19  other side are prevented by soldiers in between the
         20  truck to reach the other side of that road.  All these
         21  men have been identified by face, and they are all
         22  missing.  Someone will come and testify about this
         23  identification.
         24            This is the other part where the women, the
         25  children, and the elderly could walk and go in buses

          1  which were going towards Kladanj.  Men were shipped
          2  towards Bratunac.
          3            You can see some men are still on that part
          4  of the road.  This means that these men logically will
          5  be able to get on board of the bus, but several of them
          6  will probably be separated on the way before Kladanj,
          7  except the very old ones or the really disabled ones.
          8  People know each other, as you can see.
          9            This is a discussion between a UN soldier and
         10  the commander of special police forces in charge of
         11  organising the process here.  You can see a lot of
         12  clothing lying on the ground.  People had to abandon
         13  their bags, their belongings, before entering the
         14  buses.  All the way towards Kladanj, they will be
         15  systematically robbed of all their belongings also.
         16            This is Major Kingori at this moment
         17  complaining about the situation inside the White
         18  House.  He says that the men are sitting on top of each
         19  other, and that this is no good, no good.  General
         20  Mladic visited, indeed, the White House also.
         21            These are belongings of the men who were
         22  forced into that White House.
         23            That scene is filmed on the meadow of
         24  Sandici.  At this moment, this man is forced to shout
         25  the name of his son who is somewhere in the woods and

          1  bring him to surrender.
          2            These are soldiers who are guarding the
          3  prisoners, and this is most probably also at the meadow
          4  of Sandici, since there is no break in the footage.
          5  Not "most probably," it is most certainly the meadow of
          6  Sandici.  The man who is playing with the gun of this
          7  soldier is an alleged legal officer.
          8            This is a group of prisoners arriving on the
          9  meadow.  These are the hills which are south of the
         10  asphalt road of Bratunac-Konjevici.  They were shooting
         11  on the column with anti-aircraft weapons.  The shells
         12  explode when they hit the trees and then they throw
         13  shrapnel on all those beyond it.  It is totally
         14  forbidden to use these kinds of weapons on personnel.
         15  It has been a common practice throughout the war to use
         16  these weapons on them, that is, anti-personnel guns.
         17            This is the road coming from the direction of
         18  Konjevici, towards Sandici.  Sandici is in the hill
         19  just after this stretch of road; behind the hill is
         20  Sandici.  You can see abandoned clothing at the edge of
         21  the road.  People were surrendering, sometimes one
         22  individual, sometimes two, three, but the main
         23  surrenderings were massive.  Soldiers were lined up all
         24  along this stretch of road.
         25            You can see soldiers all along that stretch

          1  of road here again.  They're waiting for prisoners to
          2  surrender.
          3            In this piece of interview -- you will also,
          4  I assume, get a full translation of it -- the soldier
          5  is explaining that today they have captured between
          6  3.000 and 4.000 prisoners in this location.  The
          7  journalist asks him, "This is exaggerated," but meaning
          8  that this is a lot, and the soldier replies, "Yes.
          9  Yes, this is a lot."
         10            Here you can see the Bosnian Serb soldier
         11  next to the alleged legal officer wearing a blue
         12  helmet.
         13            This is at Sandici meadow.  Prisoners
         14  arriving from the forest.  I mean, at that moment, they
         15  become prisoners.  This man has a bloodstain on his
         16  backpack.  This man is asked by the journalist, why is
         17  he afraid, and he explains, who would not be?  In this
         18  picture, there is a dead body lying nearby, and the
         19  fact is that at this point, there was no reason to have
         20  dead bodies lying on the ground.  There is some
         21  propaganda saying that some persons who were arriving
         22  on the asphalt road, in fact, were willing to pick
         23  fights with the people guarding them, but that doesn't
         24  seem very serious.  Here is the dead body.
         25            Still the Sandici -- the arrival towards

          1  Sandici.  Most of the soldiers stripped themselves of
          2  military clothing, not to be identified as soldiers.
          3  This one is forced to take off his T-shirt.  But in the
          4  end, they will all be treated the same way, whatever
          5  kind of clothing they were wearing.
          6            The soldiers are directing the prisoners
          7  towards the meadow at this moment.
          8            This is the arrival towards the meadow,
          9  trying to take this wounded toward the meadow.  The
         10  wounded will then be put in some destroyed houses, and
         11  no one knows what will be their fate.
         12            This is a view of the hills nearby the
         13  asphalt road.
         14            This is Srebrenica town.  The town is empty.
         15  There is a car passing by with an individual flashing
         16  the Serb victory sign.  Zoran Petrovic filming dead
         17  bodies in Srebrenica town.  We don't know how these
         18  people died, if they died because of shelling or if
         19  they were executed there.
         20            This is a view of the mosque as it was when
         21  the enclave was taken by the Serb forces, filmed by
         22  Zoran Petrovic.
         23            These are women, children, and also some men
         24  arriving at the canyon in Kladanj.  This is on
         25  Muslim-held territory at that time.  We do not know if

          1  this was filmed on the 12th or the 13th.
          2            This is the arrival of members of the 28th
          3  Division who managed to break the lines at Nezuk.  As
          4  you can see, they carry their weapons.  It's an
          5  absolute fact that the enclave was not demilitarised.
          6  But only the first part of the column was organised and
          7  properly equipped.  Some weapons were among those in
          8  the huge crowd left behind, but only hunting rifles,
          9  old rifles.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         11  I think this is a convenient time to make a break.
         12            MR. HARMON:  Yes.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Would you
         14  agree?
         15            MR. HARMON:  Yes.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.
         17  We shall now make then a 20-minute break.
         18                 --- Recess taken at 12.54 p.m.
         19                 --- On resuming at 1.18 p.m.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         21  you may continue.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, let me just
         23  briefly summarise the manner which Mr. Ruez will be
         24  testifying now.  We have prepared Volume 1 of the
         25  Office of the Prosecutor exhibits.  They have been

          1  premarked.  You should have copies of those, I hope,
          2  before you or you will have them shortly.  What I
          3  propose to do is ask Mr. Ruez to proceed by each of the
          4  subparts of this exhibit.  He will enter more into the
          5  details of this particular series of events.
          6       Q.   Mr. Ruez, what I'd like you to do now is
          7  enter more into the details of the various locations
          8  that you have been discussing in your broad overview of
          9  the events that took place following the fall of
         10  Srebrenica.
         11            I have before me and you should have in front
         12  of you Prosecutor's Exhibit 4, and it is divided into
         13  subparts.  The subparts specify specific locations.
         14  What I would like you to do, first of all, is to begin
         15  with this exhibit, the first tabbed item which is
         16  Srebrenica, and I'd like you to enter into the details
         17  of that.
         18            I'm going to start my examination by
         19  tendering a film, and I'd like you to inform the Judges
         20  what the film will show them first.  Will you do that?
         21  Then I'll ask you to put on a map.
         22       A.   Sure.  The map first, the video second.
         23  First of all, the map of the area of Srebrenica.  If it
         24  does work on the ELMO -- do I have to press something?
         25       Q.   It will take care of itself.  You're fine.

          1       A.   Okay.  Sorry.
          2            MR. HARMON:  Okay.  Now, for the video booth,
          3  we're going to be playing Prosecutor's Exhibit 4/8.
          4       Q.   Could you, before we play that, Mr. Ruez,
          5  could you please explain to the Judges what it is that
          6  they will be seeing on the video?
          7       A.   Yes.  The video will be views from Srebrenica
          8  town, filmed by myself, but before -- and which will
          9  show Srebrenica town from the air first, and then it
         10  will show Srebrenica town from the road.  The aim of
         11  showing you these pictures is mainly to give you a
         12  feeling of the ground, how the place looks like.  The
         13  terrain is changing in this area significantly every
         14  30 kilometres.  The south of Srebrenica is very hilly,
         15  mountainous; the north is entering a plain.  So it is
         16  important for the good comprehension of the military
         17  operation also to know how the ground looks like.  The
         18  military operation will be developed later by someone
         19  else, but this will already give you a feeling of how
         20  the area is.
         21            You will also be able then to review these
         22  pictures and identify precise locations where the
         23  perpetrators can be seen.
         24            First of all, I start with the Exhibit
         25  number 4/A, which is the map of the area.  On the map

          1  one can already read the ground through the markings
          2  but the video will be much better for this.
          3            Another element of importance on this map is
          4  a little place that you can find just south-east of
          5  Srebrenica town.  I'm going to circle it on the
          6  exhibit.  It's Pribicevac.  Pribicevac is the location
          7  of the forward command post which was set there for the
          8  sake of the command and control of the military
          9  operation of the takeover of the enclave.
         10            Initially, the operation was not designed to
         11  take over the enclave but to shrink it to the limits of
         12  the town in a way to create a big open-air refugee
         13  centre which would then lead to the decision by the
         14  UN to evacuate the area.  It is only the 11th that the
         15  Bosnian Serb army realised that there would be no
         16  opponents to challenge their advance towards the town,
         17  that General Mladic made the decision to capture the
         18  entire enclave, and this is the location from which the
         19  operations were directed.
         20            We can now have a look at the film.  Also one
         21  important detail is to see the distance between
         22  Srebrenica and Bratunac, which is a short distance as
         23  you can see it on the map.
         24       Q.   All right.  Could the audio booth please
         25  start the film.

          1                 [Audiotape played]
          2       A.   This is the access to Srebrenica to the south
          3  of the road.  You can see here the road that is at the
          4  south of the map.  It's on top of a hill, and it will
          5  then go down to Srebrenica.  This is the road that the
          6  Bosnian Serb army took before entering the town and
          7  after capturing the observation posts south of the
          8  enclave.  So here you can see what the ground looks
          9  like.  It's a very hilly zone.
         10            The area you can see in front, these
         11  succession of hills, it's the same landscape between
         12  Srebrenica and the intersection of Konjevici.  All the
         13  ground looks the same.  It's a succession of huge
         14  hills.  This is the town sandwiched in between two
         15  hills, and from Pribicevac, one can overlook the town.
         16            This is approaching towards the centre of
         17  town.  In the middle of the picture here you don't see
         18  any more the location of the mosque.  This film is
         19  dated August 1999.  I filmed it from a helicopter.
         20  Here you can zoom-in on what is now a parking lot.  I
         21  will show you still pictures after this film.  There
         22  was then the Orthodox church.  I will show it to you on
         23  photographs.
         24            This is a soccer field.  The concrete
         25  playground here is a soccer field.  There are two

          1  soccer fields in the town, one for which we have a
          2  still photograph, and other one for which we don't
          3  have.
          4            This is the UN compound for Company B in
          5  Srebrenica town.  This is the second soccer field.  The
          6  soccer fields are important because, as Drazen
          7  Erdemovic testified, the population which was left
          8  inside the town was then directed towards the soccer
          9  field.  We have not determined with him what soccer
         10  field.  The fact is, anyhow, that we don't know what is
         11  the fate of these people who were then taken to this
         12  soccer field.
         13            This is the road coming from Potocari towards
         14  Srebrenica, and we are just at this moment passing this
         15  soccer field which is the most south of Srebrenica
         16  town.  This is filming the west part of that area.
         17            We are going right now from this soccer field
         18  towards the centre of town.  This lasts approximately,
         19  I would say, three to five minutes.
         20            The video is filmed by a colleague from the
         21  Office of the Prosecutor, Peter Nicholson.  This film
         22  is dated -- this one is dated April 1996.  So nine
         23  months after the takeover.
         24            Most of the hills are deforested.  The reason
         25  is that the only heating source inside the enclave

          1  since, in fact, 1992, before even the enclave existed,
          2  was wood.  That's why all the hills look so naked.
          3            This is the Company B, the UN compound of
          4  Srebrenica.  The guardhouse of the entrance.  The
          5  location has obviously been transformed at that moment
          6  into a depot of trash.  The town needed a severe
          7  cleaning for all these years and, in fact, the
          8  municipality was very busy and active cleaning the town
          9  still at that moment.
         10            The quality of the film is not excellent.
         11  It's super -- it's an 8-millimetre video camera, basic
         12  device, so there is no steady shot on the picture.
         13  This is the reason why the picture moves so often.
         14            One thing one can note also, not necessarily
         15  on these pictures, but we could have others that can
         16  demonstrate it, the place had been subject to quite
         17  intense shelling from time to time, but the fact is
         18  that the destructions are not extremely obvious.  Most
         19  of the buildings are standing.  Many have shrapnel
         20  traces, but it is not a destroyed area.  The situation
         21  reports number the number of shells at some point
         22  during the attack up to 200 a day.  There was intense
         23  shelling going on, but the result of it is not so
         24  obvious.
         25            This is an area where General Mladic was

          1  sighted on film, a film by RS television.  We did not
          2  show this footage in the film that we previously
          3  showed, but this is the south-west part where we can
          4  sight General Mladic, the 11th of July.
          5            THE INTERPRETER:  Could the sound volume of
          6  the film be put down, please?
          7       A.   [Previous translation continues] ... from the
          8  10th Sabotage Detachment.  This is entering the centre
          9  of Srebrenica.  The buildings on the right was made
         10  famous when General Morillon raised the UN flag on top
         11  of it.  I'm not sure if it's this one or the one next
         12  to it.
         13            This place here was the area where the red
         14  vehicle was passing in the Zoran Petrovic video.  This
         15  is leading to the marketplace where the main mosque of
         16  Srebrenica was standing in the Zoran Petrovic video.
         17  This is, as I said, footage dated April 1996.  You will
         18  see that the minaret of the mosque and the dome of the
         19  mosque have been dynamited.
         20            This road leads now to Zeleni Jadar.  We are
         21  still in Srebrenica town going to Zeleni Jadar, which
         22  is south of Srebrenica.  It is an area where we will
         23  later talk about secondary mass grave sites.  It is
         24  still a pile of trash and rubble in the town.  As I
         25  said, the cleaning process of the garbage was not over

          1  at that time.
          2            This is an area where Drazen Erdemovic put on
          3  fire a haystack to mark a position, a position of their
          4  advance.  The ones who entered the enclave were the
          5  10th Sabotage Detachment and Drina Wolves.  Both of
          6  them can be seen on pieces of footage that we have
          7  available.
          8            This is driving towards Zeleni Jadar,
          9  overlooking the town.  This is exactly the view that
         10  the Bosnian Serb army had when they arrived towards
         11  Srebrenica by road.
         12            MR. HARMON:
         13       Q.   Mr. Ruez, if you'd now proceed using the
         14  still photographs that are located in Prosecutor's
         15  Exhibit 4.  Would you kindly put them on the ELMO and
         16  explain to the Judges what they represent.  Will you
         17  move it up a little, please?  That's fine.  Thank you
         18  very much.
         19       A.   So this is -- this is a photograph from the
         20  part of the road that we have just seen, but this is a
         21  photo, not an extract from the film.  It shows just the
         22  town and how it is blocked in between those two hills.
         23            No, sorry.  There is one important detail on
         24  this one.  This is so far the only photograph we have
         25  of the concrete playground.  You can see in the centre

          1  of the picture a group of white buildings, and just at
          2  the left of these white buildings, behind them is an
          3  area of concrete.  This is the playground number 1,
          4  let's call them like this, of Srebrenica town.
          5            Exhibit number 4/2 is, for reference, a
          6  photograph of the UN compound of Srebrenica town, the
          7  Company B compound.  This is the place where the crowd
          8  of people was assembled at the beginning of the film
          9  that we showed as Exhibit number 3.
         10       Q.   Is this the location that was shelled and
         11  Muslim refugees were killed and injured?
         12       A.   Yes, definitely this is the place.
         13       Q.   Please proceed.
         14       A.   The Exhibit 4/3 is a photograph of the
         15  destroyed mosque, which I took in April 1993.  No,
         16  sorry.  This photograph is one dated January 1996.
         17  January 1996.  It was the first mission we did and
         18  where we were unable to enter Republika Srpska in
         19  company of Under-Secretary of State John Shattuck at
         20  the time.  We could visit a few of these locations and
         21  have a brief entering of Srebrenica town.  This
         22  photograph is January 1996.
         23       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, earlier in the Petrovic film
         24  that we saw, we saw a mosque that was standing up.  Is
         25  this the same mosque?

          1       A.   This is exactly the same mosque.  The only
          2  changes on this one is that as you can see here, that
          3  part is the minaret, and the dome which was on top of
          4  the mosque is now destroyed also.  These destructions
          5  are most probably caused by dynamite.
          6            Exhibit 4/4, on this exhibit you can see a
          7  view from the main mosque of Srebrenica, in the middle
          8  of the picture, and its environment.  One detail you
          9  can note on this one is that there is also another
         10  religious monument in the frame of the picture, which
         11  is the Orthodox church.
         12       Q.   When was this picture taken?
         13       A.   This picture is dated April 1996.  We have
         14  never visited the inside of the Orthodox church, but
         15  you have to know that during a certain number of years,
         16  propaganda claimed that the Orthodox church had been
         17  destroyed by the Bosniak Muslims who were inside of the
         18  enclave.  After the fact, photographs were shown now
         19  with the claim that it was not destroyed from the
         20  outside, but destroyed from the inside.  We never went
         21  to check.  The only thing we can show is this
         22  photograph that shows that the church is standing.
         23            This is another photograph, but dated 1997.
         24  The difference with the photograph dated 1996 is that
         25  you do not have any more the minaret and you do not

          1  have any more the dome on top of this rubble.
          2            Exhibit 46 is still extracted from the video
          3  that I filmed from a helicopter in August 1999, and
          4  which was shown to you at the beginning of the film on
          5  Srebrenica.  On this one, you can see at the precise
          6  location where the mosque was standing now is a
          7  concrete ground, and vehicles are parked here
          8  [indicates].  This has now been transformed into a
          9  parking lot.
         10            The next exhibit, Exhibit 47, is a view of
         11  another mosque in Srebrenica, which is on the way going
         12  to Zeleni Jadar, so very south of the town.  This
         13  picture is dated April 1996.  In January, we didn't go
         14  so far, so we don't know how it was in January, but in
         15  April 1996, at the moment the central mosque of the
         16  marketplace was dynamited, we can see that this one has
         17  suffered the same treatment as the main mosque.  We
         18  have no other pictures of this one, we just monitored
         19  the destruction of the main mosque, but this one now is
         20  exactly in the same state as the main one.  It doesn't
         21  exist anymore.
         22            These are the exhibits I wanted to show you
         23  about Srebrenica town.
         24       Q.   Mr. Ruez, is there any other detail you'd
         25  like to relate to the Court before we turn to Exhibit

          1  5, which is Potocari?
          2       A.   No.  The investigation does not focus on
          3  Srebrenica town, since the only elements we know about
          4  the situation at that time, in that place, is that
          5  people were still there.  According to Drazen
          6  Erdemovic, the people who were found in Srebrenica town
          7  were directed to the soccer field, but he never went to
          8  the soccer field so he doesn't know what was the
          9  situation there.  He describes one murder committed in
         10  Srebrenica, which was filmed by those who committed it,
         11  but we never could access that footage.
         12            For the rest, in fact, the only elements we
         13  have are the destructions of the mosques.  And it's not
         14  a full survey, we only have photographs on two
         15  mosques.  As far as I know, there were four mosques,
         16  and maybe even five mosques in Srebrenica.
         17       Q.   All right.  Mr. Ruez, let's turn our
         18  attention now to Potocari.  Would you inform the Judges
         19  of the additional details about Potocari?
         20       A.   This is Exhibit 5A, which is, in fact, a
         21  black and white photocopy of a map.  That map does not
         22  show all the buildings in Potocari, but the main ones.
         23  I will show you other products which will enable you to
         24  get familiar with the various factories.
         25            The important element in Potocari is that

          1  when all the refugees came from all the parts of the
          2  enclave towards Potocari, there was not enough space to
          3  accommodate them, and when I say "accommodate," to give
          4  some kind of shelter to them.  So they entered these
          5  factories, and the factories were completely crowded
          6  and packed with refugees.  Also, the surroundings were
          7  occupied, houses were occupied, and a lot of criminal
          8  events are described by the witnesses in Potocari.  All
          9  of them -- most of them we have only to stand on the
         10  declarations of the witnesses because we have no
         11  ability to conduct any forensics in that place.
         12            Most of the criminal events that the
         13  witnesses describe are happening in the vicinity of the
         14  factories, people taken by soldiers and led towards
         15  hidden directions, and also in little groups of houses
         16  which are in the vicinity.
         17            One important element about what happened in
         18  Potocari is that it was not -- it is not what we could
         19  really call an execution area.  In fact, murders were
         20  committed there.  Obviously, there was a kind of free
         21  possibility for either the soldiers or locals from
         22  Bratunac to come to the place and behave in the way,
         23  more or less, they wanted to behave.  So it's a very
         24  confused situation.
         25            A lot of murders are reported.  Bodies were

          1  left in the open, near water pumps, which is important
          2  information, because these bodies were not hidden, and
          3  we suppose that this was done on purpose.  The reason
          4  is that after the night spent in these factories, the
          5  main concern the next morning was to try to find water,
          6  so the women went to find water pumps in the vicinity,
          7  and you will hear many reports about dead bodies lying
          8  nearby water pumps.
          9            This situation has to be put in correlation
         10  with the official declarations of General Mladic and
         11  other officials, which is that the population was given
         12  a free choice either to stay under the protection of
         13  the army of the Republika Srpska and the police of
         14  Republika Srpska, and those who have committed no
         15  crimes have nothing to fear; either to leave, to leave
         16  either towards Muslim-held territory or towards the
         17  territory of the Federal Republic, towards Serbia; or
         18  even to go to a country of their choice, adding that
         19  there was no possibility to meet personal requirements
         20  but that that option was even open.
         21            The reality behind that alleged choice is
         22  that what happened in Potocari was designed not to
         23  exterminate the people, but to infiltrate enough terror
         24  to force them to flee the place, and you will see here
         25  that all the people there, indeed, were very eager to

          1  get on a bus and get out of this place, where they knew
          2  that they would be killed at one moment or another by
          3  staying too long.  But I am not going to develop on
          4  what the witnesses will tell you in this courtroom.
          5       Q.   Mr. Ruez, before you move the map, can you
          6  tell the Judges the approximate distance between
          7  Srebrenica and Potocari?
          8       A.   Yes.  As you can see, the distance from
          9  Srebrenica to Potocari is five kilometres on the map,
         10  roughly four to five kilometres.  Then the distance
         11  between Potocari and Bratunac is approximately three
         12  kilometres.  All these are short distances.
         13       Q.   And these squares in the map represent
         14  one-kilometre square; is that correct?
         15       A.   This is absolutely correct, yes.
         16       Q.   Please proceed, Mr. Ruez.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Mr. Harmon,
         18  sorry to interrupt you, but before we turn to the
         19  following issue, I would like to know why we are
         20  talking about Potocari, whereas the encircled place is
         21  called Pecista.
         22       A.   The reason is everyone calls this location
         23  where the factories are, everyone calls this place
         24  Potocari.  The reality is that the little hamlet of
         25  Potocari, I'm going to check in the map if it is even

          1  written on it -- yes, the little hamlet is written on
          2  it, but it is not the area of the building.  The area
          3  where the main factories are has no name.
          4            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
          5            MR. HARMON:
          6       Q.   Please continue, Mr. Ruez.  Please explain
          7  what this photograph is, if you will.
          8       A.   Exhibit 51 is an aerial photograph from
          9  Potocari, from the area where all the factories are.
         10  This photograph is a product of the US government.  All
         11  the photographs which will be coming from that source,
         12  which is, in fact, the State Department, which delivers
         13  these products to us, will have white markings on
         14  them.  You will see later that on these same products,
         15  yellow markers are added.  All the yellow markings are
         16  coming from myself; all that is white is the
         17  information provided by the US government.  This
         18  photograph is dated 13 July 1995.  One thing that we
         19  won't discuss also is the platform that took the
         20  picture, on which we have no information.
         21            Here you can see a group of buildings
         22  which -- this won't be very meaningful, which is the
         23  reason why I'm going immediately to pass to the next
         24  exhibit, which is 52, which has markings on it.
         25       Q.   Mr. Ruez, as you identify these particular

          1  locations, can you tell us very briefly what happened
          2  in each of these locations and what the significance of
          3  these buildings are?
          4       A.   So we are going to start with the UN base.
          5  The goal of this presentation is also, indeed, to get
          6  familiarised with the various buildings here.  In fact,
          7  there are not so many important buildings that the
          8  people refer to.  The main one, naturally, is the UN
          9  base.  It is circled and squared in yellow, in a yellow
         10  frame.  All this area is the area of what everyone
         11  refers to also as the Akumulator Factory, which is a
         12  former battery factory for ships, and maybe other
         13  devices.  But it is, in fact, the UN base.
         14            In this compound, about 5.000 refugees
         15  managed to find shelter on the 11th.  Despite Mladic's
         16  instruction, order, not to accept any refugees inside
         17  the compound, Dutch officers decided to open a fence in
         18  a little hidden part of that compound so that refugees
         19  could get in, and 5.000 of them could enter.
         20  Unfortunately, at some point, the factory was full of
         21  people and the order came out not to accept any more
         22  refugees inside of it.  So once this factory was
         23  totally filled in with refugees, other factories
         24  started to get occupied.
         25            The Blue Factory is not referred to by people

          1  for the simple reason that as soon as the Bosnian Serb
          2  army arrived in the location, they took possession of
          3  this factory and they taped around it; no one could
          4  approach.  We don't know what happened inside, no one
          5  is in a position to tell us at this point, but no
          6  refugees was inside this factory.  It is called the
          7  Blue Factory; it's a generic name that everyone used
          8  for it because the building is blue, and I will show
          9  you that on photographs where you can see the colour of
         10  it.
         11            Just in front of the Blue Factory, parallel
         12  to the asphalt road, is a building which is referred to
         13  as the Faros Building, because it is written on it,
         14  "Faros," it was the name of the company.  It's not a
         15  factory, it's an administrative building.
         16            On the top of the picture, which is, in fact,
         17  south, going south, we have the Express Bus Compound.
         18  This is the compound of a bus company.  The white
         19  little bars that you can see in the vicinity are
         20  destroyed buses.  This is an important location.  You
         21  will see it in the film which was taken at the time of
         22  the events, either by RS news or by Mr. Zoran
         23  Petrovic.  This place was absolutely packed with
         24  people.
         25            Several witnesses talk about groups of

          1  soldiers getting inside this compound by night and
          2  flashing lights on people to identify them, and
          3  separating men out of the crowd of refugees and taking
          4  them in unknown directions.  It is also the location
          5  where people talk about desperate individuals, scared
          6  of the way they will die, who committed suicide.  One
          7  body was found in a little side room, which is behind
          8  the factory, he had hung himself in that room.
          9            On the top of the picture, but unfortunately
         10  under the white frame here [indicates], is another
         11  little group of factories which you will see from other
         12  pictures.  But their names are of interest because the
         13  witnesses will refer to them as well.
         14            One is the building of Energoinvest, and the
         15  other one, which was also absolutely packed with
         16  refugees, is the factory of 11 of March, "11 of March"
         17  being the name of the factory.  We will return to that
         18  specific factory for the reason that I told you that we
         19  could not conduct forensics about criminal events which
         20  happened in this place, this is a fact, but we have a
         21  very compelling story from one witness, and we found
         22  elements on the ground which we believe entitle us to
         23  give credit to this witness.  We will talk about that
         24  at a later stage.  But this is the location where the
         25  events will happen, in the vicinity of 11 of March

          1  Factory.
          2            And the factory south of it, the Zinc
          3  Factory, this is a huge building.  This was also
          4  crowded with refugees, and separations took place also
          5  in this one.  It's always the same process:  a group of
          6  soldiers getting in and selecting men or taking people
          7  out.  Murders were committed behind these factories.
          8  You will hear about them, depending on the will of
          9  these witnesses to come and testify.
         10            A very important feature seen on this
         11  photograph is the White House.  Behind it is the
         12  electrical station.  It was marked because it is just
         13  near it.  We have no elements about what happened
         14  there, and we forgot to mark -- we will probably need
         15  to add that -- an arrow on this building here
         16  [indicates], which is a building we call the Blue
         17  Building.  Everyone refers to it like this.  So we have
         18  two blue buildings; one is the Blue Factory, not to be
         19  confused with the Blue Building, which is much smaller,
         20  as you will see on other photographs.
         21            The Blue Building is the location where the
         22  water tank is on the live footages which can be seen at
         23  the time of the events.  This is where Zoran Petrovic
         24  addresses a Dutch officer, asking him, "What is going
         25  on here?"

          1            The White House is probably the most
          2  important element in this picture.  This is the
          3  location where the men were taken after separation.
          4  You will see in a close-up that this little group of
          5  black things here on the picture [indicates] is the
          6  crowd which is building up at the location where the
          7  separation line is.  The men who were then separated
          8  here [indicates] walked along the buses, as we could
          9  see on the Zoran Petrovic film, the reason why we can
         10  hardly say in the Zoran Petrovic film that these men
         11  were, in fact, getting out of the White House to be
         12  loaded on buses or if they were coming from the
         13  separation line and led towards the White House.  It's
         14  one solution or another.  But this is the location
         15  where the men were detained and where Mladic went to
         16  see how they were doing inside.
         17            Major Kingori, the military observer who was
         18  present in that location, also had an opportunity to
         19  visit the inside of this White House and witness the
         20  condition of the people inside.
         21            I am done with this one.
         22            This is Exhibit 53, which is a blow-up of the
         23  previous picture, or of another one, I can't say,
         24  because one has an hour, the other one has none.  This
         25  picture is dated 1400 hours, 13 July 1995.  I won't

          1  make the comments on the 11th before showing you the
          2  next exhibit which has all the markings on it.
          3            So we pass immediately to Exhibit 54.  Here
          4  again we can have as a reference the Blue Factory.
          5  Just in front of the Blue Factory, the building Faros,
          6  which is not marked here, and just on the opposite
          7  side, you have the White House.  Next to the house is a
          8  bus, which most probably is there to collect prisoners
          9  who are still inside the house.
         10            At that time of the day the evacuation was
         11  not over, and still some number of men were present in
         12  the area.  So this is a problem we had with the
         13  computer.  The computer never accepted to print out
         14  properly this part.  We'll have to redo one probably.
         15  This is written "people" here.  That circle is a crowd
         16  of people.  This area here is visible on the Zoran
         17  Petrovic film.  This is the location or the area where
         18  the day before General Mladic was addressing the
         19  crowd.  This is where his bodyguards were handing over
         20  chocolate bars to the children.
         21            Just behind this crowd is a separation line,
         22  which was also visible on the footage that we saw, just
         23  a rope across the street.  UN soldiers were at this
         24  line in order to make some order in the situation, but
         25  the ones who were ruling the show there was the Bosnian

          1  Serb army, who did, in fact, exactly what they wanted.
          2  The UN soldiers were stripped of their equipment
          3  quickly, and on the 13th, no one was in a situation to
          4  oppose what was going on, and the separation was still
          5  ongoing that day.
          6            As you can see, there is a mixture of
          7  vehicles going up and collecting the people.  You have
          8  trucks and buses.  The water tank is marked again on
          9  this one.  What else.
         10            Yes.  Then I'm going to start talking about
         11  another -- no.  No.  Sorry.
         12            On this one also I have marked several things
         13  that we won't have pictures after that to show, but
         14  here we're already entering, in fact, one criminal
         15  situation.
         16            We have several features that we can see
         17  here, a little wooden share which is at the edge of the
         18  zinc factory, another shed which is not visible on the
         19  photograph because it's under the tree line, which is
         20  on a hill behind this factory.
         21            We have this house here, and in front of it
         22  is a cornfield, which on the photograph one can see
         23  that it is a grown-up, grown cornfield.  The black line
         24  you can see here is the corn, high corn.  The little
         25  white spot which is inside the corn is a vehicle, a

          1  car.  I will have to return on that a bit later.
          2            Exhibit number 5/5 is a photograph extracted
          3  from the video film from the helicopter in October 1999
          4  and shows some of the buildings that we had on these
          5  aerial black and white photographs.  These ones are not
          6  marked yet.
          7            This is the zinc factory.
          8       Q.   For the record, you're pointing to the long
          9  rectangle building on the left-hand side of the road as
         10  you look directly at the photograph?
         11       A.   Yes.  At the bottom right of the picture, on
         12  the east part of the asphalt road that goes from
         13  Bratunac to Srebrenica, you have the Express compound
         14  building.  The location where I was talking about, the
         15  body which was found hanged, is in this little
         16  extension of the building.
         17       Q.   When you say "this," you're referring to the
         18  long, rectangular, white building on the right-hand
         19  side of the road; is that correct?
         20       A.   This is correct.  The White Building which is
         21  the Express compound, the bus compound.
         22            You can also see on this photograph, on the
         23  road just in the direction of Srebrenica, which on this
         24  photograph is on the right, you have a group of trees
         25  here.  This is the location where General Mladic was

          1  giving his interview and where his bodyguards were
          2  handing over candies to the children.  You can see also
          3  that just in between the road -- the trees are in
          4  between houses.  And the road, this is a kind of
          5  construction where, in the Zoran Petrovic film, we
          6  could see refugees assembled, and men among them,
          7  sitting, and one individual, who was wearing a purple
          8  bandanna on his head, was looking at the refugees
          9  behind the fence.
         10            We will return at some point one day on this
         11  individual who is a very interesting man for this
         12  investigation.
         13       Q.   Now, Mr. Ruez, just so the record is
         14  perfectly clear, when you referred to trees where
         15  General Mladic gave his interview, you're referring to
         16  the large clump of trees that appear in this picture in
         17  the upper right-hand corner.  They appear to bisect or
         18  block the road; is that correct?
         19       A.   That is correct, yes.  Thank you for the
         20  precision of the description.
         21            Behind these trees, on the top right part of
         22  the photograph, are two buildings of interest.  One
         23  is -- we cannot see his colour on this photograph, but
         24  we will see other photographs of it.  It's the Blue
         25  Building.  It's the one we call the Blue Building,

          1  which is the location where the water tank was
          2  positioned.
          3            These reference points will be important
          4  later on in order to pinpoint precise locations where
          5  people were.  We will use them as a reference point to
          6  identify both the fact that this is the location and
          7  the precise spot.
          8            On this same photograph, the last building
          9  one can see on the upper part of the picture totally at
         10  the top right, the White Building.  This is the
         11  so-called White House in which the prisoners were
         12  assembled prior to being transported towards Bratunac.
         13            One additional comment.  Also on this
         14  picture, one can see also the other little
         15  constructions which are the houses in the vicinity.
         16  The fact is that the main crowd of refugees was
         17  occupying the factories, but as I told you, also the
         18  houses were occupied, and you might face the situation
         19  where people will talk about criminal events in the
         20  vicinity of these houses, because the fact is that
         21  these type of reports are scattered, and we have a lot
         22  of difficulties at this point to identify precisely
         23  where.
         24            Another thing that I have to tell you and
         25  admit, in fact, is that the investigation on the events

          1  in Potocari is the weak point of this investigation.
          2  The reason is that we have spent most of our time
          3  reconstructing the main criminal events, which are the
          4  massive executions.  We did not have time yet to
          5  finalise the investigation on Potocari.  This is
          6  something still ongoing.  We will do it at the moment
          7  the trial continues.
          8            Exhibit 5/6 is a view from the hill which is
          9  just behind --
         10       Q.   Mr. Ruez, let me just interrupt you for a
         11  moment.  Perhaps we have different exhibits.  The 5/6
         12  that I'm holding has a different set of buildings on
         13  it.
         14       A.   I have this one.
         15       Q.   Perhaps they have been misidentified.  Go in
         16  whatever order you like, but since you're using the
         17  official Court copy -- let me just pause for a moment.
         18  That's marked 5/19 in the copy that I have.  So we're
         19  perfectly clear and we're operating off the same
         20  photograph, I will change this to 5/6.
         21       A.   So this picture is taken from mid-height of a
         22  hill which is behind the Zinc Factory.  The view is
         23  turning towards the north, north-east.  The asphalt
         24  road going --

          1  Mr. Harmon, which number is this photograph exhibit
          2  number?
          3            MR. HARMON:  In my binder, it was originally
          4  5/19, but since Mr. Ruez is testifying from the
          5  official Court exhibits, it should be 5/6 and should be
          6  marked accordingly.  So in your copy perhaps it is
          7  5/19.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
          9            MR. HARMON:
         10       Q.   Mr. Ruez, please continue.
         11       A.   So on this photograph, the interesting
         12  elements are, again in the very centre of the picture,
         13  the Blue Building.  On this one, one can this time
         14  clearly see that it is blue, the small one which is
         15  right in the centre.  The fact is that from this angle,
         16  this building seems melded with the one behind it,
         17  which is not the case.  The one just behind it is the
         18  Feros Building.  Behind the Feros Building, the huge
         19  blue structure is the so-called Blue Factory.
         20            On the left of the Blue Factory is the
         21  Akumulator Factory, which is the UN compound.  One
         22  important element on the UN compound is this
         23  structure.  On top of it, this is the watchtower of the
         24  compound.  This is a photograph dated June 1996.
         25            The next exhibit number is 5/7.

          1       Q.   That may be marked in your exhibits as 5/9.
          2  So just wait a minute, Mr. Ruez.  We will make sure
          3  that we all have the same exhibits.
          4       A.   Do you know what?
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I believe
          6  it is 5/7, which before that was numbered differently.
          7  It said 5/15 before.  These are the numbers that we see
          8  here.
          9            MR. HARMON:  Well, obviously in preparation
         10  for today and with the massive amount of exhibits,
         11  there has been some confusion.  I apologise.  We
         12  will -- if I could just have a moment with my
         13  assistant, perhaps we could resolve this.
         14       A.   You have a good order.  I have a wrong one.
         15            MR. HARMON:
         16       Q.   Mr. Ruez, we're going to give you a different
         17  set of these.
         18       A.   Now -- mine are mixed, in fact.
         19       Q.   Don't despair.  So are mine.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Now there
         21  is no problem.  We are now with 5/7, and I believe it
         22  is this one.
         23            MR. HARMON:
         24       Q.   Mr. Ruez, if you can put your set that you're
         25  working with aside, we'll clear your desk, and you can

          1  testify off of the set that I've just handed you.
          2  There are two loose pictures that I have taken out of
          3  sleeves, but they have numbers that may correspond to
          4  the numbers being used by the Judges.
          5       A.   Okay.  I'm just a bit confused now.  Is this
          6  the one we have shown?
          7       Q.   I believe we're going to 5/7.
          8       A.   Which one is the one I'm supposed to put on
          9  it?
         10       Q.   Mr. Ruez, proceed in the order that you want
         11  to proceed in and just identify the photograph as we
         12  progress through them.
         13       A.   This is one we are currently working on?
         14            THE REGISTRAR:  Yes, this one.
         15            MR. HARMON:  Perhaps, Mr. President, this
         16  might be an appropriate time to take a break, conclude
         17  for the day if it's possible.  We can sort this out.
         18  We'll be far more efficient tomorrow.
         19            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I think
         20  this is a good proposal.  We can adjourn for the day
         21  and then resume tomorrow after you organise things
         22  better.  Of course, you are doing your work, and you
         23  will do it as you like, but tomorrow morning we shall
         24  meet once again at 9.30.  Until tomorrow.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Thank you.

          1                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned
          2                 at 2.18 p.m., to be reconvened on
