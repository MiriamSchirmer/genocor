          2                 [Open session]
          3                 [The witness entered court]
          4                 [The accused entered court]
          5                 --- Upon commencing at 9.35 a.m.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
          7  morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Are the interpreters
          8  here?  Yes.  I am glad that you are still well and
          9  kicking.  Good morning to the Prosecution and the
         10  Defence, Mr. Krstic, the Court reporters, and the
         11  witness, who is here too.  Good morning.  Have you had
         12  a good rest, Witness?
         13            THE WITNESS:  Yes, thank you.  Good morning.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] And are you
         15  feeling well?
         16            THE WITNESS:  Yes, thank you.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So we're
         18  going to resume our hearing with your testimony, and it
         19  is Mr. McCloskey who is going to continue with the
         20  questions.  You have the floor, sir.
         21            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         22                 WITNESS:  WITNESS L [Resumed]
         23                 Examined by Mr. McCloskey: [Cont'd]
         24       Q.   Witness L, yesterday we left off where you
         25  came to the execution area with a small group of fellow

          1  Muslim men and were shot down and you were lying in the
          2  field listening to things.  Can you tell us, as you lay
          3  there after your fellows had been shot, what you heard
          4  happening around you as the time went on?
          5       A.   When the men had been killed, I heard a group
          6  getting together who called each other by name, and
          7  they were talking.  I then recognised one of them
          8  called Gojko Simic, who used to work with me in the
          9  same company for at least 15 years.
         10       Q.   Now, let me ask you about that.  You say you
         11  saw -- or you say, excuse me, you heard men speaking.
         12  Were those -- how do you know they weren't Muslim men
         13  that had survived?
         14       A.   I know because they called each other by
         15  name.
         16       Q.   And what names did you hear them call each
         17  other?
         18       A.   I heard Gojko, Vojo, Risto, and they called
         19  another one by nickname, but I haven't remembered that
         20  nickname.
         21       Q.   And how long did you have a chance to hear
         22  these men speaking to each other?
         23       A.   For about five minutes.
         24       Q.   And were you able to hear the voice of the
         25  person -- of the various people clearly?

          1       A.   Yes.  I heard this one in particular, the one
          2  I knew.  He said that he should kiss those of us who
          3  had been killed because he thought we were all dead.
          4       Q.   How was it that you were able to recognise
          5  Gojko's voice?
          6       A.   Because I knew him for many years, and his
          7  voice was typical.  He didn't have a very clear way of
          8  expressing himself.  There was a lisp in his voice.
          9       Q.   How did you know him from?
         10       A.   I knew him because we worked in the same
         11  company and we also come from the same municipality.
         12       Q.   Do you know where he was from, what village?
         13       A.   The village of Orahovac, Zvornik
         14  municipality, and Grbovci and Orahovac belong to the
         15  same local community, I think.
         16       Q.   Do you know how many years ago you worked
         17  with him in the company in Belgrade?
         18       A.   I think from 1977 until 1992.
         19       Q.   What was your connection with him at the
         20  company?  Were you equal workers or what?
         21       A.   We were both of the same occupation.  We
         22  never argued.  We were always on good terms with one
         23  another.
         24       Q.   And were you friends?  Did you see each other
         25  socially?

          1       A.   We did.  We were acquaintances at work, but
          2  we never visited one another, because we lived quite a
          3  way away from one another.
          4       Q.   When was the last time you had actually seen
          5  him before the war?
          6       A.   In 1992, on the 3rd of April, when I left
          7  Belgrade.
          8       Q.   Could you describe Gojko Simic for us?  What
          9  did he look like?
         10       A.   Gojko Simic was rather like me by height,
         11  perhaps a little lower.  He had more hair than me.  He
         12  had two golden teeth.  He was fair.
         13            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Can we show the witness
         14  Exhibit 100?  And could we put it on the ELMO so we can
         15  point it out?
         16            THE REGISTRAR:  It is a protected witness, so
         17  there could be a problem if you place the photograph on
         18  the ELMO.
         19            MR. McCLOSKEY:  The people in the photographs
         20  are not protected, but thank you for your --
         21       Q.   All right.  And let me ask you the question.
         22  Can you -- I've shown you this photograph within the
         23  last day or two and asked you to point out Gojko
         24  Simic.  Were you able to do that when I asked you to do
         25  it?

          1       A.   Yes.
          2       Q.   Again, could you point out the person that
          3  you recognise as Gojko Simic?
          4       A.   [Indicates]
          5       Q.   Okay.  Thank you.
          6            MR. McCLOSKEY:  For the record, that was the
          7  middle person in the bottom row.  Thank you.
          8       Q.   And prior to hearing the soldiers speaking,
          9  referring to themselves -- or referring to each other
         10  as Gojko, Vojo, and Risto, did you hear the sounds of
         11  any equipment or anything besides the trucks that were
         12  dropping off victims?
         13       A.   Yes.  To the left there was a dredger, we
         14  used to call it, excavating machine, that was digging a
         15  hole.
         16       Q.   Okay.  Now, as you're listening to Gojko and
         17  the others talk, could you get an idea of how many were
         18  in the group?
         19       A.   According to my judgement, because three of
         20  them were left behind when they went off to another
         21  place to kill some more, there were several of them.
         22       Q.   Can you tell us what else you heard this
         23  small group of soldiers talking about as you were lying
         24  nearby?
         25       A.   When they got together, close to this

          1  earth-moving machine, all of them wanted to go to the
          2  meadow to kill people.  That is what they said.  Then
          3  the person driving the machine said, "If you turn off
          4  the machine, I will go with you.  I don't want to go on
          5  working."  And then Gojko Simic said, "Collect your
          6  ammunition and let's go to the meadow to kill the men,"
          7  the meadow from which the hay had been collected.  When
          8  he left, three Serb soldiers stayed behind.
          9       Q.   Now, were you able to see any of this, or
         10  were you just hearing this?
         11       A.   I could only discern them in the dark.  I
         12  couldn't really see them, it was dark.
         13       Q.   Is there any doubt in your mind that the
         14  voice you heard was that of Gojko Simic?
         15       A.   There is no doubt in my mind.  I am 100 per
         16  cent sure.
         17       Q.   Could you tell from the discussions that you
         18  heard who was in charge of this small group of
         19  soldiers?
         20       A.   According to what he said, the order was to
         21  collect the ammunition and to go to the meadow.  So
         22  judging by that, I conclude that he was the leader.
         23       Q.   That Gojko Simic was the leader?
         24       A.   Yes, yes.
         25       Q.   Now, I want to direct to you a time that you

          1  provided a statement to Jean-Rene Ruez.  And I notice
          2  in your statement it says that, "I saw a group of seven
          3  or eight men who obviously did the shooting.  They were
          4  standing not far away from the backhoe and were dressed
          5  in camouflage uniforms."
          6            Can you tell us, did you actually see them or
          7  did you just hear them?  Can you explain that?
          8       A.   I only heard them, I didn't see them.
          9       Q.   Okay.  And then after that there's a
         10  statement that says, "Among them, I'm absolutely sure
         11  that I recognised a Serb who used to work with me.  His
         12  name is Gojko Simic."  Now, the term "recognised" --
         13       A.   I told you, I recognised him by his voice and
         14  by the name I heard called out.
         15       Q.   What happened after the discussions that the
         16  soldiers had among themselves where they talked about
         17  going over to another field?  What's the next thing you
         18  recall happening?
         19       A.   When they left, the loader came with the
         20  lights on.  The excavator had the lights on too, but
         21  they were turned in the opposite direction.  When this
         22  loader came, it stopped next to the backhoe and the two
         23  of them talked.  I didn't hear what they said.  Then
         24  the person who was probably closest to the loader and
         25  who was still alive, he jumped off and ran into the

          1  woods.
          2            They shot after him and the person on the
          3  loader turned the lights around towards the woods,
          4  probably to light him up, and at that moment, I moved.
          5  He cried out, "Here's another man who's escaping."  I
          6  looked around a little bit but they weren't going
          7  towards me.
          8            So crawling, I reached the embankment next to
          9  the rail track.  I looked around, no one was following
         10  me.  When I jumped to my feet, I had to run up hill.
         11  It was like going up to the first floor, but it could
         12  have been the embankment along the rail track.
         13            I know that they fired some shots, but I
         14  didn't feel any bullets close to me, nor was I hit,
         15  luckily.
         16            I ran across the rails, I fell over the other
         17  side, then I got up again.  There was a cornfield
         18  there.
         19       Q.   Let me ask you a couple of questions if I
         20  could.  Can you tell me when you were first able to
         21  actually see anything?
         22       A.   When I took the blindfold off.
         23       Q.   When was that in relation to the events that
         24  you've described?
         25       A.   It could have been two or three hours after

          1  this tragedy.  When it was really dark and they had
          2  moved away from me, I took off the blindfold and I
          3  crawled from under the bodies that were on top of me.
          4       Q.   And were you able to actually see these
          5  machines that you've talked about with their lights on?
          6       A.   The machine that came with the lights on, it
          7  arrived just before I was -- I got up and ran away
          8  whereas the excavator was probably there before I had
          9  arrived, and its lights were turned in the opposite
         10  direction so that the back side of the machine was
         11  facing us.
         12       Q.   But were you actually able to see those
         13  machines without your blindfold on when you crawled out
         14  from under the bodies?
         15       A.   Yes, yes.
         16       Q.   The excavator you're talking about or
         17  backhoe, did that have tracks on it or wheels or what?
         18       A.   Wheels.
         19       Q.   Okay.  Can you describe it, as best you can,
         20  this thing you are calling an excavator?
         21       A.   You mean the loader?  It was yellow; because
         22  building machinery in our country were, as a rule,
         23  yellow in colour the trademark was  KU 150.
         24       Q.   Okay.  Now you've described something that
         25  was called an excavator and you've described something

          1  that you called a loader.  Those were the two machines
          2  that you've talked about; is that right?
          3       A.   Yes.
          4       Q.   So what did the loader look like besides
          5  being yellow?
          6       A.   In front, it had the actual loader to collect
          7  the material.
          8       Q.   That's like a big bucket that can scoop up
          9  material and load it in the back of a truck; is that
         10  right?
         11       A.   Yes.
         12       Q.   The excavator, can you describe what the
         13  excavator looked like, how it was different from the
         14  loader?
         15       A.   The excavator has a longer fork and it is
         16  used for digging big holes in the ground.
         17       Q.   It has a big, long arm that can bend and has
         18  a bucket in the bottom of it and usually digs by
         19  pulling it backwards; is that right?
         20       A.   Yes.  It goes like this and then it turns
         21  backwards towards itself again.
         22       Q.   You had described your narrow escape from
         23  this immediate spot.  Can you go on and continue to
         24  tell us where you went?
         25       A.   When I ran into the corn half way, I went

          1  upright and then I fell down to the ground, afraid of
          2  rifle fire.  So on all fours, I went through the corn
          3  and then I arrived in an area where I could hear water,
          4  but I couldn't see it.
          5            Serb soldiers that were left behind, they
          6  fired a few shots into the maize and I heard a few
          7  words exchanged.
          8            Further down, I only heard the shooting.
          9  When silence fell, I started thinking where I should go
         10  because I didn't know where I was as I was brought
         11  there blindfolded.
         12            I got up and started walking.  When I came
         13  out of the corn, I was terribly afraid I might come
         14  across them somewhere.  So I climbed on to the rail
         15  track and started walking along it slowly.
         16            I reached a railway station.  There was an
         17  office that was open there.  There was nothing inside.
         18  So I concluded I was going in the wrong direction.  I
         19  could see a village down there.  Then I went back
         20  again.  I retraced my steps and I kept thinking where I
         21  should go.
         22            I came across a road where I saw that other
         23  location where men had been executed in the meadow.  It
         24  seemed to me that one of them showed signs of life, but
         25  there was no hope.  He was squealing like an animal,

          1  and he was slightly removed from the others.  I still
          2  didn't know where I was.  So I thought I should go into
          3  the woods.
          4       Q.   Let me ask you some questions, excuse me.
          5            Now, when you left that railway station, you
          6  started walking back in the original direction had you
          7  come from; is that right?
          8       A.   No, I was going the other way because I know
          9  if I went along the rail track to the right, I would be
         10  going to the same place and if I go left, I would be
         11  going in the opposite direction.
         12       Q.   But you were generally heading in a similar
         13  direction as to where you came from but not precisely
         14  back to where you had been shot at; is that right?
         15       A.   Yes.  Yes, yes.  I was going back in the
         16  direction from which they had brought us.  But if you
         17  cross to the other side, if you take the left tracks,
         18  you go towards Grbovci, and if you take the right-hand
         19  tracks you were going to the opposite direction.
         20       Q.   Now, when you came back to the area where
         21  this man was still dying, was it still dark out?
         22       A.   It was.  It was still dark.
         23       Q.   Did you see any soldiers or any equipment
         24  around this one spot?
         25       A.   No, I didn't see any equipment.

          1       Q.   Were you able to make out anything in the
          2  darkness about how many people were on this field?
          3       A.   There were a lot of bodies and clothes.
          4  There was moonlight so I could see them, but I didn't
          5  get closer than 20 metres away so I couldn't tell you
          6  how many there were.
          7       Q.   Could you tell where this field was in
          8  relation to the field where you had been shot at and
          9  shot down with the others?
         10       A.   It wasn't very far, maybe 100 or 200 metres
         11  only.  It was on one side of the track.
         12       Q.   This second site that --
         13       A.   There was a stream nearby.
         14       Q.   So this second site that you saw was on the
         15  other side of the railroad tracks from the area that
         16  you had been shot down?
         17       A.   Yes, yes.  On the other side, yes.
         18       Q.   This summer,  did you have a chance to go
         19  back to this area with Mr. Ruez and the investigative
         20  team?
         21       A.   I did.
         22       Q.   And the place that -- Mr. Ruez first took you
         23  to the school, didn't he?
         24       A.   Yes, he did.
         25       Q.   The school that he took you to, did you

          1  recognise it?
          2       A.   I did recognise it.
          3       Q.   Did you have a chance to go in it, into the
          4  gym?
          5       A.   I entered the gym, yes.
          6       Q.   Was that the place Mr. Ruez took you, the
          7  school in the gym, the same place that the Serb
          8  soldiers had taken you back in July of 1995?
          9       A.   Yes, it is the same gym and the same school.
         10  Everything was the same.
         11       Q.   Okay.  Now, after Mr. Ruez took you to the
         12  school, did he take you out to some fields nearby?
         13       A.   He did.
         14       Q.   Did you recognise those fields that
         15  Mr. Ruez took you to?
         16       A.   Well, I did, because there's the field and
         17  the maize, and the maize was still there.  Maybe this
         18  autumn somebody cut it, but the old maize is still
         19  there.
         20       Q.   What other distinctive features did you
         21  notice this summer when you went back with Mr. Ruez,
         22  that you recognised from your experience?
         23       A.   As I said, my assessment was that there was
         24  this slope I had to climb to reach the rail tracks, and
         25  I recognised that too.

          1       Q.   Did you see railroad tracks at this site this
          2  summer?
          3       A.   Yes, I did see the railway tracks.
          4       Q.   And the site where you were shot down, was
          5  that closer to the asphalt road or farther away than
          6  the other site?
          7       A.   Further aside from the road, on the other
          8  side of the tracks.  They were on the other location,
          9  on the mown meadow, which was closer to the road.
         10       Q.   And after -- let me take you back now to July
         11  of 1995.  It's still dark out.  You've just come across
         12  this other field of bodies.  Were you able to escape
         13  into the night and later escape to the free territory?
         14       A.   No, I didn't escape to the free territory on
         15  that night.
         16       Q.   How many days did it take you wandering
         17  through the woods until you were able to escape to the
         18  free territory?
         19       A.   I could have reached the area within two
         20  hours, if I had known, if I had known it, if I had
         21  known my way, but I kept wandering for at least ten
         22  days.
         23       Q.   And then did you finally make it?
         24       A.   Yes, thank God.
         25       Q.   Were you by yourself the whole time or did
          1  you have any -- run into any company, any friendly
          2  company, that is?
          3       A.   I was by myself all the time.
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you very much.  I have
          5  no further questions.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          7  Mr. McCloskey.
          8            Witness L, now you are going to answer
          9  questions that will be put to you by Mr. Petrusic, who
         10  is representing the Defence in this case.
         11            Mr. Petrusic, you have the floor.
         12            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Good morning,
         13  Your Honours; good morning, my colleagues.
         14                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         15       Q.   Good morning, Witness L.  Witness L, while
         16  you were living in Srebrenica, you were not engaged in
         17  the military in any way?
         18       A.   No, I wasn't.
         19       Q.   Were you living together with your brother?
         20       A.   Yes, we lived together; not before the war,
         21  but after the war, yes.
         22       Q.   Your brother was in the military; he was
         23  there as a cook?
         24       A.   Yes, he was.
         25       Q.   Witness L, if you could please pause before

          1  you answer my question, because there are interpreters
          2  who have to interpret everything we say here.
          3       A.   Yes, I'll do that.
          4       Q.   Did you ever hear from your brother about a
          5  possible fall of Srebrenica?
          6       A.   No, I didn't hear anything from him.  Nobody
          7  knew five or six days before it happened that it would
          8  fall.
          9       Q.   On the 6th of July the shelling started.  Did
         10  people at that moment start to talk about the fall of
         11  Srebrenica?
         12       A.   No, they did not.
         13       Q.   So on the 11th of July you reached Susnjari?
         14       A.   Yes.
         15       Q.   You said in evidence that the commanders had
         16  decided that you should go through the woods.
         17       A.   Yes.
         18       Q.   Could you tell us whether they were military
         19  commanders?
         20       A.   There were both military commanders and
         21  personnel who was working at the Srebrenica
         22  municipality.  They were also some kind of commanders.
         23       Q.   So would that include both political and
         24  military leaders of the municipality?
         25       A.   Yes, it would.

          1       Q.   Did they say anything about the population,
          2  the people who were supposed to go to Potocari and the
          3  people who were supposed to go to the woods?
          4       A.   No, they didn't say anything about that, but
          5  we knew that Srebrenica had over 40.000 inhabitants,
          6  and therefore I think that there were about 15.000
          7  able-bodied men, including young men, who didn't dare
          8  go to Potocari.
          9       Q.   After you had spent the night between the
         10  12th and the 13th of July somewhere in the woods around
         11  the area of Buljim you surrendered on the 13th of July,
         12  around 3.00 in the afternoon, to the VRS soldiers?
         13       A.   Yes, I did.
         14       Q.   Your column, according to what you have said,
         15  had about 200 people?
         16       A.   According to my estimate, my column had about
         17  400 people, but not everybody came with me; some people
         18  had arrived even before, and they kept coming
         19  afterwards as well.
         20       Q.   In the evening, after General Mladic had
         21  spoken to you, and before the buses and trucks had
         22  arrived, the buses that you later on boarded to go in
         23  the direction of Bratunac, how many people could have
         24  been on that meadow at that time?
         25       A.   At least 2.000 people.  The meadow was

          1  crowded with people.  People were sitting next to each
          2  other.  There were between 30 and 40 rows -- the rows
          3  were between 30 and 40 meters long.
          4       Q.   According to your knowledge, did everybody go
          5  in the direction of Bratunac?
          6       A.   No, not everybody did.
          7       Q.   You were in the trailer of one of the
          8  trucks.  Could you tell us how many people were put on
          9  the buses and trucks at that point in time, when you
         10  sat out?
         11       A.   No, I couldn't tell you anything about that.
         12  I didn't know how many people there were.  I don't
         13  remember the figures.  The moment I entered the truck,
         14  I didn't know what was happening with other people.  My
         15  brother had stayed behind, and I never saw him after
         16  that.
         17       Q.   Witness L, as you were coming down the hill,
         18  going towards the road where you eventually
         19  surrendered, did you notice any vehicles?
         20       A.   We saw several artillery vehicles, two or
         21  three of them, when we reached the road.  There was an
         22  APC near the place where we were, and that's all, aside
         23  from the buses and trucks that kept passing by carrying
         24  women and children to Tuzla.
         25       Q.   Let me go back to the meadow for a second.

          1  Could you observe any other groups of people from the
          2  spot where you were?
          3       A.   No.  I could only see that one group of
          4  people.
          5       Q.   You saw some insignia, some patches with
          6  Republika Srpska Army letters written on it?
          7       A.   Well, we saw one person wearing a kind of
          8  black scarf.  He seemed to be in charge, and he was the
          9  one who told us that we would be exchanged.  And he had
         10  a white patch on his sleeve, with letters VRS,
         11  Republika Srpska Army, on it.
         12       Q.   In addition to the letters, Armija Republika
         13  Srpska, was there anything else on that patch?
         14       A.   I think that they had the four letters S, but
         15  it was difficult for me to observe that.  And also
         16  their patches seemed to be damaged.
         17       Q.   Witness L, you testified that there were four
         18  young boys in the gymnasium.
         19       A.   Yes.
         20       Q.   Do you know what happened to them?
         21       A.   Those children were set free, because after I
         22  had reached the free territory I inquired about the
         23  release of the four young boys, and they told me that
         24  they had been released.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]

          1  Mr. Petrusic, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I can see
          2  in the transcript that the witness has mentioned four
          3  letters S.  In the French interpretation I was told
          4  that the letters were written in Cyrillic alphabet,
          5  which I cannot see in the English transcript.  Yes, but
          6  I still think it's very important.  Perhaps,
          7  Mr. Petrusic, you could ask the witness if the letters
          8  were written in Cyrillic alphabet or in Latin
          9  alphabet.  I think it is important, so if you could
         10  please do that, Mr. Petrusic.
         11            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         12  Mr. President.  I will heed your advice and I will ask
         13  the witness about it.
         14       Q.   Witness L, you mentioned four letters S.
         15  Were they written in Cyrillic or Latin alphabet?
         16       A.   Serbs always used Cyrillic alphabet.  Even
         17  their registration plates were in Cyrillic letters.
         18  And it was actually the first time that I saw
         19  registration plates in Cyrillic alphabet, which had not
         20  been the case before the war.
         21       Q.   You mentioned a vehicle that you referred to
         22  as tamic.  It was the vehicle that was near the
         23  gymnasium.  You were put on that vehicle and taken to
         24  the execution site.  You said that it had had civilian
         25  registration plates.

          1       A.   No, I didn't say anything about civilian
          2  registration plates.  Whether they were police or
          3  military, I don't know.  I'm not sure about the
          4  letter.  I don't know whether it was the letter P.
          5  Because the Zvornik registration plates started with
          6  letters Z or V, so that was not a registration plate
          7  from Zvornik.  So it must have been a police or a
          8  military vehicle.  But it was a tamic vehicle with the
          9  green canvas on it.
         10       Q.   So according to your observation, the plates
         11  started with Cyrillic letters ZV?
         12       A.   No.  It was something like a letter P or a
         13  similar letter to that one.  At any rate, it did not
         14  have ZV letters on it.  This is what I had observed
         15  prior to that.  And this time I could only see Cyrillic
         16  letters SC, the Serbian Sarajevo.  But that was the
         17  vehicle which I had seen before that.  But this one did
         18  not have a civilian licence plate.  It could only have
         19  been a military or a police vehicle.
         20       Q.   I'm sorry.  My intention was not to confuse
         21  you.  I just wanted to ascertain that the letter on it
         22  was P.
         23       A.   Yes, but I'm telling you that I'm not sure.
         24  All I know is that the letters were not ZV.
         25       Q.   When you were brought to the execution site,

          1  the group of soldiers that was there waiting for you,
          2  was that the same group of soldiers who later executed
          3  people?
          4       A.   Probably not, because they were not
          5  rotating.  I could only hear shots, and I'm not sure
          6  whether those were the same soldiers.
          7       Q.   Did they talk amongst each other?
          8       A.   No, at that time they didn't.
          9            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] Mr. President,
         10  if I may, I should like to go back to a particular
         11  issue.
         12       Q.   I should like to ask the witness whether at
         13  that time he could distinguish between police and
         14  military licence plates.
         15       A.   At that time I wasn't familiar with the
         16  plates that were used by the Serbian police, but I
         17  think that they were not just either police or
         18  military.  I still don't know what kind of licence
         19  plates the police had in the Federation or in Serbia,
         20  and in the Federation today we have a uniform type of
         21  licence plate, and so I don't know the difference.
         22            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]
         23  Mr. President, I have concluded my cross-examination,
         24  thank you very much.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
          1  Mr. Petrusic.
          2            Mr. McCloskey, do you have any additional
          3  questions?
          4            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Mr. President, if I could ask
          5  two questions back at the gym that I failed to ask the
          6  first time.
          7            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Well, if
          8  you forgot to ask those questions, then later on I will
          9  have to give Mr. Petrusic the opportunity to
         10  cross-examine again.  Yes, please, do ask your
         11  questions, Mr. McCloskey.
         12            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         13                 Re-examined by Mr. McCloskey:
         14       Q.   While you were at the gym that was crowded
         15  with people, did you see any of the Muslims pass out in
         16  any way?
         17       A.   Yes, there were people passing out, mostly
         18  because they were thirsty.
         19       Q.   And did you see what happened to those
         20  people?
         21       A.   No, nothing.  Nobody helped us.  But one of
         22  our people would usually go to get some water and we
         23  would ask that person to then give him some water to
         24  refresh him.
         25       Q.   Did the Serbs provide any sort of medical
          1  help at the gym at all?
          2       A.   No, none, whatsoever.  No help at all.
          3            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          4  That's all.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          6  Mr. Petrusic, do you have anything in relation to
          7  this?
          8            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation]  I should just
          9  like to check whether I understand the witness
         10  correctly.
         11                 Cross-examined by Mr. Petrusic:
         12       Q.   When these people fainted, was it -- were
         13  they allowed to get some water?
         14       A.   Yes, but because everybody -- the place was
         15  so crowded, and the water sometimes couldn't reach them
         16  and everybody asked for more water than there actually
         17  was.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         19  very much, Mr. Petrusic.
         20            Judge Riad.
         21                 Questioned by the Court:
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         23            Good morning Witness L.  I'll just try to
         24  understand more clearly certain things you mentioned.
         25  You mentioned that you were captured with your
          1  brother.  Did you hear anything about your brother
          2  since you were captured?
          3       A.   No, I haven't heard anything.  He went one
          4  way and I went the other and I don't know anything
          5  about what happened to him.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  Since the 11th of July, 1995, he
          7  has not --
          8       A.   Since the 13th of July, 1995, I haven't heard
          9  of him.  Since that -- from the time when we were
         10  sitting together in the meadow.  He was maybe 10 to 15
         11  rows behind me sitting on that meadow.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Did you try to make any search
         13  to find out?  Did you get any news?
         14       A.   Well, we searched for him through the Red
         15  Cross.  He has a wife and children, but they were
         16  unable to locate him.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, when you left Srebrenica to
         18  Susnjari, you said you had with you something like 200
         19  armed men.  Was there any exchange of fire between
         20  these men and between the Bosnian Serbs?
         21       A.   At that time, no.  I don't know what happened
         22  further on along the way.  It was only later on that we
         23  learned that there had been an ambush, so they had
         24  remained behind and we left.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  An ambush, who made the ambush

          1  for the other?  Was it the Serbs who ambushed the
          2  Muslims?
          3       A.   The Serbs.
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  And then, I'm just following
          5  your testimony, apparently some -- when Arkan's men
          6  came and they were -- you were asked to shout or to
          7  sing, "Long live the king."  Who was that king?
          8       A.   Well, most probably the Serbian king.  We
          9  don't have a king at all.  And the Serbs have a king.
         10  I mean, they don't have him now, but they used to.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  You don't know what they were
         12  referring to?
         13       A.   I beg your pardon.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  You don't know which king they
         15  are referring to; last century, last --
         16       A.   No, I don't know.  Most probably -- now they
         17  don't have a king in Serbia, and there is no king in
         18  Bosnia either.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  So you don't know.  And when you
         20  were boarding the bus, you said you asked -- you
         21  answered the Defence counsel that the badges were
         22  damaged, you could not see their badges of the soldiers
         23  but you could hear their voice.  You being a man living
         24  in that area, was it the Bosnian accent?  Was it the
         25  Serb accent?  What was the --

          1       A.   Well, they probably spoke with a Serbian
          2  accent which is even more pronounced now, but before
          3  they used to speak like us.
          4            JUDGE RIAD:  The soldiers spoke like you or
          5  like the Serbs in Serbia?
          6       A.   They spoke like us, but they have a slightly
          7  different accent.  They pronounce -- they don't use the
          8  letter H every time they should, for example.
          9            JUDGE RIAD:  Who doesn't use the letter "H"?
         10       A.   Well Serbs, for example.  We say  "hljeb" and
         11  they say "ljeb", especially people from the
         12  countryside.  But those living in cities, they speak
         13  like us.
         14            JUDGE RIAD:  Those living in cities like
         15  Belgrade, for instance?
         16       A.   Yes, yes, yes.  There was no difference
         17  between Belgrade and places in Bosnian, but it also
         18  depended on the education.  Educated people do
         19  pronounce this letter "H", uneducated people don't.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  And these soldiers were educated
         21  people?
         22       A.   Well, I don't know them.  I know only this
         23  one who used to work with me as concrete reinforcer; he
         24  was a semi-skilled worker.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  I'm speaking of soldiers.  At a

          1  certain stage they are saying, "We are not soldiers, we
          2  are Karadzic's young Chetniks."  Where did these young
          3  Chetniks come from?
          4       A.   They were standing at the door of the gym
          5  where we were.  They were sort of guarding us.  They
          6  would shoot from time to time in the air.  They were
          7  very young people.
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  They were Bosniaks?
          9       A.   Yes, they were most probably Bosniaks,
         10  Bosnian Serbs.
         11            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, when you surrendered on the
         12  July 13th, you heard somebody saying, "These guys are
         13  ours."  That was the translation.  What was the meaning
         14  of that?
         15       A.   Well, according to my opinion, those elderly
         16  people most probably thought that if we were to be
         17  incarcerated, that then they could beat us because they
         18  didn't have any weapons in their hands.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  I mean you are their victims,
         20  "These guys are ours," means they want you to be their
         21  victims.  Is that what you understood?
         22       A.   Yes, most probably.  Yes.  Yes, this is what
         23  I understood them to mean that they beat us physically
         24  because they didn't have any rifles.
         25            JUDGE RIAD:  And also at a certain stage you

          1  mentioned that Gojko Simic had said he would kiss all
          2  those who had been killed.  What was the meaning --
          3  what was the meaning of that?
          4       A.   No.  He said that he would kiss the person
          5  who will speak.  He wanted actually to discover whether
          6  anyone was alive.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  And when he kisses them, what
          8  will happen?
          9       A.   No, no, no.  You haven't understood me.  He
         10  wanted to see whether anyone was alive and, of course,
         11  he would kill that person.  He wouldn't kiss him.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  Because there is something, you
         13  know, called the "kiss of death" if you want to save
         14  someone.  So he wanted to kill them all.  It was to
         15  kill them completely?
         16       A.   Yes, and they didn't want to let a single
         17  soul living.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  Did he kiss you?
         19       A.   God forbid, he didn't.
         20            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, it was interesting you
         21  mentioned that a woman, a Serb woman was in camouflage
         22  and gave you water.  Were there women among the Serb
         23  soldiers killing you?
         24       A.   That was the only woman.  She was in the
         25  gymnasium from where we were taken, and I didn't see

          1  any woman over there and I didn't hear a female voice
          2  either.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  But she was not killing, she was
          4  giving water?
          5       A.   Yes, she was giving water.  I don't know what
          6  her intentions were though.
          7            JUDGE RIAD:  My last question:  You were
          8  mentioning that the registration on vehicles was in
          9  Cyrillic and it was not familiar in Bosnia.  Did I
         10  understand rightly?
         11       A.   No.  Before the war, the plates used to be in
         12  Latin alphabet, and everybody had the same kind of
         13  plates regardless of the nationality.  But when the war
         14  broke out and until 1995, until I was captured at
         15  Grbovci, I didn't see that the Serbs had different
         16  plates, but at that moment I saw that they actually had
         17  different licence plates with Cyrillic letters on them.
         18            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you very much, Witness L.
         19       A.   Thank you, Your Honour.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         21  Judge Riad.
         22            Judge Wald.
         23            JUDGE WALD:  Witness L, at the time that you
         24  were discussing the different kinds of uniforms and
         25  camouflage uniforms that the people around, I think it

          1  was the Grbovci school were wearing, I think that you
          2  were mentioning that some were wearing a grey
          3  camouflage that you thought were either Serbian Bosnian
          4  police or military.
          5            My question is:  Did the people wearing those
          6  kind of uniforms do anything different?  Were they
          7  performing different functions from the soldiers or
          8  were they doing the same thing as the soldiers in the
          9  regular army camouflage uniforms?  Did they seem to be
         10  having a different function or were they intermixed
         11  with the army performing the same kind of guarding and
         12  transporting functions?
         13       A.   They were just there in the compound.  They
         14  were mixed together, the Serb police and the army.  But
         15  at the door were only soldiers, very young boys under
         16  20 years of age, I think.
         17            JUDGE WALD:  But the ones who were in the
         18  yard with the greyish uniforms were basically doing the
         19  same thing as the other soldiers, right?  They were not
         20  at the door, I understand they were in the yard.
         21       A.   They were in the yard when we arrived, but
         22  those in grey uniforms didn't come to the door because
         23  their police wear such uniforms.
         24            JUDGE WALD:  Could you tell what they were
         25  doing there?  Were they just standing around?  Were

          1  they doing anything special, the ones in the grey
          2  uniform?
          3       A.   They were just giving us orders to run
          4  towards the school, and we don't know what they did
          5  afterwards outside.
          6            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Now, did some of the
          7  vehicles that you were discussing whether they had
          8  military or other kinds of police identification on it,
          9  were any of those kinds of military police vehicles
         10  used for transporting the prisoners?
         11       A.   No, the vehicles were not like that.
         12            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  You did speak of there
         13  being -- when you were being transported to the school,
         14  30, approximately 30 large vehicles of all different
         15  types, you said.  Could you tell whether all of those
         16  vehicles looked like they were local vehicles or did
         17  any of them have markings which would suggest they had
         18  come from farther away since there were so many large
         19  vehicles in that small place?
         20       A.   All the vehicles were civilian.  None of them
         21  came from the outside.  We would only see the vehicle
         22  that would be unloaded in front of us, then they would
         23  go back to pick up some more.
         24            JUDGE WALD:  But you couldn't tell whether
         25  some of these vehicles had markings of, you know,

          1  private companies on them or military markings or
          2  what?
          3       A.   They didn't have private or military
          4  markings.  They were mostly vehicles from the former
          5  Yugoslavia, the socialist republic of
          6  Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There was a company from Sarajevo,
          7  they had the same markings.  The only difference being
          8  that the licence plates were in Cyrillic with a double
          9  "S" standing for Srpska Sarajevo, Serbian Sarajevo.
         10            JUDGE WALD:  So some of them did come at
         11  least from towns and cities that were away from Grbovci
         12  and from where they were.  They had to come a distance
         13  obviously if they came from Sarajevo, right?
         14       A.   I don't know whether they used those buses in
         15  Zvornik or Bratunac or Sarajevo, I don't know.  I just
         16  know that those were the registration plates and that
         17  they were  Centrotrans buses, belonging to the
         18  Centrotrans Company.
         19            JUDGE WALD:  And the Centrotrans Company, do
         20  you know whether it operates; all of Bosnia or just
         21  certain regions?
         22       A.   All of Bosnia and Herzegovina, everywhere.
         23            JUDGE WALD:  My next question is:  In the
         24  Grbovci school when you went into the gym, could you
         25  tell whether or not that school looked like it had

          1  recently been used as a school, I mean, or was it an
          2  abandoned kind of school, a derelict school so that it
          3  didn't look as if it had been used as a school
          4  recently?  Were things pretty well cleaned up so that
          5  it looked like it had been a regular school recently?
          6       A.   Until before the war, it was a regular
          7  school.  But then afterwards when the war came, it was
          8  allowed to go into disuse so the gym wasn't up to
          9  something, either.
         10            JUDGE WALD:  So it didn't look as though that
         11  school had been used as a school in recent months or in
         12  the recent year; is that right?
         13       A.   Of course it probably hadn't been used for
         14  the past two years prior to that.
         15            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness L,
         17  I have two questions for you.  The first is the
         18  following:  While you were under the control of
         19  soldiers or the Serb army, how many days did you go
         20  without food?
         21       A.   We were there around 22 hours.  No one gave
         22  us anything to eat.  I'm not counting the time when we
         23  went to be executed; I'm just counting the time that we
         24  were sitting there.  Nobody offered us any bread or
         25  anything.  Nobody asked for anything either, but nobody

          1  gave us anything either.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] My second
          3  question is the following.  When you arrived at the
          4  school, that is, the gym, you saw a pile of clothing.
          5  I'd like to ask you:  When you entered the school
          6  itself, when you got inside, was the school already
          7  full or was it still empty?
          8       A.   It was half full, more than half full.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] More than
         10  half of the school was full?
         11       A.   Yes, when I entered.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         13  very much for answering all our questions.  You
         14  answered questions from the Prosecution, the Defence,
         15  the Judges.  Is there anything that you would like to
         16  say and that hasn't been covered by the answers to the
         17  questions?  If you wish to add anything, you may do so
         18  now.
         19            THE WITNESS:  I could just put a question to
         20  counsel, but one that is not linked to this indictment.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] No, I'm
         22  afraid not.  You can leave the question in the air, but
         23  the attorney is not obliged to answer that question.
         24  You may put the question just like that, to the
         25  courtroom.

          1            THE WITNESS:  My question would be just for
          2  this courtroom.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  Go
          4  ahead.
          5            THE WITNESS:  Mr. lawyer, you are defending a
          6  man who left 50.000 children orphaned, without one or
          7  both parents.  Don't you feel guilty for those orphans,
          8  and what right do you have to defend him?  That is my
          9  question.
         10            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I'm going
         11  to answer that, Witness L.  The Defence attorneys are
         12  doing their job here, and they're doing their job
         13  properly.  All the accused have the right to a Defence,
         14  and that is why we are here.  We are here to hear the
         15  Prosecution and the Defence, and it is always important
         16  that the Prosecution does its job well, and the Defence
         17  also do their job well, and the Judges are there to
         18  judge.  Thank you very much for coming here and for the
         19  spontaneous manner in which you answered our
         20  questions.  I hope I will help you understand that all
         21  the attorneys are doing their job, which doesn't mean
         22  that they share any responsibility.
         23            THE WITNESS:  I know that.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] And
         25  regardless of the responsibility of the --

          1            THE WITNESS:  I know that.  I understand
          2  that.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] -- and
          4  regardless of the perpetrators of acts, and those acts
          5  are certainly horrible acts, and you are alive to tell
          6  the world that such acts must not be repeated.
          7            Don't move for the moment, Witness L.  I
          8  think Mr. McCloskey has at least one exhibit to tender,
          9  Exhibit 100.
         10            MR. McCLOSKEY:  Yes, Mr. President, we would
         11  offer that as evidence.
         12            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         13  Mr. Petrusic?
         14            MR. PETRUSIC: [Interpretation] No objection
         15  from the Defence, Your Honour.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] In that
         17  case, Exhibit 100 will be tendered into evidence.
         18            Witness L, you have completed your
         19  testimony.  Thank you very much for coming.  And as I
         20  have told you, you must tell the world, you, who have
         21  lived through these experiences, that we should do
         22  everything to prevent a repetition of such acts.  And
         23  please remember that all the accused are presumed to be
         24  innocent until proven guilty.  That is the spirit of
         25  justice, and we are rendering justice here in the best

          1  way we can.  So don't move yet, because you are a
          2  protected witness.
          3            We're going to have a 15-minute break now.
          4  And I think the next witness has more or less the same
          5  protective measures, so we will work in open session.
          6            So don't move, Witness, please.  Good-bye,
          7  and we'll have a 15-minute break now.
          8                 [The witness withdrew]
          9                 --- Recess taken at 10.44 a.m.
         10                 --- On resuming at 11.02 a.m.
         11            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         12  morning, Witness.  Can you hear me?
         13            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I can.
         14            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well,
         15  then.  Could you please stand up, because you have to
         16  read the solemn declaration first, which is written on
         17  the piece of paper that the usher will give you.
         18            THE WITNESS: I solemnly declare that I will
         19  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
         20  truth.
         21                 WITNESS:  WITNESS M
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         23  You may be seated now.  Are you comfortable, Witness?
         24            THE WITNESS:  It's okay, thank you.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You will be
          1  treated well here.  You are testifying before the
          2  International Tribunal and you will first answer
          3  questions that will be put to you by Mr. Cayley.
          4            Mr. Cayley, you have the floor.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Excuse me.
          7  There is something that we have to take care of first.
          8  The representative of the Registry will show you a
          9  piece of paper with your name written on it, Witness.
         10  Could you please tell us by saying only yes or no if
         11  this is really your name.
         12            THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is.
         13            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
         14  Now you will be answering questions.
         15            I'm sorry, Mr. Cayley.  Please proceed.
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.
         17                 Examined by Mr. Cayley:
         18       Q.   Witness, throughout your testimony I shall
         19  refer to you as Witness M in order to ensure that your
         20  identity is not disclosed.  And if I could ask you to
         21  try to remember to speak as slowly as you can -- I know
         22  it's your manner to speak quite quickly -- because we
         23  have interpreters between us who are interpreting
         24  everything into English and French.
         25            You're a Bosnian; is that correct?

          1       A.   Yes, it's correct.
          2       Q.   And you are a Muslim by faith?
          3       A.   Yes, I am.
          4       Q.   I think until 1993 you lived in the area of
          5  Cerska; is that correct?
          6       A.   Yes, it is.
          7       Q.   And I think in March of 1993, when Cerska
          8  fell, you moved to a village inside what became the
          9  Srebrenica enclave; is that correct?
         10       A.   Yes, it's correct.
         11       Q.   I want to now move forward in time, and I
         12  want you to think about the 11th of July, 1995.  And I
         13  think at that time you and the other men from the
         14  Srebrenica enclave gathered at Susnjari; is that right?
         15       A.   Yes, that's right.
         16       Q.   Now, Witness, where did the women and
         17  children go?
         18       A.   The women and children went to Potocari,
         19  together with the elderly.
         20       Q.   Why did the men not go to Potocari?
         21       A.   The men, the able-bodied men, didn't go to
         22  Potocari; they went to the woods, because they didn't
         23  dare to go into their hands.
         24       Q.   I may ask you questions the answers to which
         25  appear perfectly obvious, but nevertheless the Judges

          1  need to know.  Why didn't you dare go to Potocari?  Why
          2  did the men not dare go to Potocari?
          3       A.   I didn't dare go to Potocari, for example,
          4  because they had already surrounded us.  They had
          5  surrounded Srebrenica and they were entering Potocari,
          6  and I didn't go there, didn't dare go there.
          7       Q.   When you refer to "they" -- you said that
          8  "they" had surrounded.  Are you referring to the
          9  Bosnian Serbs?
         10       A.   They had attacked us, and on the 11th they
         11  entered the town of Srebrenica.  And when that
         12  happened, I went to the woods, because I didn't dare go
         13  to Potocari.  But I had sent my wife, my mother, and my
         14  children and a cousin of mine who was 14 years of age;
         15  he went to Potocari.  They all went to Potocari.  But
         16  he didn't survive.  And we went to the woods.  And my
         17  father was also sent to Potocari, but he preferred to
         18  go with us.  He said, "Sons, I will go to you and then
         19  be what may."
         20       Q.    Was it the Bosnian Serb army that had
         21  entered Srebrenica and surrounded the enclave?
         22       A.   As they were entering the town of Srebrenica,
         23  I had already started towards the woods, together with
         24  the military.  The command of the army ordered the
         25  able-bodied men to go through the woods; and those who

          1  were weak, they were supposed to go to Potocari.
          2       Q.   Were you in the army at the time yourself?
          3       A.   No, I wasn't in the army.
          4       Q.   Did you carry weapons with you on the 11th of
          5  July?
          6       A.   No.  We didn't have weapons.
          7       Q.   Now, can you remember approximately what time
          8  you left Jaglici on the 11th of July?
          9       A.   In the evening of the 11th of July, around
         10  10.00 p.m., and this is where we lined up.  This is
         11  where we assembled in Susnjari, and then we went in the
         12  direction of Jaglici, Pobudze, and Cerska, on onwards
         13  towards Tuzla.
         14       Q.   Now, I want to move ahead in time to the 13th
         15  of July of 1995, when I think you found yourself on a
         16  hill called Dolina, which is between the hamlets or
         17  villages of Jelah and Krke.  Do you recall that?
         18       A.   I do.
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         20  Prosecutor's Exhibit 120.  If it could be placed in
         21  front of the witness and then placed on the ELMO,
         22  please.
         23       Q.   Now, Witness, do you recall yesterday, you
         24  and I drew a sketch map of this area together and then
         25  this map that you see in front of you is generated on a

          1  computer today.  Does this accurately reflect the
          2  sketches that you made for me yesterday?
          3       A.   This is a correct drawing, correct
          4  representation of the location where I was.
          5            MR. CAYLEY:  Can you place a copy on the
          6  ELMO, please.  Thank you.
          7       Q.   Now, Witness, could you indicate on the ELMO,
          8  the location of Dolina?
          9       A.   This is Jelah here [indicates].  Krke and
         10  Dolina is here and this is where I was on a hill.
         11            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         12  witness has indicated on Prosecutor's Exhibit 120 that
         13  the pyramid, the triangle, the black triangle is Dolina
         14  and that hill is in between two villages called Jelah
         15  and Krke.
         16       Q.   Now, Witness, how far were you from the road
         17  that goes between Nova Kasaba and Konjevic Polje?  As
         18  the crow flies, how far were you from that road?
         19       A.   This is Konjevic Polje [indicates].  Nova
         20  Kasaba is here and I was here near the asphalt road;
         21  500 metres as the crow flies, maybe not even 500.  So I
         22  could observe from the hill, the area of Konjevic Polje
         23  and Kasaba, I could see the road.
         24       Q.   Now, from the hill at Dolina, can you tell
         25  the Judges what you recall seeing on the 13th of July,

          1  1995?
          2       A.   On the 13th of July, it was a Thursday, I
          3  remember very well.  It was about 2.00 in the afternoon
          4  and I noticed trucks and buses passing by moving from
          5  Konjevic Polje towards Nova Kasaba.
          6            I was there together with eight other people
          7  and people started to shout.  They were saying,
          8   "They're probably taking our women and children.  To
          9  the free territory."
         10            There were two or three buses there at that
         11  point and they turned right off the asphalt road and
         12  they went into the -- in the direction of Cerska across
         13  the bridge and I was watching them.
         14            There was a little path towards Skurici, but
         15  then they went directly to Cerska and they turned
         16  around the curve and this is where I lost them.  There
         17  was an APC following them and two other trek vehicles.
         18            Maybe five or ten minutes after that, a
         19  yellow backhoe started out in the same direction and I
         20  could watch it travel as well and at that point, we
         21  could only hear fire of small firearms.
         22       Q.   Witness, if you could pause there for a
         23  moment.
         24            Now, you said in your evidence that you saw
         25  two or three buses which turned right off the asphalt

          1  road and they went in the direction of Cerska across
          2  the bridge.  Can you indicate to the Judges, on the map
          3  on the ELMO next to you, the road that those three
          4  buses took?
          5       A.   The buses left Konjevic Polje and they turned
          6  towards Kamenica.  There was a bridge here [indicates],
          7  you can see it here, across the Jadar river.  And they
          8  moved up hill from there towards Cerska.
          9            There is a little road which turns left to
         10  Skurici they went towards Cerska and I could still see
         11  them.  They turned right towards Cerska.
         12            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         13  witness has indicated on Prosecutor's Exhibit 120 that
         14  the three buses turned onto a road that goes towards
         15  the village of Cerska over a bridge that is indicated
         16  by a bridge symbol on that road, past -- turning to
         17  another small village called Skurici and on the way to
         18  Cerska.
         19       Q.   Now, Witness, you also stated that you saw
         20  other vehicles following.  Can you describe the APC
         21  that you saw to the Judges?
         22       A.   Yes, I can describe the APC.  I noticed also
         23  a trek vehicle that was green in colour.  There was
         24  some soldiers wearing camouflage uniforms on that
         25  vehicle, but I couldn't tell which uniform it was.  I

          1  didn't distinguish between various colours, but the
          2  soldiers were on the APC.
          3       Q.   Now, you also said, Witness, that you saw a
          4  yellow backhoe vehicle following these buses and the
          5  APC.  Is that a vehicle which has a shovel on the front
          6  of it?  Is that the kind of vehicle that you saw?
          7       A.   Yes, that kind of vehicle.  It was yellow.
          8  It had wheels and it had a bucket or a shovel.
          9       Q.   Now, you then said in your evidence that you
         10  heard infantry weapons firing.  Now, prior to that, did
         11  you lose sight?
         12       A.   Yes, first of all, we heard small arms fire
         13  and then later on, we heard echo of other weapons that
         14  were being fired in the valley.
         15            And after the shooting stopped, this lasted
         16  for about half an hour, the three buses came back and
         17  took the same road in the direction of Konjevic Polje.
         18  And the APC followed them, but the excavator remained
         19  there longer, longer than half an hour.  But it came
         20  back the same -- along the same road and it went also
         21  in the direction of Konjevic Polje following the APC.
         22       Q.   I want you to think back to when you first
         23  saw the vehicles going towards Cerska.  Was there a
         24  time when you lost sight of the vehicles because the
         25  road goes into woods?

          1       A.   Yes, towards the woods, there was a wood
          2  there and I couldn't see them because they had turned
          3  around the curve and they went in the direction of
          4  Cerska.  I could follow them for a while while they
          5  were passing through the valley, but I couldn't tell
          6  exactly what kind of bus it was, what company it
          7  belonged to.  There were some letters but I couldn't
          8  make them out.  I was on the hill, I was far away from
          9  the buses.
         10       Q.   In terms of the period of time that passed
         11  between you losing sight of the vehicles and the
         12  shooting starting, can you estimate now, looking back,
         13  how much time passed between those two events?
         14       A.   The buses went away and after about 10 or 15
         15  minutes, we saw the personnel carrier and then the
         16  excavator.  And then they came back, one after the
         17  other.  The personnel carrier followed the buses, but
         18  the excavator remained there a little longer.  It
         19  lagged behind.
         20       Q.   You misunderstood my question.  Do you recall
         21  that you stated that there came a time when the buses
         22  and the excavator and the APC disappeared from your
         23  sight into the woods?
         24       A.   They didn't go into the woods, they followed
         25  the buses along the same road and I could see them.

          1  First, the buses went, then the personnel carrier, then
          2  the yellow loader.  They all followed the same road,
          3  and I could observe them until they turned.
          4       Q.   After the time that you couldn't see them
          5  anymore, how long after that time did the shooting
          6  start?
          7       A.   The shooting started 10 minutes after that.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you.  If the witness could
          9  be shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 11/3.  And if that map
         10  actually could be left there because we need that
         11  again.
         12       Q.   Now, Witness, this is a photograph that I
         13  showed you this morning.  And what I'd like you to do
         14  is to show it to the Judges?
         15            MR. CAYLEY:  Could the photograph be moved to
         16  your left, please.  No, other direction and down a
         17  little.  Actually, the other way slightly.  And if you
         18  could just followed up there is a bit that's pressed
         19  down at the top of the photograph.
         20       Q.   Now, Witness, can you show to the Judges the
         21  hill at Dolina where you were watching these events
         22  from?
         23       A.   Let me show you.  This is Konjevic Polje,
         24  this is Nova Kasaba and this is where I was, at this
         25  hill, here, [indicates] this is where I was near the

          1  woods, the Krke woods.  And from my vantage point, I
          2  could see the road leading to Nova Kasaba and the field
          3  beyond the road.  This is the Krke wood.
          4       Q.   Could you just put your pointer on the
          5  location on the hill and leave it there.
          6       A.   This is the spot [indicates].
          7       Q.   Can you show me the road to Cerska?
          8       A.   This is the road [indicates].  This is the
          9  bridge across the Jadar river and the road goes on
         10  towards Cerska.
         11            MR. CAYLEY:  I'm going to attempt to put this
         12  into the transcript.  On a large panoramic photograph,
         13  Prosecutor's Exhibit 11/3, the witness has identified
         14  that he was about halfway up the most prominent hill in
         15  the middle of that photograph, and that he also
         16  indicated on the same exhibit, the road which runs in a
         17  vertical, near vertical fashion, from that hill and the
         18  main, I think, landmark is a bridge which he identified
         19  as a bridge across the river Jadar.
         20       Q.   Witness, what was your view like from the
         21  hill at Dolina?
         22       A.   I had a very good view.
         23       Q.   Did you grow up in this area?
         24       A.   Yes, I did.  I'm familiar enough with the
         25  area.  If I didn't know the area, I probably wouldn't

          1  go there, but I had known the area from before the war.
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  That's fine, thank you.
          3       Q.   Now, I think 16 days after Srebrenica fell,
          4  you managed to cross the asphalt road between Konjevic
          5  Polje and Nova Kasaba; is that right?
          6       A.   Yes, that's right.
          7       Q.   Where did you go after that?
          8       A.   The Serb army withdrew on the 14th day.  The
          9  asphalt road was cleared and it was on the 16th day
         10  that we managed to pull through towards Macesi.  That
         11  is the area between Konjevic Polje and Nova Kasaba, not
         12  far from the turning towards Cerska, and this is where
         13  I crossed the asphalt road and I reached the woods near
         14  the area of Macesi.  And this is where I found several
         15  other people.  It was already dark.  It was at
         16  nightfall, and it was drizzling and we spent the night
         17  there and after that, we went towards the Udrc
         18  mountain.
         19       Q.   Witness if you just wait for a moment.
         20            MR. CAYLEY:  And if the witness could be
         21  shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 120 again.
         22       Q.   Witness, and if you could just show the
         23  Judges the village of Macesi and where you spent the
         24  night that night?
         25       A.   This is Konjevic Polje and this is the road

          1  to Cerska and this is where I crossed the road between
          2  Konjevic Polje and Cerska halfway through and I went to
          3  cross the field and I went to the Macesi woods and this
          4  is where I spent the night.  And after that I set out
          5  towards the Udrc mountain.
          6       Q.   Thank you, Witness.  I just have to record in
          7  our record what you pointed to.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  So the witness indicated that he
          9  crossed the tar macadam road and then turning off
         10  towards Cerska and then he proceeded towards a village
         11  which is marked as Macesi, spelled M-a-c-e-s-i on
         12  Prosecutor's Exhibit 120.
         13       Q.   Now, Witness, you then said that you set out
         14  towards the Udrc mountain and I wonder if you could
         15  just point out for the benefit of the Judges so that we
         16  don't all get lost in the forest the location of that
         17  mountain?
         18       A.   This is Udrc.
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  And let the record show that the
         20  witness is indicating to a black triangle underneath
         21  which is the word "Udrc."  The location is Udrc, just
         22  below the Drinjaca river.
         23       Q.   Now, Witness, when you got to the Udrc
         24  Mountain, who did you find there, and what happened to
         25  you?

          1       A.   I found there quite a number of men, and I
          2  and my friends joined them.  I came across a man with a
          3  nickname.  He wrote down everything:  what had happened
          4  along the way and what he saw.  He put it all down in a
          5  notebook.  And he listed all our names there on this
          6  mountain, our names and surnames, and said, "I'm going
          7  to cross into free territory, or at least my notebook
          8  will, and you stay here," and he took down everything.
          9  He wrote down the names.
         10            At that moment three men, two of whom were
         11  deaf and dumb, and we asked them how they had managed
         12  to escape from Susnjari and Jaglici.  We approached
         13  them.  And the man who was writing down everything, he
         14  approached them and asked them how had they managed.
         15  And then this man said, "You know where I'm coming
         16  from."  And he said, "I'm coming from an execution
         17  site."  I couldn't believe him.  Surely it isn't true.
         18  And he said, "It is," and he showed me his trousers --
         19  he lifted his trousers and he showed me his wounds.
         20  And then he pointed to his ears, saying that he could
         21  no longer hear from the explosions.  He said he was
         22  coming from a hangar.  Whether it was Kravica or
         23  another place, I'm not sure, but I managed to save my
         24  life and to escape.  And he came to Udrc.
         25            And this man who went to free territory, who

          1  was going to free territory, he said, "Stay here and
          2  someone will come for you."  We waited for him for 25
          3  days.  He didn't come.  It started raining.  We got off
          4  the mountain to a village.  We lit a fire.  There were
          5  just the ruins of a house and stables.  We lit a fire
          6  to dry ourselves.  There was some fruit:  apples and
          7  plums, and pears, whatever we could find.  It was
          8  August, I remember well, and --
          9       Q.   Witness, if I could just interrupt you.  Now,
         10  you've told the Judges about an account that was told
         11  by an old man, about how he and two disabled people
         12  managed to escape from Jaglici.  Do you recall any
         13  other accounts that were given by people who had
         14  escaped from Jaglici, anything else that the man with
         15  the nickname wrote down in his diary?
         16       A.   I remember the eight men who also spoke about
         17  the mass grave.  That night, on the 13th, they came
         18  along the road.  They followed the same road as the
         19  APC.  They followed that road, the macadam road,
         20  towards Kasaba.  They said, "We took that road."  And
         21  when we reached the crossroads we came across a pool of
         22  blood.  When we saw that pool of blood, we didn't dare
         23  go on towards Cerska, so they turned towards Macesi.
         24  And the man who wrote this down asked them, "Where
         25  could this spot be?"  They said, "I don't know."  And I

          1  said, "If you can't remember the name, then say it was
          2  by the Uvalic house."  And he wrote all this down.
          3            After that, maybe a month later, in
          4  September, I was looking for salt, me and my three
          5  friends --
          6       Q.   Witness, if we could just -- I just have a
          7  few questions about what you just said.  Now, you said
          8  that these men who told the man with the nickname about
          9  the pool of blood, that they had crossed the road on
         10  the 13th.  Would that be the 13th of July of 1995?
         11       A.   The 13th of July, 1995, when the shooting was
         12  heard, that night they managed to cross the road and
         13  went along the road to Cerska, and that is when they
         14  came across this pool of blood.
         15       Q.   And the road to Cerska, if you could just
         16  indicate to the Judges again -- I know you've done it
         17  previously -- the road, just the road, on which they
         18  found this pool of blood.
         19       A.   This is the road to Cerska, here
         20  [indicates].  There's a turnoff for Macesi and these
         21  are the Uvalic houses, and it must have been here.
         22  There were some tree stumps there.  This is the road to
         23  Cerska.  And a month later I found this mass grave.
         24       Q.   Witness, if you could just wait there.
         25            MR. CAYLEY:  Now, the Witness has indicated

          1  on Prosecutor's Exhibit 120 that the individuals
          2  informed the man with the nickname that the pool of
          3  blood was on the road which goes towards Cerska, just
          4  after the turning to the village of Macesi.
          5       Q.   Now, Witness, I think there came a time when
          6  the Serbs actually noticed all of you men on the Udrc
          7  Mountain; is that right?
          8       A.   Yes.
          9       Q.   And when that happened, what did you do?
         10       A.   He noticed us on Udrc in August.  I remember
         11  well.  It was a Saturday when we came down from Udrc.
         12  Me and my friends who were with me came down to these
         13  villages of Babici and others.  They were all burned
         14  down.  There were some houses still standing.  We lit a
         15  fire.  Just then I lit a fire.  I found a pot, a
         16  bucket, to get some water to wash myself.  I started
         17  washing myself in a stable.  At that moment the people
         18  from the houses started fleeing into the mountains.
         19  They were saying, "Here are the Serbs.  The Chetniks
         20  are coming."
         21            I ran out through the door and I could hear
         22  firing at the village.  And the troops were coming from
         23  the right and from the left to capture us.  I just
         24  managed to put on shorts.  I was barefoot, and I
         25  climbed up the mountain.  The men who went left or

          1  right I think were captured, but I managed to escape to
          2  Udrc.  I spent a day or two there, not long.  Then they
          3  withdrew from there and I continued along the road to
          4  Kladanj.
          5            When I got to Huberi I found some more men
          6  there.  This is towards Sandici.  I came across more
          7  people and I asked:  How were things?  And they said,
          8  "We can't pass.  There was shooting from all sides and
          9  we got frightened.  We didn't dare go on."
         10            We spent the night there and went back along
         11  the same road we had taken.  And we came back to the
         12  place at Suljici, Babici, where I had washed myself.
         13  And on the way I came across two dead people.  One was
         14  my relative and the other I couldn't recognise.  We
         15  were in Babici, and these friends asked me, "Are you
         16  going with me to Srebrenica?"  I said, "I'm not going
         17  back to Srebrenica for the life of me.  I want to go to
         18  free territory."  Then these friends separated from
         19  me.  They went towards Srebrenica to look for food.
         20            And then I went from this village of
         21  Turmadzici and Babici and I came across a small river
         22  between Hakalasi and Hasanovici.  I came across eight
         23  comrades that I knew, and I joined them and stayed
         24  there all the time until I crossed into free territory
         25  130 days later; I think 130.

          1       Q.   Now, Witness, you say that you tried to --
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I'm sorry,
          3  Mr. Cayley.  I think the witness should be asked to
          4  speak a little bit more slowly.  At least the French
          5  interpreters are having difficulty in following him.
          6            MR. CAYLEY:
          7       Q.   Witness, I know it's your manner to speak
          8  very quickly, but if you could try and slow down,
          9  because, as I said to you, we have interpreters between
         10  us.  So if you'd just take a breath while you're
         11  talking, then that will make your evidence much clearer
         12  for everybody.
         13            Now, Witness, you said that you returned from
         14  Huberi back to the Cerska area, and that you met some
         15  friends and you came across, I think, eight comrades,
         16  and you joined them and stayed near a small river.  Can
         17  you indicate on the map where it was that you were
         18  staying at this time with your eight comrades?  Just
         19  approximately.
         20       A.   Approximately.  This is Cerska [indicates].
         21  There's a road going to Hasanici and there's another
         22  road to the left, and I followed the river.  And
         23  halfway between Hasanovici and Hakalasi I was there,
         24  between Hakalasi and Hasanovici, in the river.  It's
         25  about 15 minutes from Cerska, from the school in

          1  Cerska, to this part where I was.
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  I'm not going to try to explain
          3  that into the transcript, but I think it would be
          4  accurate to say on Prosecutor's Exhibit 120, that the
          5  witness indicated that he stayed near a stream about 15
          6  minutes from Cerska, which is marked on the map.
          7       Q.   Now, Witness, there came a time, I think,
          8  when you ran out of salt, and you and your comrades
          9  decided to try and go and search for food and for
         10  salt.  Do you recall that?
         11       A.   I do.  It was in September, but I don't know
         12  the exact date.  When we ran out of salt, we wondered
         13  what we should do.  We had a little salt.  We ate
         14  whatever we could: mushrooms, plants.  So then we
         15  decided to go down to Pobudze, where we saw a lot of
         16  dead and a lot of backpacks.  We thought we'd find some
         17  salt there.  So the four of us set off from the mill
         18  and we reached the school at Cerska.
         19            From the school -- it was an eight-year
         20  elementary school.  The four of us agreed at the school
         21  the two would look to the right, two to the left, to
         22  see where that grave could possibly be.  And so from
         23  Cerska we went to Konjevic Polje, Kasaba, along the
         24  road.  We followed the road and we were looking to the
         25  left and to the right.

          1       Q.   Witness, can you indicate to the Judges the
          2  road you're talking about that you took from Cerska?
          3       A.   This is Cerska [indicates].  This is where
          4  the school is.  And we went along this road.  We went
          5  along this road towards Konjevic Polje and Kasaba,
          6  asphalt road.
          7            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          8  witness is indicating the road that goes from Cerska to
          9  the junction of the road between Nova Kasaba and
         10  Konjevic Polje.
         11       Q.   Witness, if you could continue with your
         12  account of what happened.
         13       A.   When we left Cerska, the school, when we
         14  reached a crossroads called Talusa Luka, we found a
         15  pile in the grass, and the two of them said, "This is
         16  where the grave must be."  We saw it wasn't a grave; it
         17  was somebody who had started building before the war.
         18            Then we went on and we got to this place,
         19  Masuska [phoen].  And then the two of them said, "Here
         20  is the grave."  And we found it, right here
         21  [indicates].  When you go from Cerska, the tomb was on
         22  the left -- no, on the right.  On the right-hand side
         23  was where the excavator had dug the earth.  We saw the
         24  tomb with freshly dug earth over it.  We were sorry.
         25  We cried.  It could have been my son, my brother.  They

          1  must be ours.  Then he counted 25 steps long.  The
          2  crater was about 25 steps long and 10 steps wide.  I
          3  noticed the traces of a caterpillar, of the loader.
          4  From that grave, about 5.200 metres, is a road, a
          5  crossroads, going towards Macesi, and these houses had
          6  been mined, Uvalic's houses.  I couldn't see any traces
          7  of blood, because there had been rain in the meantime.
          8            After that we went along this same road and
          9  we reached the bridge across the Jadar.  And we didn't
         10  dare go towards Konjevic Polje or Nova Kasaba, so we
         11  went between Jelah and Krke, and I reached this hill
         12  called Dolina.
         13       Q.   Witness, if I could just take you back.
         14  Could you point to the spot -- and I know this map is
         15  only approximate -- where the mass grave is located,
         16  where you found the grave?
         17       A.   Here it is [indicates].
         18            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         19  witness is pointing to a rectangle just below and to
         20  the right of Cerska.
         21       Q.   Now, Witness, you also said that you could
         22  see where an excavator had dug earth.  Can you point on
         23  this map to where you saw the excavator digging earth?
         24       A.   Right across the way, across the road from
         25  that grave, here [indicates].  We noticed the traces of

          1  the wheels.  We saw the traces there, here, on the
          2  right-hand side of the road if you're going to Cerska.
          3            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          4  witness is pointing to a Chevron sign immediately above
          5  the black rectangle indicating the site of the mass
          6  grave.
          7       Q.   Can you now -- you said that there were two
          8  houses down from there that belonged to the Uvalics.
          9  Can you just point to those?
         10       A.   Those were the Uvalics' houses, the two
         11  houses.
         12            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         13  witness is pointing to two house-shaped objects marked
         14  "Uvalic," immediately to the right of the spot marking
         15  the mass grave.
         16       Q.   Witness, when you discovered this grave, did
         17  you smell anything there?
         18       A.   I could tell by the smell, the stench.  One
         19  could feel the stench.
         20            MR. CAYLEY:  If we could now show
         21  Prosecutor's Exhibit 16/5, which is a video.  And this,
         22  Your Honours, is the video that you've seen already of
         23  the Cerska Valley region.  It's a heavily wooded area,
         24  it's very rugged, but I think it will give you a better
         25  idea of the area we're talking about.  I've taken some

          1  video stills which the witness can identify.  But it's
          2  about 1 minute 30 seconds, 1 minute 45, so it will
          3  remind you of the area that we're talking about.
          4            If the video could be played, please.
          5                 [Videotape played]
          6            THE WITNESS:  This is where I was.  That is
          7  where I saw the buses.
          8            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          9  witness has just indicated on the video which shows the
         10  road to Cerska, that that is where he saw the buses
         11  which he referred to earlier.
         12            THE WITNESS:  There are the houses
         13  [indicates].
         14            MR. CAYLEY:
         15       Q.   Are those the houses that belonged to the
         16  Uvalic brothers?
         17       A.   Yes, yes, the two houses of the Uvalic
         18  brothers.  And here's the tomb.  This is where the tomb
         19  is [indicates].
         20            MR. CAYLEY:  If the witness could be shown
         21  Prosecutor's Exhibit 121, and this is a series of
         22  stills, Your Honour, that were taken from the video
         23  that we've just seen.
         24       Q.   Now, you pointed out the houses of the Uvalic
         25  brothers, and they're just ruins.  Why are those houses

          1  in ruins, Witness?
          2       A.   Those houses were all right while we were in
          3  Cerska.  When Cerska fell, they went to mine and
          4  destroy one house after another, all our homes.
          5       Q.   The Bosnian Serbs, you're talking about?
          6       A.   The Bosnian Serbs, yes, I'm talking about
          7  them.  They destroyed, torched and mined our houses.
          8       Q.   Can you point out on these photographs, first
          9  of all, the location of the houses of the Uvalic
         10  brothers?
         11       A.   Those are the houses of the two Uvalic
         12  brothers.
         13            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         14  witness is indicating on the panoramic view in the
         15  frame that is to the furthest right in the series and
         16  you can see in the middle of that two grey-white areas
         17  which I think can be clearly seen on the clip below the
         18  remaining foundations of a house.
         19       Q.   Can you show the house, the road to Macesi,
         20  the intersection?
         21       A.   This is the road to Cerska, and this is the
         22  road that goes to Macesi.  You can see it here that's
         23  where it is.  That's the road to Macesi from here.
         24            MR. CAYLEY:  My colleague has just informed
         25  me that I've misdescribed the photograph.  In fact, the

          1  Uvalic brothers houses were on the extreme left in the
          2  frame, on the extreme left of the panoramic view, and
          3  you can see the two sort of grey-white areas which
          4  indicate the foundation of those houses.
          5       Q.   I'm sorry, Witness, can you point out the
          6  road again to Macesi?
          7       A.   The road to Macesi, here it is, this is the
          8  crossroad and it turns off here.
          9            MR. CAYLEY:  And the witness has indicated in
         10  the panorama and it can be clearly seen that it goes
         11  out to the right and disappears out of the bottom
         12  right-hand corner of the panorama.
         13       Q.   And finally, Witness, can you indicate the
         14  location to the Judges of the tomb or the mass grave.
         15       A.   Here it was, here.  This is where it was here
         16  [indicates].  There was a meadow here, the grave, the
         17  river, and this is where the earth was dug up.  So the
         18  grave was here.
         19            MR. CAYLEY:  And the witness is indicating on
         20  the frame on the right of the panorama and it is an
         21  area which is on the left-hand side of the road going
         22  towards Cerska as the road disappears out of the
         23  photograph.
         24       Q.   Witness, if you could look at the photograph
         25  below which is a clearer view of that final frame.

          1       A.   Yes, it can be seen here.  This is the mass
          2  grave on the left when going to Cerska and this is
          3  where the excavator dug the earth.
          4            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
          5  witness is indicating in the single frame photograph on
          6  the lower right side of the exhibit a white-grey area
          7  in the centre of the photograph just above where the
          8  road curves down and goes off to the left is the grave,
          9  and that below that where there's a hedgeline is an
         10  area, I think he said, where the earth was dug, where
         11  the excavator dug the earth.
         12       Q.   Thank you, Witness.
         13            MR. CAYLEY:  Finally, if we could have
         14  Prosecutor's Exhibit 16/3.
         15       A.   This is it [indicates].
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  Could the booth perhaps pan out
         17  somewhat.  That's fine.
         18       Q.   Witness, can you first of all indicate to the
         19  judges the site of the grave that you discovered?
         20       A.   The site of the grave, this is where the
         21  grave was on this side [indicates].
         22            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         23  witness is indicating on Prosecutor's Exhibit 16/3 to
         24  the right of the yellow distance markers which run down
         25  the centre of the road.

          1       A.   This is the road here.
          2       Q.   Can you indicate to the Judges where you saw
          3  where the excavator had been at work?
          4       A.   The excavator had been working on the
          5  right-hand side, the left -- no, the right-hand side.
          6       Q.   Could you indicate with your pointer.
          7       A.   Across the way from the grave here
          8  [indicates] here, here somewhere.  There was the slope
          9  up there [indicates].  This is the road [indicates],
         10  and this is the road to Macesi, this is -- to the right
         11  is the grave, and this is where they dug the earth.
         12            MR. CAYLEY:  Let the record show that the
         13  witness is showing that the excavator had been working
         14  on the side of the road which is essentially where the
         15  vehicles are parked, so directly opposite the mass
         16  grave and it is, in fact, on the left-hand side of the
         17  photograph as you look at the photograph.
         18       Q.   Witness, thank you.  Can you tell the Judges
         19  who were the male members of your family that you lost
         20  during the war?
         21       A.   After 130 days, I reached free territory.  It
         22  was the 18th of November when I reached Kladanj.  I
         23  learned that I lost my father, my brother, cousins, my
         24  neighbours; and my father who I loved most.
         25            I have my mother, my wife, and children, no

          1  brother, no father, no 14-year-old nephew.  They have
          2  disappeared.
          3       Q.   And they -- all of these members of your
          4  family disappeared at the time of the fall of
          5  Srebrenica in July of 1995?
          6       A.   Yes, the fall of Srebrenica.
          7            MR. CAYLEY:  Thank you Mr. President.  I
          8  don't have any further questions for the witness.
          9            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         10  very much, Mr. Cayley.
         11            Mr. Visnjic, how much time do you think you
         12  will need for the cross-examination of the witness,
         13  approximately?
         14            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  Mr. President,
         15  maybe 20 minutes, and I was about to suggest a break at
         16  this point.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  We
         18  will have a 15-minute break now -- no, perhaps we
         19  should have half an hour break at this point.
         20                 --- Recess taken at 12.00 p.m.
         21                 --- On resuming at 12.33 p.m.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness M,
         23  have you had some rest during the break?
         24       A.   Yes, I have.  Thank you.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Now, you're
          1  going to answer questions that will be put to you by
          2  Mr. Visnjic who is representing the Defence in this
          3  case.
          4            Let me just remind you, once again, that we
          5  speak two different languages and we risk having
          6  problems here.  And the two of you, Mr. Visnjic and
          7  yourself, you speak the same language which can make
          8  things even more difficult.
          9            So I should kindly ask you to try and make
         10  breaks, make pauses between questions and answers so
         11  that the rest of us can hear you and understand you.
         12  Thank you very much.
         13            Mr. Visnjic, you have the floor.
         14                 Cross-examined by Mr. Visnjic:
         15            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  Thank you,
         16  Mr. President.
         17       Q.   Good afternoon, Witness M.
         18       A.   Good afternoon.
         19       Q.   Witness M, let me go back to the beginning of
         20  your story.  You said you had lived in Srebrenica?
         21       A.   Yes, and I was in Srebrenica until the fall.
         22       Q.   In the town itself?
         23       A.   I lived in the outskirts of the town.
         24       Q.   During your examination-in-chief, you said at
         25  one point that on the 11th of July, when Srebrenica

          1  fell into Serb hands, that the population split in two
          2  groups; that one group went to Potocari and the other
          3  to Susnjari?
          4       A.   Yes, that's correct.  Women and children,
          5  civilian population, went to Potocari, and the
          6  able-bodied men went to Susnjari in order to save their
          7  lives; some managed to do that, some didn't.  I was
          8  lucky enough to survive.
          9       Q.   This division of the population was carried
         10  out according to whose orders?
         11       A.   Well, our soldiers, our military men were
         12  shouting, giving orders.  They were telling us -- they
         13  told us that the women and children should go to
         14  Potocari, and those who felt healthy and well enough,
         15  that they should go to the woods.  This is what our
         16  commanders told us.
         17       Q.   How did you personally learn about that?  Was
         18  there a messenger who conveyed the order or were there
         19  just rumours?
         20       A.   We gathered in the village of Kazani near the
         21  cemetery in Srebrenica, and this is where they were
         22  told what had happened.  They said that women and
         23  children and the elderly should go to Potocari, and
         24  those who were able-bodied, that they should go to the
         25  woods and try to save their lives in this manner.

          1       Q.   You said somebody had told you; was that
          2  somebody specific or were there just rumours?
          3       A.   This is what we heard.  They were shouting
          4  and they were telling that the weak ones should go to
          5  Potocari and that the others should go to the woods, to
          6  Susnjari.  And those were the orders, and some people
          7  survived, some didn't.  I managed to survive.
          8            And so let me tell you once again, it was
          9  very difficult for us.  I have not come here to argue
         10  with you.  I have come here to tell the truth about
         11  what we have been through.  And I have come to tell you
         12  about the 130 days that I spent in the woods and how I
         13  managed to survive.  I've come here to tell the truth
         14  about what has happened to me.
         15            And I feel very sorry for the people.  And
         16  this gentleman sitting here, if he had known for this
         17  Tribunal, he wouldn't have come here, would have
         18  lived -- stayed there and lived with us as he did
         19  before the war.
         20            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness M,
         21  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but could you please try
         22  and answer Mr. Visnjic's questions in a direct manner.
         23            If a question is a direct one, please try to
         24  give us a direct answer.
         25            We are here to do justice and there are two

          1  parties here in this case.  There is the Prosecution
          2  and the Defence.  Everybody has the right to defence.
          3            Imagine if something should happen to you,
          4  you would also need somebody to represent you.
          5            We do understand the suffering you've been
          6  through, but please try to answer the questions of
          7  Mr. Visnjic directly, please.
          8            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
          9       Q.   Witness M, in one of your previous
         10  statements, you said that the column had left Susnjari
         11  around 10.00 p.m.; is that correct?
         12       A.   Yes, it is.
         13       Q.   You also said that you were walking from the
         14  12th of July until 13th, that you reached the village
         15  of Kamenica?
         16       A.   Yes, that is true this is where we spent the
         17  day resting, it was the place of Kamenica.  And this is
         18  actually where the tragedy happened later on, the
         19  terrible thing.
         20       Q.   Please, if we can let the interpreters
         21  translate.  This is why I stopped.
         22            You also said that you left Kamenica around
         23  6.00 p.m. and that around 1900 you ran into an ambush;
         24  is that correct?
         25       A.   Yes.  We were surrounded and they opened fire

          1  and the shooting lasted for about half an hour, and a
          2  disaster happened and people were in great fear.
          3            THE INTERPRETER:  Could you slow down,
          4  please, for the interpreters.
          5            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
          6       Q.   You also said that on the 13th of July you
          7  arrived in the village of Burnice; is that correct?
          8       A.   Yes, that's correct, in the morning hours of
          9  the 13th.
         10       Q.   Also on the 13th, that is, on the same day,
         11  you left the village of Burnice and went to village of
         12  Rahonjici.
         13       A.   Yes.  We went across the field and we reached
         14  the village of Rahonjici.
         15       Q.   You said that on the same day you left the
         16  village of Rahonjici and went to the village of
         17  Mranice, which is near the village of Rahonjici?
         18       A.   Yes, this is what I did, and this is where I
         19  reached the junction where I found three or four dead
         20  bodies.  The junction was the one for the village of
         21  Mranice and the village of Krke.  And I heard
         22  somebody -- I heard noises, I heard people calling me,
         23  but I didn't dare move.
         24       Q.   What day was it, if you can remember that?
         25       A.   It was on the 13th, on Thursday morning.

          1       Q.   So you -- this all happened on Thursday
          2  morning; is that correct?
          3       A.   Yes, it is.
          4       Q.   You also stated that a part of the people
          5  from your group surrendered on that day.
          6       A.   Yes.  There were maybe 50 of us in the group,
          7  and there were some people whom I knew, whom I
          8  recognised.  People were inquiring about their family
          9  members.  And while I was there in that group, a
         10  personnel carrier came from Konjevic Polje, from the
         11  direction of Konjevic Polje.  I couldn't recognise the
         12  soldiers who were on the personnel carrier, but I
         13  noticed that they were wearing camouflage uniforms.
         14  And they went in the direction of Nova Kasaba, but they
         15  only got as far as Dzugum, as far as a cafe which was
         16  situated there.  And people started shouting, telling
         17  us to surrender.  They were telling us that the Red
         18  Cross was there, that UNPROFOR people were there, and
         19  they told us to come down to the asphalt road and to
         20  surrender.
         21            I was there together with other people, but
         22  whoever had any wits about him didn't even think of
         23  surrendering.  And some 130 of us remained in that
         24  river, in that little brook.  And this is -- and then
         25  afterwards I went in the direction of Jelah and the

          1  Krke woods.
          2       Q.   What time of the day was it when several
          3  members of your group surrendered?
          4       A.   It was on the same day, on the 13th of July,
          5  around 10.00 or maybe half past 9.00 in the morning.
          6  And I was watching them while I was at the village of
          7  Krke, as they were climbing down the hill and going
          8  towards the asphalt road.  I noticed several groups of
          9  Serb soldiers and I could see people coming out on the
         10  asphalt road.  I could hear Serb soldiers asking them
         11  if they had any weapons, and they said they didn't, and
         12  at that point they would raise their hands.  But then
         13  one would hear a voice of someone who was giving
         14  commands, and then they told people to halt, to stop,
         15  and to raise their hands.
         16       Q.   How far were you from the asphalt road at
         17  that moment?
         18       A.   There was a brook there and there was a
         19  little forest, the Krke wood, and maybe I was some 500
         20  meters away from them.  I'm not quite sure.  This is an
         21  approximate distance.  But I could see everything.  I
         22  could see the asphalt road, I could see people coming
         23  down to the asphalt road, I could see them surrender,
         24  being captured.  And the Serb soldiers also came down
         25  to the asphalt road and they were pointing their rifles

          1  at them, trying to prevent them from escaping, and I
          2  was observing all that.  I wanted to see whether they
          3  would be taken to Kasaba or to Konjevic Polje.  But I
          4  didn't follow them as far as Nova Kasaba.  I lost them
          5  at one point.
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          7  Mr. Visnjic, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I should like
          8  to ask you to ask very specific and short questions so
          9  that we don't lose too much time, waste too much time.
         10  The question was what distance it was.  If you can try
         11  to control the witness, please, Mr. Visnjic.  You can
         12  interrupt the witness.  That's okay with me.  If you
         13  don't do that, I will have to intervene every time.
         14            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         15  Mr. President.  I didn't want to interrupt the witness,
         16  but otherwise I would have intervened.
         17       Q.   Let us clarify something, Witness M.  You
         18  were observing the asphalt road at the moment some
         19  people surrendered.  You were at the same spot as when
         20  you saw the buses and the excavator.
         21       A.   No.  I was closer to the location.  I was in
         22  Mranice and I was between the Krke wood and the brook.
         23       Q.   So this is another location; this is a
         24  different location?
         25       A.   Yes.  I was watching people coming down to

          1  the asphalt road and surrender from that wood, and I
          2  saw them leave in the direction of Konjevic Polje.  And
          3  afterwards I left the Krke wood and I went in the
          4  direction of Jelah, and this is where I stopped, on a
          5  hill.
          6       Q.   Let us pause a little for the interpretation,
          7  and then I will ask my question.
          8            So this is where you were on the 13th of
          9  July, in the afternoon?
         10       A.   Yes.  In the morning.  It was in the morning
         11  when I was at the Krke woods.  And after that I left
         12  the Krke wood and I went to the area called Dolina.
         13       Q.   What time was it when you reached this other
         14  location?
         15       A.   It could have been 1.00, half past 1.00 in
         16  the afternoon.
         17       Q.   How far from you were the Serb soldiers, from
         18  the second location?
         19       A.   Well, maybe 500 meters away from me.  They
         20  were on the asphalt road and I was in the forest, and I
         21  was watching from my vantage point.  I didn't want to
         22  move, because I was afraid.  I wanted to stay near the
         23  brook.  And I was actually running from wood to wood.
         24  I was hiding all the time.
         25       Q.   If I understand you correctly, in the morning

          1  you were on a location which was some 500 meters away
          2  from the asphalt road, and you were afraid that you
          3  would be found by Serb soldiers, so you moved to
          4  another location, which was also 500 meters away from
          5  the asphalt road.
          6       A.   Yes, and it was between Krke and Jelah.
          7       Q.   Thank you very much.  My next question
          8  concerns the second location.  You could see Serb
          9  soldiers from that location; is that right?
         10       A.   From the second location where I was between
         11  Krke and Jelah, in the area of Dolina?  No, I could not
         12  see soldiers from there, going towards Cerska.
         13       Q.   Did you see Serb soldiers on the asphalt road
         14  from that point?
         15       A.   Yes, because the road was completely
         16  blocked.  People were coming down from the area of
         17  Mranice and Krke and going towards Konjevic Polje.
         18  That whole area was completely sealed off.  Nobody
         19  could get through.  And they had posted their guards
         20  every ten -- there were bunkers everywhere, every ten
         21  to fifteen --
         22       Q.   Tell me:  You saw three buses on that day?
         23       A.   Yes, on the 11th, in the afternoon, around
         24  1400 hours, yes.
         25       Q.   Were there Serb soldiers in those buses?

          1       A.   I couldn't notice whether Serb soldiers were
          2  in the buses or not, whether there were civilians or
          3  ordinary people.  I don't know.  I just saw three
          4  buses.
          5            THE INTERPRETER:  Please slow down because of
          6  the interpretation.
          7            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
          8       Q.   So you couldn't see whether there was anyone
          9  in the buses?
         10       A.   Because I was far away, I couldn't see.  It
         11  was a large distance.
         12       Q.   How do you know that those buses were full of
         13  people, or is it your assumption?
         14       A.   It is my assumption, because later on I heard
         15  the shooting.  I'm not sure, but I think that those
         16  were the people who had surrendered.  I assumed that
         17  those were those people who went to Konjevic Polje, in
         18  the direction of Cerska.  That is what me and my
         19  comrades thought, that they must be those people.
         20       Q.   Witness M, you made a statement previously to
         21  the Tribunal and the Ministry of the Interior after you
         22  crossed into free territory?
         23       A.   Yes.  I told the truth everywhere.  I made a
         24  statement, telling the truth, and I have come here to
         25  tell the truth, to tell everything I saw and

          1  experienced.
          2       Q.   I know that some time has passed by since
          3  then and that perhaps your memories are not too
          4  precise, but I would like to show you the statement you
          5  gave to the Ministry of the Interior on the 22nd of
          6  November, 1995.
          7            THE REGISTRAR:  It will be Exhibit D15.
          8            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
          9       Q.   On page 1 I have highlighted in yellow, to
         10  make it easier for you to find the place.  There's a
         11  sentence which says:  "On the 12th day, after I left
         12  Srebrenica, so that is on the 22nd of July, 1995, in
         13  the afternoon, from the direction of Konjevic Polje
         14  three white buses arrived, followed by an armoured
         15  personnel carrier on wheels, with an anti-aircraft gun
         16  on the turret and a yellow excavator loader."
         17            My question is as follows:  During your stay
         18  in the area of Pobudze did you see three buses driving
         19  in the direction of Cerska on a number of occasions or
         20  only once?
         21       A.   Only once, on the 13th of July, around 2.00
         22  in the afternoon.  I'm sure of that.
         23       Q.   Thank you.
         24            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Could I ask the
         25  usher for his assistance, please, with the next

          1  exhibit.  It is a statement given on the 17th of
          2  January, 1996, to the investigator of the Tribunal.
          3            THE REGISTRAR:  It is Exhibit D16.
          4            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]
          5       Q.   On page 4 --
          6            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
          7  Mr. Visnjic, excuse me for interrupting you.  It's
          8  simply to tell you that the method that you used for
          9  the other exhibit is a very good one, so you can use it
         10  in the future as well.  I'm just telling you that we
         11  appreciate that very much, so please do that in the
         12  future as well.  So you can continue, Mr. Visnjic.
         13            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation] Thank you,
         14  Mr. President.  I'm afraid on this exhibit I failed to
         15  mark the sentence, and I accept your criticism.
         16       Q.   On page 4, fourth paragraph, it starts:  "At
         17  1400 hours --"  Have you found the place?
         18       A.   Yes.
         19       Q.   "At 1400 hours we saw three white buses full
         20  of people coming from the direction of Konjevic Polje,
         21  going in the direction of Nova Kasaba.  I could not see
         22  if the passengers were only men, but I assume that they
         23  were transporting prisoners who had surrendered."
         24       A.   Yes, I remember that.  That is correct.
         25  Fine.

          1       Q.   Yes, but in the previous paragraph it says,
          2  "The 14th of July, buses and trucks packed with people
          3  were passing along the road."  So can you explain the
          4  difference between these two events?
          5       A.   Yes.  The people were going from Konjevic
          6  Polje to Kasaba in trucks and buses; in the morning too
          7  they were passing by, and I followed all this and I saw
          8  all this.  When in the afternoon they went towards
          9  Cerska, I thought that they were also civilians that
         10  they were taking.  But when I saw them turn towards
         11  Cerska, I said, "Something is wrong."  No, but the
         12  other one said, "They're taking them to free
         13  territory," and I said no, and I proved to be right.
         14       Q.   You said a moment ago that you didn't see
         15  whether they were full of people so you just assumed
         16  that?
         17       A.   Yes, I assumed that.
         18       Q.   Thank you.  Witness M, you stayed in the
         19  area, if I understood you correctly, until around the
         20  25th of July for some 11 or 12 days in all?
         21       A.   After that, I couldn't pass.  The Serbian
         22  army had withdrawn from the bunkers and freed the road,
         23  and I was able to pass.  The first night I passed, they
         24  didn't fire.  But we were all afraid, of course, all of
         25  us.

          1       Q.   Yes, but let's answer the question, please.
          2  I assume that you were watching the road on a daily
          3  basis?
          4       A.   Yes, I was watching the road.  Then I went
          5  back to the villages and hid in the woods.  Another day
          6  the infantry started after us from Jaglici.
          7       Q.   Finally, you crossed to the other side and
          8  reached Udrc?
          9       A.   Yes.  After that, I did.  On the 16th or 17th
         10  day, I reached the Udrc mountain.
         11       Q.   During your stay on Udrc mountain, did you
         12  have any indications or did you hear that the Serb army
         13  was searching the area and following you?
         14       A.   Of course they were following us and
         15  monitoring us.  I noticed them all, yes, everything.
         16       Q.   How long did this last while you were on
         17  Mount Udrc?
         18       A.   When I crossed the asphalt road, that was the
         19  18th day.  I spent 25 days there on Udrc.  This was in
         20  August when the army arrived and the APC.  That was a
         21  Saturday at the beginning of August.
         22       Q.   For how long were they searching the area;
         23  for one month, two months, or did you have the feeling
         24  that they were there all the time?
         25            I'm not asking you about that specific

          1  event.  I'm asking you, roughly, can you tell us an
          2  indication of the time they spent searching the area?
          3  Was it throughout the time you were there?
          4       A.   For a short time, no, only for about a few
          5  days, a short time.  A short time, only two days.  They
          6  were chasing people and those they managed to catch
          7  alive, and when they withdrew, then we came down and
          8  went through the woods.  And later on I joined this
          9  group.
         10       Q.   Later you didn't come across Serb troops?
         11       A.   No, never again.  And I was able to move
         12  around freely in Cerska, my place.  We were safe
         13  there.  It was better in Cerska and on Udrc mountain
         14  than in Pobudze because I was encircled on all sides
         15  there.
         16       Q.   But you did go back?
         17       A.   Yes, of course I did to Pobudze.  I was
         18  looking for salt, we needed salt.  There were dead
         19  people, our people, in the streams in the fields.  And
         20  we searched their knapsacks to find some salt.
         21       Q.   This was at least a month later?
         22       A.   Yes, this was about mid-September.
         23       Q.   Let us go back to the incident when you
         24  discovered the mass grave.  As far as I understood from
         25  your testimony, you moved around quite freely in that

          1  area?
          2       A.   Yes.  After the last search in August, we
          3  moved around freely in the woods and along the road.
          4  There were no searches, there was nothing, so we were
          5  free to move around in Cerska.
          6       Q.   When you found that grave, did you just find
          7  a pile of earth?
          8       A.   Yes, fresh earth on the left-hand side of the
          9  road.  And on the right-hand side, I saw where the
         10  excavator had dug up the earth and traces of the wheels
         11  and I felt the stench of corpses.
         12       Q.   But you didn't see any corpses, you just felt
         13  the stench and the traces on the ground?
         14       A.   No, I just had this smell, and we noticed
         15  those traces of the excavator.
         16       Q.   Was there any grass covering that earth
         17  already or any weeds?
         18       A.   No, no.  There was no grass, it was fresh.
         19  There was no grass on that earth, it was freshly moved
         20  earth.
         21            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  Thank you,
         22  Mr. President.  I have no further questions.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         24  Mr. Visnjic.
         25            Mr. Cayley, do you have any additional
          1  questions.
          2            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I have no
          3  questions for the witness in re-examination.  Thank
          4  you.
          5            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          6  very much, Mr. Cayley.  Judge Riad
          7                 Questioned by the Court:
          8            JUDGE RIAD:  Yes, do I have a number of
          9  questions.
         10            Good morning, Witness M.  I would just like
         11  to start to ask you just a very few questions from
         12  where the Defence counsel stopped concerning the grave
         13  you found.
         14            You found the grave in September when you had
         15  left Cerska and it was freshly dug earth, but you felt
         16  the stench and you assumed there were dead people
         17  inside.
         18       A.   Yes.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  Could these be the people who
         20  were killed in July, would they smell if they are still
         21  entered in September, or you assume that they would be
         22  freshly killed people?
         23       A.   I assume they were the people who surrendered
         24  who went to Konjevic Polje, and I think they were
         25  there.

          1            JUDGE RIAD:  But there were no signs of dead
          2  bodies on the ground, it was all under the ground.
          3       A.   I didn't notice any bones or anything like
          4  that, only the smell.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  You also mentioned that the
          6  houses were mined, the Uvalic brothers', and other
          7  houses were torched and so on, you saw them around.
          8  Did you understand or know anything about the people
          9  inside?  Were they mined with the people inside, some
         10  of them, or were they empty houses?
         11       A.   Those houses of the Uvalic brothers, they
         12  were mined after Cerska fell and the people were
         13  evicted.  It was after Cerska fell that the houses were
         14  mined.  When I had left Cerska, they were still
         15  standing; not just those two houses but the entire
         16  village of Cerska.  It was later that the houses were
         17  mined and the people chased out and the burning was
         18  done.
         19            JUDGE RIAD:  I'm trying to understand more
         20  about the buses you saw when you were going towards
         21  Cerska.  I think both your testimony today as well as
         22  your statement indicates that you saw buses.  You said
         23  there were three white buses with an excavator and APC,
         24  and you just counted almost the minutes you said they
         25  disappeared into the woods, and then the shooting

          1  started a few minutes later.  And that they were full.
          2  You saw that they were full, but you did not see what
          3  kind of people were inside.  Was that right?
          4       A.   I didn't see whether the buses were full or
          5  empty, but I assume that there were people inside.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  But for sure they were empty
          7  when they came back?
          8       A.   I'm sure they were empty when they came
          9  back.  When the buses came back from up there, and the
         10  APC, and the excavator, the loader, I assumed that they
         11  had been full when I heard the shooting.
         12            JUDGE RIAD:  So when you were on this spot,
         13  what was exactly the scenario that you saw in your
         14  mind?
         15       A.   When I followed those three buses along the
         16  road from Konjevic Polje, crossing the bridge and going
         17  up there, I assumed that there were people inside and
         18  that they were taking them to be executed, and that is
         19  what happened and we heard the shooting.  And when the
         20  shooting stopped, the buses came back along the same
         21  route, and the excavator/loader stayed behind a little
         22  longer for about half an hour after the buses and the
         23  APC.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  All right.  As far as the
         25  shooting was concerned, was it the shooting that was

          1  heard in a battle or was it shooting you would hear in
          2  some kind of systematic way which indicates execution?
          3       A.   I heard very strong, heavy fire.  It was very
          4  loud.  It was -- there was a lot of noise, very heavy
          5  shell fire could be heard.
          6            JUDGE RIAD:  You mean it was guns or
          7  cannons?  What do you call "heavy fire"?  What do you
          8  think?
          9       A.   I think there were light arms and also
         10  machine-guns, bursts of fire from a machine-gun.  One
         11  could hear it echoing along the valley.  It was very
         12  loud.
         13            JUDGE RIAD:  But how long did it last
         14  approximately?
         15       A.   15 minutes, half an hour, something like
         16  that.
         17            JUDGE RIAD:  And after the buses went back,
         18  there was no fire again, no bursts of fire?
         19       A.   No, because probably the APC came after the
         20  buses, only the excavators stayed there a little
         21  longer.
         22            JUDGE RIAD:  You mentioned a man whom you met
         23  who was noting all that happened and he was coming from
         24  an execution site, he was a survivor of an execution.
         25  Was that right?

          1       A.   That man at Udrc, yes.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Now, did he tell any details
          3  about the execution he lived out of, the number of
          4  executed, who did the execution?
          5       A.   He told us then, and this man took everything
          6  down in a notebook, he said that he had escaped from an
          7  execution site.  We didn't believe him.  He showed us
          8  the wounds.  It was either Lolici or Kravica in a
          9  hangar.  That's what he said.
         10            He recognised a relative of his from Cerska
         11  and he gave his name, but he didn't know the others.
         12  That is what he told us.  And he managed to escape the
         13  execution.  And I didn't see him again.  I don't know
         14  what his destiny was, whether he's alive or not.
         15            JUDGE RIAD:   And the number of executed, he
         16  did not give you an indication?
         17       A.   No, he didn't mention numbers because he
         18  couldn't hear too well.  Anyway, he was going deaf.  He
         19  was showing with his fingers that he had gone deaf.
         20  That man was there with us until Udrc fell.  I didn't
         21  see him again.  Whether he crossed into free territory,
         22  whether he survived or not, I don't know.  But he came
         23  to Udrc and he told me that he had come from this
         24  execution site.  I can't remember exactly whether he
         25  said Lolici or Kravica, he didn't know exactly anyway,

          1  but he did say he had come from an execution site.
          2            JUDGE RIAD:  Thank you.  My last question,
          3  and you can answer it if you know anything.  You
          4  mentioned on the 11th of July when the Serbs entered
          5  Srebrenica, the men preferred to go to the woods so not
          6  to be massacred, but the women and children went to
          7  Potocari.  What happened to the women and children?
          8  Were they safe?
          9       A.   The women and children went to Potocari and
         10  we, who were able-bodied went into the woods.
         11            I told my wife and mother, "Go to Potocari
         12  and look after the child, and I'm going into the
         13  woods.  If I survive, fine.  If not, who knows."  I
         14  didn't know whether I would manage to cross into free
         15  territory.  My father was there.  He was born in 1932.
         16  And I and my brothers were telling him to go to
         17  Potocari, to go with the women, but the old man said,
         18  "I won't, I daren't, they may kill me.  If you survive
         19  I will too.  If you get killed, I get killed too.  I'm
         20  not sure about going to Potocari."
         21            My nephew who was 14 or 15, he just said,
         22  "I'm going to Potocari with the women."  But he didn't
         23  reach free territory.
         24            JUDGE RIAD:  And why didn't he reach it?
         25       A.   Because I heard that there was a disaster

          1  there.  They separated the young boys and they took
          2  them away and executed them as -- at their free will.
          3            JUDGE RIAD:  He was 14 years old?
          4       A.   Yes, my nephew was 14.
          5            JUDGE RIAD:  I'm sorry to evoke these
          6  memories, but we have to know the truth.
          7            Thank you very much, Witness M.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
          9       A.   Thank you.  I thank Your Honours and
         10  everybody working on this.  I have come just to tell
         11  the truth.  And whoever is on the list of war crimes
         12  regardless of what ethnic group they belong to, they
         13  need to be arrested and tried and brought to court, to
         14  justice.  If they had been good and if all those Serb
         15  soldiers had known about The Hague, they wouldn't have
         16  done what they did.
         17            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Witness M,
         18  you still haven't finished your testimony.  Judge Wald
         19  has questions for you so will you please answer them.
         20            Judge Wald.
         21            JUDGE WALD:  Witness M, you told us this
         22  morning that on July 13th, you said July 13th was the
         23  day that you saw the buses, the three buses; is that
         24  right?
         25       A.   Yes.

          1            JUDGE WALD:  You said that when you first saw
          2  them, "some of the people", and I assume you mean some
          3  of the other men that you were with began shouting that
          4  these must be our women and children, that they're
          5  taking to Tuzla.  Had you seen any buses that same day,
          6  that is July 13th, of women and children going on the
          7  road to Tuzla so that these people around you would
          8  assume this was another set of those buses.  Had you
          9  already seen some buses on the road with women and
         10  children going in the direction of Tuzla on Kladanj?
         11       A.   On the 13th, I was watching everything and I
         12  saw everything; the buses and trucks going from
         13  Konjevic Polje towards Kasaba.  We assumed that the
         14  people were going to Potocari, were being transported.
         15            JUDGE WALD:  But had you seen, previously,
         16  some other buses which you were sure, from your sight,
         17  did contain women and children either that day or -- I
         18  guess, that day?
         19       A.   We assumed when those buses and trucks were
         20  going to Kasaba, we assumed that the people were being
         21  carried but the other three --
         22            JUDGE WALD:  I understand that but referring
         23  to the statement that you gave to the Prosecutor, you
         24  had said you had a different date then.  But leaving
         25  that aside, you said, "Buses and trucks packed with

          1  people were passing along the road.  We could see that
          2  women and children were on board."
          3            So I was asking you although you didn't say
          4  that in your testimony today whether the reason the men
          5  around you assumed that these were women and children
          6  because they had actually seen prior buses of women and
          7  children such as you mentioned in your statement to the
          8  Prosecutor.
          9       A.   Those buses and trucks that were going
         10  towards Kasaba and the people who were with me, they
         11  were all saying that they were transporting women to
         12  free territory.
         13            But at 12.00 when they turned towards Cerska,
         14  I said, "They're driving them to execution."  But I --
         15  they said, "No, to free territory," but I said, "to
         16  execution."
         17            JUDGE WALD:  No, I understand that very
         18  well.  I was trying to reconcile what you said
         19  previously in your statement that you had earlier seen
         20  buses and trucks, actually seen them with women and
         21  children on board and that's why people might well have
         22  assumed, to begin with, that these buses had women and
         23  children.  But you don't remember that right now,
         24  right, whether you had earlier seen, actually seen
         25  buses with women and children.  I know these were not

          1  the same.
          2       A.   Those three buses that went to Cerska, I said
          3  that they were men being taken to execution whereas the
          4  others were taking the women.
          5            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  When those three buses
          6  returned, when you saw them come back, returned, and
          7  you were sure that they were empty, where did they go?
          8  I mean when they passed by coming back empty, where did
          9  they go?  What direction did they go?
         10       A.   They went in the direction of Konjevic
         11  Polje.  They came from that spot in Cerska towards
         12  Konjevic Polje.
         13            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Now, let me ask you about
         14  the statement that Defence counsel mentioned that you
         15  gave to the Ministry of the Interior.  I notice that
         16  that was given on November 22nd.  I believe that would
         17  be just four days after you came into the free
         18  territory since you said in your testimony you had been
         19  wandering and you had been in flight and didn't get
         20  over to the free territory until November 18th.
         21            So this statement in which you said that this
         22  all happened on July 22nd, not July 13th, was given
         23  only four days after you got back into the free
         24  territory after wandering around for months; is that
         25  right?

          1       A.   Let me tell you.  I arrived on the 18th of
          2  November.
          3            JUDGE WALD:  Right.
          4       A.   That is true.  And when I gave that
          5  statement, I was in Tuzla, on free territory.
          6            JUDGE WALD:  Right, four days later.  I was
          7  only bringing it up to see if you thought that might be
          8  the explanation for why, since you had just been into
          9  free territory for four days after wandering around for
         10  months, your sense of the time might not have been as
         11  accurate as your later memory.
         12       A.   I remember giving that statement.  That's
         13  all.
         14            JUDGE WALD:  Okay.  Thank you.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
         16  very much, Judge Wald.
         17            Witness, I think that was your final
         18  statement in a sense.  I should like to tell you that
         19  we agree with you that regardless of ethnic origin, all
         20  people responsible of crimes should be judged, we agree
         21  with you.  Because the acts committed do not change
         22  their horrible nature depending on the ethnicity of the
         23  perpetrators.  They are always horrendous.
         24            Therefore, Witness M, thank you very much for
         25  coming and we wish you a safe journey home.

          1       A.   I wish to thank you too, Your Honours.
          2            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Don't move
          3  now because we are going to have a 15-minute break, but
          4  before that, I should like to check whether we are
          5  having a witness with the same protective measures
          6  which means an open hearing, and there are some
          7  exhibits to regulate.  Exhibit 120 and 121 of the
          8  Prosecution and Exhibit D-15 and D-16 of the Defence.
          9            Mr. Cayley, perhaps you could cover all the
         10  exhibits together, both of the Prosecution and the
         11  Defence.  I think regarding the Defence exhibits, we
         12  have to bear in mind the need to protect the witness.
         13  So we would perhaps tender them under seal and have a
         14  redacted version open to the public.
         15            Mr. Cayley.
         16            MR. CAYLEY:  Mr. President, I agree entirely
         17  with you in respect to the Defence exhibits.  That's
         18  what I would have suggested what you've stated and I
         19  would simply apply for admission into evidence Exhibits
         20  120 and 121, the exhibits of the Office of the
         21  Prosecutor.
         22            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You may be
         23  seated, Mr. Cayley.
         24            Mr. Visnjic, in relation to all these
         25  exhibits, please.

          1            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  Mr. President,
          2  we have no objections regarding the exhibits of the
          3  Prosecution.  We would just like to observe, to look
          4  through the statements.  But I see that the name of the
          5  witness is indicated in handwriting on the top of the
          6  page, so it would be a good idea to scratch those names
          7  too.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes.  So
          9  exhibits are admitted bearing in mind the
         10  confidentiality of the exhibits.  That is D-15 and
         11  D-16.  We will have a version under seal and another
         12  after redaction open to the public.
         13            You will bear that in mind, Mr. Dubuisson.
         14            THE REGISTRAR: [Interpretation] Yes, Mr.
         15  President.
         16            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]  And
         17  perhaps you could bring the next witness into the
         18  courtroom during the break.  So we're going to have a
         19  15-minute break now.
         20                 [The witness withdrew]
         21                 --- Recess taken at 1.28
         22                 --- On resuming at 1.46 p.m.
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Good
         24  afternoon, Witness N.  Can you hear me?
         25            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I can.
          1            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you.
          2  Could you please stand up.  You will first read the
          3  solemn declaration that the usher will give you.
          4            THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly
          5  declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth,
          6  and nothing but the truth.
          7                 WITNESS:  WITNESS N
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] You may be
          9  seated now.  The representative of the Registry will
         10  now show you a piece of paper with something written on
         11  it.  It is your name.  You will have a look at it and
         12  tell us, by saying simply "yes" or "no," if it is
         13  indeed your name.
         14            THE WITNESS:  Yes.
         15            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] So it is
         16  your name that is written on this piece of paper.
         17            THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is.
         18            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I hope
         19  you're comfortable here, Witness.
         20            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I am.
         21            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] I hope
         22  you've been well treated by the staff here at the
         23  Tribunal.
         24            THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Yes, I have.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We shall

          1  try to do the same, Witness N.  We will be referring to
          2  you as Witness N during your testimony in order to
          3  protect you.  You will first answer questions that will
          4  be put to you by Mr. Harmon.  Thank you for coming to
          5  the Tribunal.
          6            Mr. Harmon, you have the floor.
          7            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Good
          8  a afternoon, Your Honours; good afternoon to my
          9  colleagues.
         10                 Examined by Mr. Harmon:
         11       Q.   Witness N, good afternoon.
         12       A.   Good afternoon.
         13       Q.   How old are you?
         14       A.   I'm 60.
         15       Q.   Have you lived in the municipality of
         16  Srebrenica all your life?
         17       A.   Yes, I have.
         18       Q.   Are you a Muslim by faith?
         19       A.   Yes, I am.
         20            MR. HARMON:  Mr. President, the next two or
         21  three questions I'm going to ask the witness could in
         22  some way identify him, so if I could go into private
         23  session for two or three questions only.
         24            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes,
         25  Mr. Harmon.  We will go into private session.

          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] We are in
          9  open session.  Mr. Harmon, you may continue.
         10            MR. HARMON:  Thank you.
         11       Q.   Witness N, after the Srebrenica enclave --
         12  after Srebrenica became --
         13       A.   Yes.
         14       Q.   -- a UN safe area, did you remain in the
         15  Bosnian Muslim army or were you released from the army?
         16       A.   I was released.  I didn't remain.
         17       Q.   All right.  Now, at the time of the takeover
         18  of the enclave by the Bosnian Serb army, were you
         19  living --
         20       A.   I cannot remember the date.
         21       Q.   Witness N, let me finish asking my question
         22  before you answer, and we will progress very nicely.
         23  At the time the enclave was taken over by the Bosnian
         24  Serb army, with whom were you living?
         25       A.   With my wife, my son, my daughter-in-law, a

          1  child, and a daughter.
          2       Q.   And did you live approximately 15 kilometers
          3  from the town of Srebrenica?
          4       A.   Yes, I did.
          5       Q.   Now, Witness N, I'd like to focus your
          6  attention on the 11th of July and ask you to remember
          7  back to the 11th of July, and could you tell the Judges
          8  what you were doing at the time you learned of the
          9  attack on the enclave?
         10       A.   On the 11th of July I was collecting hay,
         11  together with members of my family.
         12       Q.   Tell the Judges, if you would, Witness N, how
         13  you learned about the attack and what you did in
         14  response to that information.
         15       A.   When I got home, I saw that my neighbours had
         16  gathered at one point, that they had taken their
         17  belongings, whatever they could carry, and I asked,
         18  "What is going on?" And they told me that somebody
         19  from the civil defence had come and told them to leave
         20  the village.  Women, children and the elderly were
         21  supposed to go to the UNPROFOR base in Potocari, and
         22  the able-bodied men were supposed to go wherever they
         23  could.
         24       Q.   Witness N, did you then go to Potocari?
         25       A.   Yes, I did.

          1       Q.   And who accompanied you to Potocari?
          2       A.   My wife went with me, my daughter, my
          3  daughter-in-law, and my grandchild.
          4       Q.   And how long did it take you to get from your
          5  village to Potocari on foot?
          6       A.   It took us around three hours, over the hills
          7  to Potocari.
          8       Q.   Did you arrive in Potocari in the night-time
          9  or in the daytime?
         10       A.   In the night-time I arrived in Potocari.
         11       Q.   Do you remember where you and your family
         12  took refuge in Potocari?
         13       A.   Yes, I do.  We took shelter at the Sacmara
         14  factory, the bauxite factory, within the compound of
         15  the factory.
         16       Q.   All right, Witness N.  Now I'd like to turn
         17  your attention to the next day, the 12th of July.  And
         18  at some point of time on that day did you and did
         19  members of your family attempt to board a bus?
         20       A.   Yes, I did.
         21       Q.   When you were attempting to board a bus, what
         22  happened to you, Witness N?
         23       A.   Serb soldiers were standing next to our
         24  column, and they grabbed me by the shoulder and they
         25  told me, "Come here, old man.  Get out of there."

          1       Q.   And what happened to your family?
          2       A.   My family went in the direction of the buses.
          3       Q.   Did they, in fact, board a bus and did they,
          4  in fact, arrive safely in the free territory?
          5       A.   Yes, they did.
          6       Q.   Now, where did you go?
          7       A.   To the left side of the road, and I remained
          8  standing there.
          9       Q.   Were you taken to a particular building after
         10  you had been separated?
         11       A.   After they had gathered a group of people, 15
         12  to 20 people, Serb soldiers told us that we could no
         13  longer stand there, and they told us to go up the hill
         14  to a partly finished house.  And this is where we
         15  went.  We entered the ground floor of that unfinished
         16  house and sat down, and they stood guard around us.
         17       Q.   Can you describe how the soldiers who
         18  separated you and how the soldiers who guarded you at
         19  this location were dressed?
         20       A.   They were dressed in green camouflage
         21  uniform.
         22       Q.   Witness N, while you were in the building,
         23  were there other Muslim men also detained along with
         24  you?
         25       A.   Yes, there were.

          1       Q.   Approximately how many were located in the
          2  building, in the part of the building where you were
          3  being detained?
          4       A.   About 200.
          5       Q.   At some point during the period of your
          6  detention in that building, did you see General Mladic?
          7       A.   Yes, I did.
          8       Q.   Tell the Judges about that particular
          9  encounter with General Mladic.
         10       A.   One of the Serb soldiers, after quite a few
         11  of us had gathered there and after we had asked him why
         12  we had been separated, told us, "I don't know.  General
         13  Mladic is coming now, so you can ask him."
         14            And then an officer appeared.  He wasn't
         15  wearing any hat, any cap.  He had balding, receding
         16  hair.  He emerged from the road and he was accompanied
         17  by three or four other Serb soldiers and he came to the
         18  door of the house where we were.  And he said, "Hello,
         19  neighbours," and he asked us if we knew him.  Some of
         20  us said yes, some of us said no.  And then Ratko Mladic
         21  said, "Well, those who don't know me now have an
         22  opportunity to see me."  And then I asked him a
         23  question:  "General, why are you separating us from our
         24  families?"  And he said, "I have 180 Serbs captured in
         25  Tuzla.  Your people do not want to release them, so I

          1  have to have 180 of you so that I could exchange you
          2  for them."  And then he went back along the same way
          3  and we remained sitting there.
          4            When night fell, we were ordered by the Serb
          5  soldiers who were standing guard around us to take our
          6  belongings and to move ahead in front of their
          7  soldiers.  Those who were sitting outside the house
          8  stood up first, and they then went in the direction of
          9  Bratunac, across the fields.  Those of us who were
         10  inside the house followed them, and we covered about
         11  200 meters and after that we turned right, to the
         12  right, and went along the road leading from Potocari to
         13  Bratunac.
         14            We got to the road leading to the battery
         15  factory, which was in the vicinity of the UNPROFOR
         16  base, and two buses stood parked there.  And the men
         17  who arrived first boarded the last bus, and those who
         18  came afterwards boarded the first bus.  I got on the
         19  first bus, and at that time it was already crowded, and
         20  I could see on the right-hand side, on the right side
         21  of the bus, I could see General Mladic and several
         22  other soldiers around him.
         23            When I got on the bus, I saw a red car ahead
         24  of the bus, and after everybody had got on the bus, a
         25  Serb soldier entered the bus and he went to the

          1  driver.  And he was standing there and carrying an
          2  automatic rifle.  General Mladic approached the bus and
          3  he told the driver to shut the door and to follow the
          4  red car.  The driver shut the door of the bus, and the
          5  red car set off and we followed it.  And this is how we
          6  reached Bratunac.  After that we went in the direction
          7  of Kravica.
          8       Q.   Let me interrupt you there for a minute,
          9  Witness N.  How many men were in the bus along with
         10  you?
         11       A.   As many as they could put on the bus, because
         12  we were being told to move backwards to the bus, and
         13  this is how we got in.  We were all cramped in that
         14  bus.
         15       Q.   Was there a guard on the bus that accompanied
         16  you in the direction of Bratunac?
         17       A.   Yes.  There was a soldier who was armed with
         18  an automatic rifle.  It was a Serb soldier.
         19       Q.   Do you remember how that soldier was dressed?
         20       A.   In camouflage uniform.
         21       Q.   What colour was the camouflage uniform?
         22       A.   Green and dark green.
         23       Q.   Now, where did you go in that bus?
         24       A.   We went to Bratunac.
         25       Q.   And do you know -- did you stop in Bratunac?

          1       A.   Yes, we did.
          2       Q.   Did you recognise the location where you had
          3  stopped?
          4       A.   I recognised the location after we had passed
          5  by a school building.  After that we stopped in front
          6  of an abandoned warehouse.
          7       Q.   What happened when you stopped in front of
          8  that abandoned warehouse?
          9       A.   We found a group of Serb soldiers there, and
         10  one of them approached the bus, the driver opened the
         11  door of the bus, and he ordered us out of the bus and
         12  he told us to march in front of the Serb soldiers.
         13  They had made a column, and we were marching in front
         14  of them, and this is how we entered the warehouse.
         15       Q.   Approximately how many Serb soldiers were
         16  waiting for the arrival of your bus?
         17       A.   Between 10 and 15.
         18       Q.   Do you have any recollection as to how those
         19  soldiers were dressed?
         20       A.   They were dressed in camouflage uniforms as
         21  well.
         22       Q.   Do you remember the colour, or were you able
         23  to distinguish the colour of those uniforms?
         24       A.   Again, green and dark green camouflage
         25  uniforms.  This is how we called them: camouflage

          1  uniforms.
          2       Q.   Did you and did all of the men who were on
          3  the bus in which you travelled get off the bus and go
          4  into the warehouse?
          5       A.   Yes, they did.
          6       Q.   And what did you do when you got inside the
          7  warehouse building?
          8       A.   We sat down.
          9       Q.   What kind of a room was it that you sat down
         10  in?
         11       A.   It was off-white in colour.  It had not been
         12  properly maintained, that warehouse.
         13       Q.   Do you remember the approximate dimensions of
         14  the room where you and the other men sat down?
         15       A.   I think that it was about 15 meters long and
         16  7 to 8 meters wide.
         17       Q.   Now, after you and the men from your bus
         18  entered that room in the warehouse, did other Muslim
         19  men continue to arrive and fill the room?
         20       A.   Yes, they did.
         21       Q.   Can you describe eventually how full that
         22  room was with Muslim men?
         23       A.   After the last group had been brought in, we
         24  were ordered to stand up and to move to the back, so
         25  that the last group who was outside could also get in.

          1  So we moved to the back as far as we could, and then
          2  the last group entered the warehouse and then we were
          3  ordered to sit down.  But there was no longer enough
          4  room for everyone to sit down, so somebody -- some
          5  people sat down and others sat on their laps.
          6       Q.   Witness N, do you remember approximately what
          7  time of the evening it was when you arrived at this
          8  particular warehouse on the 12th of July?
          9       A.   It could have been about 10.00 at night.
         10       Q.   Now, could you tell the Judges your
         11  experiences that you had and what you observed
         12  happening to the other Muslim men who were in that room
         13  that particular night and the early morning hours that
         14  followed?
         15       A.   When we entered, there wasn't enough room,
         16  and we complained that we would suffocate.  And then
         17  the Serb soldiers shot over our heads and shouted,
         18  "Keep silent or we'll kill you all," and then we fell
         19  silent.  Then someone in the area where we had entered
         20  said, "You 12 have to carry out the assignment given to
         21  you.  Do you understand that?"  And he was speaking in
         22  a sharp tone.  And then a group said, "Yes, sir," as
         23  one.  And then Serb soldiers came with flashlights and
         24  they lighted us up.  And then they asked where people
         25  were from, the people from Glogova, people from Cerska,

          1  people from Bratunac, and people answered.  And then
          2  they said, "The people from Glogova get up."  One man
          3  got up.  The Serb soldiers said, "Come out here."  He
          4  left the warehouse to the left, the direction through
          5  which we had entered the warehouse.  We could hear
          6  blunt blows and his screams and moans.  When all this
          7  stopped, again they came back with their flashlights,
          8  calling out people from various places.  Nobody
          9  admitted to being from those places, so then the
         10  flashlight was pointed at anyone at random, and that
         11  person had to get up and go out.  That is how they
         12  continued to kill people.
         13            Sometimes they would bring somebody back,
         14  badly beaten up, carrying them by the arms.  They
         15  brought them to the doorway, and then a third one would
         16  push him into the room, and then the people were
         17  carrying -- that would carry this person from one hand
         18  to another.  And this went on until the morning.
         19            In the morning they stopped taking people
         20  out.  The people holding the dead complained that they
         21  couldn't stand it any longer, and they wanted to have
         22  them carried out.  And so they allowed it and they let
         23  the people take out the dead bodies.  Two people would
         24  take out the body and carry it outside the hall, behind
         25  the warehouse.

          1       Q.   Witness, let me stop you right there and ask
          2  you some questions, some additional questions about
          3  that particular night in the early morning hours.  Were
          4  you able to hear the soldiers who were guarding you
          5  talk amongst themselves?
          6       A.   I was.  They introduced themselves.  They
          7  asked us, "Do you know who we are, whose soldiers we
          8  are?"  We kept quiet; we didn't reply.  And then they
          9  would hit each other on the soldier and say, "This one
         10  is an Arkanovac," and he would say yes.  And then
         11  another one would say he belonged to the wolves, Drina
         12  Wolves, and he would say yes.
         13       Q.   Now, during the night, in the early morning
         14  hours of the following morning, were you given any
         15  food?  Were you given any water?
         16       A.   When they carried out the dead, we heard two
         17  trucks approaching the warehouse.  We thought that they
         18  would be transporting us somewhere; however, a Serb
         19  soldier came to the doorway and said, "I need 10
         20  volunteers, hard-working ones and younger ones, to do
         21  something for us."  We knew immediately that they would
         22  be loading the bodies.
         23       Q.   Now, Witness N, let me just ask you to answer
         24  the question that I ask, and that is:  Did you receive
         25  any water or did you receive any food the night of the

          1  12th and the morning hours of the 13th?
          2       A.   We didn't receive anything until the
          3  morning.
          4       Q.   Now, I interrupted you, and you were telling
          5  us about ten men who had been taken out.  Would you
          6  please continue with your observations and what you
          7  recall about that incident.
          8       A.   Then they picked ten men, pointing them out
          9  with their fingers.  Ten of them went out.  There was
         10  silence for a while.  While we could hear those motor
         11  vehicles departing from the warehouse, these ten men of
         12  ours never reappeared amongst us again.
         13       Q.   Were toilet facilities available to you and
         14  the other men who were being detained in the warehouse?
         15       A.   Then they allowed us to go to the toilet and
         16  they showed us, as you go out of the warehouse, on the
         17  right-hand side, there was a room to be used as a
         18  toilet.  So we went out, and I went out too.
         19            As I was coming from the toilet, I saw them
         20  taking one out of the line of men and taking him to the
         21  left.  I saw two men standing on the left-hand side.
         22  There were Serb soldiers, two on the left, three on the
         23  right, and there was one facing the warehouse with an
         24  automatic rifle in his hand and shouting, "Come to me."
         25    And as he went toward him, he had stopped for a

          1  while, and this one kept saying, "Come here."
          2            And then on the left hand, the soldier
          3  standing to the left hit him with an iron rod on the
          4  head.  And the Serb soldier standing on the right had a
          5  hatchet, and hit him on the back with the blade of the
          6  hatchet.
          7            I entered the big room, but they continued
          8  taking men out and killing them.  And this went on
          9  until the afternoon.
         10       Q.   Now, when you say "they took men out" and
         11  continued killing them, to whom are you referring?
         12       A.   Serb soldiers.  I mean Serb soldiers.
         13       Q.   Were they dressed in the same fashion that
         14  you've described earlier or were they dressed in a
         15  different fashion?
         16       A.   They were dressed in the same fashion.
         17       Q.   Now, what time in the afternoon of the 13th
         18  did the killing stop?
         19       A.   About 4.00 in the afternoon, about 1600
         20  hours.
         21       Q.   What happened then?
         22       A.   Then, again, we heard two motor vehicles
         23  approaching the warehouse.  Again, one of the Serb
         24  soldiers asked for ten men to go out to do something
         25  for them.  Nobody volunteered, so he selected ten men,

          1  who went out.
          2            There was silence for a while, and then again
          3  we heard the engines being turned on and the vehicles
          4  going away.  Those ten men never returned to the
          5  warehouse either.
          6       Q.   What happened then, Witness N?
          7       A.   Then they stopped killing and they said
          8  General Mladic is coming now.  And he appeared in the
          9  doorway, a general of the Serb army, Ratko Mladic.  We
         10  asked him, "Why are you keeping us here?  Why are you
         11  choking us here?  Why don't you take us some place?"
         12            He said, "I haven't managed to negotiate your
         13  exchange earlier.  We have agreed now, and you will all
         14  be exchanged and you're going to Kalesija to be
         15  exchanged.  But let one of your men count how many you
         16  are so that I can determine how many buses I need."
         17            One of our men got up, and when he counted
         18  us, he said to Ratko Mladic that there were 296 of us.
         19            He said, "Sit down and vehicles will be
         20  coming to transport you to Kalesija."
         21       Q.   Now there were 296 men reported to be in the
         22  room, in the warehouse where you were located?
         23       A.   Yes, yes.
         24       Q.   To your knowledge, were there other Muslim
         25  men located in other parts of the warehouse, if you

          1  know?
          2       A.   When they came back, those of them who had
          3  taken the dead out of the warehouse, they came back in
          4  tears.  We asked them, "What's wrong?"  And they said,
          5  "It's not only that they're killing here, but they're
          6  killing somewhere else.  They're bringing our men; our
          7  men are bringing them and putting them on the same
          8  pile."
          9            I heard this from the man who had taken out
         10  the dead bodies from our warehouse.
         11       Q.   And when you say the men who had taken out
         12  the dead bodies from your warehouse room, you're
         13  talking about the five dead Muslims who had been --
         14       A.   Yes, yes, the five dead Muslims that ten of
         15  our men carried out.
         16       Q.   And so what is your conclusion, Witness N,
         17  based on the conversations that you had with the men
         18  who had taken out the dead and returned?  Is it your
         19  conclusion that there were other Muslim men being
         20  detained in the same warehouse but at different parts
         21  of the warehouse?
         22       A.   That was our conclusion, that somewhere in
         23  the immediate vicinity there must have been other
         24  Muslim men that were being killed.
         25       Q.   Now, at some point in time on the 13th, did

          1  some buses and trucks arrive at the warehouse to
          2  transport you and other Muslim men to another location?
          3       A.   Yes.  Six buses arrived and then the Serb
          4  soldiers gave orders that we should get up and form a
          5  line one by one, because vehicles had come to transport
          6  us.  We got up.
          7            When I got out, I saw six buses standing in
          8  the immediate vicinity.  I could recognise Bauxite
          9  Milici and Centrotrans Sarajevo; those were the
         10  markings on the buses.  I didn't recognise the other
         11  markings.
         12       Q.   Now, you say Bauxite Milici.  Is Milici down
         13  in the Srebrenica municipality or in a different
         14  municipality?
         15       A.   It is a small town within the territory of
         16  Vlasenica municipality.
         17       Q.   And I believe you also said there was another
         18  location, another mark on the bus that you noticed.
         19  What was the other mark that you noticed?
         20       A.   Centrotrans, from Sarajevo.
         21       Q.   All right.  Now, do you know the approximate
         22  time that these buses arrived on the 13th?
         23       A.   It was an hour before nightfall.
         24       Q.   Did you get on one of those buses?
         25       A.   I did.  I got on to a bus with Centrotrans

          1  Sarajevo written on it.
          2       Q.   How many men besides yourself got on this
          3  Centrotrans bus?
          4       A.   There were quite a number standing who didn't
          5  have enough seats to sit down, but I didn't count them.
          6       Q.   So all the seats were filled on the bus and
          7  there were people standing in the aisle; is that
          8  correct?
          9       A.   Yes, yes.
         10       Q.   Now, of the 296 men who were in the room of
         11  the warehouse where you were located, were you able to
         12  estimate the ages, the range of ages of the men who
         13  were in that room?
         14       A.   They were up to 60 and some were over 60.
         15  There was some who could hardly move with a stick.
         16       Q.   Do you have an estimate as to the youngest
         17  person in the room, in your room?
         18       A.   When we were coming out of the room into the
         19  bus, I didn't see any young people.
         20       Q.   Now, did you leave Bratunac?
         21       A.   We did.
         22            MR. HARMON:  Now, if I could have
         23  Prosecutor's Exhibit 1/E/1 placed on the ELMO.
         24       Q.   I'm going to ask you to indicate on this map,
         25  Witness N, for the benefit of the Judges, the direction

          1  that you travelled after you left Bratunac.  There is a
          2  pointer -- there should be a pointer in front of you.
          3  Do you see the town of Bratunac?
          4       A.   Yes, I do.  I do.  I see it.  Here it is
          5  [indicates].
          6       Q.   Could you use your pointer and show the
          7  Judges your route of travel after you left Bratunac.
          8       A.   From Bratunac, we went towards Serbia
          9  [indicates].  We reached the Drina River.  There's a
         10  bridge leading to Serbia.  We didn't cross that
         11  bridge.  So we went to the left, towards Zvornik
         12  [indicates].  We reached Zvornik, and then we went on
         13  to Karakaj.  When we got to Karakaj, we turned left,
         14  when we got to a school and a large hall attached to
         15  the school.
         16       Q.   Now, let me stop you there for just a minute,
         17  Witness N.
         18            MR. HARMON:  For the record, on Prosecutor's
         19  Exhibit 1/E/1, the witness pointed to a road that goes
         20  from Bratunac toward the Drina River, in a direction to
         21  the right side of the exhibit, and then follows the
         22  course of the river up through Zvornik to a town which
         23  is marked on the map, called Karakaj.  Then the witness
         24  indicated that the bus turned left on a road that is
         25  marked, and there's a town on that which I,

          1  unfortunately, can't read off of the ELMO, but it looks
          2  to me like it begins with the letter "P."
          3       Q.   Witness N, can you see the -- it looks like
          4  Petkovci, so that is --
          5       A.   Petkovci.
          6       Q.  -- the route that the witness travelled.
          7  Thank you, Witness N.
          8            MR. HARMON:   I'm finished with that
          9  exhibit.
         10       Q.   How long did it take you from the time you
         11  left Bratunac to the time you got to this destination
         12  up near Petkovci, near this school?
         13       A.   Five hours.
         14       Q.   Were there interruptions along the journey,
         15  along the route?
         16       A.   Yes, there were several breaks.
         17       Q.   Do you know -- strike that.  Were you able to
         18  look around in your bus and see how many vehicles in
         19  your convoy were going north towards Zvornik?
         20       A.   No, I could only see the bus in front of me.
         21       Q.   Now, on your bus, was there a guard or more
         22  than one guard?
         23       A.   There were; one, only one guard, armed with
         24  an automatic rifle, wearing a camouflage uniform.
         25       Q.   Now, let me ask you this:  Did you see any

          1  other buses that -- strike that.  The vehicle that you
          2  saw in front of you, was it a bus or a truck?
          3       A.   A bus.
          4       Q.   Were you able to see whether that bus was --
          5  how many people were in that bus?
          6       A.   One could see through the windows that there
          7  was a whole line of people standing in the aisle, that
          8  there wasn't enough room for everyone to sit down.
          9            MR. HARMON:  Now, could I have that Exhibit
         10  1/E/1 placed back on the ELMO, please, because I may
         11  have indicated incorrectly the direction.
         12       Q.   What I'd like you to do, please, Witness N,
         13  again take that pointer and -- take your pointer and
         14  could you tell me when you got to the town of Karakaj.
         15  There appear on that diagram to be two roads; one below
         16  the town of Karakaj and one directly above the town of
         17  Karakaj.
         18            Do you know which of those two roads you took
         19  or do you merely recall turning left near the town of
         20  Karakaj?
         21       A.   I just remember that we turned left.  It was
         22  night-time, and the windows of the buses were not very
         23  clean, so one couldn't know, and I'm not very familiar
         24  with the area either.
         25            MR. HARMON:  Thank you, very much.

          1  Mr. President, we normally break at this time.  I'm
          2  prepared to continue or to take a break at this time.
          3            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Yes, I
          4  think we need to adjourn.  It is time.  Shall we
          5  adjourn.
          6            Yes, Mr. Visnjic, you have something to say?
          7            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  Mr. President,
          8  it is not linked to this witness, but if you have
          9  decided that we should adjourn -- but reviewing the
         10  transcript on page 94 line 7, the last answer given by
         11  the previous witness, Witness M, and his last answer to
         12  Judge Wald's question.
         13            I think during the translation, and I must
         14  say that we all found the witness rather hard to
         15  follow, I think that during the translation, an error
         16  was made, so that the answer of that witness differs
         17  from the meaning in the transcript.
         18            I intervened with the interpreters, and they
         19  will probably be correcting the transcript.  So I wish
         20  to make this formal objection so that it shall be
         21  registered.
         22                 [Trial Chamber confers]
         23            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation]
         24  Mr. Visnjic, thank you very much for drawing our
         25  attention to this problem.  What we are going to do is

          1  that we are going to send the audio and visual tape to
          2  the translation section.  The translation section will
          3  check, and if the translation is not correct, doesn't
          4  correspond to the original, then the transcript will be
          5  corrected.
          6            MR. VISNJIC: [Interpretation]  Thank you very
          7  much, Your Honour.
          8            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Thank you
          9  too.
         10            Before adjourning, Mr. Harmon, in order to
         11  see how we are going to work until the end of the week,
         12  where do we stand in relation to the witnesses here
         13  present in The Hague.  Are we going to have a chance to
         14  hear them?  Are we running the risk of leaving a
         15  witness from the end of the week until I don't know
         16  when we meet again.  So could you give us some
         17  information, Mr. Harmon?
         18            MR. HARMON:  We anticipate completing the
         19  testimonies of the witnesses, of all of the witnesses
         20  who are here at The Hague, by Friday.  In fact, we may
         21  end up short of time in which case, we are prepared to
         22  present different types of evidence to the Chamber to
         23  complete the trial day.
         24            We have three witnesses remaining.
         25            JUDGE RODRIGUES: [Interpretation] Very well.

          1  What I would like to avoid is to have witnesses whom we
          2  have to send back because we can't hear them or to have
          3  a witness who would have to be half finished.
          4            As it is 2.30, if you have other evidence in
          5  addition to witnesses, it would be a good idea to
          6  present that evidence to make use of the time.
          7            As you know, we have a Status Conference
          8  tomorrow at quarter past two.  Perhaps I need to warn
          9  the interpreters that we may be working a quarter of an
         10  hour longer tomorrow.  That's enough for today.
         11            Witness N, you will stay here.  We will be
         12  continuing your testimony tomorrow.  I hope you will
         13  have a restful evening.
         14       A.   Thank you Your Honour.
         15                 --- Whereupon the hearing adjourned
         16                 at 2.33 p.m., to be reconvened on
         17                 Thursday, the 13th day of April, 2000,
         18                 at 9.30 a.m.
