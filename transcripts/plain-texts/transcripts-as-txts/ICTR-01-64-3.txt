MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session. 

There is no change as to who is here this morning, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
May it please Your Honours, this is an adjourned hearing, and the only change visible is that at the Prosecution bar we appear with Mr. Bongani Majola, Deputy Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Karegyesa.

Good morning Mr. Kouengoua.  No change on the Defence side? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honour; Your Honours.  There have been no changes on this side.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kouengoua. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor to tell us which witness you will be bringing this morning and if there are any other additional matters which you wish to raise.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Your Honour.  Maybe before we call the next witness to the stand, there are a couple of internal housekeeping matters that we wish ironed out before we proceed.  It has always been our desire to ensure that the Chamber is fully briefed on how we intend to proceed at the beginning of every week, and today I just wish to start with three matters which merit special attention. 

Maybe I should start, Your Honours, by confirming that the Prosecutor filed her list of witnesses for this week on Friday as promised, and in order to ensure that there was no lapse or delay in serving the Defence with this list, I personally went to Mr. Kouengoua's office and gave him a copy, and we enjoyed a brief and frank discussion on how to proceed with this trial with as little disruption as possible. 

Now, that being the case, Your Honours, after a weekend review of our case, the Prosecutor is happy to move this Chamber for leave to vary its list yet again in order to drop two witnesses from the list of this week.

We have deemed it unnecessary to call these witnesses to testify, and in the best of adversarial tradition we offer the said witnesses to the Defence if they so wish, subject however to the caveat that any approach to these witnesses by the Defence has to be done with prior notification to the Prosecution, and any interview has to be done in the presence of the Prosecution, because these are witnesses covered by a Witness Protection Order of this Chamber. 

The witnesses we seek to drop from the list of this week are TAT and TAU.  Now, we had listed seven witnesses; that means we will be leading the evidence of five witnesses this week.

Finally, Your Honours, if leave is granted to dispense with the appearance of these witnesses, it is our intention to complete the five remaining witnesses of this week by close of business on Wednesday, 6th of August 2003, after which we shall be seeking for an adjournment until Monday the 18th of August 2003. 

The grounds for this application, Your Honours, are that counsel for the Prosecution are engaged between the 11th and the 15th of August in the matter of the Prosecutor v.  Ntagerura, Bagambiki and Imanishimwe before Trial Chamber III for closing arguments.

Maybe I should draw your attention, Your Honours, to the scheduling instructions of Judge Møse dated the 25th of June 2003, which adverted to the possibility of this brief break in the proceedings.

The counsel for the Prosecution will need Thursday and Friday of this week to work on the final touches of the closing arguments in the Cyangugu case, which has been in trial for the last three years, a complex Prosecution involving three accused, two indictments, and over 120 witnesses. 

Now, if it pleases Your Lordships, I would add that I have discussed this matter with counsel for the Defence and emphasised that the break in proceedings would give counsel an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the transcripts of Alison des Forges in the Akayesu trial, which Your Honours, by decision of the Presiding Judge dated 1st of August 2003, admitted onto the record pursuant to Rule 92bis(D). 

We just wish to underscore that this brief adjournment will not compromise our target of closing the Prosecution of the current case within the time allotted to it -- i.e., we do expect to have closed the Prosecution case before the 28th of August. 

Now, on the proposed resumption of trial between the 18th of August and the 22nd of August, we propose to lead the remaining witnesses within that week, and maybe I should add that, as we have done, we may also be inclined to further drop some witnesses during the process. 
Now, subsequent to your decision admitting the transcript of Alison des Forges onto the record, we have contacted the expert, and the earliest she can appear before Your Lordships will be on Monday the 25th of August 2003.  She is currently engaged in Boston, and that is the only -- or the earliest opportunity she has to appear before Your Honours.  Since we are offering her only for cross-examination by the Defence, we don't expect her testimony -- or the cross-examination to take the whole of that week. 

So, with those few comments, Your Honours, I would like to thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.

Counsel Kouengoua, do you have any comments that you wish to make about what the Prosecutor has just stated? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The Defence team has no specific comments to make.  It is correct that the Prosecutor disclosed the list of witnesses that he will call starting on the 4th, as stated previously, but during our conversation -- during our warm and fruitful conversation, I did not imagine that there would be absent witnesses, and that was the first surprise that was mentioned this morning.

The second surprise that unfortunately changes the whole structure of justice at the ICTR in the second week is due to the fact that the Defence -- and I mentioned this in a proximate manner earlier -- that we have to follow the pace set by the Prosecutor.  If the Prosecutor chooses not to present 10 out of 11 witnesses, that is his decision, but to say that in two or three days we would have to examine and cross-examine 10 witnesses, the problem is a different one in nature.  And I think that this is what has been happening since the 20th of July.

If the Prosecutor chooses to withdraw witnesses, that is his decision, but I don't think he should be the one to set the pace.  He can make an application, but from the very beginning the Prosecution seems to do certain things that raise certain problems for us.  Let me give you a few examples in order not to lose any judicial time.  You know that later, in order to convince everyone, he said, "The plane is leaving tomorrow", and it is true the plane left, especially as the decision had been rendered.  But then he said, "This person was supposed to leave tonight", and he did leave on the plane at 8 p.m.

I respectfully request the Trial Chamber to bring to the attention of the Prosecutor that he should take appropriate measures to allow us, if it would not be possible for those witnesses not to charter a plane maybe, but have more time.
He has just told us, "I plan to withdraw witnesses TAT and TAU".  Out of the seven witnesses, that means that five witnesses remain, and they will be called by Wednesday.  In that case, I mean, I don't know how it is going to happen.  I mean, it raises many difficulties.

I agree that the Prosecutor has to appear in another trial.  However, this does not justify what he has just presented, and this is why very respectfully we submit that the pace that the Prosecutor is seeking to impose, the Trial Chamber should not follow this schedule and should not impose it on the Trial Chamber.  I think that if he presents such a schedule with such a pace, the Trial Chamber should temper it and make it credible.

I have always said, and I will never repeat it enough, that the first Prosecution witness was heard in 1998 -- at least this was for the first witness statement.  This is information that he has been aware of since 1998.  We received this information in June/July 2003, and it causes a great deal of problem. 

This is information that he has been aware of for five years.  He cannot impose on us that we follow this pace.  Therefore if the Trial Chamber wishes to grant the Prosecutor's application, then his program, his schedule, should not be accepted.

Five Prosecution witnesses in three days, from Monday 9 o'clock -- because it is currently 9 o'clock -- until Wednesday 5 p.m., I believe that this is unacceptable, Madam President.  This is what I wanted to say.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, if I could with your leave just make brief comment.  The Prosecutor is making a proposal on how we intend to proceed, and this proposal is subject, of course, to the discretion of Your Lordships.  I am fully aware of the Accused's right to fair trial, and my proposal in no way negates this right.

If counsel needs more time, he is entirely at liberty to seek more time from Your Honours.  Most obliged.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

The Trial Chamber grants leave to the Prosecutor to withdraw witnesses TAT and TAU from the witness list. 

Therefore, the five other witnesses will appear, and we will see if it is possible to hear them between now and Wednesday.  If it is not possible to finish hearing these witnesses in these three days, then we shall decide at that point.  

Nevertheless, I would like to ask the parties to please do their utmost to allow us to move forward rapidly so that we don't get behind in this scheduling that we had planned.  Thank you very much. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I am most obliged, Your Honours.  If the courtroom officer would lead Witness TAC into the courtroom.
JUDGE REDDY:
This is your fifth witness, am I right?  I missed two days of proceedings.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes, it is Prosecution witness No. 5, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness TAC. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You will be testifying in the Prosecutor v. Gacumbitsi.  You will be examined by the Prosecutor, and then Defence shall cross-examine you. 

At the present time I would like to bring to your attention that you must be very careful when you answer the questions put to you.  Please refrain from providing details that might reveal your identity. Moreover, if questions are put to you that might reveal your identity, please tell the Court.

At the present time, the registry is going to assist you for your solemn declaration. 
MR. JUMA:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up.
(Declaration made by Witness TAC in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank the witness who has just made a solemn declaration.

Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor. 

MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President, and if it pleases Your Honours to move into closed session, a brief closed session, so that we can establish the particulars of this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We move into closed session as requested by the Prosecutor.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session, and you may continue with your examination-in-chief of Witness TAC. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, we are now back in an open session, and I would ask you to be cautious when you are responding to my questions so that your identity is not revealed.

Witness, can you tell Their Lordships who was the most senior public official in your commune as of April 1994 ?
A.	Yes.  His name was Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.
Q.	And do you know what office he held, if any, in April 1994?
A.	Yes.  He was the bourgmestre of the commune.
Q.	Now, prior to April 1994 did you know Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	And how did you come about to knowing Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, Witness TAC?
A.	Before he became a bourgmestre he was a teacher, and there was a child I used to visit who was his pupil.  Subsequently he became bourgmestre, but he was also the chairman of a bank that I was a member of.

After he was sworn in as a bourgmestre in 1982 or 1983, I'm not sure of the year, he was presented to the people of the commune.  I had the opportunity to see him on that occasion.  Subsequently he chaired meetings at the secteur level, and at the time he would call a meeting at the commune level.

I also saw him on several other occasions on the market place when he would come to collect taxes and fees.  So I saw him on many occasions. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, can you tell Their Lordships, to the best of your recollection did you see Sylvestre Gacumbitsi in April 1994 subsequent to the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	And to the best of your recollection, how many times did you see him in April 1994 subsequent to the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I saw him on one occasion.
Q.	Do you recall the date or day of the week when you saw him in April 1994, Witness?
A.	Yes, I saw him one week.  It was in the week after the death of President Habyarimana.  It was a few minutes after 12.
MR KAREGYESA:
Could the Kinyarwanda interpreter advise us whether the witness mentioned the day of the week? 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English interpreter omitted the word "Friday".  It was mentioned, Friday. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, the witness did mention Friday.  Apologies from the English booth. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Now, Witness, this would have been on a Friday in the week following the death of the president, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And can you tell Their Lordships where you were on that Friday when you saw Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	On that day I was close to the Catholic centre at Nyabitare.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Nyabitare, your Honours, is No. 182 on the list. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	And can you tell Their Lordships what you were doing near the Catholic centre at Nyabitare on that Friday?
A.	Okay.  On that day and in the morning we were going to be attacked, or an attack was envisaged, and each person went to seek refuge.  I first of all went to a wooded area, and towards midday I saw people running towards the hills, houses were being burnt, and I had some information that people were going to seek refuge in Nyarubuye.

I tried to go there, gradually going up and down the hills.  Then when I got to the Catholic centre, about 30 metres from there I saw a vehicle, a pick-up, with some people on board.  It was a double-cabin pick-up.  I don't know whether it was a Hilux.  In any case, it was a pick-up.  There were policemen in the rear; in the cabin itself there was Gacumbitsi and some other people. 
Q.	Witness, I have asked you to pause so that I can advise you to speak slowly, because what you are saying is being translated from your language into French and English.
A.	Yes, thank you.  I will repeat.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, you have told Their Lordships that there were attacks that morning.  Can you be more specific and tell us to the best of your recollection whether you knew who the attackers were?
A.	Yes, there were attacks, and among the attackers there was Gacumbitsi, there was a certain Edmond Bugingo, and there were other attackers, but I wasn't able to see them.  They carried out these attacks against my family, but I learnt of it when I went back home.

Among the attackers you had Kabandanyi Gregoire.  I'm talking about those who attacked my family.  There was also the conseiller Nzabarinda, and others.  There were many of them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, could you spell some of those names, or maybe mention the numbers if they appear on the list that we have before us? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
The name Nzabarinda appears at No. 196.  And if I could ask the Kinyarwanda interpreters to spell the first name.  I am advised that Bugingo, Edmond, appears at No. 22, but there was another name that starts with "K" that I did not quite capture. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The other name mentioned by the witness is Kabandanyi, and it is spelt as follows:  K-A-B-A-N-D-A-N-Y-I.  Kabandanyi.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Now, Witness, you have also told Their Lordships that houses were being burnt.  Were you able to establish who the victims of these attacks were?
A.	Yes.  The victims who were subject to attack were the Tutsis, those belonging to the Tutsi ethnic group.  There were others, people who were opposed to Habyarimana's government, people who were known as Hutus but who did not support the genocide ideology.  So these were Hutus who did not agree that Tutsis, their Tutsi brothers, were killed. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you have mentioned Edmond Bugingo as one of the attackers.
A.	Yes.  He was the president of the Interahamwes at the commune.  He was the leader at that level, leader of the Interahamwes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And what about Kabanda Gregoire?
A.	In regard to Kabandanyi Gregoire, he was a teacher at the time and he was the CDR party leader.  He was very active when it came to the killings.  He was in charge of the CDR party in our secteur.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness had mentioned a certain secteur, but my Kinyarwanda colleague, the interpreter, did not get the name of that secteur.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, can you repeat the name of the secteur you are talking about? 
A.	Yes.  Kabandanyi Gregoire, was the CDR leader in the Nyabitare secteur.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Nyabitare, Your Honours, is No. 182 on the list.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Now, Witness, I want to take you back to when you saw a pick-up vehicle while you were near the Nyabitare Catholic centre.  Would you tell Their Lordships what transpired when that pick-up vehicle arrived?
A.	When the vehicle arrived the two policemen came out, particularly a certain Berakumenyo and Kazoba.  They went into the Catholic centre and they pulled out some young men, some boys, and one of the young men went by the name Rukomeza, and the other Mutunzi Vianney.  He was a well-known footballer, well known in the area. 
Q.	If you could pause, Witness.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, Mutunzi Vianney appears at No. 151 on the list; and Rukomeza appears at No. 213.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell us who else was in this pick-up you are referring to?
A.	When they left the place -- and I was not aware, I got to learn about it later on -- it was Gatete.  I didn't know Gatete personally.  I saw them.  I was able in any case to recognise Gacumbitsi and some other people.  Later on members of the population got to know that he was accompanied by Gatete.  I got this information later on, when I was already in Tanzania, because at the time I did not know Gatete. 
Q.	Witness, you say that Gacumbitsi was in the vehicle.  Did you yourself see Gacumbitsi in that vehicle on that day?
A.	Yes, I saw him in the vehicle with the policemen.  There were several policemen.  Two came out of the vehicle; I had already mentioned their names, Kazoba and Berakumenyo.  I saw them come out, they stood a bit, and then after pulling out the young men they were hitting them with the butt of their guns.  When they were outside I saw Gacumbitsi question those young men.  I didn't hear what he said, but they took something from their pockets.  I don't know whether it was money or identity cards.  There was a lot of noise, and I thought maybe they had given them money.  They were screaming, asking for mercy.  They were saying, "Forgive us.  Please don't touch us.  Kill us, shoot us, instead of killing us with a machete".  So they were killed in an atrocious manner.

But before they were killed, if my memory doesn't fail me, he left in a vehicle.  He left a policeman on the stop.  I don't recall the name of the policeman, because subsequently after he had left I went to seek refuge in some other place far from there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please could you slow down, maybe?  You are going too fast, and the interpreters find it difficult to follow you.  Can you speak a bit slowly?  Thank you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the witness mentioned the names of the policemen.  Kazoba appears at No. 99; the other name, not on the list, is Berakumenyo.  It is spelt B-E-R-A-K-U-M-E-N-Y-O.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Now, Witness, if you could, as the President advised you, just try and talk slowly so that the interpreters capture everything you are saying.

What was the distance between the banana grove where you were hiding and the Catholic centre where this scene you are describing was unfolding?
A.	It was a very short distance.  I would say about 30 metres.
Q.	And between you and where the scene was unfolding, was there anything to obstruct your view?
A.	I was in the banana grove.  I was close to a banana heap and I hid myself inside in a manner as to see what was happening. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, you have mentioned that Rukomeza and Mukunzi were removed from the --
A.	Mutunzi.
Q.	-- Mutunzi were removed from the Catholic centre.  Who removed them from the building?
A.	It's the two policemen who pulled them out or brought them out.  However, Gacumbitsi was also present. 
Q.	And did you know Rukomeza and Mutunzi prior to this incident, Witness?
A.	We grew up together, and we went to the same school. 
Q.	Did you know to which ethnic group they belonged?
A.	Yes.  They were of the Tutsi ethnic group. 
Q.	So can you tell Their Lordships what happened after they had been removed from the building and brought outside?
A.	Yes.  After they had handed over to their attackers something that was in their pockets -- I didn't quite see what it was -- they were promptly shot. 
Q.	Now, to the best of your recollection, Witness, were the policemen carrying any firearms on that occasion?
A.	Yes.
Q.	To the best of your recollection, Witness, was Sylvestre Gacumbitsi carrying a firearm on that occasion?
A.	No. 
Q.	And to the best of your recollection, Witness, can you tell Their Lordships whether you saw the person or persons who shot Rukomeza and Mutunzi?
A.	Yes.  Each, actually.  When they were shot those who were standing next to the victims were the policemen, Kazoba and someone else whose name I have already mentioned, and that was Berakumenyo.
Q.	Witness, to the best of your recollection, when Rukomeza and Mutunzi were shot, was Sylvestre Gacumbitsi present?
A.	No.  He had already left in the car -- or in his car towards Nyarubuye. 
Q.	And how did you know that the Accused was headed towards Nyarubuye?
A.	Very well.  If you know the road that he had taken, it is a one-way, there aren't several roads, and it leads to Nyarubuye.  It is a road that runs across the secteur.  There is no other road in that direction. 
Q.	Now, can you tell Their Lordships at around what time of the day was this incident you have just narrated?
A.	Yes.  If you remember what I had already told you, my previous testimony, when I decided to move towards Nyarubuye it was a few minutes past noon, past 12 o'clock, and the incident I have just narrated took place at about 1 p.m.  
Q.	Now subsequent to the shooting of Rukomeza and Mutunzi, did you see what happened?
A.	Yes.  It happened that their dead bodies were searched so as to take away all their possessions.  I saw a policeman do so.  So when I turned around I saw a policeman searching their pockets, but I don't know what he took out of it -- of them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, how long did you stay at your hiding place in the banana grove after this incident, Witness?
A.	After the incident I became extremely -- or very frightened.  I did not dare leave the place immediately.  I stayed there about -- for about three hours, all the more so because from what I had seen, there were no other killers who were going by there, and so that's the reason why I stayed there.  Subsequently, I left that place.
Q.	At around what time did you leave your hiding place?
A.	Yes.  Well, I wasn't wearing a watch, of course.  It was during the rainy season, in April.  It is a time during which there is heavy rainfall, and I think when I left that place it was around 3:30 p.m., and I moved farther away from there.  I would say I got -- I stayed at a place some 300 metres away from there.  And there again there was a banana grove; it was a wooded area.
Q.	Witness, can you tell Their Lordships whether on that afternoon you made any attempt to return to your homestead?
A.	Yes.  However, when I got home it was about 7 p.m.  
Q.	And can you tell Their Lordships what you found when you returned to your homestead?
A.	Yes.  At home, at my place, I could only see ruins.  Every building had been destroyed.  The cows had been killed to be eaten, and the people I had left at home were all dead -- mostly all dead.  Most of them were dead.  Very few people had survived. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Chamber how many members of your immediate family were killed on that occasion?  Please do not mention names, just give us the number.
A.	Regarding the people that died that day, I don't know the names of the very young ones.  There was a two-week-old baby, only two weeks old; there were the children of my paternal uncle I don't remember very well.  But ten or eleven people were killed, because those were the ones killed on that day.  The next day more were killed.  The figure I gave you is the number of people killed during the attack that took place on that day. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you remain at your homestead or did you flee that evening?
A.	After having seen what happened -- what had happened, and the very few people who remained at that place told me how -- what had happened, how things had started, and when I understood that where I had hidden my wife and children, that she and the children were still there and still alive, that night I decided to try and flee.  At that moment I was lucky, because I saw my sisters, my three sisters, who were still alive.  Then I saw a paternal uncle who also had survived.  During the night we therefore fled.  It was about 7:30 p.m., and we sought refuge in Tanzania. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, it is nine years since these tragic events you have just told this Chamber.  When you look back, how do you feel about these events, Witness?
A.	It is hard for me to express my feelings.  It was a tragedy.  It was a tragedy that occurred.  It is very hard for me to express my feelings in that regard.  I only have a paternal uncle and my orphaned sisters whom I care for.  I care for them, for all their needs. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, the events you have just narrated occurred on a Friday in the week following the death of President Habyarimana.  Do you recall the date?
A.	When I made a statement in 1997 it was three years after the events, and the question was asked.  The investigator from the Office of the Prosecutor that questioned me at the time asked me what date it had been, and I gave him an approximate date.  I think I mentioned the 14th or the 15th. 
Q.	And this would have been of April 1994?
A.	Yes, April 1994.  I don't remember the exact date, but it was either the 14th or the 15th. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, it is nine years since these events.  Would you be in a position to recognise the person you referred to as Sylvestre Gacumbitsi if you met him on the street?
A.	But I know him very, very well -- but really well.  I even know his younger brothers, and I know his children.  I might add that I also know his wife. 
Q.	Witness, I want you to stand up in this courtroom and tell Their Lordships whether you are in a position to recognise and identify the person you refer to as Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	Thank you.  I see him; he is over there.  He is sitting -- I think it is the second row, and he is wearing a sort of khaki-coloured jacket and a tie, and his shirt -- and a white shirt, as far as I can see.  The shirt is striped, and he is wearing spectacles, glasses, and he has scars on his face.  His complexion is a bit light, he has very few hair on his head, and he has got something looking like a bald patch -- amasoso, as we say in Kinyarwanda.
Q.	Witness, you have said he is in the second row.  Is he alone, or there is more than one person in that second row?
A.	He is with someone else who is wearing a blue shirt, unless I am mistaken -- if I'm not mistaken.  He is wearing something on his shoulder. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
A.	Some sort of badge or something on his arm.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, if the record could reflect that the witness has positively identified the person he has been referring to as Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.

I have no further questions for this witness, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let it be recorded that Witness TAC did recognise the Accused, Gacumbitsi.

We thank the Prosecution, and we now give the floor to the Defence for cross-examination of the witness. 
MR KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, could we have a 15-minute break before we begin the cross-examination, please? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, before you rule on that application  --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, sorry. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Before Your Honours rule on that application, could learned counsel for the Defence indicate how long he is going to be in cross-examination?  We have only taken less than an hour in examination-in-chief, and we need this information in order to prepare or to inform WVSS whether they should bring the next witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Can the Defence answer the question?  I was going to ask also:  How long will the cross-examination last? 
MR KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, the most precise answer I can give you is that if you allow me 15 minutes I will begin the cross-examination on the 16th minute.  When it will end, I cannot tell you in the present state of affairs, for the simple reason that as in the three last cases, it depends on the witness's answers.

As you know, this is criminal procedure; I must speak to my colleagues from time to time.  So to give you a precise time would be presumptuous on my part.  I would rather not, in the present state of affairs.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  All right.  Perhaps you might give us an approximate idea a bit later.  

We will therefore break for 15 minutes to allow you to prepare yourself, but then we probably won't take our break at 11:00, so please try to be precise, concise, so the cross-examination does not take too long.

We note the Prosecution only took an hour -- less than an hour, in fact, 54 minutes precisely, for examination-in-chief. 
MR KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Perhaps he could even have taken less, since he was only correcting what had already been said in 1997.  I will do my best, Madam.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing is adjourned for 15 minutes.
(Court recessed from 1004H to 1025H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Court is in session.  Judge Egorov would like to put a few questions to the witness. 

Judge Egorov, please. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Mr. Witness, you mentioned that Mr. Gacumbitsi arrived in a Toyota car.  Is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he came in a double-cabin Toyota Hilux.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Do you remember what was in the car besides the policemen and Gacumbitsi?  Was there anything else?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were various weapons in the rear tray of the pick-up.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  Could you recall what happened with these weapons?
THE WITNESS:
On that day I heard of the killings, and I also heard that they had been used to kill the inhabitants of the secteur.
JUDGE EGOROV:
So, do you mean that those weapons were distributed?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, they were distributed.  But when he reached the place where I was hiding, first he had gone around a bit, and I believe that he had already distributed the weapons somewhere else, because the secteur is quite vast, and I believe the weapons had already been distributed.  According to information I received that evening, I was informed that the weapons that were used by the local people, by the Interahamwe, were weapons that had been given to them. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  Mr. Witness, do you remember Mr. Gacumbitsi giving any instructions to the policemen who accompanied him?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  When they reached the Catholic centre -- or compound, rather, he spoke to them, but I could not follow their conversation.  But immediately after they entered the building, after speaking to them -- after speaking to him, and immediately after that they entered the buildings of the Catholic compound.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  I have a document; it seems to me it is your original statement .  Here in this document you said that "Gacumbitsi gave the policemen instructions that no Tutsi should be still alive at nightfall".  Is it correct?  Is that your testimony?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's correct.  He said those words when he spoke to the policemen and to the persons who were in charge of the secteur before they began the massacres. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Did you hear his instructions by your own ears? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes -- do you mean when he gave the instructions?  Because when he gave the instructions I did not hear him with my own ears.  These are words that were repeated to me by the survivors.  They are the ones who told me what he said that evening. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to thank Judge Egorov. 

Counsel Kouengoua, you have -- you may now proceed with your cross-examination. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Your Honours, with your permission and your consent, may we begin, Madam President, with a closed session as this is a protected witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we now move into closed session.  We move into closed session for a few moments. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 20 to 22] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Page 19 by Judith Baverstock)























	1045H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, you may proceed.  We are now in open session. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Witness TAC, as the Trial Chamber has just -- as Madam President has just stated, we are now in open session, and if any questions -- if you feel that any question might reveal your identity, please do not respond to the question, or advise us accordingly.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAC, you have told us that you are from ............ commune; do you know the name of the department that .............depended off?
A.	Rusumo was a commune.
Q.	And in what préfecture was the commune?
A.	..........
Q.	Was there a sous-préfecture in...............?
A.	It was nearby, approximately one kilometre away.
Q.	Witness TAC, do you know the name of the sous-préfet that was there?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was his name?
A.	His name was Joseph Habimana.
Q.	Witness TAC, as you know Joseph Habyarimana -- sorry, Habimana.  The names are sometimes a bit difficult.  I apologise for this mispronunciation.  

Did you know the sous-préfet Joseph Habimana?  I will now put the next question to you:  Who was the most important civil servant in .............commune?
A.	At the commune level it was Mr. Gacumbitsi.
Q.	To the best of your knowledge, between the sous-préfet and the bourgmestre, which of the two is a civil servant?
A.	The highest ranking civil servant between the two is the sous-préfet, but your question is specific, you're asking me who the most important person was at the commune level, and a sous-préfecture is composed of three communes, except that at the time there were only two communes, ....... commune and Rukira commune.
Q.	Therefore, you confirm before the Trial Chamber that the sous-préfecture -- there were two communes in 1994?
A.	As far as I remember, as someone who lived in the ............ commune, at the time we were told that sous-préfet Joseph Habimana was the sous-préfet of the subpréfecture and that the subpréfecture included the ........... and Rukira communes.  As far as I know, that is what we were being told.
Q.	Well, based on what you were told, they said ............ was part -- or was a commune of -- the same as Rukira; is that what you are saying?
A.	Yes.  Yes, that's correct.
Q.	TAC, at this juncture then, who is the most senior official in the Rukira subpréfecture?
A.	It was the sous-préfet.
Q.	But you stated before this Court earlier on that you knew Gacumbitsi before 1994?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	The Prosecutor asked you how you knew him, and you said, "He was a teacher; he had a child to -- whom I visited often;" is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	So that's Gacumbitsi's child?
A.	No.
Q.	Can you then explain?
A.	Unless I do so in writing, because there's some relationship I have with the kid.
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Your Honours, there's also a mischaracterisation of the witness's evidence.  In evidence-in-chief the witness did not suggest that the child was Gacumbitsi's child; he was visiting a child or a friend who was at the school where Gacumbitsi taught, and the Prosecutor submits, Your Honours, that the particulars of this child are unnecessary and irrelevant to this Trial.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kouengoua, I think witness talked about a pupil of Gacumbitsi in reference to that child.  Would you really know -- need to know the name of that pupil to continue your cross-examination?
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Not particularly, Madam President.  I wish to point out that, to explain how he knew Gacumbitsi; he said he was a teacher and that he had a child whom he had visited -- a child.  So I wanted to find out whether that was Gacumbitsi's child, that's all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So he has answered your question; he said that was not Gacumbitsi's child, so you can proceed.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I, indeed, will proceed.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Did you know Gacumbitsi's family?
A.	Yes, I knew the family very well.  I knew Gacumbitsi's wife, the way she looked, the way the children looked.  They are still there and we still meet.  I know the first name of one of the children.  As for the others, I don't know their names, but when I come across them I am able to identify them -- or recognise them as Gacumbitsi's children, even if I don't know their names, apart from the one whose first name I know.
Q.	TAC, how can you know a family without knowing their names?  We are in 2003.  Can you tell us how you got to know Gacumbitsi's wife?
A.	Yes.  Even if I lived in the secteur, which I had mentioned earlier, I had members of my family who lived close to the place where Mr. Gacumbitsi lived, and during holidays, when I was visiting my own family, it was easy for me to see members of Gacumbitsi's family who were passing by there -- who were strolling by there.
Q.	TAC, in answer to a question put to you by the Prosecutor, you said that Mr. Gacumbitsi was the president of a party?
A.	No, that was not my testimony.  I said that he was the president of the banque populaire while he was still a teacher, if my memory does not fail me.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, would it have been necessary to check on those points, because this was a matter of evidence during the examination-in-chief which, if my memory serves, it was the fourth question in open session.  If my memory doesn't fail me, he said:  "He was a teacher; he had a child whom I visited, he was the president of a bank.  I saw him come to the market on a tax drive.  He was the president of a party."  So, I cannot understand why 20 minutes later on --
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Your Honours, that is a total mischaracterisation of the witness's evidence.  My transcript that was being taken simultaneously indicates, as the witness has just said, that Gacumbitsi was the chairman of a bank to which this witness was a member.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I am grateful to the Prosecutor for assisting me, and that's why I was raising it here, so that I might be corrected.  I have done so off-the-cuff, so no big deal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can then proceed.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Much obliged.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Q.	TAC, in answer to a question put to you by the Prosecutor, you said in 1994 you saw Mr. Gacumbitsi just one time; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	When you say, "just one time" are you talking of just one time or just a single day?
A.	I said, "Once after Habyarimana's death."  Now, if you want to refer to 1994, you must remember that there were several months before the genocide.  And so, if I said "just once," I am talking about once after Habyarimana's death.  I believe your question -- or the question was referring to the period after Habyarimana's death.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Was is it just once or a single day -- just one day after Habyarimana's death?
A.	I saw him once.
Q.	When was that, please?
A.	Yes, as I explained, he came to the Catholic centre and I was going up to seek refuge in Nyarubuye, and when I got to that point, I saw his vehicle which was going to the Catholic centre, and I hid myself in a banana grove behind the Catholic centre.
Q.	Where was the banana grove, TAC?
A.	The grove -- banana grove was about 30 metres behind the Catholic centre.
Q.	Before that encounter, was it customary for you to go to the Catholic centre?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Could you describe for the Court and for myself -- could you describe this Catholic centre?
A.	It is a building, the foundation is made of stone, the walls are built with unburnt bricks -- adobe bricks, and the building has two sides, that is, you have a two-sided roof; it has white clay paint and the doors are made of wood, the windows also of wood.  Within, there is a hall, a small hall, which is the sacristy, then there is the huge hall where the service or prayers are held, and the floor is not cemented.
Q.	How about the outside?
A.	I did say that the walls were painted with white clay.  They were covered in white clay.  There's no pavement; it is not cemented, as I said.
Q.	No, I am not talking about the walls, I'm talking about the building.
A.	On the lower side of that Catholic centre, at about 10 metres from the centre itself, there is a school.
Q.	Is that all, Witness TAC?
A.	No, on the lower side of that school, there's a road which passes by the school towards the commune office and onto Nyarubuye.  There's a huge tree on the way, that is, on the lower side of the school, and that tree goes by the name ikivumu; ikivumu in Kinyarwanda.  In French that is fecus (sic) - F-E-C-U-S. 
Q.	Now, earlier on, you talked about the banana grove.  Is that banana grove not in the environs of the Catholic centre?
A.	Yes, yes.  There is a banana grove on the lower side of the road that I had mentioned earlier, but there is also some other banana grove on the other side close to one side of the primary school, and this stretches right behind the Catholic centre.
Q.	Are there any eucalyptus trees there?
A.	Yes, there are eucalyptus trees at the entrance to the Catholic centre when you're facing the market or the shopping centre, which subsequently was destroyed.
Q.	Now, which one is closer to the building, the eucalyptus or the banana grove?
A.	It's the banana grove, which is a couple of metres away from the Catholic centre.  As for the eucalyptus, it is in the background.  There is, further on, the primary school.
Q.	Between the banana grove and eucalyptus there are some coffee trees, aren't there?
A.	Yes, there was another place which was a coffee farm, but that doesn't exist any more.  On the upper side, close to where you had the eucalyptus, so next to that there was the coffee farm next to the road.  At the time the farm had old coffee trees and it does not -- that farm does not exist any more.
Q.	Who owned the banana grove?
A.	The banana grove belonged to some elderly man by the name Abduri Gahindo (sic); he was killed during the genocide -- sorry, Gahinda.
Q.	And who owned the eucalyptus trees?
A.	The eucalyptus trees were planted by the pupils of the primary school, and it was located next to the road leading to the primary school, so these were planted by the primary school pupils.  On the lower side of the eucalyptus there was an estate belonging to Claver Rukeribuga, and below that road again there is some land belonging to Bukambira who believed, who -- sorry, who lived below that huge tree, the ficus, F-I-C-U-S which had been alluded to earlier.  Below that there was another banana grove on the lower side of the road, and there, there was another man by the name Rugerinyange, who lived there with his second wife; himself, his wife and his children were killed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could those names be spelt, those names that have been mentioned by the witness?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Witness, you have mentioned some names, could you spell them?
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Your Honours, if he could be availed of a piece of paper and a pen so that he can write them out.
THE WITNESS:
I said that that at the entrance to the primary school on the lower side of the road after the ficus, F-I-C-U-S, located on the other side of the road -- so let me start with the banana grove.  There was a man who lived there by the name Bukambira, and he lived there with his family.  He was killed, together with his wife and children.  And next to him, if you stand next to the ficus, close to the road, facing the lower side of the road, there is some other house to the right with some other family living to the left-hand side.  They are quite close, and the distance separating both families was some 20 metres.  There was a man by the name Rugerinyange who lived there.  

Oh, I wrote down the names.  I talked about a banana grove where I hid, and it was behind the Catholic centre, and the owner of the banana grove was Abduri Gahinda. I don't know what you want me to do.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We want you to take a piece of paper, write down the names, and then read them out -- spell them out.
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  The first person's name could be spelt as follows:  B-U -- no, let me repeat, B-U-K - B-U-K-A-M-B-I-R-A, Bukambira.  Then Rugerinyange is spelt R-U -- so, it's R-U-G -- okay let me repeat:  R-U -- so R-U-G-E-R-I-N-Y-A-N-G-E, Rugerinyange.  Then Gahinda, Abduri.  Gahinda is spelt G-A-H-I-N-D-A.  Budori is spelt B-U-D-O-R-I --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Oh, it's Budori.  Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	You said that while you were some 30 metres away the bourgmestre came, or arrived.  You talked about his vehicle; which vehicle are you talking about?
A.	It was a Hilux, double-cabin pick-up.
Q.	And who was the driver of that vehicle?
A.	The driver was a man by the name Sebudandi, if my memory doesn't fail me.
Q.	What colour did the vehicle have?
A.	Khaki; however, on one side of the vehicle there were stripes, you know, lines that were drawn.
Q.	TAC, do you confirm the fact that the bourgmestre came in a double-cabin Hilux, khaki coloured?
A.	Yes.
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, on the 8th of April 1997, this same Witness TAC sitting before you said as follows, on page 2 of the witness statement, paragraph 3 --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Which the interpreters do not have, if I may.  The interpreters don't have a copy of that statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, could you then read it slowly so that the interpreters can follow you?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Grateful, Madam President.  

Madam President, I was saying that on the 8th of April 1997, Witness TAC, on a question/answer statement -- and I am referring to the witness statement on page 2, paragraph 3 -- he said as follows:  "He was in a Toyota Stout vehicle.  He was in a vehicle -- in a Toyota Stout vehicle."
THE WITNESS: 
It's true, it's been some time, and if I talked about a Toyota Stout vehicle, it might -- it must have been an oversight on the part of the person who took down my statement.  But, indeed, there was a Stout vehicle -- Toyota Stout vehicle belonging to someone by the name Hakizamungu.
Q.	Witness TAC, did you sign the witness statement you made in 1997?
A.	Yes, I did sign the statement, but I do indeed remember that I did not read the statement.
Q.	Are you telling the Court, Witness TAC, that the officials of the Prosecutor's Office prevent witnesses from reading their statements?
A.	No, that's not what I am saying.  I did not ask to read my statement; however, I think the investigator did not ask me or remind me to do so.
Q.	Could you tell the Court how -- what Gacumbitsi was wearing on that day?
A.	Yes.  As for what he was wearing, I don't quite understand -- I don't quite recall, it's a long time back.  He was wearing a pair of trousers, a shirt, but I don't have a specific -- very specific recollection.  But, you know, in order to be able to recognise the -- what the person is wearing while you are in hiding, it's not that easy.  I'd able to recognise his face, his features, but as for knowing whether he was wearing a suit with a tie, that's very difficult.  I saw his face and I hid myself.  I was a couple of metres away; I didn't have to raise my head at that point in time.
Q.	Which is more visible, the face or what the person is wearing?
A.	In actual fact, to tell you the truth, it is true -- you are with him right now, here and now, but if you asked him to stand in the midst of all these people and you came in through that door into this courtroom, you will see him.  And I am sure if you were together, he would even be the first person I would see before seeing you, in view of his height.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel Kouengoua, does that answer your question?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I don't think so.  I am putting direct questions to the witness.  The witness is not to comment on myself.  I am the one asking questions.  I don't want to get any lessons from him, and that's unacceptable, Madam President.  He is a witness and the law requires that he answers the questions or he remains silent.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thought the witness was trying to answer by providing some sort of an analogy.  

So, Witness, can you answer the question put to you -- that specific question put to you by Mr. Kouengoua?
THE WITNESS:
Now, immediately I got there I say the vehicle, which was parked, then I went into hiding where I was.  When I raised my head I saw these people entering the centre, and when they left there -- or when they came out of there, I saw them beating those young men with the butts of their guns.  And when they were outside I hid my head, but I had already seen that this was Gacumbitsi, without being able to recognise or identify what he was wearing.  That can be explained by the fact that I immediately hid completely so as not to be seen.  It was not easy for me to raise my head, so I hid myself completely -- carefully so as not to be seen.  

BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	You told the Prosecution this morning that the houses of the Tutsi and opponents of President Habyarimana had been looted; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Were the president's opponents killed?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Just as were the Tutsi?
A.	Yes, quite.
Q.	Witness TAC, if I remember correctly, you answered the Prosecution, and it can be corrected if I am wrong, that when the vehicle stopped, two policemen got down; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	You've just told us that when you came you saw the pick-up and you hid; is that correct?
A.	When I arrived the vehicle arrived at the same time and stopped as I was arriving there and I immediately hid, but I only hid when I saw them come out of the Catholic centre with the young people.  I hid, and then when I raised my head I saw them coming out from the centre with the young people and then I hid again.  That's how events occurred.
Q.	When you say you laid down, Witness TAC, you were in what position?
A.	When one hides, one attempts to hide one's body entirely.  So I lay down flat on my stomach.
Q.	And where were you coming from when you lay down on your stomach -- lay flat on the ground on your stomach?
A.	I had just crossed the road just below the school and I was going up.
Q.	Is that the same road that the pick-up went on?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you mean that there are two roads at that place?
A.	No.  No, there's only one road, but one branch of the road goes up to the parish, but in fact, it's at the -- it's a branch off the road in front of the centre, so there is a road from the main road to the Catholic centre and not the parish, so there is only one road.
Q.	Witness TAC, you've come from the school, you've just crossed the road in front of the school; is that what you are telling us?
A.	Yes, I left the school to go behind the centre, which is above the school about 10, 15, 20 metres, and it was then -- and it is there that there is a path that local inhabitants use to go to Nyarubuye.
Q.	Do you know the area called Migingo?
A.	I did not quite understand your question.
Q.	A region called Migingo, M-I-G-I-N-G-O?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Does it include Nyabitare, Nyarubuye and Kankobwa?
A.	Yes.
Q.	The road you are referring to earlier, does it go through the three secteurs?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So the road the bourgmestre took goes through Nyarubuye, Nyabitare and Rugingo (sic)?
A.	Yes.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I am just, Your Lordship, saying that if the road goes through the three centre -- through the three secteurs, can you tell us, of the three secteurs, which one is in the middle?
THE WITNESS:
Kankobwa secteur.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Let it be recorded that Witness TAC confirms that Kankobwa secteur is between Nyabitare and Nyarubuye.  

Witness TAC, in answering the Prosecution, you said that he left the Catholic centre to go to Nyarubuye parish.  The Prosecution asked, "How did you know that he was going to Nyarubuye"?
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Your Honours, Counsel is mischaracterising a question of counsel for the Prosecutor and the answer given.  No mention was made of Nyarubuye parish; the witness explained that the road leads to Nyarubuye.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank the Prosecution. 

Witness TAC said that the bourgmestre was going to Nyarubuye, and he was asked how he knew that and he answered, "Because that road goes straight to -- there."  He has just told us that Nar -- between Nyarubuye and Nyabitare there is Kankobwa secteur. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
There is a difference between final destination and direction.  The Prosecutor's question and the answer elicited by that question related to the direction and not to final destination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you clear this point up for us please?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  You see, normally, the road goes to Nyarubuye parish, but it also goes another place.  Nyarubuye parish is on the border with Rukira secteur and if the bourgmestre took that road, whereas it leads to the border of his commune, Nyarubuye commune, there was no reason for me to suppose that he was going to Rukira; I thought he was going to Nyarubuye, inasmuch as the leaders were in the habit of going to Nyarubuye because there were development projects -- there was a big church tbere.  And when we saw a leader heading in that direction, we were sure that he was going to Nyarubuye, and it was in Nyarubuye commune, unless he was going to Rukira.  But I personally told myself that since it was in his commune and on the border of his commune, he would not go beyond the border of his commune and, therefore, he was going to that place.  I should like to say this:  When the local people saw a leader take that road in that direction, we always thought that that leader was going to Nyarubuye.  I, therefore  -- either for a meeting, to see the priests, in fact, Nyarubuye was a very important place in Mikongo; it was the most important place in Mikongo.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Do you wish to continue, Counsel?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, Madam.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAC, at Nyarubuye Catholic centre, you saw the bourgmestre, or you caught a glimpse of him?
A.	I did not fully understand your question.
Q.	Witness TAC, at Nyarubuye Catholic centre, did you see the bourgmestre or did you catch a glimpse of him?
A.	I saw him.  The only thing I cannot remember is what he was wearing, but as for seeing him, I saw him.  I saw him well.  I knew him.  I could not have made a -- I could not have been mistaken.
Q.	Did he have a weapon?
A.	Are you asking me if he had a weapon in his hands or if his weapon was in the vehicle?
Q.	Witness TAC, did the bourgmestre have a weapon?
A.	Yes.  But in the vehicle, he had arms, weapons, in the vehicle.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Very respectfully, Madam President, I didn't ask the witness if he saw the vehicle, I asked him if he saw the bourgmestre or caught a glimpse of him, and the second question was whether he was bearing a weapon.
THE WITNESS:
The bourgmestre was not bearing a weapon in hand, the policemen with him were the ones bearing arms.  The arms I am referring to were in the car, in the vehicle.  It was those arms -- those weapons I was referring to when I said he had distributed them to members of the population in our secteur.  I never said that he was carrying -- bearing a weapon in hand.  Moreover, I think that I answered the Prosecution question as to whether he had an arm, and I said he was not bearing a weapon.  I remember having said that he had weapons in his vehicle.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q. (No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could the counsel please repeat the question?  We missed the beginning.
THE WITNESS:
The weapons were in the back of the pick-up.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That's the answer.  Sorry, we missed the question. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
For English booth, Madam President, I was asking Witness TAC whether he could tell us where the weapons were hidden in the vehicle.
THE WITNESS:
The weapons were not hidden.  You see, it was a double-cabin pick-up.  There were policemen in the back sitting in the vehicle, but in the back -- in the arms -- the weapons were also there in the back and Gacumbitsi was in front in the vehicle.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAC, I suppose that when you tell the Trial Chamber that there were policemen in back and that the weapons were in back, either of two things -- either the policemen were on the weapons or the weapons were on the policemen.  Could you please clarify that point?
Q.	I stated as follows:  The policemen were sitting in the back of the vehicle.  At their feet, where their feet were -- look at the desk where I am, you see the sides of the box.  Let's say it is the left-hand side and right-hand side of the vehicle, and the policemen are sitting on the edges of the vehicle and the weapons are in the middle; that was the situation -- they were sitting on the sides of the vehicle.
Q.	And you confirm to the Trial Chamber that you were 30 metres away in the banana grove?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Witness TAC, what is the distance between myself and the Prosecution?
A.	About 10 metres -- I think we should add about 10 metres, say about 15 metres.
Q.	Fifteen metres?
A.	No, I didn't measure the distance.  I'm talking in reference to where I was.  From the Catholic centre to the place where I was -- from behind the Catholic centre to the place where I was hidden, there was twice or two-and-a-half times the distance between yourself and the Prosecution.  I'd say from where -- it would be double the distance between you -- double to two-and-a-half-times the distance between yourself and the Prosecution.
Q.	With the Court's permission -- with the Trial Chamber's permission, could the Witness TAC stand up, please?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(No interpretation) 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, to answer my question, before you referred to the edge of your box as a point of reference; is that correct?
A.	I wanted to explain the vehicle --
Q.	Please stay standing.  And can you tell the Court what I have under my feet?  And here, we have less than six metres between us.
A.	As you can see, there's an obstacle, something -- there is a desk there, but where I was there was nothing in the way, apart from the banana grove; it was an empty space.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
May I continue, Madam?  Madam President, I ask these questions only in relation to what the witness was saying about the edge, Madam President. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Q.	Witness, you may sit down.  

Did you search Gacumbitsi's vehicle?
A.	Do you think that would be possible?  I am telling you what I saw with my own eyes.  I did not search the vehicle.  When you see a vehicle passing, carrying bunches of bananas or sacks of beans, you see clearly that it's foodstuffs, you don't need to go and search the vehicle to know that.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, I'm very respectfully asking the Trial Chamber to note that the Defence bench -- desk is lower than the back of a Toyota pick-up, but the -- and regarding distances, the full extent of the room does not exceed 20 metres from one end to the other.  

I shall continue. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I don't think Your Honours can take judicial notice of the size of the pick-up if no dimensions have been given in this Chamber.
JUDGE REDDY:
May I ask the witness a question at this juncture?  It may be the convenient time to ask the question.  

Witness, you told us that when you were hiding in the banana grove, you were on your stomach; you were in a crouching position, were you not?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE REDDY:
The point is, how then -- how then were you able to look inside of the tray of the Toyota vehicle from that position?  I think that's the point that learned Counsel is trying to labour.  Could you explain how you were able to see?

THE WITNESS:
Yes, I will explain.  In fact, when the two boys were taken down, they weren't shot immediately.  The vehicle turned and then drove off, and that's when I sort of got up to see where the vehicle was going.  I got up and I looked, and I saw in the back of the vehicle -- that's when I saw what the vehicle was carrying.  And it was immediately afterwards that the two boys were shot and I completely hid myself and did not get up again.  But when the vehicle turned to drive off, they hadn't yet shot the two boys.  And when it turned to leave, that's when I raised my head to see which -- where the vehicle was going -- in what direction it was going, and that's when I saw the guns that were stacked in the back.  I don't know whether they were the policemen's guns, because the policemen, in any case, had their own guns, and they were between their feet.  What -- and what drove me to immediately hide myself is the shooting, when -- as soon as I heard the shooting, and that was just as the vehicle was driving off, and that's when I hid again.  

What drove me to look was I wanted to know where the vebicle was heading.  I think I already told you that I was on my way to Nyarubuye, that's where I was going to seek refuge, and I wanted to know where the vehicle was heading, and that's when I took the decision to stay hidden at that place until nightfall.
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Pray continue.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Q.	Witness TAC, you have just answered His Lordship's question.

Did you follow the conversation between the bourgmestre and the policemen?
A.	No, no.  But when I got home at night I met people who had survived that day's massacres, and it was the survivors who told me that first he had a meeting with the policemen and the secteurial representatives, the leaders; he had a brief meeting with these people before they took up arms and began the massacres.  What was said was reported to me by the survivors, those that had survived the massacres of that day.
Q.	Witness TAC, at Nyabitare Catholic centre, how many policemen were there in the bourgmestre's vehicle?
A.	I did not count them.  I cannot tell you exactly, but I saw those that got down.  There were two of those, and I recognised them.  They were the ones I named, Kazoba and another called Berakumenyo, but I don't know the names of the others.
Q.	You said a moment ago that the bourgmestre left before the two boys that were removed from the Catholic centre were shot; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And then according to you, Witness TAC, they ran after the vehicle, or did they take another vehicle, or did they just stay guarding the Catholic centre?
A.	When I raised my head and the vehicle was leaving, I saw one of the policemen going through their pockets -- searching their pockets, but the vehicle was leaving, that's when he shot them.  But as to how they caught up with the bourgmestre, I can't tell you; I think perhaps they went down to lend a hand to the local population, but I can't tell you when they caught up with Gacumbitsi.
JUDGE REDDY:
(Microphone not on) 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
(No interpretation) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The booth would like to apologise, but we haven't quite caught what counsel was saying. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, for the interpreters:  I asked the witness to tell us, according to him, how the policemen, after having shot the two boys, caught up with their boss, the bourgmestre?  Did they stay guarding that place?  What happened to the two policemen, according to Witness TAC, at Nyarubuye Catholic centre?
THE WITNESS:
After Gacumbitsi's departure, I only saw one policeman.  I don't know how he left, but I do know that he didn't stay, because I think I already told you that after the shooting I did know -- I did not raise my head again.  But after two or three hours, I already told you that I left that place and a bit further on, about 300 metres away -- and when I raised my head I didn't see any policemen around.  But I couldn't tell you how they caught up with Gacumbitsi or whether they stayed in the secteur, or if they went off on foot.  I can't tell you anything about all that.  All that I know is that they did not leave together when the vehicle departed.
Q.	Witness TAC, every time you answer the prosecution you speak of the massacres, but to identify things, Mutunzi and Rukomeza, these were the two boys at the Catholic -- at Nyabitare Catholic centre?
A.	Yes, those two boys, Rukomeza and Vianney Mutunzi.  I am speaking of those that were killed on that day, because if any were killed the next day after my departure, I can't tell you, but on that day, the Friday, those two were killed at Nyarubuye Catholic centre.
Q.	Did Gacumbitsi -- was Gacumbitsi present at their assassination?
A.	I have already told you that Gacumbitsi arrived there, got out of the vehicle, spoke to two policemen who'd already -- who'd also got down from the vehicle.  They went into the Catholic centre building and came out with the two boys.  But before the boys were killed, before they were shot, he drove off; in fact, they were shot just as he left.
Q.	Witness TAC, can you tell the Trial Chamber -- are you telling the Trial Chamber that the policemen seized the opportunity of Mr. Gacumbitsi's departure to shoot the two boys?
A.	No; in fact, according to what I saw then, it was as though they were in a hurry -- they were in a race against time because it was getting late.  When he left, I say -- I'd rather say that he left the policemen on the spot, and drove off, but according to what I saw they were in a hurry because time was getting short.  It was about noon -- 1 p.m. as though -- the impression was that perhaps they had started the massacres a bit late; they didn't want to waste time there because there were only two people to be killed, and the secteur was where there was the most Tutsi.  I think it's probably where there were the most Tutsi -- the foremost place for Tutsi who were cattle raisers.  And this is why there were so many victims, because even the population from other secteurs around had come to participate in the massacres, because there were many cows.  One herder could easily have between 20 and 50 cows, and the population responded to these massacres because they wanted to come and share out the cows, and there were many victims, especially because of the wealth of the victims.  And I think that if he didn't spend much time there, it was because there were only two victims and time was getting on; it was getting late.  The news had already travelled around that many people had sought refuge in Nyarubuye.  That's even why I wanted to go to Nyarubuye, because I had heard that news.
Q.	Witness TAC, you said that even the assailants from surrounding areas were going there because of the wealth, the cows; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber some of the surrounding areas from whence assailants had come?
A.	Yes, but these are things that were told me because I, myself, ran away that night.  But, for example, the Stout vehicle referred to before was -- belonged to a certain Hakizamungu, had on board several people from Nyakarambi, Rusumo commune.  There was another Daihatsu pick-up which was full of people.  I didn't even know the owner of the Daihatsu.  There were Revela (phonetic) secteur, which also borders on Nyabitare, where there were Bakhiga people who come from Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfecture, who had been given plots of land along the Kagera and who killed a lot of people.  They drowned all the people who wanted to cross the river.  They even drowned my brother-in-law with his seven children when they were trying to cross the Kagera.  

He, himself, he knows; he came to collect the taxes in the secteur, and it took up to two days to collect taxes because of the number of head of cattle there were in the secteur.  It was a very prosperous secteur inhabited by cattle-raising Tutsi.  And because of the wealth, the whole commune -- all the leaders came to that secteur.  And I think that today there is not even a tenth of the population that there was then still alive.  

But as I am telling you, these were things that were reported to me afterwards.  It seems that he had come back to that place, but I had already left, and it seems that he even came with another person called Gatete from Byumba, from Nyakarambi commune, and they set up a camp in Gacumbitsi's commune with the refugees from Murambi commune.  And those refugees who had no food assistance because the World Food Program was not working in that secteur, it would appear that those refugees took the vehicles of the people who had been killed and came to kill people in Nyarubuye secteur, and at the same time steal foodstuff, pilfer foodstuff and the cows, which they could eat, as their loot from -- they are looting.  And that is why nearly the whole commune -- and the refugees who had come with Gatete attacked the secteur and that's why there were such large-scale killings.  I don't think there is -- there must be barely 20 survivors in the whole secteur.  And people sometimes were surprised at how many Tutsi were there, even the leaders would be surprised because there were many Tutsi in that secteur.  But I repeat, these are things that were told me.  

When we left there were people that came after me, two days or more, and then told me what happened after I left.  But even it was difficult for me to flee because Gacumbitsi had -- shooting all the boats crossing the Kagera, and people that were helping people to cross the Kagera were also shot, so these things were told me.  Perhaps other witnesses can tell you about it at greater length.  There was someone who helped us to cross --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please try to answer clearly the question; answer the question as precisely as possible.  Listen carefully to the question and then answer it as precisely as possible. 
THE WITNESS:
Fine. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Q.	Witness TAC, if you have followed what Madam President has asked you, please let's go back to the things you heard.  Did you hear before the assailants from Rukira, Gisenyi, Byumba came -- before these refugees and attackers arrived, were there any problems -- troubles in your commune?
A.	No, there were no troubles.
Q.	Witness TAC, you have stated to the Trial Chamber that you knew Gacumbitsi and his family before 1994 and that you know them even today.  Can you tell us what is the ethnicity of Gacumbitsi's wife?
A.	I have told you that I know them by sight, but I did not state that I knew what their ethnicity was.  Even though we were being followed and chased around, they had to ask for our identity cards, and if they didn't know you well -- if your attackers did not know you personally, then they would ask to see your identity card, because the identity card mentioned the ethnicity of the bearer, and if you weren't Tutsi, it would mention Hutu.  You will understand that if I said that I knew it -- I knew her but that does not mean I knew her ethnicity unless I looked at her identity card, but if I were to come across her, I would be able to tell you that it is Mrs. Gacumbitsi, absolutely.
Q.	Witness TAC, when you were lying down in the banana grove who was lying next to you?
A.	I have told that you that I was laying on my stomach where -- and there was no one next to me, and I saw no one near me.
Q.	Do you confirm this statement, Witness TAC?
A.	Absolutely.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I would like you to refer to the witness statement of 8th of April 1997.  This is the witness statement from the preliminary investigation, 8 April 1997, page 3, fourth paragraph, and I will read --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
For the record, the English interpreter states that she does not have a copy of the statement, and if counsel could please read slowly.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
"Who else was with you and can confirm what you said?"  TAC's answer:  "I was with my wife and my three sisters."
(Pages 23 to 39 by Judith Baverstock)
























	1215H
A.	I think that the person from the Office of the Prosecutor who was putting questions to me had asked me if all of the persons I mentioned had died during the genocide, I think that was the question that had been put to me.  And I said that those persons had died.  And I remember that my mother had died sometime before, but not during the genocide and that is why I didn't mention her name.  

I mentioned the names of the persons who died during the genocide and who were dead at the time, and that is when he wrote down the names.  Then he asked me who I was with.  And I think that is when I gave the answer that you have just read out, Counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you tell us when you said that you were with your wife and three sisters; do you remember what question was put to you?
THE WITNESS:
If my memory serves me right, the point I was referring to with my three sisters was in the evening, and other persons were there.  And other persons had survived the massacre that had taken place on that day.  And they told us how my family members had been killed and where they had been killed.  And the others even told us the names of the cellules where people were killed, because you could leave one cellule and be killed in another.  And that is when I was able to meet my wife and my three sisters and we fled together.  And that is what I told to the representative of the Office of the Prosecutor, to say that I fled with my family members who had survived, and that is why I mentioned their names as persons who could testify to it, because they had also received news about the massacres of our family members.  And I would like to add that we met around 7 p.m.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please continue, Counsel Kouengoua.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, with your permission, I would like to read another -- I would like to ask your permission to read another passage to the witness.  It is further -- it is higher up in the page.  Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	So in answer to a question put to you by the investigator,  "Could you tell us if Gacumbitsi was there at the time?  

Witness, answer" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel please slow down.  The interpreter does not have the document and cannot keep up.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I apologise to the interpreters. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	"Do you know who he allegedly killed with that weapon?

Answer:  A person named Vianney Mutunzi and a person named Rukomeza were killed by Gacumbitsi himself.  The two persons had first given him money, pleading with him for him to kill them with a bullet.  After killing them, he took the rest of their money. 

Where did he kill them?

Answer:  He killed them at the Nyabitare Catholic centre.

Where were you during this time?

Answer:  I was hiding close by in a banana grove.  We were looking for a way to go to Nyarubuye.  When we realized that that was where he was going, we then decided to cross the border to go to Tanzania." 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
And Madam President, this is the question: 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	"Who else was with you and can confirm what you have just told us?  

I was with my wife and three sisters."
A.	I would like to provide explanations, with your permission.  When they asked me if Gacumbitsi was carrying a weapon, I said yes because when you are a leader -- Gacumbitsi, it was almost as if he were the commanding officer of these policemen.  If I said that Gacumbitsi carried a weapon, I remember saying he wasn't carrying a weapon in his hand.  But as a commander, a commander of the police officers, they executed his orders.  

And later I have already stated that there were weapons in his vehicle.  And I have stated how I had -- people had told me that he had distributed weapons.  Unless the Defence counsel's question is to know whether Gacumbitsi shot them himself, but I have already said that the policeman was the one who shot them.  And in my understanding, if he was the commander of the policemen who were carrying weapons, then he also had weapons.  

When I say that he has weapons, I don't mean to say that he was carrying a weapon in his hand.  And this is why I told the investigators that Gacumbitsi had weapons.  In a few words, those are the explanations I can provide.  
I would like to add that as to my wife and sisters, I had been able to send a message to my wife, my sisters and children.  I had asked a Hutu friend of mine to tell them, and it was normal for him to know where I was hiding.  And he even tried to bring me food.  And my wife, who was well advanced in her pregnancy could do nothing, and hid at the house of a Hutu friend.  

And I asked this person, when this person brought me food, to instruct my wife to stay where she was.  She knew that she couldn't do anything, but if she had the strength then she could join me so that we could go to Nyarubuye together.  I told them what itinerary I was going to follow so that they could join me.  

And you see, when you hide you cannot take a straight road.  And if I left my house at 12, I could have reached Nyarubuye -- where I was hiding at 12, I could have reach Nyarubuye at 6 p.m.  And I think that is where this information comes from, that we were going to Nyarubuye, but in reality, at the time I was alone.  But after that, my three sisters came to follow me, but they felt the situation was very tense and they went back to the place where they were hiding previously.  And this is how we were able to meet -- to gather in the evening.  

In reality, we weren't together, but I had arranged for a message to be sent to them that they should follow me to Nyarubuye because that is where everyone was seeking refuge.  That is how the situation unfolded. 

The person who wrote down my statements might have made a few mistakes or not so perfectly followed what I said in my statement.  But what I am telling you today is the manner in which the events took place.
Q.	Witness TAC, at the Nyabitare Catholic centre, Vianney Mutunzi and Rukomeza were killed.  Are you telling the Trial Chamber that there were only those two?
A.	Those are the two that I saw that were brought out and killed.  If there had been others, I didn't see them.  Maybe -- they could have been seen subsequently, but I was only able to see those two.
Q.	Witness TAC, what you have heard -- based on what you have heard, when did the RPF enter Rusumo commune?
A.	I think you should ask the persons who were present when they arrived what the answer to that question should be.  When the RPF arrived, I personally was in Rusumo. 
Q.	Thank you, TAC.  Can you tell us if you heard if anything happened at Nyarubuye parish, and at what date?
A.	People say, but I only heard this upon my return, nevertheless, on the day the incident took place at the catholic centre, starting at 2:30 p.m. up until 5 p.m., there was a great deal of noise, of shooting coming from the direction of the parish.  And most of the people who were going to Nyarubuye stopped on the way and were killed in the secteur.  

In view of the shooting that could be heard between 3 and 5 p.m., all of the people who were fleeing stopped.  And that is why I stopped at the centre because many people who were on the way to Nyarubuye who had left before me came back and were killed in Nyabitare secteur.  

As to Nyarubuye, my paternal aunt's family was decimated there.  It was a family of over 30 persons and not one of them survived.  That is what I know.  Many persons were killed in Nyarubuye.
Q.	Witness TAC, now you are saying that Gacumbitsi prevented you from going to Nyarubuye or was it because you heard the shooting that you didn't go to Nyarubuye?
A.	Before I hid I had not yet heard the shooting, I hid from Gacumbitsi.  And I mentioned the place where I was hiding before.  I left that place, as I said because they had started to burn the houses down in my locality and destroy them.  I saw people running and screaming on the hills and I decided to go to Nyarubuye.  

But in reality, even if I was hiding, there was a reason for that.  I was hiding that morning because on the Thursday we had been told that Gacumbitsi's secteur, the one which he resided which was called Kigina, which is close to the Rusumo commune office, many persons had been killed in that secteur, and these are secteurs that are nearby.  Kigina is neighbouring -- neighbours of Nyabitare.  And people were saying on that Thursday that in Kigina secteur and in other bordering secteurs, massacres had took place, and that the day that followed -- the next day near Nyabitare would also be a target, that is why I went to hide.  And some went to Nyarubuye, others did not reach Nyarubuye and stopped on the way.  

When I saw Gacumbitsi's vehicle, and in view of the information that I had received that Gacumbitsi had played a role in the massacres in the other secteurs, when I saw the vehicle I hid.  But, in fact, when I hid I had not yet heard the shooting coming from Nyarubuye.  

When the vehicle left, quite a long period of time elapsed, I would say over an hour before we started to hear the shooting coming from Nyarubuye.  That is when we heard the explosions and we heard the steady gunfire from different types of firearms, explosions of grenades and I don't know, all kind of weapons.  One could almost have thought that it was loud music.  

Nyarubuye is far away on the horizon, far from where I was.  And from where I was, you could hear the sounds.  I would say that there was a valley between Nyarubuye and Nyabitare.  When you go from Nyabitare and follow the road used by most people, you cross a river, then you go up toward the place called Nyarubuye, and it is beyond Nyabitare.  
So when something happens in Nyarubuye, because of the valley, you can hear echoes in Nyabitare because of the valley and the river.  So you could have thought that the sounds were coming close by and not far from where I was.  And this is why all of those who were thinking to seek refuge in Nyarubuye, came back.  They came back and were killed in the place where they were living.  

Subsequently, all of the persons that were in Nyarubuye were not killed.  We were able to meet survivors that told us that Gacumbitsi had arrived and had triggered the massacres.  I wasn't there; it was the people talking about it.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I would have concluded the cross-examination way back, but witness went on and on.  I think I should end here because Trial Chamber is aware of the fact that answers are being provided to questions that I have not raised.  

I am most grateful, Madam President, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kouengoua.  

Do you have any redirect, Prosecutor?
MR. KAREGYESA:
No questions, Your Honour, for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor. 

Witness, we have now come to the end of your testimony, you were kind enough to volunteer to testify.  We wish you a safe return to your place.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could the witness then be led out of the courtroom?
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, do you have some other witness who is ready?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes, Your Honours, we do have another witness.  We actually thought we would have been able to start on that witness earlier than this.  In light of the fact that there is little time remaining between now and the lunch break, I'd prefer starting on the witness after lunch.  

I must say, Your Honours that the next witness is equally short; the testimony shouldn't last 45 minutes in-chief.  So we should be able to dispose of that witness this afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So it is TAK, is that right?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

Very well then, we will adjourn and resume at 2:30 p.m.  Thank you. 
(Court recessed at 1240H and resumed at 1432)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, you have the floor.  The hearing is resumed. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. If it pleases Your Honours, the Prosecution calls Prosecution Witness No. 6, pseudonym TAK.  If the courtroom officer could please lead him into the chamber? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness TAK.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is being -- you are appearing to testify in the Prosecutor versus Gacumbitsi.  And we will start by asking you to make a solemn declaration.  You will be questioned by the Prosecution, then by the Defence and perhaps by the Judges.  

We will be giving the appropriate instructions, and the registrar will now administer the solemn declaration, solemn oath.
MR. JUMA:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up.  Could you please raise your right hand and repeat the following words after me. 
	(Declaration given by Witness TAK in Kinyarwanda)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  We will now give the floor to the Prosecution. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  
Registry, could you please hand this information sheet to the witness?
WITNESS TAK,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, you now have been given the personal information sheet; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And do you confirm that the particulars on that sheet are correct?
A.	Yes, I can.  But I don't understand the words that appear at the bottom, on the bottom of the page, on the last line.
Q.	Is it the last word you do not understand, Witness?
A.	Yes, the word is written in a language that I do not understand.
Q.	Witness, were you a trader or businessman in 1994?
A.	No, I was not a trader, I was a farmer.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Witness.  Registry, could you please retrieve the information sheet from the witness and give it to the Lordships.

Your Honours, those are the personal details of the witness who is protected.  And we request that information sheet be placed under seal. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
(Not translated)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please take this document and give it to the Defence?  And if your witness will be so kind as to sign this document before it is placed under seal.  And I believe, however, that we should first correct the item that he corrected for the record.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Defence would like to know if the witness was able to read what appears in this document and that is why we would have asked for the floor earlier to ask in which language this document is written, because while he was reviewing the document we did not hear any translation of the document.  Therefore, that means that the witness understands the language the document is written because we did not receive a translation of the document that he was reading.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you understand what was written in the document that was placed before you?


THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understood.  It was only the last two words of the last line that I could not understand.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Does the Defence, therefore, understand this to mean that the witness understands English perfectly?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, if you may please assist, the witness was able to identify the particulars that belong to him.  Counsel has had the particulars for the last two months.  If Counsel is unrestrained, then we might as well go back into closed session.  And I am perfectly happy to lead evidence verbatim from this witness.  Your Honours advised the Prosecution this morning to adopt this procedure, and I see no difficulty.  And if Counsel has any questions, he is free in cross-examination to cross-examine this witness on those details.  

Most obliged, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is subsequently right.  I was the one that suggested to the Prosecution that we should proceed in this manner so that we would avoid wasting any time with the identity of the witness.  

The witness has said that he understood what was mentioned in the document, with the exception of the last line and asked that the words be explained to him; and he has now answered.  But this does not mean that he is able to express himself perfectly in the language.  But he did say that he did understand what appears in the personal information sheet.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you.  Our only concern was to determine what language the witness spoke and understood.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.  Prosecution may proceed.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, we are in an open session and have established your identity and particulars on the basis of the information sheet I have just shown you.  I am going to be asking you questions.  And I advise you to be cautious when you are responding to my questions not to give any information that might divulge your identity.  Have you understood me?
A.	Yes, I understand.
Q.	Now Witness, prior to April 1994, you were a resident of Rusumo commune in Kibungo préfecture; isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now prior to April 1994, did you know the bourgmestre of your commune?
A.	I did.
Q.	And can you tell the Lordships the name of your bourgmestre up to April 1994?
A.	Our bourgmestre, ............ commune's bourgmestre was Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.
Q.	And for how long had you known Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, prior to April 1994?
A.	I knew him when he became bourgmestre of .............. commune.
Q.	And do you recall the year?
A.	No, I don't remember very well what year, but at the time when he became bourgmestre of .......... commune I was no longer a small child, I was an adult -- adult and I could take part in meetings, so I was adult enough to know him.  And when I got married, he officiated at my civil wedding.
Q.	Witness, when did you get married?
A.	In 1991.
Q.	And in what capacity did Sylvestre Gacumbitsi officiate at your wedding?
A.	He officiated at the wedding in his capacity as bourgmestre of Rusumo commune.  Under the law, he was the civil servant who had the capacity to celebrate -- officiate at civil marriages.
Q.	And did you see him often thereafter say between your marriage in 1991 and April 1994?
A.	Yes, I saw him often.
Q.	Now, it's nine years since 1994; if you met him on the street today, would you be able to recognise him?
A.	I think I would be able to recognise him.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now taking you back again to 1994, did you know a person called Augustin Kanyagote?
A.	Yes.  I knew him.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the name is No. 87 on the list.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Did you know his occupation?
A.	Yes, Kanyagote was what we call a basic agricultural extension worker in animal husbandry in the Rusumo area.
Q.	Was he therefore an employee of the commune?
A.	Yes, he worked for the commune, but at secteur level.  Of course, he was paid by the commune; he was a commune employee, therefore.
Q.	And did you know his ethnic group?
A.	Yes, I do know.  He was Tutsi.
Q.	And did you know his family, wife and children?
A.	Yes, I knew them, I knew his wife, I knew his children.  Moreover, his wife was from the secteur where I resided.
Q.	Now, subsequent to the death of President Habyarimana in April 1994, did you ever meet Augustin Kanyagote?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	And do you recall the date or day of the week when you met Augustin Kanyagote?
A.	It was a Thursday, in the evening at about 5 p.m.
Q.	And do you know -- do you recall the date?
A.	Yes, I remember the date.  It was a difficult time; I couldn't forget such a date.  It was the 14th of April.
Q.	And that would have been April 1994, Witness; isn't it Witness?
A.	Quite, April 1994.
Q.	Now, you have told the Lordship that you met Augustin Kanyagote on April 1994 at around 5 p.m.  Where exactly did the two of you meet?
A.	We met when he was coming from Nyarubuye where he lived and we met in Nyabitare secteur at Nyamadeke.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Perhaps that should be Nyamateke, excuse me.
MR. KAREGYESA:
And Nyamateke, Your Honours, is No. 186 on the list.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Can you explain to the Lordships the circumstances under which you met Augustin Kanyagote on that occasion?
A.	On that day, the date I mentioned, it was the second day of my fleeing from hill to hill to try to escape from the people trying to kill me; and that day was the second day.  Assailants, who were Interahamwe, and the other people participating in the attacks had just come home, because they went home in the evenings to share the loot that they had pilfered.  And it was then that I met Kanyagote.  He was with two young men.  So we met, and I asked him -- 
Q.	Witness, can you please pause?
A.	-- what the situation was at his home place.
Q.	Witness, your answers are being interpreted into English and French for the benefit of the Chamber.  And I would appreciate if you slowed down so that the interpreters can capture whatever you are saying.  And maybe with that, I will take you back a bit. 

You have just told the Lordships that you had been in hiding for two days?
A.	Yes, it was the second day.
Q.	And that there had been attacks.  Can you please tell the Lordships who were responsible for the attack that put you in flight?
A.	The attacks that caused us to flee were by the people we called Interahamwe, who were Hutu, and it was those people we were running away from.
Q.	And were you in a position to establish the targets of these attacks you have just referred to?
A.	Yes, it was us, the Tutsi, every Tutsi, any Tutsi, including me.
Q.	And similarly, were you able to establish why the Tutsis were being targeted?
A.	It was for political reasons.  Personally, I wasn't very well informed about all of that, I really wasn't very well informed, I knew that it was for political reasons but I didn't know more than that.  And I wasn't very well informed because I wasn't very involved in politics.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, it is your evidence that you met Kanyagote whilst you were in flight.  Could you tell the Lordships what transpired when you met Augustin Kanyagote and his two sons?
A.	Yes.  So, we met and told each other how things were, what the situation was, what was going on here and there, the people that were chasing us.  He told me that he had taken the decision to seek refuge in Kigina secteur, at Gacumbitsi's since they were friends.  So that he could protect him or give him someone or some people to accompany him to seek refuge in Tanzania; that is what he told me.  

And then I asked him if he knew where the roadblocks were since he had been moving around in the daytime.  He told me he didn't know where the roadblocks were.  After that exchange, I told him I hadn't been able to find a way to flee and I asked him to allow me to go with him.  And I, moreover, asked him to wait so that we could leave after nightfall in order to try and avoid the killers.  

And at about 6:30 p.m., 7 p.m. we started out with his two sons and we talked at length as -- on the way.  And I decided to be with him, but not to the same destination as he, to stay close to where he was going.

	1500H
Q.	Witness, now after your discussion with Augustin Kanyagote, did you proceed with him to Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	No, I didn't get as far as Gacumbitsi's house.  I told Augustin that he could go to Gacumbitsi, and if Gacumbitsi granted what he requested, then perhaps he could tell him that she was with others.
Q.	Now, Witness, did you leave the location where you met Augustin and take the direction with him towards Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	Yes, we left together, but I did not go as far as Gacumbitsi's house.
Q.	Did Augustin Kanyagote and his children go as far as Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you've told Their Lordships that you didn't go as far as Gacumbitsi's house.  Can you us -- can you tell the Chamber at which point you stopped?
A.	I didn't go right after Gacumbitsi's place, but quite near there.  I didn't cross the road to go into his house.  I didn't go above the road; I crossed the road, since his house was on the road.
Q.	And can you give us an estimate of the distance between where you stopped and Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	I stopped at about 50 yards.  That is an estimate I am making.
Q.	And from where you stopped, could you see Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	Yes, I could see Gacumbitsi's house.
Q.	And from your location, Witness, approximately 50 yards away, did you see Kanyagote and his son enter Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	Yes, they entered Gacumbitsi's residence and I saw them go in.
Q.	Now, Witness TAK, how long did you remain at your location approximately 50 yards away from Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	I remained there for about an hour, waiting to see what was going to happen after that.
Q.	Now, are you able to tell Their Lordship, Witness, whether indeed Sylvestre Gacumbitsi gave or rendered any assistance to Augustin Kanyagote?
A.	To tell you the truth, he did nothing for him.  However, sometime later, I heard a crowd of people coming making a great deal of noise as if they were quarrelling.  And these were people that were leaving Gacumbitsi's house.  I heard someone say, "Gacumbitsi, please, let me leave to be killed by other persons".  And I understood that these were the people who had gone to Gacumbitsi's house, and I was afraid, and so I turned around and left running.
Q.	Now, from your location, Witness, were you able to recognise, or otherwise, identify whose voice it was you heard pleading for mercy?
A.	Yes, it was someone who was with me and I knew before.  I heard his voice and understood that it was Kanyagote that was being beaten.
Q.	Now, Witness, from your location approximately 50 yards away, were you able to observe what was happening?
A.	Yes, I saw a crowd of people coming from Gacumbitsi's house and they were beating someone, it was a fight and the people were going towards the road towards my location.
Q.	And can you tell Their Lordships, Witness, whether you were able to identify any of the people who were in this crowd?
A.	No, I only heard Kanyagote's voice who was begging them to allow him to leave and be killed by other persons.  I was not able to recognise anyone with the exception of Kanyagote.  I did not recognise any of his attackers.
Q.	And is this because it was dark, Witness?
A.	Yes, it was night.  And you will understand yourself that when you are afraid, you cannot clearly distinguish.  Your heart wouldn't be into closely observing what was going on.
Q.	Witness, do you recall at around what time of the night this was when you heard this crowd leaving Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	I believe it was between 9:30 and 10 p.m.
Q.	Now, to the best of your recollection, Witness, do you -- to the best of your recollection, do you recall the exact words that you heard Kanyagote say?  And if you do, would you please repeat them to this Chamber?
A.	I remember the words that Kanyagote said.  They were pushing him and beating him  and he was saying, "Gacumbitsi, forgive me, allow me to leave and have other persons kill me".  He was shouting very loud and I could hear his voice.  It was someone who was shouting begging the people who were beating him.
Q.	And to the best of your recollection, Witness, do you know whether Gacumbitsi ever responded to these pleas of mercy?
A.	No, I don't know if Gacumbitsi ever actually answered him.  There was such a loud noise, people speaking at the same time making a lot of noise.  And so I wasn't able to establish whether or not he gave him an answer.
Q.	So, Witness, do you know what happened subsequent to this beating of Kanyagote?
A.	I don't know what happened after that, because I immediately left the place where I was and went to hide somewhere else.  Therefore, I do not know what happened after that.
Q.	Witness, can you tell Their Lordships whether you subsequently that night, or any other occasion, saw Augustin Kanyagote and his two children?
A.	I did not see them.  I have not seen them again.  Subsequently, I found out that Gacumbitsi killed them at Gacumbitsi's house.  I found this out subsequently and I never saw Kanyagote after that.
Q.	Did you ever see the remains of Kanyagote that night or on any other occasion?
A.	No, I was not able to see his body.  Nevertheless, in 1997, when they were reburying the persons who had been killed at that place - - and many persons were killed at a roadblock close by - - at the time we recognised his remains and we recognised them by the clothing that their remains were wrapped in because I had seen his clothing on the day he was killed and I recognised the clothing.
Q.	Now, Witness, subsequent to this incident, did you have occasion to meet or otherwise see 
Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	I saw him.  I saw him on the next day.
Q.	And is it correct that that would have been Friday the 15th of April 1994, Witness?
A.	Absolutely.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, if you please.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Please proceed, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the Prosecutor is leading the witness.  I believe that the witness has yet to mention the date of the 15th of April.  The Prosecutor is putting words into the witness's mouth.  Up until now the witness only spoke of the 14th, I believe.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He said the day after.  The day after the 14th, that would be the 15th.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
But maybe it wasn't Friday.  Madam President - - Madam President, you can interpret it the way you want, but the -- this information provided by the witness and we can only repeat information provided by the witness, even if he tells the truth, he might be mistaken.  No one can help him.  If he says the day after, then it's the day after.  If the day after is Sunday or Wednesday, that's his prerogative, but we would not like to see words being put into his mouth the day after would be Friday.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we are just saying that the day after the 15th, but we cannot -- the witness did not say that the day before was a Thursday, therefore, we cannot make the jump that the day after was a Friday.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, my record clearly indicates that the witness said it was Thursday the 14th.  Ordinarily, I wouldn't ask a leading question but, Your Honour, it is permissible.  Indeed he -- the record reflects that it was Thursday the 14th.  This Chamber inclusive of counsel should be able to assume that the day was Friday the 15th.  It caused no prejudice to the Accused, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
I believe that the Defence referred to what was said today, what was said this afternoon.  Are you referring to what was said in the witness statement perhaps?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, in examination-in-chief, I asked the witness whether he knew the day of the week or the date.  He first gave the day of the week as a Thursday and subsequent -- the subsequent question was whether he knew the date, and he said it was the 14th of April, and I asked him, "Do you mean April 1994?"  And the answer was in the affirmative.  I don't really see why counsel should make -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, very well.  I have found in my notes that indeed he did say Thursday -- Thursday night.  I have found this in my notes.  I am sorry, Counsel.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Your Honours.  Thank you.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, maybe to clear any lingering doubt, can you tell Their Lordships the day and date that you saw Gacumbitsi after the incident you've just referred to?
A.	When I saw Gacumbitsi, it was on the 15th of April 1994.  It was in the afternoon and he was in the commune vehicle, and I saw him with my own eyes.
Q.	And can you tell Their Lordship where you were when you saw Gacumbitsi on that occasion?
A.	I was hiding in an area near the road where there were bushes.
Q.	And can you tell Their Lordships when you say you saw Gacumbitsi, was he stationery or was he travelling?
A.	He was in a vehicle that was in movement.
Q.	And how -- and how close was your hiding place to the road on which the vehicle was travelling?
A.	Approximately 10 metres.
Q.	And in what vehicle was Sylvestre Gacumbitsi travelling, Witness?
A.	He was in a double cabin pick-up like a Hilux.
Q.	(Inaudible)?
A.	Yes, I remember the colour.  It was yellowish, a washout yellow.
Q.	Would that also be the same as a cream, somewhere between white and yellow, Witness, or 
off-white?
A.	It is a colour that is between yellow and khaki.  It's not really yellow.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And was Gacumbitsi alone in this vehicle?
A.	No, he was not alone, but the people I was able to see were the persons who were sitting in the back.  I was not able to count, but there were people in the back as well.
Q.	Now that would be on the rear tray of the pick-up truck, Witness, isn't it?
A.	Yes, I am referring to the rear tray, because that was the part I was able to see when the vehicle went by the place where I was located.
Q.	And were you able to identify the people that Gacumbitsi was travelling with?
A.	No, I was not able to identify them and the vehicle was going by very fast, and I was afraid.  So I was not able to identify them.
Q.	Do you know which direction the vehicle was headed?
A.	I could see that the vehicle was going in the direction of Nyabitare.  It was coming from Rusumo and was heading towards Nyabitare.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Were there any other vehicles on the road at that same time, Witness?
A.	After Gacumbitsi's vehicle went by, another vehicle followed, blue this time, like a stout.  It was a Toyota stout vehicle.  And some time after that, another vehicle, Daihatsu, in which there were many people dancing in the vehicle.
A.	When you say people dancing in the vehicle, Witness, what exactly do you mean?  Can you be more specific?
A.	There were a lot of people singing Interahamwe songs.  The type of song that they would sing when they were hunting men -- victims, and this proved that they were Interahamwe.  They were wearing uniform made of straw or banana leaves.
Q.	And on which of the two pick-ups were these persons who were singing Interahamwe songs, Witness?
A.	They were in the vehicle that was following Gacumbitsi.  It was a Toyota stout, and there was also the vehicle that came by last.  That was a Daihatsu type vehicle, and that is where most of the people were that were singing Interahamwe songs, but they were singing, "Let's exterminate them.  Let's exterminate the Inyenzi", and other songs of this type.
Q.	Now, were there -- you've also told Their Lordships that there were people travelling on the tray of Gacumbitsi's pick-up, did they wear any distinctive items?
A.	In truth, I did not pay attention to the type of clothing that they were wearing, but there were persons not many, but there were persons in the rear tray of the vehicle.
Q.	Witness, let me rephrase the question.  You've told Their Lordships that there were two people on the two pick-ups that came after Gacumbitsi's pick-up, the stout and the Daihatsu pick-up had people who were dancing or singing Interahamwe songs.  You've also told us they wore straw or straw and banana leaves, and you have identified them as Interahamwe.  All I am asking is whether the people you saw on the first pick-up; that is, Gacumbitsi's pick-up, were similarly dressed or were they dressed in a different -- in different attire?
A.	Those who were in the last two vehicles were the ones who were wearing these art costumes, straw and banana leaves, but in Gacumbitsi's vehicle, there might have been between three and five persons in the rear tray of the pick-up and they were not wearing a particular uniform that struck me as odd.  There was nothing that struck me as being odd in what they were wearing.
Q.	Do you recall whether they were in civilian attire or any form of uniform?
A.	What do you mean?  I'm not sure I understood your question.
Q.	Do you recall whether the people you saw on Gacumbitsi's pick-up wore civilian attire or were in uniform?
A.	I have told you that I had paid attention to Gacumbitsi.  I was focusing on him and when I saw him I became frightened because I realised that I could also be killed and I ran.  I fled immediately.  I did not pay close attention to his vehicle.  And even the two other vehicles that I was speaking of, I was not right next to the road, I had already left the place where I was hiding next to the road and was running away.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, do you recall at what time of the day it was when you saw Gacumbitsi's vehicle drive by?
A.	I don't remember the time specifically, exactly.  All I know is that it was in the afternoon, but I will not be able to provide you with the time because I didn't wear a watch.  But if I were to take into consideration the time I spent there, I could say this took place in the afternoon.
Q.	And, Witness, for how long did you stay in hiding after this incident?
A.	Are you referring to that same day?
Q.	I'm asking when you came out of hiding altogether, not just on that day.  Or for how long did you remain in hiding?
A.	I spent a great deal of time in hiding, because I did not seek refuge in another country like Tanzania.  During the whole genocide, I remained in hiding.
Q.	Now, Witness, during the month of April 1994, did you loose members -- any members of your family?
A.	Yes, many family members died.
Q.	Witness, you've told this Chamber that you would be able to recognise Sylvestre Gacumbitsi if you met him on the street.  I would like you to stand up and look around this Chamber, and tell Their Lordships whether you can identify Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.
A.	The gentleman who is sitting over there behind the other people.  I know him well enough.
Q.	Can you tell Their Lordships what he is wearing?
A.	I can see him.  He is sitting in the back over there.  He is wearing a khaki coloured-jacket, a khaki-coloured jacket, a white shirt, a tie and glasses, and he is trying to loose his hair; he is going bald.  That is the way he was in 1994 even.  He hasn't changed at all.
Q.	Witness, please stand up and tell Their Lordships which row the Accused is sitting in?  Is it the first row, the second row, or the third row?  Please stand up.
A.	He is sitting in the second row if you start with the one where those people are sitting there, two people sitting in that row.
Q.	And what is the second person sitting next, who you have identified?  What is the second person wearing?
A.	He is wearing a shirt that looks almost green with insignia on the side -- on the shoulder.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the record could reflect that witness TAK has positively identified 
Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It will be noted on the record that Witness TAK identified the Accused Gacumbitsi.

MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I have no further questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  Judge Egorov, you may proceed.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, in your written statement you argue that you know that Mr. Gacumbitsi killed Kanyagote and his children; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Were these people killed inside or outside the Gacumbitsi's house.
THE WITNESS:
They weren't killed inside Gacumbitsi's house; they were killed outside.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, did you see when they were killed -- did you see them being killed on the outside?
THE WITNESS:
I saw the beginning of the incident.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have also told us that in the cabin of the vehicle -- when you saw Gacumbitsi, he was in the cabin of the vehicle.  Was there anyone with him in the cabin?  Was he the person driving?
THE WITNESS:
He wasn't the one driving the vehicle.  He had a driver I was not able to identify.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Counsel Kouengoua, you may proceed with your cross-examination.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Lordships, because it's not ritual, but could I please have five minutes break for perhaps very understandable personal reasons?
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel you have five minutes.  We'll resume in five minutes.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Are you going to actually adjourn or should I just be allowed to leave the Trial Chamber for a couple of minutes?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can take your three minutes.

Are you ready, Counsel?  May we proceed?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes.  Thank you, Madam President, Your Lordships.  

Madam President, Your Lordships, I shall respectfully request five to 10 minutes in camera as this witness is a protected witness, I'm afraid we might get into matters that would divulge his identity, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good, we shall go into an in camera hearing for a few minutes.
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 59 to 60] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

	1550H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Lordship.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAK, you knew the bourgmestre through the meetings -- through your civil wedding in 1991.  Did you also know his family?
A.	No, I did not know his family.
Q.	To date have you made acquaintance of any member of his family?
A.	The only person I know is his younger brother.
Q.	And what is his name?
A.	His name is Maniraho.
Q.	Could you spell it for us?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, this is No. 119 on the list.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	And how did you know him please, Witness TAK?
A.	(By order of the Court this answer has been extracted, and filed under seal) 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour, I am afraid if this answer is not struck from the record it might will the witness's identity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Be careful, Counsel, with the questions you ask.  Through the answers he gives to you he might be identified, as he has told you about the brother in prison.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam, I should like to assert something here, if I may.  I don't think that the witness himself was in prison, unless I misunderstood.  He is describing the circumstances in which he met someone's acquaintance.  If the person exists or has existed, 50 or 10,000 people must have visited him in prison, and I don't think this that can identify someone.  It is the bourgmestre's younger brother and not a member of the witness's family.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecution, can you clarify?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the witness has given an answer in Kinyarwanda that betrays his identity, and I 
pre-empted that by raising an objection.  If you want us to argue this in detail, I pray that we go in closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it really necessary, Counsel?  Do you need a clarification on this point?  Prosecution has explained that the witness made a clarification, but that did not get through to the Defence because he objected before the witness's testimony was translated.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
If the Prosecution said that, perhaps the witness can continue.  We can only go by what you and I have heard, Madam President, on what the interpreter has heard and translated.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, that is why you need to be careful with the questions you are asking.  You don't need to have the clarification made by the witness.  It will not be reflected in the record and we can go on to another question.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam, I would rather reformulate my question:
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q 	Witness TAK, is it true that you made acquaintance with that person only after the war?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	You say after the war.  Which war was it?
A.	I am talking of the war of 1994.
Q.	Very good, I wanted that clarification.  Do you know the geography of Rusumo?
A.	I told you the number of secteurs in Rusumo, commune.  I don't see what else you are looking for.
Q.	Witness TAK, do you know Migongo area?
A.	I have heard mention made of Migongo without knowing where it begins and where it ends.  I could not exactly locate it for you.
Q.	Do you know Nyarubuye secteur? 
A.	Yes, I know Nyarubuye secteur.
Q.	Do you know Kankobwa?
A.	Yes, I know it also.
Q.	Do you know Nyabitare secteur?.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Don't you think that all those three secteurs constitute the Migongo region or Migongo area?
A.	I didn't know that Migongo region was made up of those three secteurs; all I know is that Migongo region does exist.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAK.  In answer to the Prosecution you stated as follows:  "I know 
Augustin Kanyagote, he worked for the commune, but at secteur level."  Now, which secteur was that?
A.	I don't know the secteur where he works, but I know that he was what you call a basic agriculture extension worker, but I don't know in which secteur he worked.  I knew him as a person.
Q.	Did you have any family relationships or were you friends with that man? 
A.	With who, please?
Q.	The person whose name I have just mentioned.
A.	You mentioned quite a few people.
Q.	Would you like me to give you the name of your friend, too -- Kanyagote?
A.	Yes, what do you want to know about him?
Q.	Were you connected by friendship or family ties?
A.	No, he was an acquaintance, that is all, just a mere acquaintance.
Q.	You mean that apart from his role as agriculture extension worker, you didn't know him otherwise?
A.	I knew that he was an agriculture extension worker, but I also knew that he lived in my secteur.
Q.	On what date did you meet him, Witness TAK?
A.	I met him on the 14th.
Q.	You are referring to the 14th April l994?
A.	Quite.
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber in what secteur did you meet him?
A.	In Nyabitare secteur.
Q.	Do you know in what secteur he lived?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber where that was?
A.	Yes. He lived in Nyarubuye secteur.  
Q.	Did he know you?
A.	Yes, he knew me.
Q.	In what capacity, please?
A.	He knew me as someone -- as a neighbour, someone who lived in the same area. That is the only connection in which he knew me.
Q.	Witness TAK, at what time did you encounter him?
A.	It was in the evening at about 5 p.m.
Q.	And what were you doing when you met?
A.	Nothing.
Q.	You were doing nothing.  That is excellent.  Now, Witness TAK, was he married?
A.	Yes, he was married, and I think I told you that he was with his two children.
Q.	I have not come to the children yet.  I am merely asking if he was married?
A.	Yes, he was married.
Q.	Witness TAK, the water there besides you; you can drink it.  And if ever you need a break you are free to say so.
A.	He was married.
Q.	What was the name of his wife, Witness TAK?
A.	You are asking many questions at the same time.  Could you please repeat your last question?
Q.	What was the name of his wife?
A.	I do not know her name.
Q.	On what date was his wife killed?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	Witness TAK, was Mr. Kanyagote your neighbour or not?
A.	He was not my close neighbour.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, counsel -- he should avoid asking questions that elicit answers that might compromise the identity of this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, It think you should be cautious.  If he told us that he was his immediate neighbour, it would be enough to have an address to be able to identify the witness.  So please be cautious.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
With all the respect -- my due respect, Your Honours, I should like the Prosecution to advise the witness that the answer he has given might reveal his identity.  I have only repeated what the witness repeated before.  It was not me who was the author of that remark.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Well, neither was the witness's.  It is the witness's evidence that Kanyagote came from a neighbouring commune, but what we protest is the manner of questioning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
At this juncture, I appeal to the parties to be calm, and I would ask you, Counsel, to be cautious and circumspect your questioning so as not to divulge the identity of the witness.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAK, you met Kanyagote at 5 p.m. in Nyabitare secteur; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Apart from him and his two children, was any one else with him?
A.	No one else.
Q.	And so spontaneously he started to confide in you; do you confirm this statement?
A.	I told you that we spoke and he told me what had happened to him and I told him my story as well.
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber what is the distance between Nyabitare secteur and Kigina?
A.	I would not be able to give you an approximation of the distance separating those two secteurs.  All I know is that Nyabitare and Kigina secteur are two secteurs that border one another.
Q.	You have stated that the attacks were launched against the Tutsi, and when the Prosecutor asked you why the attacks were launched against the Tutsi, you answered as follows:  "It was for political reasons, but I have no additional information."  Did you state that?
A.	That is what I stated.
Q.	Can you now explain what you meant about "political reasons"?
A.	I don't know, I am not sure I understand your question.
Q.	You have stated in answer to a question put to you by the Prosecutor that attacks were launched against the Tutsi group, and the Prosecutor asked you why in your opinion these attacks were launched against the Tutsi.  You answered exactly as follows:  "It was for political reasons, but I have no further knowledge about that."  What do you mean by "for political reasons"?
A.	Well, this does not help me.  I still don't understand the question.  Maybe you could rephrase your question so I can understand it.
Q.	Witness TAK, in Rusumo commune, did you know a veteran named Alphose Kanyagote?
A.	I have already explained that the person named Kanyagote that I know was a trainer.  He provided training in animal husbandry, and I do not know the Kanyagote you are referring to.
Q.	Do you know any other Kanyagote in Rwanda?
A.	No.
Q.	Do you confirm that the one you know -- the first name of the person that you know was Augustin?
A.	The part I am sure is Kanyagote.  I am sure of that part of the name.
Q.	Does this mean that you wish to withdraw the first name Augustin as being part of your testimony before the Trial Chamber?
A.	I don't care if that first name is kept or removed, because I know whom I am referring to.
Q.	Witness TAK, is it possible to know someone and not know their name?
A.	It's possible.  There are several ways or several levels of knowing a person.
Q.	So you knew this person, but you didn't know this person's name?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the witness has already answered this question by saying that he knew the name, but that he had some doubt as to the first name.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  It is just that I was hoping that he would state it himself clearly.
BY MR. KOUENGUA:
Q.	At 5 p.m. on the 14th of April, you come across him in Nyarubuye secteur. Together you take the road leading to Gacumbitsi's house;  Is that correct?
A.	Could you rephrase your question, Counsel?  I think that you are not allowing me to understand you.
Q.	Witness TAK, before April 1994, did you know Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	Yes, I knew his house.
Q.	On the 14th of April as night was falling, Mr. Kanyagote invites you to follow him to Gacumbitsi's house; is that correct?
A.	You misunderstood me.  If you have taken notes then I suggest you review the notes.
Q.	Witness TAK, what time did you leave Nyarubuye?
A.	I would ask you to repeat your question.
Q.	Witness TAK, you seem exhausted by my questions, but you can have a glass of water.
MR. KAREGESYA:
Your Honours, counsel should refrain from making such comments.  It is clear that he is mischaracterising the witness's evidence.  The witness never left Nyarubuye at all, and that is why he has difficulty in answering that question.  It is nowhere in his evidence that he left Nyarubuye.  He left another location, but clearly the record indicates it was not Nyarubuye.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I would like to ask you to put your questions to the witness without making any comments.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, may the Bench and the Prosecutor correct me if I am wrong:  "I saw him in - 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel repeat - he was reading too quickly for the interpreters.
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Thank you, Mr. Chief interpreter.  "It was Nyamateke cellule, Nyarubuye secteur that I came across him."
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, could you please clarify what you said earlier?
A.	I think if I answer the question put to me by counsel, I would have to begin again from the beginning.  I would like to ask him to clarify his questions, to put clear questions to me so that I can better answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can he tell us where he met Kanyagote -- can you tell us where you met Kanyagote even if you have to repeat it?
A.	It was in Nyamateke cellule in Nyabitare secteur.
Q.	At what time did you leave that location?
A.	We left that location after nightfall, around 7 p.m.
Q.	And at what time did you reach Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	It was around 9 p.m.  I should add that this is an approximation.  I was not wearing a watch.
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber how many persons you were with at the time?
A.	There were four of us.
Q.	Did you stop along the way?
A.	No.
Q.	On the 14th of April, had it rained?
A.	I don't remember.
Q.	Was it during the rainy season?
A.	Yes, it was during the rainy season, but I do not remember if that day it rained or not.
Q.	Do you maintain before the Trial Chamber the answer that you gave to the Prosecutor stating: "I stopped approximately 50 metres away."  And you were referring to Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	This is an approximation, I did not measure the distance.
(Pages 61 to 67 by Regina Limula)




































	1630H
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	This approximation, you added, "I stopped at the road".  Is that true?
A.	You are referring to the road?  I'm not sure you are saying I was on the road, next to the road; I am telling you that I stated that I stopped somewhere near the road.
Q.	Witness TAK, when you say somewhere near the road, is this -- should the Trial Chamber take this to mean that you crossed the road?
A.	No, I did not cross the road.
Q.	You did not cross the road.  Does Gacumbitsi's -- is Gacumbitsi's house surrounded by a fence?
A.	Yes, at the time there was a fence.
Q.	Witness TAK, can you tell the Trial Chamber what kind of fence it was?
A.	It was a fence built -- made of boards -- boards, and the gate was green.
Q.	Witness TAK, this green gate or door that you are referring to, was this the gate to the -- in a fence or was this the front door to the house?
A.	The door to the house was white.
Q.	You were approximately 50 metres away from the house because you had not crossed the road.  In your opinion -- in your estimation, how far away was Gacumbitsi's house from the road?  I'm not asking in relation to you but, rather, the distance separating Gacumbitsi's house from the road.
A.	I would say that there were approximately 40 metres between the two.
Q.	When you arrived to that point, approximately 50 metres away from Gacumbitsi's house at around
9 p.m., was the gate open?
A.	I don't know.  I didn't pay attention.
Q.	That night, Witness TAK, was there any light coming from Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	Yes, I could see a glimmer of light through the windows.
Q.	Wasn't there a problem with electricity supply in Rusumo that night, a black out?
A.	Are you talking about a problem with electrical supply?  But there was never any electricity in that area.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAK.  What was the name of the cellule in which Gacumbitsi's house was located?
A.	I don't know the name of the cellule, but I knew -- do know the locality in which the house was built was called Kavuzo.
Q.	Witness TAK, "When I arrived, I stopped.    We could hear noise come from the house.  People that were coming out were pushing Kanyagote".  Was he thrown out of the fence?
A.	What I saw is that a lot of people came out of the compound.  You will understand that the gate had been opened, and there was real fight, struggle going on.  They were beating the person I have already -- whose name I have already mentioned.  That is what I saw.
Q.	Witness TAK, who were the two parties that were fighting?
A.	There were many people.  I was not able to identify the people that were fighting, but I did hear the person mention the words that I have repeated in this courtroom.  And I believe -- I assume that you must recall them.
Q.	At that specific moment in time did you see Gacumbitsi?
A.	In view of the distance that separated me with the house, I could not identify the people to be able to give you their names.  But I heard Kanyagote's voice begging for Gacumbitsi's mercy and this leads me to believe that they were together, and that Gacumbitsi was present.
Q.	You are assuming that he was there?
A.	It's clear that you cannot ask for forgiveness or beg for mercy from someone who wasn't there.
Q.	In answer to a question put to you by the Prosecution, you stated as follows, Witness TAK: you said that when you're frightened it's not possible to distinguish, to discern what is happening.  Is that correct?
A.	No, that's not exactly what I stated.
Q.	I should like to ask you what the Prosecution asked on my own account: "Did you identify the people that were there?  Did you hear other people?"  You answered, "I did not recognise anyone else.  When one is afraid one cannot distinguish what is happening".  Is that not correct, Witness TAK?
A.	No, that is not what I said.
Q.	Witness TAK, at the moment that there was the fight, who did you identify?
A.	Given that it was night and that I was not with those people, I did not recognise anyone, but I did recognise the voice of the man who had been with me who was imploring his aggressors for pity, talking to the person to whom he'd gone to seek refuge.
Q.	Witness TAK, before going to Gacumbitsi you were four: Kanyagote and the two children and you.  What was the age of those children?  Can you tell the Trial Chamber the age of those children?
A.	I could not tell you.  They were school children, in primary school.  I am not in a position to give you their ages.
Q.	Answering the Prosecution you said that, "Along the way we chatted; he told me about his problems, I told him about mine".  Is that all you discussed with Kanyagote?
A.	Yes.  He told me his problems, I told him mine.  As regards what we said to each other, he told me he was going somewhere, I asked him if I could accompany him, he accepted.  That's all we discussed between us.
Q.	Witness TAK, were you accompanying him, showing him the way or helping him to carry the bags he had with him?
A.	We setoff together towards his final designation.  I must tell you he didn't have any bags or baggage.
Q.	Who asked who to accompany him, was it Kanyagote who asked you to accompany him or was it you who offered your services?
A.	I asked him if I could go with him.
Q.	Did you do that because he had difficulty knowing where he was?
A.	No.
Q.	At that time you already had two children?
A.	You are trying to say I was with my children? 
Q.	Witness TAK, on your way to the bourgmestre's house, who was walking in front, Kanyagote, his children or you?
A.	It is difficult to answer that question.  When people travel together the situation evolves.  Our positions in respect of each other can change.  Sometimes you might be in front, sometimes in the back.  It is not any fix thing, people move as they wish.  They might be in front or behind as time passes.
Q.	In the beginning you said that you had asked him what the situation was with regard to the roadblocks on the road.  Is that correct or have I not taken proper notes again?
A.	I said that I told him to wait for night to fall before setting out from fear of encountering roadblocks on the way and being molested by the people manning the roadblocks -- the said roadblocks.
Q.	When you arrived at about 50 metres from the house, what happened to the children?
A.	The children setoff with their father.
Q.	Where?
A.	They entered Gacumbitsi's residence.
Q.	Witness TAK, did you not hear those children cry?
A.	There were shouts, various noises.  I can't tell you if people were laughing or screaming.  There was a great deal of noise and it was hard to distinguish who was making what sort of noise.
Q.	Witness TAK, the father was crying more than the children.  That is what you stated to the Chamber. 
A.	No, that's not what I said.  I said he was imploring his aggressors for pity.
Q.	"In 1997, we found the remainder of his clothes near the roadblock".  Is that what you stated?
A.	No, it was not the remainder of his clothes, it was his corpse, but they were still wrapped in the clothes that the victim was wearing when he was killed.
Q.	Witness TAK, can you tell us in which month of 1997 that was?
A.	I do not remember what month.
Q.	In answer to His Lordship, you said he was killed outside.  Do you stick by your answer?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Witness TAK, what happened to the children?
A.	I don't know.  We found the corpse or pieces of the corpse of Kanyagote.  There were many victims at that place.  It was difficult to distinguish between the victims unless you knew what clothes they were wearing at the time of their death.  And among the corpses we found, there were several children's corpses which leads me to believe that even his children must have been among those victims.
Q.	Witness TAK, did you see Gacumbitsi kill Kanyagote?
A.	No.
Q.	In answer to the Prosecution, you stated the following: "I saw Gacumbitsi passing in a double-cabin Hilux pick-up.  I was ten metres away".  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber where that occurred?
A.	What occurrences are you referring to, Counsel?
Q.	"I saw the bourgmestre.  He was in a double-cabin Hilux pick-up.  It was yellow, washed out yellow".  Where did you see him?
A.	In Nyabitare secteur.
Q.	Is that not where precisely you met Kanyagote at 5 p.m.?
A.	No.
Q.	(Not translated)
A.	I already told you that it was Nyabitare secteur.
Q.	At ten metres from where in the secteur, on the roof, in the market, where?
A.	On the road leading to Nyabitare from Rugegene.
Q.	And what time was it then, Witness TAK?
A.	I don't know the exact time, but I think it was in the afternoon.
Q.	So you think it was in the afternoon.  Now, what date was that, the 14th, 15th, 16th or 17th, what date?
A.	The 15th.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We missed the beginning of the counsel's question.  Anyhow, the answer is Kimisagara -- Nyamisagara.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Could you spell it for the interpreters?
A.	Give me a piece of paper and I will write it for you on the paper.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I think that the name is N-Y-A-M-I-N-I --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, could we ask counsel to repeat, please?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
N-Y-A-M-I-S-A-G-A-R-A, N-Y-A-M-I-S-A-G-A-R-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will you have finished soon?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I'm making efforts to do so.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because one of my colleagues has an appointment at 5 o'clock and it is already five to five.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAK, apart from Gacumbitsi, did you identify anyone else in the vehicle?
A.	No, I could not identify anyone else.
Q.	And when -- and in answer to the Prosecution when asked why you couldn't identify -- there was a following -- "I couldn't identify anyone else because the vehicle was travelling too fast".  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That is what I stated.
Q.	Witness TAK, did you see Gacumbitsi kill Kanyagote's two children?
A.	Personally I did not see him kill them.
Q.	(Not translated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, the microphone -- Counsel's microphone was not on.  We missed the first half of the question.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know him.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The question was: Who was Gacumbitsi's driver?  And I think the witness has just given the answer.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sorry, microphone.  Microphone, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not translated.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's gone off again.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, Prosecutor was saying the question is not specific.  We need to know a driver, when?  Which time frame is counsel referring to?  Is it in 1993; is it in March 1994 or is it in April 1994?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thought that it were in April 1994.  It was his question; I was only trying to elucidate further the matter he had raised. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAK, time is running out.  Do you confirm that Kanyagote had two children?
A.	There were the two children who were with him on that day when we met.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Your Lordships, on the 8th of April 1998, the 8th of April 1998 -- I wish to refer to the preliminary statement.  I think it's on page 3 or 4.  These are photocopies.  First sentence, first paragraph.  Witness TAK answered: "Kanyagote and his three children"; "Kanyagote and his three children".  

Madam Presiding Judge, Your Lordships, with your permission, on 8th of April 1998, Witness TAC (sic) very lucidly, answered the Prosecution's investigators as follows: "What was the name of the driver that you saw?  Witness TAK answered, "Seduka.  Now he is in Kibongo".  Page, page 3 of the preliminary interview --
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Eleventh paragraph.
	(Pages 68 to 73 by Gifty C. Harding)

































	1701H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, this isn't the appropriate procedure of making submissions about a witness's statement without putting propositions to the witness, particularly where counsel gets it wrong.  Nowhere does he give the name of Gacumbitsi's driver as being Seduka, who is now in Kibungo.  This is the driver of a different vehicle altogether.

Let counsel put the propositions to the witness and elicit an answer from the witness, rather than making a submission on the record.  It is very inappropriate.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you are lengthening the debate by making clarifications that are not -- in fact, the driver you are referring to in the witness statement is the driver of the Daihatsu.
MR KOUENGOUA:
With all due respect, the driver of the Daihatsu doesn't matter.  "In the convoy of three vehicles, apart from Gacumbitsi, who else did you identify?"  His answer today was, "No one, because they were going very fast".  Apart from Gacumbitsi, today he did not identify anyone.  That is the matter at hand.

Four or five years before he identified Gacumbitsi's driver and gave a name.  This was the clarification that the Defence wished to make, Madam Presiding Judge. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, Prosecutor submits that it is for the witness to make clarification and not Defence, because Defence cannot give evidence from the Bar.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TAK, time is passing.  I must finish, otherwise I will not be forgiven by the Presiding Judge.  Do you know a certain Gasanwa in the Rusumo commune? I can spell it out for the interpreters: G-A-S-A-N-W-A.
A.	I do not know him. 
Q.	Last question, Witness TAK:  who did you see Gacumbitsi kill?
A.	No, I did not see Gacumbitsi kill anybody, personally. 
MR KOUENGOUA:
Madam Presiding Judge, Your Lordships, I am sorry if I have delayed you and made you late for appointments.  If I did push forward, it was merely to try and clarify as many matters as possible, and I wish to make my apologies.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, any questions? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I am fully aware of an appointment which you have just mentioned.  Would you rather I asked my questions now, or would you rather I asked them in the morning?  It will be a very short --maybe 10 minutes -- re-examination, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, the witness is not leaving tomorrow?  He is still here for a few days?  Well then, in that case, it is preferable -- we prefer that we question him further tomorrow morning, and we will begin with that in the morning. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The hearing stands adjourned until tomorrow morning at 8:45.
