P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The representative of the registry, could you read the case, please?  
MR. ORTEGA:
Yes, Madam President.  The Pre-Appeal Judge Inés Monica Weinberg de Roca, of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, is now sitting for a Status Conference, today, Tuesday, 8th December -- I am sorry, 8th March 2005, in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Emmanuel Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, Case No.  ICTR-01-64-I.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Now, the appearance for the parties, first, for the Appellant.  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon to the Prosecution.  Good afternoon to the interpreters and staff.  Madam President, I am a bit confused, I must say.  And please excuse me for the clothing I am wearing.  The first Status Conference that I went to was not the same and people were not robed, and I consider that I should dress the same for this Status Conference.  My name is 
Mr. Kouengoua from the Cameroonian Bar, and I am lead counsel for Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. 
Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  And is the co-counsel also present?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
My co-counsel is not present, Madam President.  I am alone today.  Perhaps that is one of the issues that we will need to discuss in a few moments.  And thank you for that remark, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the Accused, I would like to know if he can understand?  Just remain seated, but tell me if you can understand in the language that you are fluent in what is going on in the courtroom.  
THE APPELLANT GACUMBITSI:
Thank you, very much.  I do understand French.  So I understand the proceedings.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Now, appearances for the Prosecution.  
MS. REICHMAN:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I am Amanda Reichman and Francois-Xavier Nsanzuwera for the Prosecution. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  The Status Conference is a -- has been called so that Accused can -- Appellant can say if there is any matter that has not been raised, any personal matters, and the brief, as far as I can see, have been all filed and so have the translations.  But I want to know from both parties if there is a matter that should be dealt with here.
MS. REICHMAN:
Your Honour, there is one outstanding brief that I would like to draw your attention to, and that is the reply to the appeal from the -- from the Defendant. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The translation has just been filed, I believe.  
MS. REICHMAN:   
I believe, that's correct, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Your Microphone, Your Honour.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, so that would be the only pending brief, but the Status Conference is mainly not to discuss legal questions which can be raised before the Bench, but to give the Appellant an opportunity to say if there are concerns regarding detention facilities or anything that should be transmitted either to Pre-Appeal Judge or through him to the whole Bench.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  There is, indeed, a problem regarding the brief and reply.  The French version, the translation was no doubt transmitted to me counsel for the Appellant, but unfortunately, I only received a copy of that document from the registry just yesterday.  At about 7 p.m., the client received that after I found him at the detention facility.  So, there are technical issues that I, as lead counsel, I am dealing with.  Now, that we've received the translation, I think that on the 1st of March, you issued an order saying that I should file my brief by the 16th.  I haven't had an opportunity to read that order and, in fact, just before you came into the room, I was trying to obtain the documents.  

So, procedurally speaking, one of our main concerns is that we would hope that you would take into account these issues when you give an order regarding time limits, also with regard to the remark you made at the very beginning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just one question regarding this first issue; how much time -- extra time would you need?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Not extra time.  I think that I would be able to respect the time limit as provided for in the Rules, but you made an order on the 1st, and only yesterday I received the French translation of that as did my client.  So, perhaps we can start counting the time limit beginning today, and I shouldn't have any problem filing my brief.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution? 
MS. REICHMAN:  
That's fine, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, this is done.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Very well.  Thank you.  Madam President, to go on, the second issue that I as lead counsel for the Appellant has, has to do with my Defence team.  I am supposed to have a co-counsel as well as an assistant, but I am alone here in the hearing.  These are issues that were -- that we are dealing with, that I am dealing with.  I am trying to surmount these difficulties here, and you will remember that my trial was the quickest trial in the history of the ICTR, and we -- before this Court hope to be able to deal with all these difficulties and move just as rapidly, Madam President.  These are the issues that we are dealing with right now, as we try to accomplish our duties. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the status of your -- what is the status of this request regarding this co-counsel and someone extra on your team with the registry?  Have you requested for extra assistance?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  In the appeal cases, we still need a co-counsel, but they are limited in the number of hours that they can work, that is limited to 350.  Now, I was also given an assistant for three months.  Normally, assistants can work for six months.  So the contract for my assistant expired on the 24th of February.  He was able to work in December, January and February.  Perhaps based on your recommendation, that contract can be renewed so that we will be able to finish the work such as finishing our book of appeals so that the appeal trial can move forward as quickly as possible.  This would be my request, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So your request would be the continuation of the contract of your assistant?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, I would like that contract to be extended, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the representative of the registry give any information?  
MR. ORTEGA:
Madam President, we have just called Ms. Aminatta, who is in charge of the relevant section.  And so, if you give us a few moments, she would be here to address that issue. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any further issue?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
For the time being, Madam President, there are no issues.  Perhaps after the representative from the lawyers and detention facilities management section, we may have something further.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Prosecution, while we wait for Ms. Aminatta, does the Prosecution have any query?  
MS. REICHMAN: 
Nothing at this stage, Your Honour, except to note that we would appreciate a date for appeal being set on as soon as possible after the filing of the reply from the Appellant.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And how long do you -- the representative of the registry -- should we adjourn or is she on her way?  
MR. ORTEGA:
With your leave, we could adjourn for 10 minutes and give her time to arrive, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would the parties agree to this?  
MS. REICHMAN: 
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Absolutely, Your Honour.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we adjourn for 10 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1640H to 1648H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Status Conference is resumed.  So Ms. Aminatta, Appellant has some queries concerning the extension of contract of the assistant, and is it also the appointment of co-counsel or is it the same?  Are you calling assistant co-counsel?  Is it one or two people?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  In fact, there are two different people, co-counsel is already here, but is limited by the number of hours.  As regards the assistant, however, I am requesting an extension of that contract so that the assistant could be with me during the duration of the appeals work, especially as we need to finish that work yesterday, I was at UNDF to meet with the Accused.  I had to stop at 3 p.m. to come back to contact the registry, and I had no time to even pay a visit Ms. Aminatta just to say hello, because I am limited in the time I have.  So, if I could have someone to help me with the brief as I can work on other task.  That would help me enormously.  All of these issues need to be taken into account, Madam President.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the issue before us now is the assistant extension of the contract.  Ms. Aminatta, have you looked into it?
MS. N'GUM: 
Thank you, Madam President.  We have not received any request from Mr. Kouengoua, unless I am mistaken, because he is supposed to send the request for the assistant -- appointment of the legal assistant.  And to my knowledge, we have not received anything.  In fact, we were looking for an application before I came out here, and as at this afternoon, we have not received any application from Mr. Kouengoua.  It's not automatic even for co-counsel who was co-counsel at the trial stage, when the matter comes on appeal, the lead counsel has to apply for the co-counsel to be re-assigned on the Appellate matter.  And as far as I know, we have not received any request for the lead counsel -- co-counsel contract to be -- to be renewed.  

The question of the hours, that is the registry's policy that on appeal co-counsel works for 350 hours.  The legal assistant can be renewed for the period that is requested by the lead counsel if he puts in a request, but as at this afternoon, Your Lordship, we had not received any request from Mr. Kouengoua, and we will be pleased to deal with the matter as quickly as possible once we receive a request from him, Your Lordship, because he has to justify why he needs a co-counsel and also why he needs a legal assistant.  It is not automatic that they continue from the trial stage to the appellate stage.  Thank you, Your Lordship.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Ms. Aminatta for the clarification.  Mr. Kouengoua, have you applied for an extension of the legal assistant, on the one hand, and for -- and extension of hours of co-counsel?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I was not making a complaint earlier.  I was simply talking about the difficulties that I am having with my work.  Ms. Aminatta said something very important.  She said that as soon as I make a request, she would deal with the issue.  So, I think the ball is in my court now, and there is no longer need for discussion on this matter.  I will make a request as soon as possible, or perhaps I would give a copy of the request I have already made, which may have not made it to her office.  I do have problems with my fax, but at any rate, I will get that request into the section as soon as possible. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps, you can make the request now.  We can have it on the record and you do not need to go back to your office to make the request.  At least, for the legal assistant, I think it would be quicker if you just said now what is it you require?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Very well, Madam President.  As regards the legal assistant, Madam President, I already mentioned my first request in November 2004 that for the appellate hearings, I would need that legal assistant to conduct research into jurisprudence, into legal doctrine and to prepare the various briefs that I need to file.  Currently, I still have one last brief to file, which needs to be filed within the time limit prescribed by you.  I also have to file the book of appeals as well as the book of authorities.  We all know this.  On 1st March 2004, I finished my pleadings.  And when I left I found out that there was an order, an eviction order in quotes; "I no longer had an office."  I have paper documents here, parts were in Cameroon.  So, it's not easy to deal with as counsel.  This is very important.  When we were at trial, I had an office with a telephone and a computer and all of my documents there.  And that problem was not raised, but now I have to work between Doulla and Arusha.  It's a long way, and if I cannot arrive with an assistant, for example, to conduct all of that research, I, indeed, will have problems.  

I have all the goodwill in the world.  I will work very hard and I have the strength to do so, but I will have to deal with these issues.  And if they are not resolved, this may occasion delays in the proceedings.  So these are the issues that have to be dealt with.  And I, respectfully submit, that the assistant's contract should be extended, and I ask that that assistant be able to come to Arusha to conduct the necessary research.  This is very important for us, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For how long did you need the extension?  How many months?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I have thought about that in great detail, but normally an assistant contract should last for six months, and I think that that would be sufficient.  Six months would be entirely sufficient for the work, Madam President.  

As I was saying, it is understood if I finish before that, that's very well, I won't try to renew for another two or three months, if we are given the six months from the beginning.  Normally, the contract should last for six months.  My assistant was given a three-month contract, and we still have work to do.  So, I think six months would be sufficient. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Mr. Kouengoua.  So, with respect to the legal assistant, we'll ask Ms. Aminatta to respond to you whether an extension of six months is possible.  Regarding co-counsel, I think this is not a matter to be solved here because the registry has directives, and there is a special procedure if you want to appeal, and that is not at the Status Conference.  

Ms. Aminatta, do you think you can give a response to counsel within a period of time you now can suggest?  
MS. N'GUM:
Thank you, Madam President.  Once we receive the written request which he said he was trying to fax to us we will deal with it accordingly, Your Lordship.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ms. Aminatta, instead of a written request, what I have been saying at this Status Conference is that you should take the minutes of this Status Conference as a written request.  So, you have the written request before you now to extend for six months the legal assistant of counsel.  So, you have the request before you as from now.  The question I am putting to you, how long will your office need to deal with it?  
MS. N'GUM: 
By the end of the week, Your Lordship.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Ms. Aminatta.  

Is there any issue to be raised, Prosecution? 
MS. REICHMAN: 
We have nothing to add.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

Mr. Kouengoua?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President, those were my main issues at the -- for the present moment.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Gucumbitsi, do you have something personal that is on your heart, related to the detention facilities, your health or other personal concern you may have?  
THE APPELLANT GACUMBITSI: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Personally, with regard to matters of health, when I am ill, I receive treatments.  So, all is well with regard to my health.  Other problems are problems of a common nature, common to all the detainees in the UNDF.  And I believe you have been made aware of this through correspondence through -- between the detainees and the President of the Tribunal.  These are matters of concern for the detainees at the UNDF, and they are problems of a general nature.  These are problems which we find cause us a great of suffering.  That would be in that context, but apart from that, everything else is all well.  Thank you, very much, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Mr. Gacumbitsi.  

So then this Status Conference is adjourned.  Thank you all.  
(Court adjourn at 1710H)
