P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber in session. 
MS. THOMPSON:
Good morning, Your Honours.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andrésia Vaz, presiding, Judge Sergey A. Egorov and Judge Jai R. Reddy, is now sitting in open session today, 1st March 2004, for the closing arguments in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Silvestre Gacumbitsi, Case No. ICTR-01-64-T. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  

We now ask the parties to introduce themselves, beginning with the Prosecution. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
May it please Your Honours, I appear for  the Prosecutor, together with Melanie Werrett, Chief of Prosecutions, Khalid Ramadhani, legal adviser and Roberta Baldini, assistant trial attorney.  I am most obliged.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Can the Defence introduce themselves? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, today is 1st March 2004.  The Defence team for Gacumbitsi comprising Anne Ngatio Mbattang of the Cameroon bar, Kouengoua, that is myself, with our legal assistant, Mr. Gatarama, Tharcisse, we wish to express to you our best wishes for the year 2004.  Indeed this is the only opportunity of wishing you a happy New Year.  We would have liked this to be earlier, but this is all we were able to do and respectfully request you to accept our wishes for a good year 2004.  We thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Kouengoua.  In turn, we express to you our best wishes for the New Year.  It is better late than never.  It is the beginning of March, but it is still the beginning of the year for all of us.  Thank you. 

Now, perhaps I would like to check with the parties how much time they think they will need, that is, how much time does the Prosecutor need for their closing submissions and how much time does the Defence need for their closing submissions as well.  Perhaps that may help us in programming the hearings. 

	Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I will try to keep it within the hour, or maybe an hour and 15 minutes.  Most obliged, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Mr. Kouengoua, please. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence for Gacumbitsi intends to make their oral submissions on 2nd March 2004.  We thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We said that we will meet this morning for the Prosecutor's closing arguments and the Defence's closing arguments, and if the Prosecutor takes only one hour for their closing arguments, I think you could immediately thereafter also make your oral submissions, because we have to -- if we have to sit this morning and wait until tomorrow to hear your oral submissions, I think we will not be comfortable with that.  We would like all of these submissions, both for the Prosecution and the Defence, be made without interruption. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, if the order agreed on is respected, what is said is that the Prosecutor knew that they were going to begin, and since the Trial Chamber had told us that we were allowed three days for both the Prosecutor's arguments and the Defence's arguments, that is, from the 1st to the 3rd of March, what was repeated is not later than Friday, we legitimately thought, Madam President, that we would take the day of 2nd March.  Perhaps we may only need 15 minutes, but we intend to make our submissions on the 2nd.  The only change now is that the Prosecution is refusing -- or, rather, it is reducing the time they would need. That is their right.  We do not know whether we would take less time as they would, but all we are saying is that we are ready to make our submissions on the 2nd of March.  Madam President, I do not think that we have made any departure from the programme agreed on by the Trial Chamber.  We are respecting that programme in its totality.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In fact, you have not answered my question.  I asked you how much time the Defence arguments would take.  How much time do you think you need to make your submissions? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, we could start from nine o'clock to at least 5 p.m. on the 2nd, and we think we will still be within the programming of the Trial Chamber.  We will not go beyond the hour now as provided for by the Trial Chamber.  It is not just a commitment, it is a legal obligation. We cannot do otherwise.  Everything must end by 5 p.m. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any comment to make regarding what the Defence has just said?
MR. KAREGYESA:
May it please Your Honours, it is my understanding that your tentative scheduling of this matter issued on the 25th of November last year was superseded last week by a hearing notice that set aside this matter for today from nine to five-thirty.  Now, in the circumstances where the parties filed detailed closing briefs, the closing arguments shouldn't exceed a day.  I would therefore object to counsel's application, allowing him to proceed, the whole of tomorrow, and propose that he responds to my address immediately after conclusion, and that we stick to the notice issued last week fixing this matter for only today from nine to five-thirty.  I am most obliged, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kouengoua. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the scheduling order of last week which is being referred to, and which was disclosed to us, provides that on the 1st of March, at nine o'clock, we will begin in the Laïty Kama Courtroom and in the afternoon we will go to Courtroom III and we will continue thus.  

Madam President, the country from which I come or the legal system from which I come, the Prosecutor at the time of their submissions may say that they would listen to the Bench, in other words, after having submitted or filed their submissions, they would say, well, they have nothing else to say.  If the Prosecutor refuses to make oral submissions, they cannot apply same to the Defence.  In any case, the Prosecutor fulfilled their task on 26th -- 20th June.  Gacumbitsi is in prison.  The Prosecutor may decide not to say anything.  I, the Defence, I have things to say.  I have matters to bring before you, and the Prosecutor cannot impose on me their view of things.  I am here to defend; he is here to prosecute.  He says he will take one hour, and I am saying that I will take from nine to
 5 p.m. tomorrow.  That is our position, and nobody can impose their position on the other party, especially as it is true that our interests are antagonistic.  And I do not think that at any point in time we were asked by your Trial Chamber to say how much time we will take or when we will make our submissions.  In any case, the Prosecutor should know that the case law before your Trial Chamber up to the Gacumbitsi case is such that after Prosecutor's closing arguments, the Defence is given time.  I do not want to make reference to any specific case, but in some cases -- in fact, that interruption was 48 hours; that is, after the Prosecutor's closing arguments, the Defence counsel started making their submissions only the following day, and in other cases, sometimes interruptions last about two days.  

We, in our specific case, respectfully, we are saying that we are ready to make our oral submissions tomorrow, the 2nd of March 2004, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. That is our position and that position is in conformity with the law.  We are not trying to depart in any manner whatsoever from your scheduling order.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua.  

The Chamber is of the opinion that both parties have filed a written brief, approximately 100 pages of written briefs, and it would be of no purpose for parties to engage in a repetition of what appears in those briefs.  Rather, parties should barely make observations in regard to those positions that had been stated earlier on in the briefs.   

We are not attempting to determine or to make or take a stand in regard to your conduct.  We intend to allow each party to make its submissions or closing arguments.  We also intend to give you the opportunity to respond.  However, we think we should not wait until tomorrow.  It would be of no purpose if the Prosecutor were to conclude her closing arguments this morning.  I believe you could start off this afternoon, Mr. Kouengoua.  I believe you are ready. That has already been scheduled some time back.  

We are, therefore, going to ask the Prosecutor to start off with her closing arguments, and this afternoon you will start, Mr. Kouengoua, and in the event the Accused would want to say a few words to the Court, we will be willing to listen to him, a few minutes, no more than five to ten minutes.  

Mr. Kouengoua, our hope is that your submissions will not exceed two hours.  That is our decision in regard to this matter, and without further waste of time, we will allow the Prosecutor to address the Court.  

The Prosecutor has the floor. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I am most obliged, Your Honours.  

Genocide, Your Honours is the ultimate crime, the crime of crimes, involving the deliberate and wanton slaughter of the people on account of their blood and birth, the ultimate nightmare of humanity that brings us here today.  Genocide, Your Honours, is what we allege and have proved occurred in Rwanda during 100 days of murder and mayhem in April through July 1994, a very sad closing chapter, Your Honours, to the last century, written in the blood of its victims.  

In my opening address on the 28th of July 2003, I set out what we sought to prove, that the defendant Silvestre Gacumbitsi, in concert with others, embarked on a deliberate course of action within days of the death of President Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994, a criminal course of action whose singular objective was the total destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group, a diabolic plot that resulted in the killing, maiming and rape of thousands of Tutsi civilians in the Rusumo commune during the month of April 1994, crimes for which we now seek his conviction.  

Gacumbitsi, Your Honours, stands charged with five counts: the count of genocide or complicity in genocide in the alternative, and the counts of extermination, murder and rape, as crimes against humanity, all arising from the culpable acts we alleged and proved he committed in concert with others as part of a common criminal campaign in Rusumo commune in April 1994.  

We have filed a detailed brief, Your Honours, setting out our analysis of the law and the facts, and our duty today is to sum up our case and respond to any questions you may wish to raise.  

The core issues for determination by Your Honours have been narrowed by Defence admissions during the course of the trial.  With exception to the count of rape, the following matters are not disputed:  one, that there was a massacre of Tutsi civilians at Nyarubuye parish on the 15th of April 1994; two, that Marie, Beatrice, Mutunzi, Rukomeza and Kanyogote were killed as alleged in the indictment.  

On these two points, Your Honours, what is in issue is whether the alleged killings were committed by the Accused, with the requisite intent under the various crimes charged, and whether he is criminally responsible.  

With regard to the count of rape, the Defence contests that the rapes were committed as alleged.  And so, all the issues with regard to rape are outstanding.  

It is the case for the Prosecution, Your Honours, that on the 15th of April 1994, at around 2:30 p.m., the Accused Silvestre Gacumbitsi and others not before this Court arrived at Nyarubuye parish, where thousands of Tutsi civilians as well as some few Hutus had taken sanctuary, fleeing attacks in their homes and villages following the death of President Habyarimana.  

The Accused in the company of communal policemen and armed militiamen paved the way for a massive slaughter by first announcing that, and I quote: "The hour of the Tutsi had come."  He immediately lent meaning to his statement, Your Honours, by hacking to death an aged Tutsi male named Murefu with a machete and ordering his policemen to shoot at the crowd of refugees.  With those actions, Your Honours, commenced a barbaric attack lasting anywhere between three to four hours, in which countless Tutsi civilians were killed on account of their ethnicity.  Guns and grenades were used against these civilian refugees while militiamen hacked the wounded to death and looted their victims' property.  

That wasn't the end of it, Your Honours.  Gacumbitsi returned to this horrific scene on the next day, the 16th of April 1994, and returned once again on the 17th of April 1994, on both occasions with commune policemen and armed militiamen, to finish off any survivors from the carnage of the night before, in order that none would live to tell the tale of his horrific deeds.  In a nutshell, Your Honours, that was the Prosecution case proved at this trial for the counts of genocide and extermination. 

We submit that the evidence proffered at trial has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that from the 15th through the 17th of April 1994, the Accused, in concert with others not before this Court, with intent to destroy an ethnic group in whole or in part, participated in and presided over the large-scale killing of thousands of Tutsi civilians sheltered at Nyarubuye parish.  The evidence also proves beyond reasonable doubt, Your Honours, that the massacre of Tutsi civilians at Nyarubuye parish was not an isolated or fortuitous incident, but part of a widespread or systematic attack on the Tutsi civilian population, on account of their ethnicity. 

This, Your Honours, was the evidence of Prosecution witnesses TAQ, TAO and TAX, who from their various positions at Nyarubuye parish saw the Accused arrive with armed assailants and launched a ferocious attack in broad daylight.  These witnesses, Your Honours, knew Gacumbitsi prior to the massacres and would have had no difficulty in singling him out of a crowd in broad daylight.  He arrived in common style, in a communal pickup, accompanied by a quadrille of communal policemen and armed militiamen.  These same witnesses, Your Honours, had further opportunity to positively identify the Accused when he returned to Nyarubuye parish on the 16th and the 17th of April 1994.  

Now, the picture I have just painted, Your Honours, would be incomplete without reference to the context in which this macabre slaughter was committed or without reference to the sequence of events between the 7th and the 15th of April 1994, in Rusumo commune.  

Regarding the context, Your Honours, you heard the expert testimony of Dr. Alison Des Forges, and you have read the manuscript of her testimony in the case of The Prosecutor against Akayesu, which was admitted onto the record in this case as Prosecution Exhibit No. 15.  Her unchallenged and uncontroverted opinion is that the massacre of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 were not spontaneous but centrally organised and supervised, with the sole intention of complete destruction of the Tutsi as an ethnic group.  And we would submit on this score, Your Honours, that the Nyarubuye carnage was no exception and neatly fits into the nationwide campaign that was going on simultaneously all over Rwanda.  

Equally relevant for Your Honours' deliberation is the sequence of events and actions of the Accused which point to the planning and premeditation behind the Nyarubuye massacre.  They are sufficiently addressed in our written brief, and we only single out the most salient from which the necessary inferences of guilt must flow.  

According to the evidence of Witness TAW, Your Honours, the Accused attended a meeting in Kibungo on the 8th of April 1994, at which TAW subsequently learnt that the plot to exterminate the Tutsi had been elaborated.  It does not injure our case, Your Honours, to concede that this is hearsay evidence with little probative value if seen out of the circumstances that subsequently unfolded in Rusumo in the following week.  

It was also the case for the Prosecution, Your Honours, that on Saturday, 9th of April 1994, Gacumbitsi, as bourgmestre of Rusumo, convened and presided over a meeting of conseillers and political party heads at the communal conference hall.  It was at this meeting, Your Honours, according to the evidence of Witness TBH, that Gacumbitsi instigated his conseillers to organise the killing of Tutsis in their respective secteurs.  

The evidence of TBH, Your Honours, is in part corroborated by Witness TAW, and it is vital evidence proving the nascent stages of the extermination plan and the premeditation with which the killings were committed.  

On the evening of 9th of April 1994, TAW was briefed by TBH about what had transpired at the said meeting earlier on; namely, that the Accused Silvestre Gacumbitsi had elaborated the plan to kill Tutsis and had asked his conseillers to put it into immediate effect. We concede, Your Honours, that there is some divergence between what TBH purported to have told TAW and what TAW says he was told by TBH.  The common denominator, however, Your Honours, remains constant, that the Tutsi's moment of reckoning had finally come.  It is tempting, Your Honours, for the Defence to rely on the seemingly inaccuracy and minor inconsistency and blow it out of proportion in their brief.  We explain it, however, by the passage of time, the influence of that call on that occasion and the failure of human memory.  Posed against the background of what actually happened, however, over the next course -- over the course of the next seven days, this meeting neatly conforms with the general scheme to exterminate the Tutsis, and we would, in the circumstances of the whole case, urge
Your Honours to treat it likewise.  

It was the further evidence, Your Honours, of Witness TAW, that on the 10th of April 1994, the Accused Silvestre Gacumbitsi went to the Rwandan army camp in Kibungo with three communal pickup trucks and took delivery of 105 cartons of assorted weapons.  According to TAW, Your Honours, these cartons were distributed the same day in Rusumo commune by the Accused and communal policemen to all the various secteurs.  

We again, concede, Your Honours, that the only evidence that these cartons contained weapons is based on the assumption of Witness TAW and on the contemporaneous report he received from one Leonidas Gacondo, the responsable of Kabuza cellule, who had taken delivery of several of those cartons from Gacumbitsi that same afternoon.  Gacondo, Your Honours, purportedly told Witness TAW that the cartons did indeed contain weapons.  The events, Your Honours, transpiring in Rusumo over the next week lend credence to the evidence of TAW in this regard and render it reliable and beyond reproach. 

The Prosecution, Your Honours, also led evidence of four representative instances where the Accused publicly ordered and/or instigated civilians to isolate and kill their Tutsi neighbours.  It was evidence of TAS corroborated by that of TAW, that on the 13th of April 1994, the Accused addressed the people gathered at Nyakarambi market and told them in his speech to ensure, and I quote, "their own security", by reference to the houses which could be seen burning in the neighbouring commune of Rukira.  Both TAS, a Hutu, and TAW, a Tutsi, understood the Accused's utterances to be an encrypted call upon the Hutu to kill the Tutsi.  These witnesses are, of course, entitled to their own interpretation, which cannot be held against the Accused if seen in isolation of the prevailing circumstances of the day.  

TAW, Your Honours, was privy to classified information about the plan to kill the Tutsi.  He fled to safety in Tanzania shortly after the speech by Gacumbitsi.  On the other hand, Witness TAS overheard a communal policeman called Kazoba, saying that the Accused had given orders that all Tutsis should be killed by noon of 14th of April 1994, starting with the killing of Marie and Beatrice, Gacumbitsi's Tutsi tenants.  

We have, Your Honours, attempted to sequentially trace the path of the genocide from the 8th to the 13th of April, like a cyclone picking debris in its wake.  

We now move to the 14th of April 1994.  But maybe before we do, the events I have just addressed Your Honours, if considered independent of each other, they may appear to be worthless as evidence.  We submit, however, Your Honours, that they are very relevant and of probative value because they are the various pieces of this jigsaw puzzle that neatly fit into each other and ought to be seen as a whole.  

During your deliberations, Your Honours, we'd urge you to look at the evidence as a whole, not in a compartimentalised and narrow way, because it is only then that it makes meaning.  What happened on the 14th of April, Your Honours, the day before the slaughter at Nyarubuye the next day, we have the evidence of Witness TBH, TBI, TBJ and TBK, all ex-detainees in Rwanda who we referred to in our written brief as accomplices, accomplices because the offences with which they were charged in Rwanda were committed at the bidding of the Accused, form part of the same genocide we alleged and proved.  It was the evidence of Witness TBH and TBJ that in the morning of the 14th of April 1994, the Accused in the company of his policemen arrived at Rwanteru trading centre and exhorted the crowd to kill Tutsi and loot their property.  They were quick to comply, Your Honours.  

According to Witness TBK, later that day, at around 3 p.m., the Accused in the company of policemen arrived at Kanyinya trading centre with the same message, that of killing the Tutsi.  According to TBK, Your Honours, the killing of Tutsi commenced the next day in his neighbourhood, all done at the instigation of Silvestre Gacumbitsi.  An hour later, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi with his policemen in tow turned up at Gisenyi trading centre at approximately 4 p.m. that afternoon, again, with the same message, instigating the killing of Tutsi and the plunder and pillage of their property.  

According to TBI, who confessed to have killed a woman, her children and a man, whom he threw into the Kagera river, the killings in Gisenyi also commenced the next day, on the 15th of April 1994.  

For reasons that are not entirely clear to the Prosecution, Your Honours, the Defence in its written brief suggests that these witnesses are not accomplices.  I would be remiss in my duty as an officer of this Court to treat these witnesses as anything other than accomplices.  They are accomplices par excellence, and that is why in our written brief we advise caution when Your Honours are considering their evidence.  It needs no restatement that in most jurisdictions accomplice evidence is treated with the utmost caution.  

We note, however, Your Honours, that the accomplices, in the course of their testimony, individually denied any threat or inducement to come and testify, and the peculiar circumstances of each are adequately dealt with in our written brief and need no repetition here, for fear of compromising their protected identities.  And it is for this same reason, Your Honours, that we shall not indulge the Defence in their gratuitous and their unsavoury comments, unsupported by any evidence, of why these witnesses chose to testify the way they did.  
We now move, Your Honours, to the 15th of April 1994.  Prior to the major assault on Nyarubuye parish, Your Honours, the evidence of Witnesses TAC and TAK places the Accused in and between Nyabitare and Nyarubuye, contrary to the Accused's assertion that he was in hiding.  

It was the evidence of Witness TAC, Your Honours, that the Accused arrived at the Nyabitare Catholic centre at approximately 1 p.m. in the company of armed communal policemen, including Kazoba and Berakumenyo.  The two policemen are alleged by the witness to have entered the Catholic centre building and emerged with two Tutsi males, Rukomeza and Mutunzi.  They first assaulted these Tutsi males with their gun butts in the presence of Accused Gacumbitsi, who was interrogating them.  

From his hiding place, TAC was not able to hear the nature of the questions posed by Gacumbitsi, but did hear the two victims cry out loud for mercy, pleading to be shot rather than killed with machetes.  Their prayers were promptly answered by one of the policemen, who shot them both while the Accused drove off to Nyarubuye.  

Shortly after this very incident, Your Honours, Witness TAK spotted the Accused in a convoy of vehicles headed towards Nyarubuye.  Both Witnesses TAC and TAK subsequently heard the sound of gunfire and explosions originating from Nyarubuye direction that same afternoon.  That, Your Honours, is the core of the Prosecution evidence in support of the counts of genocide and extermination.  

I now move to the count of rape. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, just a point of clarification.  You said that Witness TAK accompanied who?  Did he accompany a witness or an accused in the convoy?  Who did he accompany, the witness or the Accused?   

So, I think the correction has been made by the French booth, both the translation for the Prosecution counsel.  I think the correction has been made. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Your Honours.  Your Honours will recall the second Prosecution witness, TAQ, nine months pregnant on 17th April of 1994, according to testimony.  Her evidence is that at around 9 a.m. on the morning of the 17th of April 1994, the Accused drove by her hiding place and she heard him announce loud and clear over a megaphone that Tutsi females should be raped, and if there was any resistance, they should be killed in an atrocious manner. 
	(Pages 1 to 10 by Sithembiso Moyo)


	1000H
MR. KAREGYESA: (continuing) 
	Shortly after this call for rape by the Accused, a group of about ten Interahamwe discovered TAQ and seven other female colleagues and flushed them out of their hiding place.  These Interahamwes, Your Honours, press-ganged the eight females up the hill and threatened them with death for 
	non-compliance before forcefully undressing them and raping them.  It was the evidence of TAQ that she was raped while nine months pregnant, and actually gave birth that same day subsequent to the rape.  Her colleague, Chantal, was less fortunate.  She was murdered.  The assailants spread her legs and thrust a wooden stake up her vagina.  She probably bled to death because of this assault.  

	That, Your Honours, is the evidence in support of the facts pleaded in paragraph 39 of the indictment, which proves beyond any reasonable doubt that the Accused Sylvestre Gacumbitsi is guilty of rape as a crime against humanity, on account of instigating the rape of Tutsi women as part of a widespread or systematic attack on the Tutsi civilian population. 

Now, in addition to relying on the evidence of Dr. Alison Des Forges, which established beyond reasonable doubt in the Akayesu case that rape and other forms of sexual violence against Tutsi women was an integral part of the widespread and systematic attacks on the Tutsi population in 1994, the Prosecution also led the evidence of Witness TAS, a Hutu female married to a Tutsi.  TAS was gang-raped by two Hutu men, including Muvunangoma, a younger brother of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  Muvunangoma claimed that Gacumbitsi had authorised them to rape and murder Tutsi women.  She was not killed subsequent to the rape, but her Tutsi husband was less fortunate.  He was killed that same evening by a mob of Tutsi (sic) assailants. 

Your Honours will also recall the evidence of Witness TAP, which also establishes the widespread and systematic rapes in Rusumo commune during the month of April 1994.  Your Honours excluded a portion of this witness's testimony on account of prejudice to the Accused for late or non-disclosure.  The rest of her testimony remains on record.  According to TAP, Your Honours, after the Nyarubuye massacre, she and her mother were gang-raped by a gang of about 30 Hutu assailants, including one of her former domestic servants.  After raping TAP's mother, Your Honours, the assailant thrust a wooden branch through her vagina, which exited through her head, killing her instantly.  TAP, too, Your Honours, was also gang-raped, subsequent to which a metre-long branch was thrust up her vagina. 

You recall the evidence of Witness TAO, a male Tutsi, husband and father of children, who witnessed the gang-rape and subsequent murder of his wife by the rapists, rapists who also killed his children by tossing them into a fire.  Such, Your Honours, is the depravity with which these crimes were committed. 

I will now move on, Your Honours, to briefly address the count of murder.  Maybe before I do, Your Honours, I just wish to remind you that in the Prosecutor's brief, at Annex B, is a memorial summarising the evidence of widespread and systematic attacks on a civilian population, containing some 196 references from the record.  So when you're considering, Your Honours, that common element to all crimes against humanity, for ease of reference there is Annex B. 

The Accused, Your Honours, is also charged with murder as a crime against humanity, the material facts of which are pleaded in paragraphs 33, 34 and 36 of the indictment, where we allege the murder of Kanyogote, Mutunzi, Rukomeza, Marie and Beatrice respectively.  I would be quick to concede, Your Honours, that paragraph 33 is defective from misdescription of the victim, but we submit, Your Honours, that the defect is not total and does not in any way prejudice the Accused.  The paragraph, Your Honours, pleads the killing of a Tutsi female and her three children, while the evidence adduced at trial proved the killing of a male Tutsi named Kanyogote and his two children.  In either case, the victim is a Tutsi adult, friend of the Accused, who happened to be a godfather of one of the children.  The Accused was on sufficient notice of the allegation based on the adequate and timely disclosure of the statement of Witness TAK and the clarification contained in paragraph 2.30 of the pre-trial brief, which specifically mentions the murder of Kanyogote.  It was the evidence, Your Honours, of Witness TAK that on the evening of the 14th of April 1994, he went with Kanyogote and his two children to the Accused's residence to seek shelter from the attacks on Tutsi homes in the region.  TAK, however, Your Honours, didn't enter Gacumbitsi's residence as the victims did.  He remained approximately 50 yards from Gacumbitsi's house.  A short while later, TAK observes a large crowd emerging out of Gacumbitsi's house while beating someone.  In an instant, TAK heard Kanyogote loudly pleading for mercy and imploring Gacumbitsi to spare his life.  TAK, Your Honours, never witnessed or saw who actually killed Kanyogote, but he later identified Kanyogote's remains during an exhumation near the Accused's house in 1997.  The remains still had the clothes that Kanyogote wore when TAK last saw him alive. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Can I just pause there?  The killing of Kanyogote doesn't feature in the indictment, does it? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
This is what, Your Honours, I called a misdescription.  It's supposed to be paragraph 33.  There is a misdescription there which we submit isn't fatally defective and causes no prejudice to the Accused.  The Accused was on adequate notice of the specific allegation by reason of the disclosure of the witness statement and also by the clarification in paragraph 2.30 of the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief filed on the 16th of May 2003. 

JUDGE REDDY:
Paragraph 33 is the one that talks about a woman and her three children.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes, Your Honours.  This is why I'm saying it's a misdescription.  I've said the paragraph pleads a Tutsi woman and three children, while the evidence at trial proves a male Tutsi adult and two children.  In both cases, Your Honours, the victim is a Tutsi. 
JUDGE REDDY:
So 33 is the relevant paragraph.
MR. KAREGYESA:
It is the relevant paragraph, Your Honour.
JUDGE REDDY:
Dealing with the killing of Kanyogote.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes, Your Honour, and the corresponding one in the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief is 2.30. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Are these defects not fatal?  
MR. KAREGYESA:
It would, in a municipal jurisdiction, probably be fatal, if a technical, narrow approach is used, but we submit in the context of mass crimes targeting civilian groups, civilian populations, on account of either ethnicity, religion, politics, the Statute seeks to protect groups and members of the groups.  What is important is the subjective perception of the perpetrator when such a crime is committed.  In this case, we concede that there is a defect but not so fatal as it does not cause any prejudice to the Accused as long as action was taken subsequent to the indictment to put him on sufficient notice. 

Now, in municipal jurisdictions, judges would ordinarily have inherent jurisdiction or power to amend an indictment to conform to the evidence led.  In the event that it hasn't been done, Your Honours, you may wish to consider it as a possibility. 

May I proceed? 
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, certainly. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 

In paragraph 34 of the indictment, Your Honours, the Prosecution alleges the murder of Mutunzi and Rukomeza.  Again, they are not specifically named in the indictment as being Mutunzi and Rukomeza.  Reference is just made to Tutsi males.  This, however, is clarified in paragraph 2.28 of the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief and the Accused was on sufficient notice of the particulars of the victims by reason of the disclosure of the written statement of Witness TAC, a witness to these events.  The murder of Mutunzi and Rukomeza at Nyabitare Catholic Centre has already been discussed under the count of genocide and extermination and merits no repetition.  

Now, with regard to paragraph 36 of the indictment, Your Honours, the Prosecutor relied on circumstantial evidence to prove that the Accused was criminally responsible for the murders of Marie and Beatrice, two Tutsi females, on the night of the 13th of April 1994 at Nyakarambi trading centre.  It's not disputed by the Defence that they were murdered in cold blood, Your Honours.  What they contest is who is criminally responsible for the killings.  The Prosecutor relied upon evidence that proved that the Accused evicted these two tenants from his house on account of their ethnicity.  Antecedent to this, of course, Your Honours, the Accused had instigated his conseillers on the 9th of April 1994 to kill Tutsis, he had distributed weapons for the purpose on the 10th of April 1994, and on the night of 13th April, Witness TAS overheard Kazoba, the notorious communal policeman, saying that the Accused had ordered the killing of Tutsis, starting with Marie and Beatrice.  And in this regard, our submission is, Your Honours, that the only inference that can be drawn from these circumstances is that the Accused is criminally responsible for these double murders, which were a foreseeable, if not intended, result of the common plot, scheme or design to destroy the Tutsi ethnic group, even though committed by proxy in furtherance of the said plot. 

Now, in addition, Your Honours, to the murders I've just addressed you on, the Prosecution relies on other murders, namely the killing of Murefu and others at Nyarubuye on the 15th of April 1994, the killing of Mukamwiza on the 16th of April 1994, to prove that the alleged or the pleaded murders were committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, on account of their ethnicity. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Where is the evidence about the killing of the -- of several children, subject matter of your paragraph 35? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour --
JUDGE REDDY:
You haven't dealt with that.
MR. KAREGYESA:
You'll note in our brief, Your Honours, that we led no evidence on that, and we are not relying on that paragraph at all.
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, thank you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Your Honours. 

Now, in the face of such overwhelming evidence, Your Honours, what would the Defence have you believe?  The last stand of the Accused is that he was without power, influence or knowledge of the plot, that he was in hiding, the supposed victim of marauding criminals who alleged that he was an accomplice of the Tutsi and deserving of similar fate.  If, as the Defence claims, Gacumbitsi was in hiding between the 13th through the 17th of April 1994, why was no notice of alibi served on the Prosecution, you may wish to ask.  Or if indeed it be true that he was hiding at his house, why were no witnesses ever called to say so?  Would a victim threatened by ruthless criminals hide at his house which was by the roadside and publicly known?  Wouldn't he be exposing himself to great risk? 

A resolution of these questions, Your Honours, is to be found in the record from Prosecution evidence and from the Accused's own testimony.  It was Gacumbitsi's evidence, Your Honours, that he was in hiding at his house from the afternoon of the 13th through the 17th of April.  Pressed in 
cross-examination by the Prosecutor, Your Honours, this is what Gacumbitsi had to say, and I quote:  "Listen, to say that I was in hiding in my house, that does not mean I was indeed in my house, but I had asked members of my family not to tell anyone where I was.  That's what I said.  That's what I asked my family members to say." 

This glaring contradiction, Your Honours, remains unresolved on the record.  Your Honours have no explanation from the Accused, or any other witness, for that matter, as to his actual whereabouts between the 13th through the 17th of April.  The only evidence you have, Your Honours, is that from Prosecution witnesses who knew him and positively identified him at the various crime scenes alleged in the indictment on the disputed dates. 

Now, in an attempt to plug this gaping hole in Defence evidence, Your Honours, the Defence closing brief tries to breathe a new meaning into the concept of alibi.  If you look at the Defence closing brief, at page 18 of the English version, and I believe it's paragraph 8, it reads, and I quote: "What matters in alibi is not to state the place where the Accused was but to prove that he was not present at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed."  This novel proposition advanced by the Defence, Your Honours, is not supported by any authority whatsoever, and we submit that it is a deliberate misrepresentation of the law. 

Now, in adversarial jurisdictions, the Prosecutor bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was present and committed the crimes with which he's charged, and this burden never shifts.  It does not even shift where an accused asserts an alibi.  Where, however, an accused raises an affirmative defence of alibi, he must present evidence which tends to show that by reason of his presence at a particular place, at a particular time, he was not at the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the alleged time of its commission.  Evidence which merely, you know, indicates that an accused was not present at the scene of a crime, with no corresponding positive assertion as to where the accused was, is not evidence in support of an alibi at all.  And we submit, Your Honours, that this interpretation of the law on alibi finds support in our own Rules of Procedure and Evidence at Rule 67(A)(ii)(a), which reads in part, and I quote -- or which requires the Defence to notify the Prosecution of, and I quote, "the place or places at which the accused claims to have been present at the time of the alleged crime and the names and addresses of witnesses and any other evidence upon which the accused intends to rely to establish the alibi." 
JUDGE REDDY:
And you say that Rule 67 was not complied with in this case. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes.  But that's besides the point, Your Honour, because it's no bar to advancing an alibi even if you don't issue notice to the Prosecution.  What I'm trying to direct Your Lordship's attention is what is required to establish an alibi, however belated. 
JUDGE REDDY:
In other words, what has been raised is not really alibi.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Precisely, Your Honours.  It's a mere denial that does not amount to an alibi.
JUDGE REDDY:
But I'm just wondering about the consequences of not complying with Rule 67.  Does it bear any consequences? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Well, Rule 67(B) overleaf says it's no bar.  It's your discretion, Your Honours, to allow --
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, I see that.
MR. KAREGYESA:
-- the Defence to raise an alibi.
JUDGE REDDY:
I see that. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Now, let it not be misunderstood for a moment that the Prosecution seeks to shift the burden on the Accused to prove his alibi.  Not at all.  But there is basic evidence that is required to establish an alibi, and in this case, Your Honours, we submit that there is no evidence and, therefore, this is not an alibi at all.  You don't know, we don't know, where the Accused was on the disputed dates, and other than Prosecution evidence placing him at the scenes of crime, there is no other evidence as would cast an iota of doubt on the Prosecution case.  We therefore urge Your Honours to disregard this pseudo-alibi in its entirety. 

The alibi aside, Your Honours, we turn briefly to consider Defence evidence with regard to some of the events on which we led evidence, and as I said earlier, Your Honours, we filed a detailed written brief so we shall attempt to be short and to the point.  I noted, when I started an hour ago, Your Honours, that the massacre of civilians at Nyarubuye parish is not contested.  Nor is it contested that on the 16th of April 1994, there was a mopping-up exercise which involved the killing off of survivors.  We submit, Your Honours, that from the sheer scale and intensity of this sustained attack, the only inference that can be readily drawn -- or the only inferences that can be readily drawn are that, one, the intention was genocidal, and, two, that the massacre was part of a broader ethnical or politically motivated, widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population as alleged in the indictment. 

The Defence called four witnesses, and I will briefly highlight the disturbing parts of their testimony, Your Honours.  Witness NG2 for the Defence claims that the attack was led by gendarmes from Mulindi, who forced civilians like him to join the group of attackers.  Surprisingly, however, Your Honours, while other civilians carried traditional weapons, and were compelled by the assailants to wear banana leaves, this witness obtained an exemption from the gendarmes.  He neither carried a weapon nor did he have to don banana leaves.  NG2 claims that he neither killed nor looted any property during the Nyarubuye attack on the 15th of April 1994; yet he positions himself in the front row of activity, side by side with the armed gendarmes.  He claims to have spent almost two hours at the parish during the attack and says many people died during the attack, although he only concedes to seeing one corpse.  It's NG2's testimony that he never saw Gacumbitsi at Nyarubuye parish during this same attack.  I don't find it surprising, Your Honours; if he only saw a single corpse during a massacre that lasted more than two hours, you wouldn't expect him to have seen Gacumbitsi, would you?  It's simple.  A witness who denies the obvious, for whatever reason, isn't to be relied upon.  He must be treated with caution, the same caution you would apply while evaluating the evidence of an accomplice,  particularly where the witness seeks to exculpate himself from any criminal activity, in this case incompatible with where he was positioned during the attack.  We therefore advise caution, Your Honours, and submit that the evidence of this witness is inherently unreliable. 

The next Defence witness, Your Honours, UHT, was also purportedly forced by men wearing banana leaves and press-ganged to Nyarubuye parish on the 16th of April 1994, a day after the massacre.  His evidence is that he found soldiers, gendarmes, and people wearing kitenge uniforms killing off any survivors from the carnage of the night before.  UHT claims to have spent at least six hours at the parish doing nothing but watching the murderers.  His evidence, too, is that he never saw Gacumbitsi at the parish on the 16th of April 1994.  This witness, Your Honours, was not an impressive witness, to say the least.  He posts the death of President Habyarimana on the 10th of April 1994, a four-day margin of error, rendering his presence at Nyarubuye parish on the 16th of April highly improbable, if not mistaken. 

Now, apart from keenly playing victim and distancing himself from the criminal activity of that day, he was also evasive in answering questions, and his testimony is replete with inconsistencies between written statement and oral evidence.  On many occasions, Your Honours, he blamed the error on the investigator who recorded his statement, and, in fact, his testimony ended like this, and I quote:  "Is it the first mistake we have noticed since I began my testimony?"  This witness, too, Your Honours, refused to admit the obvious.  He refused to admit that the Tutsis were the targets of the killings and violence in and around Nyarubuye, despite the fact that he and his brother-in-law were, on that morning, beaten by masked men on account of unresolved questions pertaining to their ethnic identity.  It's therefore not surprising, Your Honours, that another witness who would deny the obvious would equally deny the presence of Gacumbitsi at Nyarubuye on that day. 

You recall the evidence of Defence Witness ZHZ.  He too claims he was forced to the parish by attackers.  He also distances himself from any criminal activity by placing himself at the back of the crowd of attackers and conveniently manages to slip away when the explosions begin.  He never saw a single corpse, but that's beside the point.  His credibility is particularly more doubtful on account of false representations made on the record concerning his own criminal antecedents during 
cross-examination by the Prosecution.  These matters are adequately addressed in the closing brief and will not be recounted here, for fear of compromising his protected identity, but I would urge Your Honours to treat his evidence with utmost circumspection and caution. 

The last Defence witness to testify about the Nyarubuye massacre, ZIZ, was equally preposterous.  He too didn't see Gacumbitsi on that day, and also claims that he was press-ganged by assailants who were going to the parish to kill accomplices.  He was labelled an accomplice by the assailants but was never killed.  I find that hard to reconcile.  He said he didn't know who the assailants were but was emphatic that they were from Birenga.  How would he know unless he knew them?  Asked by Your Lordships what he meant by "innocent" -- "innocent" in closed quotes -- in relation to those people asked to step outside from the crowd at the parish just before the attack, he was totally evasive and feigned ignorance.  In short, he failed to acknowledge that it was the Hutus who were asked to separate from the crowd of the Tutsi refugees before the attack began. 

He also referred to "accomplices" -- in quotes -- but he couldn't explain to Your Lordships what he meant or understood "accomplices" to mean within the context of the prevailing circumstances. 
You will also recall the witness saying that the refugees at the parish were guilty, but didn't explain what they were guilty of.  Now, it was common knowledge, Your Honours, that the refugees were guilty because they were Tutsi.  That was the only crime:  They were Tutsi. 

This witness, Your Honours, was also emphatic that he never saw communal policemen at the parish during the massacre, never mind that he couldn't tell the difference between communal policemen and gendarmes. 

Such, Your Honours, are the witnesses the Defence would have you believe regarding the events at Nyarubuye on those tragic dates of 15th and 16th April 1994, witnesses who will deny the most obvious and whose only common ground is that they did not see Gacumbitsi at the parish on those dates. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Assuming -- I'm in no way prejudging anything, but if the Tribunal accepts the evidence of TAQ, TAO and TAX, must necessarily mean that we reject the evidence of those Defence witnesses that you're dealing with now.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours --
JUDGE REDDY:
Or does it? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
You have to look at the evidence as a whole.  When the Accused was put to his defence, the Prosecution had obtained the threshold of establishing a prima facie case.  You will have to test the evidence of the Prosecution against the evidence of the Defence, taking a holistic approach before you reach your conclusions. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, yes.  Thank you. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
We would submit, Your Honours, and very strongly too, that the evidence of these four witnesses was totally lacking in credit and does not cast an iota of doubt on the evidence proffered by the Prosecution, and we would urge Your Honours to disbelieve it altogether. 

As I wrap up, Your Honours, I will just briefly touch on Gacumbitsi's defences or evidence concerning the alleged meeting of 9th of April 1994 at the Rusumo communal office where he instigated his conseillers to commence the killings of Tutsis.  The Accused concedes that the alleged meeting was held but denies that it was to instigate the killing of Tutsis.  Against the backdrop of events as they unfolded subsequent to the 9th of April 1994, we submit that Gacumbitsi's blanket denial does not cast any doubt on the Prosecution evidence proffered by TAW and TBH.  Similarly, Your Honours, the Accused denies going to the FAR military camp in Kibungo on the 10th of April 1994 to take delivery of weapons.  His evidence is that he was in Nyamugali on the morning of the 10th of April 1994, and Witness ZEZ testified in support of this alibi.  ZEZ's evidence, Your Honours, should equally be treated with circumspection.  This is a witness who was evasive in answering questions concerning the death of Kanyogote, and when asked by Your Lordships why he never reported Kanyogote's death to the authorities, his evidence is that the authorities were useless at the time. 

Now, if indeed it be true that the authorities were useless, it's highly unlikely that the authority, Gacumbitsi, would have gone to Nyamugali on the 10th of April 1994, as he claims.  You will recall that this alleged visit to Nyamugali was put to TAW in cross-examination by the Defence and he was emphatic that Gacumbitsi did not go to Nyamugali.  Rather, it was the communal police in another communal vehicle who went to Nyamugali on that occasion.  TAW was emphatic he was with Gacumbitsi the whole of the 10th, from morning until late evening; at no point did they go to Nyamugali. 

Your Honours, with regard to the counts of murder and rape, the Accused's defence is an outright denial and a -- what I call his pseudo-alibi, which we have extensively discussed and merits no further comment.  Suffice to add, however, that --
JUDGE REDDY:
While you are dealing with murder, what is -- what would be the consequence if we found, for example, that you have not made out some of the specific allegations of murder in your indictment?  Does that alter count 4 in effect in any way? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
By failure to establish, for example, one murder out of so many? 
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes.
MR. KAREGYESA:
It doesn't impact on the count, Your Honours. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Thank you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Unlike municipal jurisdictions, where there is normally only one murder count in any single charge in an indictment, this is different.  It's generic and representative charging. 

We will not indulge the Defence in the libellous and unsavoury comment rendered on the Prosecution witnesses, and with regard to rape, the Defence offered no eye-witness, direct witness, to the rapes alleged.  The Defence position was contra-existential, i.e., all the Defence witnesses proffered at trial claim not to have heard Gacumbitsi ordering or instigating rape of Tutsi women.  We submit that however often a non-proposition is repeated, it remains a non-proposition.  The mere fact that Defence witnesses testified that they never heard Gacumbitsi ordering rape cannot controvert the direct evidence of those who heard him order the rape and who were raped subsequent to such orders or instigation. 

If you permit me, Your Honours, I would like to wrap up in time for the mid-morning break.  We conclude, Your Honours, by submitting that the Prosecutor has discharged the onerous burden of proving all the counts charged beyond reasonable doubt and would accordingly request that you find the Accused guilty of genocide, extermination, murder and rape. 

Our submission on the appropriate sentences is adequately laid out in the closing brief and merits no further discussion here, save that we request that if found guilty and convicted, Accused Sylvestre Gacumbitsi should be put away for life. 

I'm most obliged, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor, for those closing remarks.  Judge Reddy would like to ask you a few questions. 

Judge Reddy, please. 
JUDGE REDDY:
I note you haven't said anything about the evidence of the journalist, Fergal Keane.  Would you just briefly indicate to us what you say is the significance or the importance of that evidence to this case as a whole? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I didn't deem it necessary, both for brevity and possibly irrelevance, to render any comment on the evidence of Fergal Keane, because it is no longer in issue.  It's not contested by the Defence that there was a massacre at Nyarubuye on the 15th of April 1994.  Fergal Keane was never a witness to the massacre.  He captured graphic images six weeks after the massacre.  We have led the evidence of three direct witnesses who survived the massacre, and the Defence in its case concedes that the massacre was there. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  I have no other questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will adjourn and resume at 2.30 p.m. when we will listen to the closing arguments of the Defence.  So we stand adjourned.  Thank you.  

We will reconvene in this very courtroom at 2:30.   
(Court recessed at 1057H)

	(Court resumed at 1430H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Good afternoon to everyone.  

Mr. Kouengoua, you have the floor for the presentation of your closing arguments. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Initially, our closing arguments will be presented to the Trial Chamber by Miss Anne Ngatio Mbattang, and after that, I will see if I have anything to add.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Kouengoua.  

Miss Mbattang, you have the floor. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, the other members of this Court. 

Madam President, Your Honours, as the Prosecutor said this morning, the matter before us today is the nightmare experienced by the people of Rwanda in 1994.  Madam President, from the month of April to the month of July 1994, hundreds of people died in Rwanda, which at that time, Madam President -- which at that time seemed to enjoy peace, the kind of peace that a country could enjoy, and, in particular, some economic development.  Above all, the world had confidence in that small country.  However, Madam President, as I said earlier on, that country, Rwanda, experienced the most hideous crime that did dishonour and which still continues to do dishonour to the world as a whole.  Who was the perpetrator of those crimes?  Was it the government in place at the time?  Was it the RPF?  Or was it because those who at the time were sent on the spot to ensure peace among those people did not do their job? 

You know all the ramifications of this matter, Madam President, Your Honours.  You know all the ramifications, and therefore you can know exactly what happened.  Following this human tragedy, it was decided that this Court be set up, a Court which had to restore peace and reconciliation among the people of Rwanda.  It is for that reason, Madam President, that you are here today and that we are also here to help you see to it that the people of Rwanda find peace and reconciliation once more, the peace and reconciliation which they so desperately need. 

Madam President, the short stay I have had amongst you, I would say a stay that has lasted less than 30 days, because it only lasted so long as there were Prosecution and Defence witnesses, during this short stay, Madam President, in all humility, I think you are the most appropriate persons through whom peace can be restored in Rwanda.  Madam President, Your Honours, as I said, I followed you, your deliberations, for the short stay I had with you, and I noticed that you are attentive and that neither political concerns, nor concerns of friendly relations, would cause you to render a decision that will be counter to the reconciliation of the people of Rwanda. 

Madam President, Your Honours, as I said earlier on, unless one is really of bad faith, one cannot say that there were no massacres in Rwanda during the period April-July 1994.  These events occurred suddenly, Madam President, and I believe that during the period in question, nobody was -- or knew that there will be a trial and therefore nobody thought it necessary to gather all the evidence, which evidence could have helped you to render a decision on the basis of evidence. 

What happened?  The world was shocked by the events which occurred in Rwanda, 
Madam President, Your Honours.  And justice had to be rendered; the guilty had to be punished.  But as I said a while ago, Madam President, Your Honours, there was no evidence.  Consequently, it was thought that to ensure reconciliation, it was necessary to prosecute those who represented the institutions of that country at that time.  What I'm saying is not an invention.  In the Cyangugu case, we heard a witness, a certain Paul Dobbie, who testified that in that case it was difficult to have evidence because not having been able, as I said a while ago, to have evidence, a sketch was prepared, and on the basis of that sketch, prosecutions were instituted against ministers, préfets, bourgmestres, and so on and so forth.  That witness said in the Cyangugu case that it became necessary to arrest those persons and thereafter gather evidence, and that is why people who had to come to prove the Prosecutor's allegations were often those who were -- who knew the reality. 

Madam President, I believe that in that context, Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, who I here represent today, it is in that context that Gacumbitsi was arrested and that he appears before you today to answer to five counts:  Genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity, murder, rape, and extermination. 

Madam President, I would hold it against myself if I started by elaborating on the argument that -- or elaborating on the credibility of witnesses without presenting to the Court who Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre, was.  Because, Madam President, when I would have finished, when I would have finished introducing Mr. Gacumbitsi -- as I was saying, when I would have finished presenting Gacumbitsi, Madam President, Your Honours, I believe that you will know that the person before the Court today did not commit the crimes with which he is charged. Madam President, if you look at the indictment, that indictment does not enable you to know who the person appearing before you today is.  In the indictment it is said that the Accused was born in 1947.  This leads me to believe, Madam President, that there is a confusion between this witness and a certain Gacumbitsi, Samson, who lived in Kibungo préfecture.  At the time the Accused was arrested, the said Gacumbitsi, Samson, was in custody in Kibungo.  Well, that doesn't matter, Madam President.  Today you have before you 
Mr. Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre, who was born in 1943 in Rusumo commune.  Madam President, Your Honours, he is married and a father of six children.  He is married; he is a Catholic, Christian, a practising Catholic. 

Madam President, this Accused whom I have just described briefly lost his father at a very early age, and it was his mother who had the painful duty to raise this child.  He was Hutu and, 
Madam President, we know that at that time those who were entitled to education were the Tutsi.  Everyone has their faith or destiny, and the Tutsi chiefs at that time, having seen that Gacumbitsi had a promising future, a Tutsi chief did everything to enrol him in a school -- or, rather, that Tutsi chief calls Gacumbitsi's parents to enrol him in a school.  

When he completed or graduated from that school, which is very near the parents' home, he pursued his education, Madam President, Your Honours, at the Catholic mission of Nyabitare.  It is in that parish that a massacre occurred on 15 April 1994. 

Madam President, this man who was educated thanks to Tutsi assistance, thanks to the assistance from the Catholic mission, could he be against the Tutsi?  Could he join or be the instigator of the attack that took place in this parish?  I do not think so, Madam President.  

Why don't I think so, Madam President, Your Honours?  He completed his studies.  He became a teacher.  And before this Court you heard people who came to tell you that if they were able to go to school, it was thanks to Mr. Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre.  Before this Trial Chamber, Madam President, Your Honours, you were told that Gacumbitsi's friends were, above all, Tutsi, were mainly Tutsi.  TAW, TBC were mentioned.  Another person with whom he joined in the sole business that he undertook, that is, brickwork, were all Tutsi.  Madam President, that is a person being described to you today as being the person who was the cause of all the evil that befell Rusumo commune. 

Madam President, Mr. Gacumbitsi was appointed at the head of the commune, which was described here by Miss Alison Des Forges, a commune that was most abandoned by the government.  Yet 
Mr. Gacumbitsi undertook to develop that commune. 

In 1975 he noticed that there was no bank in that commune.  He created one.  He noticed that there were -- there weren't enough schools for children.  He created schools.  He listened to his people.  The Prosecutor told you that the Accused was somebody who enjoyed a vibrant social life.  He shared a drink with everyone.  How, therefore, could you think, Madam President, Your Honours, that somebody with such a background, somebody with such an education, with such a culture, ready to help everyone, could destroy what he built with his own hands; namely, the inhabitants of Rusumo commune?

Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence submits that Mr. Gacumbitsi is that man and could not have been the cause of the evil experienced by his commune in April 1995.  Yet, Madam President, he is appearing before you today because he was arrested and transferred to the prison in the UN detention facility in Arusha on the basis of an indictment prepared by Prosecution. 

Madam President, the Defence has gone through, has perused, that indictment, and have come to the conclusion that the conditions set out in Rule 17, 18, 47 and Article 20(A) of the Statute have not been complied with.  But before that, Madam President, Your Honours, I could tell you, without wanting to imitate any -- not because I do not think you know what an indictment represents -- I could tell you this so that you should be able to know or have this definition before you when I am going to analyse the said indictment.  As you know, Madam President, Your Honours, an indictment is the linchpin by which the Tribunal is seized, and you cannot, Madam President, Your Honours, render a decision except on the basis of what is alleged on the indictment.  

In my jurisdiction and according to the law which I practise, it is said the Court is seized in rem and in persona.  I was saying, Madam President, Your Honours, -- I was talking about this indictment, how it is presented.  

Madam President, I know we are constrained by time, but I will summarise what an indictment should be.  In the quotation I referred to earlier on, it is said that an indictment should, in a detailed manner, clearly state the facts with which the Accused is charged.  It is said that -- well, it follows from this provision that the drafting of the facts must be done with clarity, with accuracy, must be accurate and concise.  If we look at the indictment, Madam President, the indictment we have before us, we notice at a first glance that the Prosecutor is prosecuting Gacumbitsi as a main perpetrator of genocide and as an accomplice in genocide and also an accomplice for crimes in -- or crimes against humanity.  

Legally speaking, Madam President, Your Honours, when we talk of a main charge and a charge in the alternative, first of all, the allegations constituting the main charge must be explained, and if it is noticed that those allegations are untenable, then you are asked to characterise those allegations in the alternative.  But what do we see here in the indictment, Madam President?  The Prosecutor alleges as follows:  that the acts of genocide, which is the main charge, is explained by the evidence which would be given with respect to complicity, complicity in genocide.  This is not normal drafting, Madam President, and all of this, as I said a while ago, seems to us that the Prosecutor initially, when he prepared his indictment, did not know where to start from and thought, "Well, I have a duty to perform.  I have a sketch to follow.  First of all, I'm going to arrest Mr. Gacumbitsi and thereafter the Court is going to find its way."  But this is not the way -- this is not how to go about it.  When one proceeds in that manner, that is to prevent you from rendering just, fair, equitable justice.  

Still with regard to this indictment, Madam President, Your Honours, I told you a while ago that it emerges from the indictment that the Accused you have before you was born in 1947 in Rusumo, without further explanations.  Whereas the Prosecutor is duty bound to explain to you, to enable you to know whom you are convicting and therefore has given you -- or gives you the full identity of the detainee.  If you consider only this indictment, you may convict a certain Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre, who allegedly is born in 1947, but as I told you a while ago, the person appearing before you, 
Madam President, is born in 1943.  The Court has not been given the names of the Accused's parents.  And if you had to enter a conviction by default, you will have problems arresting or knowing the person you have convicted or you would have convicted somebody other than the person you should have convicted.  And in an international court like yours, there is no right to such errors.  Such errors should not be committed.  

Still in this indictment, Madam President, Your Honours, while the Prosecution is duty bound to disclose to the Accused detailed allegations, when we are talking of detailed allegations, this means that in the indictment the Prosecutor, when he alleges a fact, must specify the place of occurrence of the alleged acts, the date, when the alleged acts were committed, the person who allegedly committed the said acts, and the person or persons who allegedly committed the said acts with the Accused.  However, Madam President, Your Honours, if we look at the indictment, the indictment before us, the Prosecutor very often does not specify the person with whom the Accused allegedly perpetrated the acts with which he is charged. 

When the Prosecution tells you, Madam President, that the Accused committed the acts with which he's charged with the policemen of his commune, Prosecution, for example, gives you two names which very often are repeated.  These names are, for example, Kazoba and Berakumenyo.  
Madam President, this is not enough.  Why is this not enough?  Because there are many people who bear the same name and there is a risk, Madam President, Your Honours, that the Accused may not know in the preparation of his Defence who he allegedly perpetrated the acts, if at all he did commit them. Madam President, you will notice in this indictment that the Prosecutor uses expressions like "the", "towards", "at a certain date in the course of the month of April."  It is vague, Madam President; it is not specific.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I had said earlier that we were before an international court.  This Court, Madam President, has primacy over all other courts in the world, and when one is before such a court, he or she needs to be a bit more serious.  We, Madam President, did point out these defects before this Court.  We did so in 2002.  We were seeking that some counts be withdrawn.  We further sought an amendment of the indictment.  

What were we told in response to that application on our part?  The Prosecutor told us, "Well, we will see about this at the end.  That decision will lie -- or that determination will lie with the Judges.  It will lie with them to choose between genocide and complicity in genocide." 

Madam President, just to mention a few examples of the vagueness, or might I say the emptiness, of this indictment?  I would like to refer to paragraphs of the indictment.  In one of the paragraphs --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Be specific about the paragraph. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Paragraph 5, in regard to a meeting that took place on the 9th of April.  Should I read it?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's your business.  That's for you to determine whether this is important. 
MS. MBATTANG:
It reads, "On or about 9 April 1994 Sylvestre Gacumbitsi convened a meeting of all the conseillers de secteur, responsables de cellule and party chiefs of MRND and CDR in Rusumo commune.  The meeting was held at the bureau communal, and at that meeting, Bourgmestre Sylvestre Gacumbitsi announced that weapons would be distributed for purposes of the extermination of the Tutsi population."

You would notice, Madam President, that the Prosecutor does not make mention of the names of the conseillers de secteur or of the responsables de cellule or even of the party chiefs of the MRND and CDR in Rusumo commune.  He could have done so, Madam President.  He had every possibility to do so.  He had all the material and human means to so proceed.  He could have done so to prove the fact that -- or to establish the fact that that meeting did take place and that all those persons mentioned did participate, and maybe provide even a list of those who attended the meeting. 

Madam President, as I told you earlier, since the business of the Prosecutor, or the duty of the Prosecutor, was to fill in the empty spaces in his sketch, he just threw everything at you, just about anything.  

Madam President, Your Honours, if I now move on to Paragraph 7 of the indictment, the Prosecutor says as follows, "On or about 12 April 1994, after conferring with Major Ndekezi, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi ordered soldiers and boatmen along the lakes in Gisenyi secteur to stop refugees in flight from escaping across the border into Tanzania."  

Madam President, Major Ndekezi, would that be enough information?  Madam President, 
Your Honours, can -- with that type of information, can the Accused be able to defend himself?  
Major Ndekezi belonged to which unit in the army?  At the time these events occurred, was 
Major Ndekezi at the military camp in Rwanteru?  Madam President, when the Rwanteru camp was described to your Court, one, a senior officer could not be there as a person in charge of such a small camp, and at any rate, Madam President, the Prosecution did not make it possible for the Accused to know whomsoever he met in the event he met so-called Ndekezi or anyone belonging to the army on that date, namely, the 12th of April 1994.

Madam President, you would then understand that this indictment is so vague that you cannot use it without running the risk of delivering unfair justice.  And if we move further in this indictment, 
Madam President, we notice that the Prosecutor has put in everything, a hodgepodge.  In the indictment the Prosecutor has made mention of events which do not incriminate this accused person.  Madam President, the Prosecutor has included in this indictment facts which have not been alluded to subsequently, which have clearly not been proven.  

I made mention earlier on, Madam President, of this Tutsi lady who was an erstwhile friend of the accused person and who, at the time of the events, sought refuge at the Accused's house and it is claimed in the indictment that he failed to accommodate that lady and, instead, killed her and her three children.  That is what you were told this morning by the Prosecutor.  Such events could be explained, or one can put it to the massacres that occurred, in Kanyogote (sic).  But the Prosecutor did not dare to go further.  He didn't even dare to tell you how many children Kanyogote had or whether Kanyogote suddenly became a woman.  

All of this, Madam President, is merely to emphasise the fact that the indictment before you is a mere hodgepodge of events which the Prosecutor finds difficult to prove. 

Madam President, the indictment before you clearly carries or bears incurable defects.  Why do I say these defects are incurable?  Because from the trial -- pre-trial proceedings and right up to the stage that we are at today, the Prosecutor didn't deem it necessary to seize your Court for a reconsideration of this indictment.  He was allowed under Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  If he failed to do so, it was because he was aware that he could not so proceed.  And he was merely putting it in and saying, "Well, you're on your own," and it will lie with your conscience to convict someone who is innocent.  He does not provide you with the details of the facts.  He does not provide you with the evidence.  He just says, it is the Court.  It is yourself, Madam President, Your Honours, who would bear that heavy responsibility of convicting someone who a priori is not guilty.  

What does he say from the very beginning?  This morning, he told you that you could correct, rectify, this indictment.  He told you that this could be done taking into account the statements by witnesses -- sorry, the testimonies of witnesses before your Court, taking into account the briefs that have been filed; that is, after the Accused has already been kept in detention.  And I say to you, 
Madam President, that this cannot be done.  Otherwise, you would be bringing shame to the institution that you represent.  

Madam President, we are here to assist you, the Prosecution and the Defence alike, to hand down the law and to assist you.  We are duty bound, whether it be on the side of the Defence or the Prosecution, we are duty bound to provide you with the facts, with the events, with what charges are brought against the Accused.  We are bound to provide you with an indictment that contains all those facts as provided by law.  This morning you were told that you can proceed without all these.  That cannot be done; you cannot do so.  A lot of rulings have been handed down along those lines, Madam President.

Madam President, I was saying that rulings have been handed down according to which a vague indictment, a hodgepodge, a combination of confused events, cannot stand and amount to grounds for the conviction of an Accused person.  It has been ruled and held here, Madam President, that you cannot rectify or regularise the defects inherent in this indictment through closing arguments either made by the Prosecution or anyone else, or evidence that can be provided ex poste facto.  

Madam President, these are included in the Kupreskic judgement dated 23 October 2001.  That same application, Madam President, was applied on the 25th of February 2004 in the Cyangugu judgement.  You cannot differ.  It is the same Court.  If the Prosecution want to assist you in delivering a fair judgement, it would have had to review its indictment, and it had time to do so, particularly that ourselves at the time, in 2002, we had raised this matter.  He could have picked up what we had suggested, but since he didn't do so, those facts that are vague in the indictment -- I mean, you can follow the Prosecutor.  You will place yourself in a state of ridicule.  You cannot waver from what had been handed down, both by this Court and by the Appeals Chamber, in 2001.  

That having been stated, Madam President, I remained convinced that in view of the ability you have demonstrated, listening to us, you will not allow yourselves to be dragged along by the bad faith on the part of the Prosecutor, and that is why, Madam President -- that is why we rely on you, on your experience in matters judicial, to rule that the indictment that is brought before you is defective and therefore will not be considered in determining the conviction of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi; in other words, Madam President, in the silence of your chambers, Madam President, Your Honours, you would peruse this document, you would sift it, and in your soul and conscience you would say what needs to be said. 

This morning, Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecution -- and I believe tangentially -- talked to you about the credibility of Prosecution witnesses -- sorry, both Prosecution and Defence witnesses.  Madam President, I will not be going back to talk about all the witnesses.  In our briefs that have been submitted here, we dwelt -- in some 20 or 30 pages, we dwelt on the credibility of witnesses who paraded before your Court.  I agree with the Prosecutor when he said at the outset, Madam President, when he said that all my witnesses who were former detainees, their testimony would need to be considered over and over.  He also told you, Madam President, that the Defence witnesses are not credible. 

Madam President, we cannot place on the same standing or lend the same weight to the credibility of the testimony -- to the testimony of detainees, of killers, on the same level as citizens who are law abiding.  It is along this path that the Prosecutor would like to take you, that is, in view of the witness testimonies.  For our part, Madam President, we are saying that the Prosecutor's witnesses are not credible. 

Madam, in regard to the former detainees who came here as witnesses, the Prosecutor quite sincerely did tell you not to take into account their testimony.  So I shall not unduly dwell on the cases of those witnesses, and even if I had to do so, Madam President, I would say to you that all those fellows are people with a skeleton, and I would like to draw your attention to the circumstances under which those witnesses were placed on provisional release.  And among those witnesses, there are people who are still to undergo trial.  

But I would be blaming myself, Madam President, if I did not make reference to Witness TBH.  We said, Madam President -- we submitted, Madam President, that that witness had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment and had lost his civic rights, or had forfeited his civic rights.  And it was as a result that we requested you -- we urged you -- not to consider the statements or testimony made by that witness.  

In our brief, Madam President, that you have with you, we quoted Rule 66, 66(iii) of the Rwandan penal code.  It is a law applicable to all Rwandan citizens and it states as follows:  "Conviction that is accompanied by forfeiture of civic rights makes it impossible for such a Rwandan citizen to be an expert or to testify before the courts except in a case where mere information needs to be provided." 

Yet, Madam President, when this witness appeared before your Court, he took the oath before proceeding with his testimony, so you didn't hear him as a mere witness or for mere information purposes.  He could not be heard in view of the fact that he had been convicted and had accordingly forfeited his civic rights, so he should have testified without taking the oath. 

Madam President, that is in regard to the conviction of Witness TBH.  When that witness was heard by the Court, there were changes in such testimony, in the evidence he gave.  There was a sentence that he -- something he said here, and it stuck in my mind.  When he was talking about weapons, he told -- he told the Court, "I am telling the truth.  This time around, I am telling the truth.  I am not aware of the distribution of weapons."  

If we seek to interpret that testimony, what would it really mean, Madam President?  It would mean that, from time to time, TBH witness did tell lies and he repeated -- he merely repeated what the Prosecutor told him on a Friday, before appearing before your Court on a Monday.  The Prosecutor might have told him to lie and he said, "No, this time around I am going to tell the truth."
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour, I find that objectionable. 
MS. MBATTANG:
With the utmost respect, with the utmost respect for this Court, we are making our closing arguments.  Madam President, we most fervently listened to the Prosecutor this morning, and each time -- in fact, when his witnesses were testifying, when we wanted to raise a matter with which he would be uncomfortable, he reacted the way he has done right now. 

Madam President, I am making my closing arguments and the Prosecutor has no right to interrupt me, because what I have said in no manner would, for instance, disclose the identity.  It's, 
Madam President, an attempt to make me lose the trend of my thoughts and not be able to say the law as it should be. 

Madam President, we know that the Prosecutor has always tried to act as if he was presiding over this Court.  Could the Prosecutor just be patient?  When he will be given the floor, he'll have the opportunity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, Madam Mbattang, you have to be careful about what you are saying.  The Prosecutor is not acting as the presiding officer of this Court.  You are currently submitting your closing arguments.  We don't want to interrupt you, but please don't accuse anyone, any of the parties here.  So you have to be careful about what you say.  And you will not be interrupted, you better believe me.  You can now proceed.

	1530H
MS. MBATTANG:
So, Madam President, I was saying -- I was talking about the attitude of Witness TBH during his testimony before this Court.  

TBH is an ex-convict who has lost his civic rights and, therefore, he is an impeachable witness and his allegations therefore -- his testimony therefore, cannot help you in coming to a determination.  And that is why I am saying that contrary to what the Prosecutor said this morning, Madam President, Witness TBH is not a credible witness and his testimony -- his testimony is not beyond a reasonable doubt.  

I will say the same thing with respect to the other witnesses who are all ex-convicts, but you will tell me, Madam President, Your Honours, that the other witnesses have not lost their civic rights.  The Defence has given proof in their submissions, and if I may come back to that -- if I were to come back to that, we will take a lot of the Court's time.  

The Prosecution also referred to Witness TAQ.  The Defence also made submissions on the credibility of that witness.  **Madam President, Your Honours, it was alleged before this Trial Chamber that the woman in question is  ... ... .... .... ... ... ... .
MR. KAREGYESA:
Objection, Your Honours.  The identity of this witness is protected and she is compromising that protection.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ms. Mbattang, please be careful.
MS. MBATTANG:
Well, this is in the heat of action, Madam President.  I apologise for that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, try to avoid the same error.
MS. MBATTANG:
Very well, Madam President.
MR. KAREGYESA:
	If that portion could be expunged off the record, Your Honours, because we are in open session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would request the Registry to expunge from the transcripts, or proceedings, the status of this witness.
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, I was saying that the person I referred to gave a description -- gave an account of events, an account which a normal person cannot give.  What did she say throughout her testimony?  She was pregnant, she testified, a pregnancy that had come to full term.  And we know that a pregnant woman, a woman who's been pregnant for nine months is very tired.  But this very woman told this Court that she was in Nyarubuye on the 14th, that she was at the parish on the 15th, that she hid herself, together with other persons, in a kernel.  And in that kernel, according to the witness, there were several victims lying on the witness.  

The same woman, according to her testimony, got up at mid-night with the help of her mother, sometimes with the help of her mother -- sometimes with the help of her mother, sometimes with the help of her aunt-in-law.  And early in the morning she is the one who went to go and see people come and finish off the survivors. 

Your Honours, Madam President, it is the same woman who the assailants flushed out of a classroom.  The assailants would not kill her although they came to kill all the survivors.  The assailants asked her to wait on the spot so that they would first of all go and loot before coming back to kill her.  The woman leaves the classroom, and takes refuge sometimes near a river, if we refer to her statements during the preliminary investigations, and sometimes under a bridge.  And under the said bridge, the woman sees vehicles passing by.  She hears people who are speaking over loudspeakers.  The witness, Madam President, Your Honours, specified that when the vehicles were passing she recognised the driver of the Accused but did not see the Accused, and only recognised the person she said she recognised through that person's voice.  This description or this account of events is not normal.  

Already at the parish she fled and yet still heard, through the loud speaker, the Accused who was saying that the Tutsi should be killed.  Such an account, Madam President, is an exaggerated account and you cannot take it into consideration.  In view of all this without revisiting all the contradictions and inconsistencies in our testimonies, the Defence submits that Witness TAQ, contrary to the Prosecution's assertions, is not credible.  

Still this morning, Madam President, Your Honours, Prosecution talked about Witness TAS.  TAS's testimony was also inconsistent.  On the 13th of April in Nyakarambi the witness testified, "I did not -- I was not present up to the end of the meeting but I was able to hear what Sylvestre Gacumbitsi said."  The same witness told this Court that during the night at Rusumo where there is neither electricity nor any other facility, at a place where she was hiding, she heard a certain Kazoba who said that the Accused had asked that all the Tutsi be killed before the 14th.  

Madam President, I would hold it against myself if I failed to draw your attention to the fact that before this Court the witness, Witness RDR testified that she was among those who were approached and trained by Ibuka in order to come and support the conviction of the Accused.  In view of all this, Madam President, how can this Court hold that this witness only testified to what she saw?  

The same witness, Madam President, told the Court that on the 16th, while she was fleeing from the assailants, she went into a compound where she stayed in order to follow the acts of the Accused who was supposed to be in Nyarubuye according to the testimony of TAO.  Madam President, we have given you facts which enable you to enter a finding that this witness is not credible beyond a reasonable doubt.  

Madam Witness (sic), another credible witness that the Prosecutor referred to this morning is TAO.  We heard the testimony of this witness before this Trial Chamber.  It is that witness who arrived at the parish after the events of Nyarutunga.  The witness spent eight hours to find her family.  The witness finally finds her family, she puts them in a classroom and in the morning, without any reason, she leaves that classroom in order take refuge in a latrine belonging to the school.  And from that latrine, a pit latrine, Madam President, a latrine that had a closed door whose walls were made of earth, the witness was able to see the Accused, the Accused who was accompanied by other persons.  Those persons still have to be determined -- still have to be known.  They went to finish off the survivors who were at Nyarubuye parish.  The witness testified that she had two or three children, his wife and him.  And for a whole day they stayed in a latrine.  We do not know whether they were standing throughout the day, whether they were lying down.  In any case, humanly, that -- such an operation is impossible, and that is why we are saying that the account given by this -- because of the account given by this witness, the witness cannot be credible.  

We now move on to the case of Witness TAK.  TAK is the witness who before this Trial Chamber told or testified that -- that he went towards the house of Mr.  Gacumbitsi in the company of Mr. Kanyogote and his children.  That he went there at about 8 - 9 p.m. and that it was around 9:30 p.m. that he allegedly heard the cries of Kanyogote from Mr.  Gacumbitsi's house, and that subsequently or thereafter, he saw a crowd of people coming out of that house.  The witness fled and does not know whether Kanyogote was killed.  The witness gave you an account of those events while TBH -- or even though TBH told you that on the 14th, at about 9:00 a.m, a certain gentleman came to meet him with the bicycle of Mr. Kanyogote and told him that Mr. Kanyogote had just been arrested and that he was sure that he was going to be killed.  This was at 9 a.m., Madam President, I would like to specify that.  

Witness EZ.  Witness EZ, a Defence witness, told this Court that -- that he went to Kavuzo's cellule and that -- on that date between 9:00 -- or, rather, 10:30 and 11 o'clock, and he was told that his friend Kanyogote had just been killed.  Madam Witness -- Madam President, sorry, Witness TAK, who at 11 p.m. sees someone who certainly had been killed in the morning, can that person -- can such a witness's testimony be credible?  That is why Witness TAK is not credible, especially as Witness EZ told you that he saw bodies, dead bodies.  

Madam President, on a balance of probabilities, the Defence witnesses -- or if you compare the Defence witnesses to the Prosecution witnesses, as I told you earlier on with respect to the majority of Prosecution witnesses, Defence witnesses were citizens living in peace.  He told you that NG2 ZIZ, ZEZ, ZHZ and UPT are not credible.  The Prosecution tried to explain to the Court why they thought that ZEZ, ZHZ could not be credible.  

Madam President, the Defence demonstrated at length that these witnesses are credible.  Why?  The Prosecution relied, above all, on two events: One, the Prosecution alleged that ZHZ could not be credible because before this Trial Chamber that witness denied having been convicted for the murder of his household servant.  The Defence submits, and strongly argues, that this witness has never denied that he was convicted.  What this witness did before this Trial Chamber, is that he refused to say in open session what had happened to him.  The witness told you that he may say what happened to him in a closed session, and you would recall, Madam President, Your Honours, that when we moved into a closed session, without any insistence, as the Prosecution alleges, that witness told you the circumstances under which he was detained, under which he was detained provisionally; he specified that.  Because as regards the charge of murder as alleged by the Prosecution, under Rwandan criminal code, when one kills, that person is liable to a death penalty and not a penalty of three years imprisonment.  The witness explained that he had been detained for three years.  And, in any case, the Prosecution, which at the time of the events pretended that -- or purported that they had evidence, did not tender any evidence or judgment by which Witness ZHZ was convicted, but the witness said he had been detained and when one is detained, that does not at all affect the credibility of the person detained -- of the witness.  Especially as the witness explained that he was detained, that he did not commit the acts or crimes of which he was charged, but simply because it happens that one may be detained.  It may happen that a person is accused and that time is taken before you are asked to explain what happened.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I submit that this witness did not vary his testimony in spite of his state of health.  The witness testified, and as I said a while ago, he did not vary his testimony. 

This morning, the Prosecution told this Court that the witness was not credible because the witness alleged that he did not see a dead body in Nyarubuye where there was a massacre, but the witness told you the circumstances.  The witness testified before this Trial Chamber to the circumstances under which he left the parish.  The witness stated that he was compelled to be at the parish as soon as the attack was launched.  The witness took advantage of the ensuing disorder to go into hiding.  From a human standpoint, Madam President, somebody who goes into hiding when an attack has been launched, can such a person see a dead body?  Because people die only after there has been shooting.  This carries no weight, the fact that a person says that he did not see a dead body and you are told that the person is not credible because there was massacre.  And if the massacre occurred after his departure, if people died only after that witness's departure, Madam President, I do not see how you could cast doubt on the credibility of that witness.  The Defence therefore submits, 
Madam President, Your Honours, that this witness has given you an account which is beyond a reasonable doubt, and his credibility is beyond reproach.  

Madam President, it was also purported that the other Defence witness, that is Witness NG2, was not credible either.  That he wasn't credible because he testified that when he arrived in Nyarubuye, he did not see any corpse --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"He saw only one corpse", rather.  We wish to make that correction.
MS. MBATTANG:
When that witness testified before this Court, he said that he saw a dead body outside.  That was during his testimony in chief and that, in any case, there were many people who died in Nyarubuye.  If that allegation is dismissed, the testimony of Witness NG2 -- or, rather, the testimony of Witness NG2 is beyond doubt, is credible.  

Regarding Witness ZIZ, and I think this witness -- rather, we have made submissions on this witness in our written brief and we reply on what we said in our written brief regarding this witness.  

Madam President, Your Honours, this morning the Prosecutor talked about Witness UHT.  In our brief, we have dwelt at length -- we have shown that this witness is credible.  

Madam President, Your Honours, having shown that through all these credible witnesses the -- we have shown through these witnesses the credibility of our case and we have confidence that in this matter you will only render fair -- a fair decision, because the Prosecution has failed to adduce evidence that will lead to the conviction of this Accused.  

On this note, I will rest my case, and I regret to be leaving you because I would have liked to stay here a while longer to look at you, to admire you, because I know that peace, the peace that will be restored on this planet is in your hands and you will make every effort to successfully discharge your mission.  I rest my case, Mr. President(sic), Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Ms. Mbattang.  

Mr. Kouengoua, would you like to address the Court? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
	Madam President, Your Honours, after those final words by Ms. Anne Ngatio Mbattang, after those soft words, and after you have paid your full attention to what Ms. Mbattang has said, would 
Mr. Kouengoua even dare have the courage to say anything?  Why would one take over after a man has already defended her son between the woman who bears the child and the man who doesn't even know when this child would come to fruition?  

Madam President, I was assigned counsel -- I wouldn't say lead counsel.  I was asked to represent Mr. Gacumbitsi in the same capacity as Ms. Mbattang, and I will be failing in my duty if I didn't do so.  

Since the 28th of July, you've always pointed out to me, Madam President, that from time to time I go faster than the Court, and from time to time I create problems for the court reporters and the interpreters.  Everyone has criticised me.  With those criticisms, what else is left?  I believe you would be missing me, and when you feel you are going to be missing someone, then it is an opportunity to say au revoir.  I have taken the opportunity to meet my Defence team and I promised my team that I would speak as carefully, as slowly as Ms. Mbattang.  It's a challenge which I want to meet -- to take up.  

But when the Court will observe that in September 2003, I said that I would be finished by the 31st of October, and right from the very first days I did produce witnesses, the witnesses that were necessary.  I'm all the more at ease, Madam President, when I did so because I am representing a convinced Christian, a good man whom I heard from the father, from the mother, from witnesses.  Should such a Christian not make me proud?  And under your guidance I want to say, yes, and I'm going to prove this by telling you a short story.

When I got to Arusha in October 2001, Madam President, I had to have my ID prepared for me to have access to the Tribunal.  The officer in charge of preparing my ID refused to do so because I do not have a first name.  So someone intervened right from my own country and then finally I got an ID.  It was necessary for me to have a pin code in order to be able to make a call, and the person in charge of the communication services also said if I didn't have a first name there is no way I'm going to get a pin code.  And so I was lost, Madam President.  But in spite of all, I stayed.  I represent a man who has a name and a first name, but I think it is a source of joy.  

Beyond our profession, beyond our occupation, what is left?  It is the man, a man as a whole.  It is that man, the homo, that -- whose character they sought to taint, to damage, but not in an intelligent way, Madam President.  

I do remember that when I was very young in school we used to go to the movies, and we were -- I don't know what it was -- I don't remember the title of the film but it did talk about the fact that no crime is perfect.  Indeed, no crime is perfect.  In 1994 Mr. Gacumbitsi couldn't have imagined that he would be here.  In 1994 Gacumbitsi was convinced, if he had committed anything, would be among the conquerors if you were to go along with the Prosecutor's thesis.

In 1995, if it was true that it was the Hutus who wanted to eliminate the Tutsis, they couldn't imagine at some point in time they would be in prison.  So that is the story of history.  It's like the minaeval doctrine which takes on its flight when the evening is sounding or appearing.  

All those who are in prison, well, what did they do in 1994?  The Prosecutor tells you, and 
Ms. Mbattang says it with soft words; I will say it crudely, and allow me.  Well, I will bring all these facts to you and then we'll see, we'll see who participated and who was not involved.  But in our case, the Prosecutor did not exhibit that much bad faith.  Right from the very beginning the Prosecutor knew what he was doing.  

I am not under estimating him, I am merely drawing your kind attention to the fact that in this case, the Prosecutor prosecuted or brought Gacumbitsi to court for genocide.  All other counts are in the alternative.  Subsidiarily, even if you look at the first page or the second page, you are going to see the same thing.  Madam President, I'm looking at you while saying so.  

In some legal systems when they say in the main, and then we shift to the alternative, it's a way of saying, "Well, we are not too sure of the main charge.  Don't allow the criminal to go away, just look at it even if the main charge cannot stand, maybe in the alternative, maybe something should be done about it."  And in other systems, the one I know that you practised, that I also practice, they say, "If by some extraordinary happening," and that's the usual answer.  ^^On more than one occasion the Prosecution answered -- that was the answer that the Prosecutor gave to Judge Reddy this morning.  There might have been some minor defects but --  

Now, in business law, or in civil law or even in criminal law, and more specifically, when it comes to matters that come within the jurisdiction of this Court, it might be mistaken but it is a life sentence, and if one is lucky, there might be a time frame.  Now, the Accused person that we -- I represent and the Prosecution - well, each and every one of us has to act, and I said so on the 6th October before this Court.  I did say that each and every one had to make an effort to ensure that we did not violate the laws of the republic, we do not violate the laws of a monarchy.  And that in the event there was a violation, it was human rights that were violated.  And what -- who is the human?  It's yourself, myself and each and everyone.  And there is violation when there is death.  And before death, there is total equality.  There is no Prosecutor, no Defence counsel, there is no minister, there is no president of the court; there are only dead bodies.  No society in the world has the right to cause the death of anyone else of his neighbour.  

Madam President, I thought Ms. Anne Ngatio Mbattang, after having told you that the indictment was defective and there was nothing in it, she was going to ask you to acquit Gacumbitsi, but I do understand her.  Because if we stop at this level, a lot of people will think that we are afraid to address the issues or the facts or the events.  The Prosecutor didn't put anything into his indictment.  Unfortunately, he cannot do anything, but for us, we are trying to challenge what he had done.  And what did he do after that?  That is, he brought people who are likely to prove, correct, to fabricate a number of things that could not appear in the indictment.  

	And the first person to appear before you -- and this is what is worrying about this trial -- is Patrick Fergal Keane, a BBC journalist, BBC correspondent in 1994 who was based in South Africa.  That man, from the 28th to the 29th, came and engaged in advertising his footage, his film, but that advertisement was unwelcome, not only because he was the one involved, but just because that footage was strewn with lies, with fabrications.  Why, Madam President, Your Honours?  Because at no time in the course of his testimony -- and I challenge anyone -- at no time did Patrick Keane tell us that these were two films three years difference: 27th of June 1994 and 18th of June 1987 --  18th February 1997.  That journalist never told us.  On the contrary, we were shown footages that were silent and Patrick Fergal Keane then started explaining the contents of the footages.

Madam President, this is a critical issue because in 1994 -- and I had pointed it out earlier; I hope I had been followed -- Gacumbitsi had to be very powerful.  He was the bourgmestre, he was the administrator, but at no point in time was he thinking of being the object of prosecution.  And in 1994 Fergal Keane did say so here, and I made mention of that particular section in my briefs before you.  He said that he had been sent on assignment in Rwanda and he found himself at the Benaco camp in Tanzania because of the charges that were brought or that were weighing on Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.  

Your Honours, I had -- and I waited in vain to hear those charges being brought in 1994 and who were bringing any such charges, I didn't get anyone.  Madam President, when we watched those pictures, there were two soldiers, permanently there in uniform, carrying their weapons.  Patrick Fergal Keane, you followed him live, he was the first witness.  You all heard him.  I don't want to waste time, too much of time, but tomorrow before you hand down your decision, please re-examine those tapes.  You would notice that there was a translation of words the population were saying to Fergal Keane.  The translator was Frank Dore (phonetic) of the RPF.  At the time when I was saying in my introductory statement on the 6th of October 2003, that seemed to be pure literature, but when the forensic experts Le Conte and Deware (phonetic), who were in the forensic department or the coroner's department in Paris, when they made their testimony here, the Court noticed -- came to understand and then the Prosecutor said, "Well, let these same experts not come and explain all this here again."  That they merely be tendered as exhibits because contrary to the testimonies of Fergal Keane, the experts did prove from footage 11 to 17 that there were three types of bodies at the Nyarubuye parish.  It was the experts who detected the fact that the footage were taken at two different times.  It was the experts, using their skills, their techniques, their scientific knowledge, with supporting and corroborating evidence, and this can be reviewed.  These are matters that were brought before you here, that amongst the bodies that were photographed in 19 -- in May 1994 in Nyarubuye, there were skeletons which had gone as far back -- years back.  

Madam President, now that report is one of the materials produced by the Defence, does prove as appropriate that right from the very first Prosecution witness who appeared here, right from that first witness, we've never been told the reality as to occurrence of events.  

Madam President, I want -- I don't want to keep you here unduly.  You told us that we do everything to finish as speedily, as expeditiously as possible.  We shall and -- but we ask you respectfully, to note that what we are saying here today does not appear in our briefs.  If I didn't do so at the beginning, it's because my regret to leave you takes over from whatever thing I had to do.  After 25 years in this profession, I have had problems with my profession only in 2004, I mean, a counsel, even those who are my elders, how can we answer 134 closing brief from the Prosecutor in a couple of days?  Please bear with us.  I have all the respect required, but no one is bound to perform the impossible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I think you have had -- you had more than five days to write your brief.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I know that your Court did ensure that nothing is lacking.  But that's the practice.  It's very important, Madam President.  Between what you decide and what we do, there is a significant gap and that's why we are saying, that, "Prosecutor you should have put all those crimes in the indictment instead of calling TAO, TAX, etc. to come and replace -- do the job that you should have done in your indictment.  And these are things we cannot forget.  

Now, take TAO and TAX, those are the main witnesses, the star witnesses of the Prosecution in regard to events in Nyarubuye.  I'm not going to go back there.  Ms. Mbattang has said everything, the Prosecutor has said everything; I merely want to draw your attention.  Then TAX got to the parish on the 12th, TAO got there on the 14th, TAQ got to the same parish on the 14th, and now we are here 1st of March 2004, ten years later, and these people never saw each other at the parish.  I do accept, there were a lot of people on the 14th.  On the 15th, TAX, TAO, TAQ were at the parish; they never saw each other and there was a crowd.  Everyone does acknowledge that.  And then on the 16th the whole thing changed.  On the 16th there were just the survivors.  On the 17th, just the survivors.  And TAQ is among the survivors on the 30th; he doesn't see TAX or TAQ -- TA -- TAO.  TAX is among the survivors on the 15th; he doesn't see all the others.  Are we talking about the same parish, 
Madam President?  But they all organised themselves to say, "I saw the bourgmestre, Gacumbitsi, arrive." That was TAX, "But he didn't kill anyone." That is his testimony.  But how could it be otherwise?  

TAX says he gave a blow with a machete to the neck of Murefu. TAO says he took a machete and the others killed Orbegina, Murefu and Buhonogo.  

Madam President, I'm taking up this witness because that's -- it's on him that the Prosecutor stands, as it were, firmly.  And Ms. Anne Ngatio Mbattang talks about unimpeachable witnesses.  I don't know whether impeachable or not, I simply note that in law -- in the same place, on the same date they didn't see each other and didn't witness the same things or the same event.  

Madam President, I will not disclose the identity of anyone, but I will respectfully request you that in the secrecy, in the quiet of your Chambers and in the course of your deliberations -- I want to bring to an end this whole thing.  Maybe I will get back to it when I will be talking about some of these minor offences that are brought in the alternative, but do note that out of the 40 paragraphs in the indictment that is vague and inaccurate, all the victims mentioned by the Prosecutor, none is recognised by any of the witnesses that appeared here.  The witnesses came each with each or her own victims, and the Prosecutor says, "Well, the Defence did not deny, they even accepted."  Please, let's understand ourselves, I don't know what we accepted.  

Madam President, I prepared Gacumbitsi's Defence on the basis of the indictment that was given me, and I was convinced Under Rule 47 all these charges were listed before the confirming Judge signed the indictment.  That was not the case, and the consequences have to be drawn by the Court.  It need not be told that this was not said or this was said.  And, Ms. Mbattang did say, right from the 10th of November, we did ask the Court whether this indictment could not be modified so that it can be worth its source.  

Madam President, there were Prosecution witnesses whom the Prosecutor didn't want to talk about this morning.  Now, it's not only Fergal Keane, there was TAW and I want to talk about him, 
Madam President, because if there is any witness who might have had some credibility, if there was some witness who was believable, who might have experienced a particular event, our everyday life, you have your cook, you have your gardener --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please be carefully, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
	I fully understand you, Madam President, but I am still standing by my commitment.  I haven't got there yet.  I was saying that in our everyday life, Madam President, we who are bound to have aids, you have people like your cook, your gardener and your driver.  When one of those people comes and tells us that your shirt was not washed in the morning, it's because he knew that the last time it was washed and he saw you wear it and he could identify the places where -- the spots where there were stains, but then I understand you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I am even of the same view, but in your situation, you must leave no stone unturned so as not to disappoint people.  

Well, you dealt with what you had with you, but one of the things on which we wonder right up to this day, and I believe that we will still be unrequited right to the time when you make a decision, is in regard to paragraph 5.  You said, "On or about the 9th of April, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi convened a meeting."  That paragraph 5 is of such gravity.  Why? Because in our own understanding of an indictment, it is our opinion that -- our view that the Prosecutor, not having witnessed these events, referred to people who witnessed those events and who provided him with the required information.  But when you take the 9th of April with what is stated, you would notice that the only person who could have witnessed or participated in that meeting, that that person was only heard on the 20th of November 2002.  That person was only heard on the 20th November 2002, the 1st and the 13th of May 2003.  Now, how come somebody who was only heard in 2002, would then find his words mentioned or his statement mentioned on an indictment dated 20th of June 2001?  I'm merely quoting Judge Reddy during the session.  He asked the witness, "Why didn't you talk about this meeting in your statement?"  He said, "Well, I just occurred -- it just occurred to me.  And this is the first time it cropped up in my mind."  So the only person who could have attended that meeting, he spoke about it in this courtroom.  

The other fabricator, the man who is jealous, the fellow who did not succeed, who dared to tell you that he was a civil servant, he was this or that, what did he tell you?  He said he got it from the person who came and testified before you and who had never spoken about it previously.  It is the same witness who would tell you that on the 8th of April 1994, a meeting was organised at a businessman's house in Kibungo in order to plan the crimes and the massacres and all these things that can be imagined.  And, unfortunately, once more, he was rebutted by the Prosecutor through Exhibit D7.  
The Prosecutor produced the audio cassette, a cassette containing a programme of the Rwandan national radio, which talks about a meeting of the préfectural security committee.  That witness was rendered naked.  That is not all.  

That same witness came before you and said that if you talk about the carton of weapons it was because at the end of the meeting on the 9th, the only person who witnessed told him, allegedly so, that the issue was one of the distribution of weapons.  And that same person came and said, "I never spoke it, I had never heard any mention made of it."  That was not enough.  

That same witness told you that after the 12th of April the friend of the Accused never saw him again.  And as I said, Madam President, that friend, fortunately, was summoned by the Prosecutor and he came here and said that on the 13th the Accused told her -- or him that he had been the object of victim of threats.
	(Pages 34 to 45 by Gifty C. Harding)
























	1630H
MR. KOUENGOUA: (continuing)
	Now, when that witness was asked why he or she was scared on the 13th, he said he did so because the Accused wanted to kill him.  And in the course of the cross-examination, when we said, "Well, you have been for years -- 50 years as friends, how could he do that?"  He said, "Well, you know, the Accused didn't do anything for me.  I had asked him to take care of my properties and my family, and he did nothing about it."  "So are you sure that his children would take care of you?"  He said, "Yes."  He says, "Well, if he is convicted, his children will take care of me."  And that is not all.  He destroys himself.  What does he say?  He said, "On the 13th, my first night in Tanzania at the house of the sister of the Accused" -- and he said more than he saw.  He said, "On the 14th, in the morning, I saw the Accused at Gisenyi following me." 

And lastly, he said -- to conclude his statement with regard to the second day, Madam President, he said, "I am not going to lie.  Gacumbitsi did not know how to operate a firearm."  These are people who misled the Prosecution.  These are the slanderers who came before this Court, who came before this Court to do this man - unfortunately, for them it is not Gacumbitsi who was being prosecuted.  It is the bourgmestre of Rusumbizi -- Rusumo, because, in any case, what is highlighted is the position he occupied.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I heard before this very Court this person say that on the 10th April they went to Kibungo military camp in order to receive weapons.  On the whole they received 105 crates of weapons.  I do not want to bring you back to the preliminary investigation where reference was made to crates, but in the Court the crates became boxes.  And then we asked, "How did you know that they were weapons?"  And the witness said, "I imagine what the other said."  And the other said, "I never told him anything about that."  The witness is going to change his statement, and the Prosecutor did say this morning, it is no longer the person whose name I am not going to mention, but since the Prosecutor said it this morning, it is Gaconda, Leonidas.  But Gaconda, Leonidas, is not a conseiller de secteur, and, therefore, could not attend the said meeting.  He was nothing.  And being unable to attend the said meeting, he could not know what was said in that meeting.  This is how an attempt was made to make up charges to be brought against Silvestre Gacumbitsi, and all the witnesses named by this person said that they were not aware of the distribution of weapons in their area.  

Madam President, Your Honours, the other witness whom you all know and who, for reasons of safety, I do not intend to mention either his name or his pseudonym, but I would like the Trial Chamber to understand that during cross-examination that woman strongly testified before this Trial Court that she was disappointed.   She was disappointed to have been ... ... ... 
           ... ... ... .  She was disappointed -- 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Can that be expunged from the record?  Because Counsel earlier had made similar reference. 

Your Honours, may I also advise -- you see that we are in an open session and these proceedings are being telecast live.  And if we aren't careful in expunging it from the transcripts, it can be done internally, but the proceedings here are on the air waves, and it compromises the security of our protected witnesses. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Defence, I told you earlier on to be careful because I felt that you were divulging information that could lead to the identification of the protected witnesses.  So, of course, we are going to expunge what you said from the Court records, but since we are in open session, that raises a problem.  I could therefore recommend that you exercise more care.  Do not make any -- do not go to any specifics.  Talk about the facts.  You have given some information concerning the identity of the witness.  Please, all this should be expunged from the records.  

How much more time do you need, Counsel for the Defence? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I thank you.  Before answering to the second part of your question, I would respectfully like to state that the persons whose names I did not mention and regarding whom I gave references were heard in closed session by this Court.  The public has no basis on which to make a comparison.  The public has no basis for a comparison.  

If a closed session has the meaning that we think it has, therefore, I thought that for the first time, I could raise certain issues without referring to the person concerned.  The witness was -- let us look at the two cases, we can verify that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, but at present you have given information concerning those persons because you have given the relationship relating to the Accused, and I believe that can help or lead to the identification of that person. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I apologise sincerely for that.  

Madam President, the second part of your question is related to how much more time I need.  Well, I will try to limit myself to two and a half hours, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time do you need?   
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Two and a half hours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Two and a half hours.  Do you mean to say that at five o'clock you would have finished?  What do you mean to say?  Do you mean to say that at five o'clock you would have finished?  What do you mean to say?  Do you mean to say you still need two and a half hours?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I am saying that I will see what I can do in order to finish in two and half hours from now.  I do not know what time it is now.  From where I am, I cannot see the time on the clock.  The Trial Chamber would like to know how much more time I need to finish; and I am saying that I need two and a half hours more in order to finish.  I do not know whether I am clearer now. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Mr. Kouengoua, much of what you are saying is already in your written brief.  Am I right or am I wrong?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Your Honour, at the time I am making my oral submissions, I do not have the written brief with me.  Therefore, I cannot reasonably challenge what you are saying.  If you say so, then it must be true, and on that premise, I will try to go a little bit faster.  It is also because I have made a commitment to be slow, and that is why I am making confusion between slowness and being sleepy.  I do not know what I have to do in order to make up for the time lost. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We nevertheless remind you that we told you that the Defence was allowed two hours to make its oral submissions.  

Furthermore, we confirm that what you are doing is already contained in your brief -- in your written brief.  We therefore also told you that it was necessary to avoid repeating what has already been mentioned in the written brief, rather than -- but rather, that you should address the submissions of the Prosecution.  So if you would try to focus on that, I believe that you would be able to finish earlier.  But in any case, don't worry.  We have your written brief.  We have read it.  We will read it again before making any determination. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I thought what I was saying was slightly different from what is contained in my written brief. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. KAREGYESA:
I am asking for your indulgence, if I could excuse myself from the Chamber for about five minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to take a ten-minute break.  

And Counsel for the Defence, we would request that you should endeavour to conclude by 5:30 p.m., please.  Please try to organise yourself during the next ten minutes.  The time now is 20 to 5 p.m.; kindly endeavour to finish by 5:30 p.m.  You have a few minutes to reorganise your work. 

The proceedings are adjourned for ten minutes. 
	(Court recessed at 1644H)
(Pages 46 to 49 by Sithembiso Moyo)


























(Court resumed at 1700H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  

Mr. Kouengoua, you have the floor. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Madam President.  This summary that I'm going to make, Madam President, is going to deal with the criminal responsibility of the Accused.  Certainly it's also going to address sentencing as well as the penalty.  

Regarding the responsibility of the Accused, Madam President, we also elaborated on this in our written brief.  We have submitted for your consideration that Gacumbitsi was not able, and could not be able to be at Nyarutunga market on the 14th, at the parish, the parish of Nyarubuye, on the 15th, at the parish on the 16th, at Kankobwa in Rubare cellule on the 17th.  The reason why he was absent in those places is that, Gacumbitsi, as from the 13th in the evening, was threatened with death.  The threats started with the release of the people he had arrested on the 11th and 12th, which people he locked up in the communal jail house.  Faced with the threat of death, Madam President, my client, the Accused, said at the hearing of 21 November, before your Trial Chamber, I quote -- this was in answer to a question asked in the examination-in-chief, I quote:  "I was hiding in my house.  I was not able to run away from my country.  I only asked the members of my family not to tell anyone that I was in the house.  I would have given them instructions to the effect that anyone looking for me should be told that I was not there, and I did not leave my house." 

Madam President, during the questioning of the Accused, which questioning lasted two days, the Prosecution did not challenge the fact that the Accused was threatened with death.  On the contrary, what Prosecution pointed out and interpreted it in their own manner was the answer given to Prosecution's question at the hearing of 25 November, paragraph 35, transcript page 23:  "And you would like to make this Court believe that you were hiding in your house and that would have made you more vulnerable to any attack, isn't it?"  Answer by the Accused:  "Listen, to say that I was hiding in my house does not mean that I was indeed in my house, but I had asked the members of my family not to tell anyone where I was.  This is what I said.  This is what I asked the members of my family to say."  The Accused said this for the first time on the 21st.  "I gave them directives to the effect that anyone looking for me should be told that I was not there and I did not leave my house."

Madam President, I think that this testimony by the Accused, or the Accused-cum-witness, does not call for any special comments because the testimony is clear.  It speaks for itself.  

The Accused-cum-witness added something else, quote -- or, rather, when I asked him why he did not run away with his family, the Accused answered as follows:  "I could not take refuge in that manner.  I was waiting for the sous-préfet, the préfet, to do something, in order to ensure the safety or security of persons.  If I had taken flight with my family, that would have been serious.  I would have confirmed what people thought.  People said, 'Well this is what we said.  It is true.  He has taken his family and has run away.'  As a leader, I had some responsibilities; therefore, I could not have taken such a move."  Page 46, paragraph 11 to 23, of the transcript of 21 November 2003.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I do not know whether Gacumbitsi was mistaken, but we heard that the last person to leave the boat when it is sinking is the captain, and I believe this is what Gacumbitsi sought to do, and he cannot be blamed for that.  On the contrary, on the contrary, Madam President, and furthermore, the fact that he was threatened with death was not challenged, was not denied.  Those who saw him -- and I'm compelled to come back to this -- the four ex-convicts who saw him saw him only on one date.  All the prisoners saw him only on the 14th.  Not any difference.  And all of them saw him at 4 -- between 3 and 4 p.m., all of them.  So, Gacumbitsi was not ubiquitous.  He was a human being like anyone else.  And I think the greatest regret on the part of the Accused, as he stated before your Court, is that -- well, and he said it, you will find it in his statements, the witness/Accused said that he is saddened; he's saddened because the people in Nyarubuye came to find refuge at a place they thought they would find peace.  "They wanted protection.  Yet they came to kill them in my commune without me being able to protect them."  Gendarmes who came from Mulindi, assailants from Rukira; in other words, those who were pursuing the refugees came to kill them in his commune.  

That is the reality, and, Madam President, I thought that at the end of the Prosecution's closing arguments, or following the indictment, you would be told the following, that of the 10,000 Tutsis who were in Rusumo after the events of Nyarubuye, only 2,000 or 3,000 survived, but the Prosecution did not do that.  In fact, those who took refuge at the church did not come from Rusumo.  Witness TAO testified to that.  Witness TAQ testified to that.  They came from Rukira, Birenga and other places, and they were looking for a place where there was peace. 

Madam President, I even heard that two priests, Gisagara and Charles, came from Nyarubuye.  No, these are priests that came from Rukira.  But since Gacumbitsi had to be tarnished at all costs, they placed them, situated them in his commune.  This is what I would say with respect to the indictment.  

Madam President, we know in law that there must be a reason, a motive, for any crime, to know who benefits from the crime.  And we take -- we quote Alison Des Forges:  "Rusumo looked like an abandoned plantation.  What did the government do, the government of Habyarimana, Juvénal, for Rusumo, for Gacumbitsi?  Gacumbitsi was not a member of the Akazu.  Was it in his interest to kill the inhabitants of his commune or to kill those who had taken refuge there?  Gacumbitsi was a weakened man.  The most serious act, the act of the humiliation of a bourgmestre, was to see that those he had locked up were released, even though he was still bourgmestre." 

Madam President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi, from the 10th, the 11th, the 12th, arrested the criminals who dared to operate in Nyamugali, Gatore; everyone agrees on that; everyone knows that.  Before him, Madam President, the other bourgmestre of Rwanda, says the Defence counsel, who dared -- I think the bourgmestre of Kigina, in the north or perhaps in the centre of Rwanda, this is what that bourgmestre did.  And the Prosecutor said that since the Defence has succeeded to prove that personally Gacumbitsi did nothing, the Trial Chamber should convict him for the acts of his subordinates. 

Madam -- Madam President, we waited in vain for the Prosecution to tell us who the subordinates of Gacumbitsi were, which subordinates did whatever he alleges, but we didn't hear that.  And he quoted Article 6(3) time and again.  Madam President, Article 6(3) cannot apply as the Prosecutor believes.  It is not a blanket article in which you can put everything.  I'm not the first to say so.  Your Trial Chamber has already said so.  The bourgmestre is not the hierarchical superior of the secteur conseiller.  When we talk about hierarchical superior, Madam President, you would be talking about somebody who effectively has the power to control and to direct and in particular, somebody who can impose disciplinary sanction on the subordinate.  And even in that case, he should be aware of what his subordinate is doing.  But you were told about secteur conseillers, the heads of cellules.  The Prosecution even went to the extent of saying that Gacumbitsi supervised all the administrators of the local government in Kibungo; in other words, he was even above the préfet.  We are still waiting.  Perhaps during your deliberations you will be given the instruments appointing him to that position, but at our level that has not been disclosed to us.

Madam President, as I told you -- perhaps I may have to revisit this in order to conclude -- murder.  Murder here is another secondary crime, yet the Prosecution wants to prove murder through genocide.  This is unthinkable.  It isn't thinkable for murder to become an element of genocide.  One could accept that, but to start from genocide in order to justify murder and extermination, I would say that this is gymnastics for which you need long-term training, and that we did not quite understand. 

But to be brief on this issue of assassination or murder, we are saying that what was said before you does not feature in the indictment, and this is not by chance.  It is glaring. 

Now, on rape.  We know and would assert the Tutsi problem in 1994 in Rwanda became a routine theme, a commonplace argument.  The Defence called before you young girls, Tutsi mothers, Tutsi women, who have never been raped.  Madam President, how come it is that the Prosecutor up to this time did not think that Gacumbitsi housed a young girl whom he saved, and that young girl came here to testify before you?  Why did he omit that?  That is the truth.  It doesn't disturb anyone.  TAS claims that she was raped, and she testified before your Court that she never heard from Gacumbitsi giving orders to rape women.  Who better than that witness can say what Gacumbitsi did not do?  

As an anecdote -- I thought this chapter was closed but the Prosecutor brings me back to it -- I'm referring to TAP.  I would not come back to what has already been submitted; however, this person said during her -- during the preliminary investigations that she was assaulted by the former employees of his father, Athanase, Calixte, and others, and this was said -- or, rather, she was assaulted on the 9th of April, but the Trial Chamber said that -- when it was said that it was after the events of Nyarubuye that she was assaulted.  That appears to me extraordinary. 

Madam President, one of my colleagues talks about traversing the desert.  Now, I don't want to dwell unduly, but let me say the Prosecutor made a lot of effort in order to comply with the legal requirements.  He failed to prove genocide; he fell back on complicity.  He failed to prove complicity; he then relied on rape, murder, et cetera.  But still he did not stand.  At the last minute, in his closing arguments, he pulled out something that is extremely dangerous, and for the first time in writing he talked about judicial notice and he made reference to the Semanza case.  We believe for our part that that should not be held by you -- should not attract your attention.  The Chamber has had occasion to rule that judicial notice would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis.  It cannot apply -- it cannot be applied in a blanket manner.  It cannot be generalised.  Alison Des Forges came here with no specific report.  She said that she did not even know that there was a sous-préfecture in Rusumo.  So what did she come to do here?  

Madam President, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi thinks and believes that this Court has circumscribed, understood, his personality, but the charges with which he is charged, those five counts fabricated over TV, over the radio, on Internet, and then gives birth, I wouldn't say, to a mouse.  Such charges of such seriousness are withering, fading away, and I understand the Prosecutor took hours on end to submit these charges, and then at the end say, one hour would be too much.  I can understand, because not only hearing both parties, one really wondered what was left of this case.  But we are the ones -- we are not the ones who pass judgement.  We don't know the law.  The only people who know the law is the Bench, yourselves.  And the only request we make of you is to acquit Gacumbitsi, acquit him of those five counts that have been wrongly brought or laid against him.  But since we are not parties to your deliberations, and all we are doing is submitting our respective positions, which are not less legal, we are saying to you, if by some extraordinary happening, you hold the opinion that beyond what has been said by either party, that beyond the defects, there was the least doubt in regard to the conduct of the Accused, Madam President, Your Honours, please act in such a manner that this man, among all the others that you will be trying, appearing before you -- maybe the Chamber is not aware of this -- I think and I believe if Gacumbitsi is not the only one, if he is the only person whose family remained in the same house in Rusumo, in Rwanda, and this man wants to go back to his family.  Madam President, I don't know how criminals behave.  I just wish to suggest to your Trial Chamber anybody who blames himself and who wants to protect himself, the very last thing the person has is his children.  The children of Gacumbitsi are in Rusumo.  Some have gone to university.  Others are there.  No member of the Gacumbitsi family is hiding in any other country.  They are there.  And I will say -- I was saying that if ever the Chamber considers that there might be some blame to be laid at Gacumbitsi's door, it should be light. 

Madam President, what can I do?  The law requires that I represent Gacumbitsi right up to the sentencing phase.  Please act so that if there are two or three penalties, that he be able to serve just one.  Maybe I'm betraying myself but that's what I seek of you, Madam President.  I've had so much fear in pronouncing this word, because my grandmother always told me, she said, "Never draw the devil on the wall at night because if you do so, the devil might come into your home."  I trust the justice that you will be delivering.  I know you've understood me.  And that's why I say, after eight months of debate, eight months of lacking respect, and after that, I'm asking you, I'm requesting you, no one else, to acquit Gacumbitsi. 

I am not disposing of anything.  If it were ever to be the case, please act in such a manner that Ms. Mbattang is not disappointed.  She stands for the reconciliation of the people in Rwanda, the reconciliation of people that will come about through you, through your judgement, we do believe, and that is why we say -- and that's why you say all the time, "Introduce yourselves, parties.  Make your appearances."  The acquittal lies with you.  Contrary to the Prosecutor, I have produced objective grounds, and I'm requesting you to acquit.  If conviction has to occur, well, convict.  The Prosecutor just says, "Convict," but he doesn't produce any limit to warrant conviction.  That's the difference between us.  

Now, you have that hammer that stands there -- that gavel, sorry, that stands there.  Gacumbitsi's Defence team is convinced that that scale will weigh necessarily on the side of the truth, where reality lies, where there hasn't been any twists and turns, where no witness spent more than three days in Arusha, where witnesses were not met in May or June to be heard later on in October.  

Madam President, we are even told that we did not summon someone who had to come here and say what the Accused might have done.  We have brought witnesses here who told us that they really experienced these events.  They didn't try to fabricate or to build anything around this.  We know nothing further than that.  When I shall have finished, I must confess that in light of what happened in Rwanda, I was still a novice, but what I obtained I brought before this Chamber with all humility. 

Madam, Your Honours, we would be grateful to you.  We need to conclude now.  The greatest pleasure for a counsel is not to talk at length but to see his client acquitted, but since you won't order such an acquittal from the Court, our hope is that he will be acquitted, and we will know which date, the date on when we will come and look for Gacumbitsi.  It will apply to everyone.  We will be ready to comply with your ruling because it will be the ruling of wisdom.  We respect you, Madam President, and that is the wish of the entire team, and I would have come to an end. 

Thank you for your understanding.  Thank you for your indulgence.  I know it has not been easy, but with Mr. Kouengoua, I haven't done anything wilfully.  I only sought to represent my client, and that's all I did. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kouengoua. 

Prosecutor, you intend to give a rejoinder? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
With your leave, Your Honours, I just have five -- four points that I can dispose of in the next five minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel for the Prosecution.  You have five minutes. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
The first, Your Honours, concerns the form of the indictment which learned counsel spent about an hour submitting on, and all I wish to clarify is that the Defence filed a Rule 72 motion challenging defects in the form of the indictment, which motion was denied by Trial Chamber III on 25th July 2002.  And the operative paragraph is paragraph 22 of this decision, and I'll just read one sentence, and I quote:  "In the opinion of the Chamber, the indictment sets out the material facts of the Prosecution case with enough detail to inform the Accused of the charges against him so that he may prepare his Defence."  

This therefore is not the appropriate forum to relitigate an issue that has been disposed of.  To do so, the Chamber would be sitting in appellate judgement over its own decision. 

I'll move to the second bullet point, a clarification arising from Counsel Kouengoua's submission with regard to Witnesses TAQ, TAO and TAX.  And what I seek to clarify, and which Your Lordships will find on the record, is that these three witnesses were at different places at Nyarubuye parish on the 15th of April 1994 when Gacumbitsi arrived.  TAQ and TAO were on either side of the church in the compound when Gacumbitsi arrived.  On the other hand, TAX was in the convent or nun's compound behind the church, and she only saw Gacumbitsi after the initial gunshots, when Gacumbitsi entered the nun's compound. 
Three:  Counsel said that the Prosecutor hadn't shown motive.  We submit, Your Honours, that motive in criminal law is irrelevant.  It's not an element of any of the crimes with which the Accused is charged.  And it's distinct from the criminal intent or the mens rea, as we know it. 

Finally, Your Honours, counsel touched on the criminal responsibility of the Accused.  It's sufficiently discussed in the closing brief, and all I need to add is that the Prosecutor submits that Gacumbitsi is individually criminally responsible under Article 6(1).  I'm now addressing the counts of murder and rape as crimes against humanity.  We submit that his responsibility is as a co-perpetrator, for committing these crimes in execution of a common purpose, particularly if the murders and rapes were a foreseeable consequence of this common criminal plan. 

Now, I'll refer you to paragraph 25 of our indictment.  It sufficiently pleads that the Accused acted in concert with others in execution of a common scheme to exterminate the Tutsi -- I paraphrased the paragraph but you have the indictment; it's attached to our closing brief.  Now, in that regard, we would submit, Your Honours, that the murders and rapes with which he's charged were not only the foreseeable, but were actually the intended, result of this common purpose for which we now hold him liable. 

Finally, Your Honours, the wording of that paragraph is in conformity with the ICTY Appeals Chamber decision in the Simic case.  Unfortunately, I do not have the appropriate citation with me but will avail it to the registry. 

And with that, Your Honours, we maintain our earlier submission that the Accused be found guilty and convicted as charged.  Most obliged. 
JUDGE REDDY:
If you could just clarify one point for me, dealing with the three witnesses at the parish, the point being made was that they had not seen each other; therefore, the inference is that they were not there.  Is that -- have I understood the argument correctly, the Defence argument? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Well, you see, Your Honours, that -- Your Honours, that submission is gratuitous.  It's unsupported by evidence on the record.  First of all, we don't know whether they knew each other in the first place.  Counsel did not cross-examine them on this theory he's now advancing.  So he cannot raise it ex post facto in his submissions because these submissions we are making arise from what is on the record and how the law applies to that evidence.
(Pages 50 to 57 by Mark Porter)



































	1730H
JUDGE REDDY:
But that's really the only point that he was making, wasn't it?  It's strange that they didn't see each other, for whatever it's worth, and therefore the inference is that they were not there.  Have I understood him correctly?
MR. KAREGYESA:
What I was responding to is he tried to lump them all in the same place, but our submission is the record indicates that they were in different places at the time that Gacumbitsi arrived.
JUDGE REDDY:
Besides, there were tens of thousands of people there, and it would not be a surprise if some didn't see the others.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Well, it's neither here nor there, Your Honours.  The point is he never put these propositions to these witnesses in cross-examination, and can therefore not just assume out of the blue that they didn't see each other.  They very well could have seen each other, but the propositions weren't put to them. 
JUDGE REDDY:
The opportunity to refute that wasn't there.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, I understand you.  Thank you. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I'm happy to respond to any other questions which you have. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you want to add something, Mr. Kouengoua? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes.  I am being compelled to stand.  Madam President, I didn't ask the Court to reconsider under 62, 6 -- sorry, 72, sorry.  I said right from November 2001, we drew the attention of the Prosecutor and the Court to the indictment.  Well, we were not followed.  Maybe what the Prosecutor is not saying, there's a version in English -- I don't have it in French.  The rebuttal was that Rule 50 allows only the Prosecutor and that I didn't have any right as Defence counsel to raise it.  Sorry, Rule 50.  That was Rule 50.  And I remember Judge Ostrovsky saying this in the course of the hearing.  That's the first one. 

The second, on the 6th of June, the Prosecutor said that my motion was belated, I did not comply with Rule 72.  And, Prosecutor, you do agree with me that I was -- it was because of my case that in 2003, 72 was harmonised; I mean the English and the French versions of that Rule.  Because previously the French version said, "Until the trial on merits."  Whereas the English version stated "30 days".  
	Judge Williams' attention was drawn to this matter in our Court.  So, Madam President, to say that this indictment sets out those facts, I don't know where the Prosecutor picks that one from.  I have case law here which says that even facts that have been set out in an indictment, in a manner that is inaccurate, would vitiate the said indictment.  In fact, Ms. Mbattang cited the judgement of 23 October 2001.  

Now there's reference made to TAX, TAO and TAQ were in different locations.  I'm hearing this for the first time, Madam President.  Why?  Well, because on the 14th, there was a crowd.  I said so.  On the 15th, there was a crowd.  Sixteenth and 17th, TAO says there were 30 survivors and someone else said 18 survivors, and all of them talk about the classrooms. 

Another matter, Mr. Prosecutor, another reason why we cannot ask for the conviction of Gacumbitsi is, well, the refugees who came from Rukira and Birenga all went to the parish in order to ensure that their physical integrity were protected.  They were hiding themselves.  So, Mr. Prosecutor, how do you explain the fact that people who wanted to go into hiding see the killers arrive, then they find them in front of the classrooms?  I mean, even in human terms, how can that be envisaged?  How can that be considered?  And they alleged that when Gacumbitsi came, they started shooting.  So they might have shot Gacumbitsi after killing those thousands, as you say, and they have only 15 people.  But, at any rate, they could have seen each other.  They did not see each other. 

I don't want to waste the time of the Court.  Madam Prosecutor (sic), there is a witness who didn't testify, whom you summoned here, CGB, and a convict.  It is serious enough, Madam President, this man was introduced as a bodyguard, and on the 16th he said that he was in the Musaza secteur.  He also spent a month here, Mr. Prosecutor, and you didn't think he needed to appear here, because he was contradicting all four other ex-convicts, because there were five of them in number.  So please provide some other evidence to allow for the conviction of Gacumbitsi.  It is becoming now a redundant matter. 

Now, as for criminal responsibility, individual criminal responsibility, I believe the Rules of Procedure and Evidence which governs your proceedings -- well, when you want to talk about co-perpetrators, they would really talk about conspiracy with a view to committing, et cetera.  They usually refer to conspiracy.  And it is quite clear, it is specific.  It doesn't go through complicity, does it?  The paragraph referred to by the Prosecutor in order to justify the stand he has taken, Madam President, I thought we weren't supposed to revisit this.  It was supposed to be paragraph 25.  It says, "As an authority, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, acting in authority with others, Bagilishema et al, and others," when nothing -- even the subordinates, even the communal policemen would need to be individually identified and be seen as co-perpetrators.  The Prosecutor just said, "and others."  It could be me, it could be Unobyono (phonetic), it could be anyone else.  It's not clear at all, as required under Rule 47. 

Madam President, Prosecutor does not want this trial to come to an end, and he is saying he doesn't have time.  The fact is, in your indictment you said that Gacumbitsi conspired with the interim government, and even the Cyangugu trial, you even said that the interim government was set up on the 8th of April,  whereas on the 8th of April -- and I asked you on several occasions who of the interim government came to Rusumo before or after April.  The conspiracy you are citing, it was with whom?  It stands where?  And you fail to explain that conspiracy.  

Your desire to have Gacumbitsi convicted is not enough.  This Chamber needs evidence beyond any reasonable doubt, Mr. Prosecutor.  This is what we await.  You may even speak over and over and over again.  As long as that evidence is not adduced, nothing will happen.  I am paying attention, but that's not the point.  

Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, I think we can now come to the end of this session.  

Does the Accused wish to address the Court for a few minutes? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Oui. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then you have five minutes.  You may wish to move and come in front here, of the Court.  You have the floor. 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
As I did in the course of my testimony, I would like to address the Court in Kinyarwanda. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 (No interpretation) 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
No problem. 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, well, the microphone is on.  Maybe there's a technical problem. 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Thank you for this opportunity you are providing me to enable me to say a word in regard to my trial.  I don't have much to say here.  A lot of things have already been said and repeated in the course of the closing arguments.  

Before becoming a bourgmestre, Mr. Gacumbitsi was a teacher.  I told you that when I was a teacher, I had not wanted to be a politician.  But when the president of the republic says to you, "I want you to make yourself available to the government," you cannot do otherwise.  So immediately after my appointment as bourgmestre, I did not fold my arms.  I did all within my power to develop the commune in continuation like development projects, associations, cooperative societies.  I was involved in all those activities and often I used this period -- I took advantage of this period of solidarity and the peace that reigned to promote the development of the people, and I was commended for that.  And this could be seen in my CV.  

What I did within my commune was to bring all the people in the commune, the Rusumo commune, together, as well as those from the other communes in the various préfectures of the country, those who came to look for land on which they could set up their farms in our commune.  And I transformed them into one population.  They were like brothers and sisters.  I never engaged or pursued a policy of ethnic discrimination or regional discrimination.  This was well known.  And that is the reason why I stayed in office for all the years which are known to you.  However, the war which occurred was a problem.  

Another problem that occurred was that of the political parties that were set up in 1991.  With the advent of multiparty politics, the powers of the bourgmestre declined significantly in view of the fact that there were opposition parties, and you know at the time the bourgmestre could not be chairman of any party whatsoever.  He had no duties to perform in a political party.  He was the bourgmestre of the commune and he was responsible for matters of security.  And so in 1994 there was security, there was peace, but then the situation changed sometime later on.  

Right from the beginning of the war, there was security within the Rusumo commune.  But then, subsequently, the members of the population of other communes who were being persecuted came and sought refuge at Nyabitare parish, and they included Hutus and Tutsis, and this is known.  They came from various communes of the Kibungo préfecture, and that's the reason why the refugees who came from the Byumba prefecture -- that's where the war had been raging right from 1990.  They came because they were running away from the fighting.  They sought refuge in Rusumo commune in April 1994, mainly because there was security there.  And that's why, when RPF got to Kibungo and after the massacres that were perpetrated by RPF in that préfecture, those who came from the east sought refuge in Rusumo.  And by the way, the préfet of the Rusumo préfecture, who was new, was called Kabanda.  And the parliamentarians from Byumba got to Rusumo in April 1994 because that was the only place where security was guaranteed in the Kibungo préfecture, an area that shared the same borders with Tanzania.  

So where did the problem come from?  Among the members of the population who sought refuge in the Rusumo commune, they started burning houses at about the 10th, 11th and 12th of April.  I arrested those individuals.  Madam President, Your Honours, I arrested those individuals.  And my sole concern was to restore security.  I kept them in custody, in detention.  They were not happy, and so their accomplices set up a group in order to fight the communal administration and the administration of the sub-préfecture.  That group even wanted to kill the bourgmestre.  And by the way, the préfet was the target of that group because the group did not trust the préfet.  

So why was I persecuted?  I was badly treated and I was in a bad situation because I had thought -- because I was perceived as someone assisting the Tutsis and locking up the criminals.  And among those persons, there were Hutus and Tutsis.  So I was treated as an accomplice of the RPF.  Moreover, it was said that I was a Tutsi, that I had hidden my identity.  Their goal was my physical elimination.  

Following that demonstration, the sous-préfet and the assistant bourgmestre of the commune, having seen that the commune was overwhelmed because of that situation, the prisoners were released but with the intention of bringing back -- bringing them back to prison after security must have been restored.  That was on the 13th of April.  

Since I was the target, I went to see those who had found refuge in my house at Nyakarambi.  I told them, "Listen, look for other ways of saving your lives because I've been threatened by an extremist group here in Rusumo."  I added that in the group there were people who had come from Kibungo, people sent by a certain Cyasa.  That -- well, rather, those people followed my advice and they found refuge in Tanzania.  Moreover, they are alive, except the woman called Regine, who was killed by the group of bandits in Nyakarambi.  

So, Madam President, what didn't I do in the meantime? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I do not think it's necessary to repeat all that you have said. 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Madam President, I'm saying all of this because I was persecuted.  I am indeed saddened.  In Nyarubuye, people had found refuge there.  I told them there was a group of bandits, criminals, who had come from various communes and who had come to Nyarubuye to cause killings.  It was not the people of Rusumo who carried out the killings.  You can even investigate that, and you would realise that what I'm saying is the truth.  

Gacumbitsi was not there.  I feared to be eliminated at any time.  I therefore went into hiding.  I became aware of the massacres in Nyarubuye a day after they occurred because there is some distance between Nyarubuye and the place where I was hiding.  

Madam President, Your Honours, what is being said in my case makes me lose my mind.  I know that only God knows what I did.  And what I did is known by everyone. 

Madam President, being tried before your Chamber, I think, I hope, I believe, that justice will take its course, justice that is fair.  I, Gacumbitsi, even in my commune -- even in my commune -- I have never hurt anyone.  When I punish someone, it was for the purpose of making that person amend his ways.  I used or applied punishment that was in continence with security and peace.  Everyone who knows me in Rwanda can attest to that.  My wife and children knows that I am even incapable of killing a chicken.  So when I am described as a criminal, indeed, that saddens me.  

I do not want to say much because if I have to say all that I know, I will take a lot of your time.  I request you, Madam, that in your capacity as President, you should see what you can do to see to it that national reconciliation takes place.  Also, do what you can to ensure that the people of Rwanda know what I did.  I love Rwanda.  I love my country.  

I thank you, Madam President.  I thank you, Your Honours, for your patience.  I thank you for having given me the opportunity to address the Court for these few minutes.  I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Now, the proceedings in the matter of Prosecutor versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi stand adjourned.  The Trial Chamber will withdraw for deliberations in Chambers, and a date for the delivery of the judgement will be set subsequently.  We take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the parties for their contributions.  We also thank all those who contributed or assisted in these proceedings, in particular, the legal assistants, the interpreters, the courtroom reporters, the registry staff, the staff of the lawyers' unit, the Witnesses and Victims Protection Unit, who perhaps are not here.  And, of course, our thanks also go to all the technicians who helped us during these proceedings.  

The proceedings stand adjourned sine die.  The date of the delivery of the judgement will be disclosed to you subsequently.
