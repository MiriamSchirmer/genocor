P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Court is in session.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Good morning, Ms. Des Forges.

Counsel Kouengoua will continue with his cross-examination.

Counsel Kouengoua, we would be most obliged to you if you could respect -- if you could abide by the promise you made yesterday, which was to complete your cross-examination around 10:00, and these are your words.  Counsel Kouengoua, you may proceed.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good morning, Madam President; Your Honours; good morning, counsel for the Prosecution; good morning to the registry; good morning, Expert Witness.  All the persons here today -- the Defence team wishes to greet all of the members of the Tribunal this morning.  The Defence team this morning is composed this morning by Ms. Mbattang; by myself, Counsel Kouengoua; and our assistant's name is Tharcisse Gatarama.

If we are not able to complete our testimony in time, it will really be due to conditions beyond our control.  We really intend to complete by 10:00.  There is something that has not been answered.  The Prosecutor said, this morning that he does not intend to speak after me, and I have insisted on this yesterday.  I think if there is a problem with that or this matter is in question, then we can look at -- read the draft transcripts.  The Court told me, "Don't make us stay here for a long time", and I said, Madam President, I will do my utmost.  But if I have to stop just to allow the Prosecutor to do a re-examination of 15 or 30 minutes, quite frankly, that would not be fair, and I have insisted on this point since yesterday.  I would like this point to be clarified before I begin.  Please, Madam President, I request that you clarify this matter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you wish to make any comments with respect to what Counsel Kouengoua has just said?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, his comments merit no comment because the Rules are clear: examination-in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination shall be allowed in each case.  So in adversarial litigation, Your Honours, re-examination follows cross-examination.  In the event that counsel asked to be able to cross-examine this witness, of course, the Prosecutor is entitled to re-examine, and it would have been the other way around if it was counsel's witness and I cross-examined.  I mean, it's beyond debate.  The Rules are very clear; Rule 85(B), Your Honours.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, what did you want to say?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I just said that nobody was questioning the Rules.  This was a promise made publicly that was -- and I did not ask him to make that promise.  I was not the one who said that.  And, Madam President, we are going to verify this in the transcript.  The Trial Chamber said that the Defence would speak mainly with respect to the cross-examination and this is what was said.  I'm not saying that we should change the Rules.  I just think that each person should respect -- abide by the promise they made to this Trial Chamber.  If people go back on their word, then the Trial Chamber will have to determine what is appropriate.  That is all that I wanted to say.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we did not hear of any promise that was allegedly made by the Office of the Prosecutor.  In any case, after cross-examination, the Prosecutor or Defence, depending on who is cross-examining, has the right to proceed with the re-examination of the witness on the matters -- on the points that were raised in cross-examination, and we must abide by the Rules.

Now, you must proceed with your cross-examination, and we have to ask the Prosecutor if she wishes to proceed with the re-examination of the witness; therefore, we cannot give you any guarantee of that type.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Your Honours, you will note -- and I will continue with my cross-examination after that -- that if I promised that I would finish by a certain time, it is because I was told I was the only person who would speak to the expert witness.  Of course, I could not accept to spend four hours on 3,000 pages.  That is all I wanted to say.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber never told you that you would be the only person to speak before this Court.  We said that the Prosecutor had chosen not to lead the witness in examination-in-chief.  This is all we said, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
ALISON DES FORGES
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Once again, Dr. Alison, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	I am sorry, Dr. Des Forges; I am in a very unfortunate position.  I hope that you did not think for a moment yesterday that I was impolite.  I forgot to ask you how your trip went.  Was your trip well?
A.	Thank you for asking me about my trip.  My trip went well.
Q.	And I wish to recognise that, since yesterday you have been most kind in answering my questions, would you be so kind as to tell me when you arrived in Arusha because at one point the weather was quite cold?
A.	I arrived in Arusha on August 22nd, Friday.
Q.	Thank you, Doctor.  We thought you were only arriving on Monday because we had been told that you were to arrive on the 25th, and they led us to believe that you were not yet in Arusha.  Thank you, Doctor.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Madam President, I object to these utterances by counsel.  It is unbecoming conduct at the Bar.  Nowhere on the record did we give the witness's arrival date as the 25th.  We said she would be in court on the 25th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please refrain from making such comments which really make us very uncomfortable.  Please go to the essential points.  I have already given you these instructions.  You have promised that you would end your cross-examination at 10:00, and I think that you need to make sure that no time is a wasted needlessly.  Please put essential questions.  What is the relevance of the witness arriving Friday or Monday?  In our view, this is not relevant.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to ask you to put questions to the witness that can be useful for your client's cause.  Thank you. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Dr. Alison, yesterday you told me that you went to Rusumo; is that correct?
A.	I have been at Rusumo, but I do not recall saying yesterday that I had been at Rusumo.
Q.	Maybe I misunderstood, Ms. Des Forges -- but I misunderstood.  The impression was that not only did you go there, but you took photographs of bodies of that were still covered in flesh.
A.	At that moment I was not speaking of Rusumo.
Q.	What region from you speaking of, Doctor?
A.	The place where I, myself, took photographs was in Gitarama.
Q.	Yes.  Yes, but where else, aside from Gitarama?
A.	At the site I mentioned in Mukingo and along the road.
Q.	And where else, Dr. Des Forges?
A.	I may have taken photographs in Kigali city, but I do not recall for sure.
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber this morning whether you ever went to Rusumo?
A.	I have just stated that, yes, I have been at Rusumo.
Q.	And did you visit any sites in Rusumo?
A.	I remember walking through that area for a period of three or four hours.  I no longer recall the names of the cells or the secteurs where I was, but I did walk through there for three or four hours one day.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, in the research you have conducted on Rwanda and, more specifically, with respect to Rusumo, as you have been to that location, did you ever hear anyone mention Marcel and Gloria Gerin?
A.	Would you spell the family name for me, please?
Q.	Yes, of course.  Gerin is spelt G-E-R-E-N (sic), Gerin.
A.	Yes, I believe I had one or perhaps two meetings with Mr. Gerin.
Q.	Did you have the opportunity to conduct an interview with him?
A.	Yes.
Q.	During this interview did he ever see that -- say that he had experienced the massacres directly, personally, in Rusumo commune?
A.	I remember his speaking to me about his experiences at a ranch that I believe he managed for President Habyarimana in the area of Nasho.  I don't know if that's within the commune of Rusumo as it is now drawn or exactly which commune it falls in, but I identify it with the area known as Nasho.
Q.	Doctor, this couple -- did this man tell you whether he or they were arrested?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did they tell you who arrested them?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber who arrested them?
A.	He said that they were arrested by RPF soldiers.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, when you went to this commune, I assume it was in 1994, did you have an escort?
A.	Maître, I was in Rusumo, as I recall, in August of 1994 and, to the best of my recollection, except once in 1993, I have never travelled under escort.
Q.	In that case, could you tell me at what date you went to Rusumo?
A.	I believe it was late September or early October 1994, but in order to be sure I would have to check my notes.
Q.	This Gerin person -- or this couple, did they tell you that persons were murdered at his ranch?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did he tell you the names -- or tell you who had perpetrated these massacres?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you mention the names of those who perpetrated these killings to the Trial Chamber?
A.	He said the killings were committed by RPF soldiers.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, did Gerin tell that you he had a radio that would allow him to hear army communications, including FAR forces, UNAMIR forces?
A.	I recall his saying that he had a radio.  I do not recall his specifying its capacities.
Q.	During your conversation, did this Gerin person mention that aircraft were flying over the area?
A.	I recall his speaking of one airplane; I did not recall his speaking of more than one.
Q.	One airplane, yes, I'm sorry; it was one airplane, a C-130.  Did he mention to you why this airplane frequently flew over his land?
A.	I don't recall that he had any explanation, nor do I recall the kind of airplane.  If it was, in fact, a C-130, I would suspect that it was the UN plane that flew supplies and personnel back and forth between Nairobi and Kigali.
Q.	Dr. Alison, did Gerin describe for you what the soldiers who came to kill the people in his ranch and arrest him were wearing?
A.	Maître, I had understood that your questions would be based upon my testimony in the Akayesu trial.  I do not recall that I discussed this in the Akayesu trial.  In fact, I don't think I had met Gerin at that point; so I have not reviewed those notes in several years and, I'm sorry, I cannot tell you the details of that interview.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  I wasn't insisting on this.  I just wanted to know if you had heard about it.  Now, madam, if these details can't be given, which is understandable to everyone and especially to me, at least, madam, did you meet Gerin after he was arrested or before he was arrested?
A.	I met him after his return to Europe which I believe must have been in, perhaps, late 1997.  In any case, it was not in Rwanda that I met him and it was considerably after the establishment of the current Rwandan government.
Q.	Where did you meet him?
A.	I met him in Brussels.
Q.	Doctor, before you went to Rusumo, did a journalist speak to you about that region of Rwanda?
A.	There were several journalists in the Kigali at the time of my arrival.  I spoke with them.  I do not recall at this time whether we specifically spoke of eastern Rwanda or not.
Q.	Doctor, with the permission of the Trial Chamber, I have a copy of an interview here with Mr. Gerin.  I should like you to look through it and give us your opinion.  I should like you, madam, to specify to the Trial Chamber that this Gerin was neither Hutu or Tutsi nor even Rwandan.
A.	I think this man is Belgian.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, so as to gain time, when you have documents you wish to submit to the witness you should at least have two or three copies so we don't waste time, so that the witness can look at the document.  Have you handed several copies?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I gave more than one copy; I think three or four.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
But, apparently, he has forgotten the interpretation booths.
THE WITNESS:
This newspaper interview appears to me, roughly, to contain the same kind of material that Mr. Gerin presented to me in your conversation.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Thank you, madam.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, the expert witness has told us that all the questions the Defence has put to her and --
THE WITNESS:
(Witness's microphone not on) --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
-- answers she made are present in this document.
THE WITNESS:
I said the newspaper article appeared to treat the same material that was covered in our conversation.  Obviously, I have not had time to read this in detail, so I cannot affirm that it coincides exactly with the information that he presented to me.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	But the questions I asked and the answers you gave are here in this document, are they not?
A.	Maître, to affirm that, I would need to read this page -- this article, and it would take me, perhaps, ten minutes to read it thoroughly.  I don't expect that it is of such importance that we would take the time to do that now.
Q.	Madam, as it's in French, can I read it?  That might accelerate things.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't think you are quite conscious that if you read the article now, it's going to take 15 or 20 minutes and you will have exhausted time of your cross-examination.  Is that all you have got left to do?  Is that what you want to do?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No, madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, in that case, please think, because I don't think it would be very useful.

MR. KOUENGOUA:
No, madam.  I merely wanted to point out that ranch is at Mpanga, north of Rusumo commune, where my client was bourgmestre, and I should like the expert witness to continue reading and that this document be reserved as a document we wish to tender in evidence because everything is contained in this article.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, do you have an observation?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I am uncomfortable.  This is a newspaper article.  I don't know the contents because clearly it is in French and counsel didn't have the courtesy of availing it to the Prosecutor.  But it's a newspaper article.  What's the value of the newspaper article?  A newspaper article cannot be evidence unless counsel is calling the person quoted in that article as a witness for the Defence.  And, in the event that he does so, there is no need to put the newspaper article if we get the best evidence from the witness.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, please.  I think that counsel for the Prosecution's argument is unfounded.  The Trial Chamber can receive any evidence that it deems to have probative value, and that is the request I am making.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will consider your request.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we can allow this document, but we don't really know what is in this article which is journalism.  We shall determine later what value we can ascribe to this document.

Registrar, for the time being the document has been tendered by the Defence. 

You consider it an article?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is not --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Forgive me, it is an article from a magazine called "Africa International", quite well known, and I will add that when the Prosecution objected they were saying what could be the value of a newspaper article.  I should like to draw attention to the fact that the documents disclosed to me in respect of Madam Des Forges's expert testimony, cartoons from Kangura, and I don't know which is journalism.

JUDGE EGOROV:
Go on, please, with your questions to the witness.  Go on, please.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Lordship.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Madam, I am obliged go quite quickly now.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The table to your right, on the easel to your right, could it be brought forward?
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	I think when I was shown this administrative something - chart, when I was given this -- shown this document, this chart I was told that you are the author of it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Is that correct?
A.	Yes.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Counsel for the Prosecution, could you please show it on the screen as you did yesterday because from here I can't see it?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Technicians, technicians.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I can see, but we have no time; we will have to go blind.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	So, you see here on the chart that you have the president, prime minister, council of ministers, ministry of interior and community development, préfectures and then commune.  Do you think that your chart reflects administrative realty in 1994 in Rwanda, madam?
A.	The chart is a schematic rendering of a more complex organisational structure done for the purpose of illustrating my testimony.  There is, for example, no mention of the division or subdivision of the sous-préfecture on this chart because that was not being treated in my testimony.
Q.	Madam, a witness to whom I asked the question told me that the hierarchical superior of the bourgmestre is the subpréfet not the préfet.  How could you have neglected that, whereas, my client is a bourgmestre -- was a bourgmestre?
A.	I explained the purposes of the chart.  The chart was done for a certain reason.  In any case, the echelon of sous-préfet was, I believe, according to law, added considerably after the structure of préfecture and commune, and never had the same political weight as these other offices.  It was a kind of bureaucratic half-way house, if you can say that, a stopping off point, for documents and orders that went up and down the hierarchy, but in political terms the sous-préfet had none of the importance of the préfet and the bourgmestre; for example, the structure of the security councils, the conseils de sécurité, which were very important during this period, existed at the level of préfecture and level of commune, but so far as I know, there was no such structure at the level of sous-préfecture.
Q.	Doctor, is it communes in which there was a subpréfecture; you think the préfecture was the same as you are describing now?
A.	Depending on the personality and connections of the sous-préfet, the proximity of his office to that of the commune could be increased by the fact that he was so nearby, but this does not materially change my comments.
Q.	Is the case that you have just described that of Rusumo commune?
A.	I do not know if the sous-préfecture office was within the limits of the commune of Rusumo or not.  I know that it was close to Rusumo, but I am not sure that it was in Rusumo.
Q.	Thank you, Doctor.  Let us now speak of the bourgmestres.  In the Akeyesu case in 1997, for the part I tried to read, you said that the bourgmestre had military, administrative and other powers.  The question, madam, is: did you check that situation?  Did you verify it?
A.	When I described the duties of the bourgmestre, I was relying upon the laws for the creation of the commune.  I believe that information is accurate.
Q.	Madam, I'm going to read article 56 of the law of 23rd November 1963, as amended; law -- 23rd November 1963, as amended by law No. 31/91 of the 5th of August 1991.  "Article 56: The powers of the bourgmestre.  The bourgmestre represents central government in the communal -- in the commune and embodies communal authority."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you please repeat the last sentence?
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Q.	Article 57 -- I was saying: "The bourgmestre is under the hierarchical superior in charge of economic and social development of the commune and the application of laws and regulations.  Moreover, he works in close cooperation in the accomplishment of tasks of general interest when requisitioned by the préfet."  Article 50 -- and Article 58: "The bourgmestre is, in general, entrusted with implementing decisions taken by the communal council."  I did not see anywhere, any powers over the military or the gendarmerie, as you have asserted, 12th -- on 12th of February 1997 before Trial Chamber I of this Tribunal.
A.	Would you quote exactly what I said, please?
Q.	For example, page 47, testimony of 12th of February 1997, "He has exclusive responsibility and authority over the communal police and, through that police force, he is responsible for maintaining order.  When he needs reinforcement from elsewhere, to enforce order, he can requisition the Gendarmerie Nationale and can requisition them when they were present in his commune.  Moreover, he is an officer of the judicial police and, in that capacity, can lock people up in their cells".
A.	I don't know if -- what part of that do you wish to contest?
Q.	"He is responsible for maintaining order and has authority over the Gendarmerie Nationale"?
A.	There is another part to that sentence which says "when they are in his commune".  I believe if you look at the law on the communes, you will see that when the national gendarmerie is put at the disposition of the bourgmestre he then assumes control over them.
Q.	And in your research, Doctor, was there a gendarmerie in Rusumo?
A.	I do not know that there was a gendarmerie at Rusumo.  In times of crisis, detachments of gendarmes were often sent for a brief period into a place of crisis, perhaps for only two or three days.  I don't know whether that was the situation in Rusumo or not.  In any case, that was a procedure which could take place whether there was a permanent gendarme detachment or post or camp in the area or not.
Q.	Dr. Alison, you are testifying and I am cross-examining on your testimony in the Akeyesu case in 1997.  Yesterday when I deplored the absence of a specific report in my client's case you said that the facts were no different, and I tried to check last night, but I do not see anywhere the name -- the proper noun "Rusumo" throughout your testimony of that date.  Is that a deliberate omission?
A.	I attempt to be as pertinent and on point as possible in my responses to questions.  The questioning, as I recall, had to do with the commune of Taba and with developments at the national level.  I cannot imagine why I would have wasted the time of the Court by talking about Rusumo, so I do not expect that you would find any reference to Rusumo in that testimony.
Q.	Dr. Alison, thank you for that reply.  But, as I thought it was an omission on the part of the stenographers, I took the document entitled, "No one" -- "Aucun témoin ne doit survive".
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Which is, I think, "No one should live to tell the tale".
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Is that from your pen?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	The book is dated 1999 and I don't think that there's anywhere in that book that you mention Rusumo, madam.
A.	I cannot affirm that there is no mention of Rusumo in that entire book.  I do not carry all of those details in my head, but I am quite sure that there is a discussion in the book about the church of Nyarubuye.  And, here, if I might add a point of clarification, I realise now that when you questioned me earlier about Rusumo, you were speaking of the commune of Rusumo.  In my own mind, I think of Rusumo in a much more narrow context, and when you asked was I in Rusumo in August, I was thinking of Rusumo at the crossing point, which is the place I always think of, or the bureau communal.  I was not there in August, but I was indeed at Nyarubuye in August.  So in the book I don't know whether you find Rusumo, but I'm quite sure find Nyarubuye.
Q.	Dr. Alison, can you go to Nyarubuye without going through Rusumo centre?
A.	I don't recall the road we took.  It's quite possible we went through a commercial centre, but I don't recall that.  In any case, I did not stop there; I went to the church.
Q.	Doctor, in your testimony in 1997 in the Akayesu case, in answer to counsel for the Prosecution in examination-in-chief, you said, "In matters of history any source must be dealt with with scepticism in the first place"; is that correct, madam?
A.	I do not recall those precise words, but that is fundamental to my thinking, so it is quite likely that I did say that.
Q.	In other words, one should always be doubtful with respect to the sources of information -- with respect to the credibility of the source of information.  Is that what you are referring to?
A.	Indeed, I believe I said that in this courtroom yesterday.
Q.	Doctor, since you say that in 1997 you did not talk about Rusumo but, rather, Taba -- that you, instead, talked of Taba, did Akayesu come from Taba?
A.	I believe he was the bourgmestre of Taba.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, well, time is a passing very quickly.  Since you didn't talk about Rusumo in 1997, and that is where my client was bourgmestre, do you think you can do so today; can you talk of Rusomo today, that is, six years later?
A.	I am prepared to discuss the history of the genocide in order to provide a context for understanding the events in the commune of Rusumo or the préfecture of Kibungo.  I came prepared to do that, and I am still prepared to do that.
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  When you say you are ready to do that, that presupposes that I should put to you questions on Rusumo; is that correct?
A.	Of course, you may ask questions about Rusumo and, to the extent that those questions can be usefully answered by drawing upon my professional experience and knowledge, I am happy to answer them.  If, on the other hand, I feel that my research and my experience is inadequate, I will tell you so.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, like you, I came here today for the cross-examination, so I should ask you -- well, you did not talk about Rusumo in 1997.  How can I, who was not there in 1997, ask you questions on Rusumo?  What will be my guide or reference point, so to speak?
A.	The events of Rusumo did not take place in a vacuum.  One of the characteristics of the genocide of 1994 was the connection between events at the local, national and even international level, so that, a thorough understanding of the development of the genocide elsewhere in Rwanda is essential to understanding what happened in Rusumo.  I suppose that it was for that reason that I was called.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, yesterday you very briefly said that there was a classification -- a complicated classification of rich, poor, Tutsi, Hutu, and so on; but, since Rusumo is my client's commune and since you have been there, while you were there, were -- the electric poles that have been thrown to the ground, had they already been put up again?
A.	I do not recall having observed any -- what do they call them in English -- transmission towers.  In any case, the "poteaux électriques", I do not recall having observed them either standing or on the ground.  I simply have no recollection of having seen them.  I believe there was no electricity at the time I was there, so that may indicate that they had not been replaced upright.
Q.	Thank you, Doctor.  Do you have correspondents in that commune, people you correspond with, do you have them in that commune?
A.	In 1994?
Q.	Yes, only in 1994.  I am only referring to 1994, at that point in time.
A.	Not that I recall.
Q.	Since you carried out studies on Rwanda as a whole, if I asked you to make a comparison on economic development of Rusumo and the other communes that you visited, what would you say?
A.	I would say that, based upon my observations, Rusumo was one of the most rural and most -- what shall I say?  It gave the impression of a place that was remote from the centre, not in the heart of things.  The population, as I recall, not just from 1994 but from earlier visits -- when I was doing historical research in the area, I recall it as being a very relatively lightly populated region compared to central Rwanda and one with relatively little commercial life; that is, there were not a great number of shops and crossroads and so on.  My impression was, instead, of a rural, very dispersed population.
Q.	Following those explanations, for which I thank you, can one say that Rusumo was not favoured by the Habyarimana clan.
A.	I believe that would be correct.
Q.	I thank you.  Furthermore, I also forgot to introduce to you my client; his name is Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre.  He was bourgmestre.  His name does not feature in any of your documents or research studies.  Is my understanding correct?
A.	I cannot say whether or not Mr. Gacumbitsi's name appears in my book.  There are a number of places where I spoke of groups of communes, groups of bourgmestres and listed several.  Whether he appears in that context or not, I do not know.  I do not at this point recall having ever written about Mr. Gacumbitsi.
Q.	Thank you.  I agree with you that whenever you talked about groups of communes very often you gave the name of the bourgmestre and since I drew your attention to the fact that you did not talk about Rusumo, certainly you did not talk about Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre.  This is important, Dr. Des Forges.
A.	It reflects the way our research was done.  Our work was concentrated in the préfecture of Butare which was chosen because of its particular history of resisting the genocide, and then certain adjacent areas which we took for the purposes of comparison from the préfecture of Gikongoro and then other materials that happened to come to us from the préfecture of Kibuye.  We then expanded into Gitarama because that also was an area that was slower to join in the genocide, and our research on the ground did not deal with Kibungo, with Byumba, Ruhengeri or Gisenyi; so it is not at all surprising.  Our work was focused on certain geographical regions and then enlarged to include a history of the genocide at national level and its international connections, but it was not meant to be an intensive ground level study of every region of Rwanda.
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Alison.  The little that you said on Rwanda -- or certain regions mentioned, perhaps for my understanding, maybe you could give the sources that enabled you to arrive at the conclusions that you are referring to today.
A.	Which sources exactly are you referring to, the sources of the book?
Q.	No, I am talking about sources that enabled you to carry out the analysis and arrive at the conclusions that you presented before this Court, I believe, since 1997 because this is the period we are dealing with today.
A.	Well, I would say interviews of thousands of persons, to begin with; the examination of a considerable amount of government documentation; the examination of some correspondence between government officials and political leaders; reading of the press of the time; reading of transcripts of radio broadcasts of the time; reading of diplomatic correspondence extensively; reading of records of UNAMIR; examination of records of UNHCR; examination of the records of the UN human rights field office; discussion with Rwandan colleagues and colleagues from other parts of the world, including academic specialists.  That may not be a complete list, but it gives you an idea.
Q.	Dr. Alison, in your testimony of 18th February 1997 you cited religious authorities, UN authorities, authorities from the US state department, the UN general secretariat, but at no time did you talk about members of government, nor about those whom you described yesterday as members of the MRND.  We are referring to -- I'm referring to page 48, the testimony is that of 18th February 1997, pages 47 and 49.
A.	In some cases, Maître, it was to protect the confidentiality of sources.  When I speak of thousands of interviews, they included among them interviews of members of the former Rwandan government and members of the MRND, as well as of other political parties.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I'm not challenging your testimony.  All I'm saying is that I saw RPF, clerics, correspondents, United States, and so on; but I did not see any mention of members of the government, the MRND or the Rwandan Armed Forces.  That is all I am saying.
A.	Then please cite the words exactly.
Q.	I will try.
MR KOUENGOUA:
Prosecutor, I mentioned the page.  Can it be shown on the screen?  This will enable us to go faster; pages 48 and 49, please.  
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, well, time is against me.  I would now like to come back to where I should have started.  You were the "Woman of the Year" in 1995 for Buffalo News, in 1995.  You were also a fellow of another institution in 1996.  I take only these three (sic) distinctions because it is quite a voluminous and impressive document or C.V.  I would, respectfully, for my information as well -- because tomorrow I should have the opportunity of saying that I was able to question you.  Now, my question is: your research on Rwanda, did it contribute to the various awards that you received?
A.	Those distinctions were based, in part, upon my work in Rwanda; in part, on my efforts to improve public education in the City of Buffalo.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, still in your transcripts, the transcripts disclosed to me -- but, unfortunately, I cannot give you the page in this case; it is quite fastidious.  I believe you said that there were two parties, MRND, CDR, which came together in a coalition to do a number of things; is that correct?
A.	The MRND and the CDR were, indeed, collaborators for a considerable amount of the period from 1992 to 1994.  There was a brief period when the CDR split from the MRND but, in general, they acted together.
Q.	Since we are in 1994; in 1994 were they still together, were they still collaborating?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I am going to read correspondence which I have before me and you will give your impression thereon.  This document is dated 25 March 1993, Kigali.  "Mr. President of the Alliance for the Strengthening of the Democracy, Kigali.  Mr. President, I regret to inform you that on 17 January 1993, the executive committee of the party CDR -- the CDR party decided to withdraw the CDR party from the Alliance of the Strengthening of Democracy, RFD.  Thus, in accordance with the agreement for collaboration of 12th November 1992, the withdrawal of the CDR party from the Alliance is set for 25 March 1993.  Please accept our greetings.  The CDR party; the address of the party; telephone 70076 (sic), Kigali; copies to Parti PECO, Parti PADER, PARMA party; signed by the chairman of the CDR party, Bucyana, Martin."
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Registry, please, can you show this document to the witness?
THE WITNESS:
Did you have a question about the 1993 document? 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	I put the question to you before producing the document.  My question was -- because you told me that in 1994 there was an alliance between the MRND and the CDR, and I'm showing you this document to ask for your reaction.  This document put an end to what you said, from 27 March 1992.
A.	No, no, no, you got it wrong.  If you recall my answer, I said that these two parties worked in common from 1992 through 1994, with the exception of a period when they separated.  That period was, indeed, the period of this letter.  But the parties resumed their alliance sometime after that, and my answer is correct for the year 1994.
Q.	And when did the alliance resume?
A.	I do not know that the alliance was formally recreated or renewed but, certainly, if you look at the series of CDR press releases, and I am thinking particularly of those from the month of August through to the end of 1993 and into 1994, you will see there an association with the power position which encompassed at that point, as well the MRND.
Q.	When this letter was written, that split was in existence, wasn't it?
A.	As I noted, there was a period when the parties divided and, in fact, when -- I believe it was about the time of this letter -- the CDR actually openly opposed President Habyarimana and suggested that he should be removed from power.  But one of the characteristics of politics in Rwanda is its dynamism.  People changed positions rapidly and easily, and coalitions group and regroup as the parties see their interest at the moment.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I would also like to tender into evidence this document.  This will be a Defence Exhibit D06.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, do you have any comments to make with regard to the application made by the Defence?
MR. KAREGYESA:
No comments, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.

This document, therefore, is admitted into evidence as Defence Exhibit D06. 
(Exhibit No. D06 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I should recall that earlier on we had also admitted into evidence a document tendered by the Defence and relating to a press article published in the newspaper called "Africa International", issue No. 319 in the month of November 1998, and this document is marked D05.
(Exhibit No. D05 admitted)
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Dr. Alison Des Forges, I thought I read in the transcripts an assertion -- well, not an assertion, a statement to the effect that the RPF was a party which had eliminated, at least on documents, the issue of ethnicity.  Is that the outcome of you -- or the finding of your research?
A.	I believe that what I said was that the ideology of the RPF was a nationalist ideology that sought to eliminate or to minimise distinctions based on ethnicity.  I stress the need for careful language here; I say that is their ideology.
Q.	I thank you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Defence counsel's microphone, please.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q. Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  While we note that, if I have to subscribe to what the Prosecutor said -- that when the CDR and the RPF were allowed to settle in Kigali there were 11 members of parliament.  Among them, there were five Tutsi, five of them were future ministers; and among them and there were three Tutsi.  What do you think of this?  Well, you could see that the assertions of the RPF were not as practical as they purported. 
(Pages 1 to 16 by Verna Butler)


































	1015H
A.	The majority of members of the RPF, particularly at the upper -- in the upper ranks, were Tutsi and the persons nominated to the posts you mentioned were obviously chosen from that pool of the upper ranks. 
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  I'm sorry that we were not able to go into details with respect to Rusumo, but with respect to Akazu I would like to put one last question to you if you would be so kind to answer, as you have been kind since yesterday.  Did Sylvestre Gacumbitsi -- in this commune which in your opinion was far from the centre, far from the capital, which was a rural area, do you believe that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was a member of the Akazu?
A.	I have never heard Mr. Gacumbitsi's name mentioned as a member of the Akazu and I would find it surprising if he were a member of the Akazu.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you for enlightening us, and I would like to thank the Trial Chamber, the Presiding Judge and Your Honours for your indulgence.  I thought I might be able to catch up on the minutes that were lost but, unfortunately, this was not the case.  I would like to thank the Court once again for its indulgence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel.  Judges Reddy and Egorov would like to put some questions to the witness and, after that, we shall see if the Prosecutor also wishes to put questions to you as part of its 
re-examination.

Judge Reddy, you may please proceed. 
JUDGE REDDY:
I have just --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The microphone, please, for Judge Reddy.  Thank you. 
JUDGE REDDY:
I just have two or three questions.  The first relates to your visit to the Nyamugari seminary, which I think you said was in August 1994, if I'm not wrong. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, the date is correct, but the place I visited was the parish, the church and the immediate surrounding buildings.  I do not believe -- if there is a seminary there, I did not visit it. 
JUDGE REDDY:
All right.  Perhaps the church and the precincts are what I'm talking about.  Now, you said you saw dead bodies still presumably in the church, in the chapel, and within the precincts.  Am I right? 
THE WITNESS:
As I recall, there were very few bodies in the church at that time, perhaps only a half dozen bodies or parts of bodies.  I remember some just inside the main entrance.  I remember some bones which appeared to be leg bones near the altar, but it was not a church that was filled with bodies, certainly not at the time I saw it.  

There were bodies in front of the church, or parts of bodies.  I recall, when I stepped out of the truck, I looked down and realised I was standing on the body of a small child, and then as I walked back along the path into the courtyard there were groups of bodies, perhaps five, six, seven at a time lying alongside the path and, then, as you entered the courtyard, there were a very large number of bodies in the distant corner of the courtyard, as if a group of people had fled and been trapped there and killed there. 

I made an attempt to estimate the number.  It was very difficult because the bodies were pell-mell, very much a dense mass, but my estimate would be under 1,000; in other words, not tens of thousands but under 1,000, given the space. 

In addition, there was a small house in the courtyard where there were bodies and then there were classrooms, as well, in which there were bodies. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Now, on the basis of what you saw at the church, the chapel and the precincts and on the basis of investigations that you carried out and discussions you had with both the survivors and the witnesses, were you able to establish approximately how many people were killed at the church or within the precincts of the church? 
THE WITNESS:
Estimating numbers is perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of evaluating a catastrophe.  No one is very good at this.  Survivors generally speak only of large numbers of people; they have no concept and, indeed, you can imagine, were you in a similar position, you also would not be interested in how many others exactly were surrounding you.  So, the only reliable basis I feel was my own observation of what I saw.  

It's possible that a certain number of bodies had been removed.  Certainly, some parts of bodies had been consumed by dogs.  I would be surprised, given the area, the relative sparsely of population and so on, if there had been more than, say, 10,000 victims at that site.  I know that there were a substantial number of other people who came there to seek refuge there as they fled towards the border, but the Tutsi population, the total Tutsi population of the commune at that time was, I believe, fewer than 4,000.  I believe it was 3,700 and something, and certainly not all of those people were killed.  So, you would have that basis, plus the people who came in from the outside. 
But when these attacks took place, the numbers of attackers were never equal to the numbers of victims, certainly not.  And one can picture an attack -- at least here I draw on the basis of my experience elsewhere because I have not studied this in detail -- but where one would have a small number of professional armed people -- that is, soldiers or gendarmes or former soldiers or even perhaps militiamen -- but they would be in the order of one, two, three dozen, so, certainly fewer than 50.  And then you would have a mass of ordinary people who had been summoned, who had arms like machetes and clubs and so on, and they would perhaps have been, at most, in the neighbourhood of a thousand or perhaps something more than a thousand.  That would mean that when the attack happened, some people got away.  And, indeed, from the accounts of witnesses, people did get away.  So if you have 10,000 or more at any given time at the church, once the attack begins, people do flee.  So, that would leave me to estimate 10,000 or fewer, perhaps considerably fewer, since my own observation was, I would say, fewer than a thousand.
JUDGE REDDY:
And then on the basis of your discussions with survivors and witnesses and any other sources that may have been available to you, were you able to fix the date of the massacres at the Nyamugari church? 
THE WITNESS:
Based on witness statements, it would seem that the attacks were on the 15th.  There may have been preliminary skirmishes earlier and follow-ups later, but I believe the 15th was the day.  

That was also the day of major attacks in Kibungo, the préfectural capital, and then the RPF arrived approximately the 27th or 28th in that area.  So that would be the point after which further killings of Tutsi would have diminished rapidly.  They would not have ended altogether, but would have diminished rapidly because most of the other militia and others would have fled.
JUDGE REDDY:
That would be the 15th of April 1994?
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry, you're correct, the 15th of April '94.
JUDGE REDDY:
Now, I notice in some of the material that is available to us about events in Rwanda, at least after 1990, that there were massacres.  They may not have amounted to genocide, but certainly there were massacres of Tutsis.  Is there any record of any massacres at the Nyamugari church, other than the one that took place 'round the date you have mentioned, 15th of April 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
I certainly have never heard of any mention of a massacre in this area prior to that time.
JUDGE REDDY:
Thank you.  And elsewhere in Rusumo commune -- you did talk about this yesterday -- were there visible signs of massacres of large numbers of people that you were able to establish during your visit in August 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
I recall visiting a site nearby, oh, perhaps one, two, kilometres away, and I believe that there were -- that that was a place where there had also been killings on April, the 15th, but, to the best of my recollection, there were no bodies visible at that place when I visited it. 
JUDGE REDDY:
And were there graves, signs, evidence of recent graves in Rusumo commune that you saw in 
August 1994, and if there were, would you be able to give us the approximate numbers? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not see evidence of mass graves.  Certainly, the impression at the church site was of a place where there had been no organised effort to clean it up.  So, I think there may well have been places where people were buried, but I did not see them.
JUDGE REDDY:
Thank you very much. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Madam Witness, unfortunately, very many people were killed in churches.  Could you briefly comment on this phenomenon?  What was the role of religion in Rwandan society and what were the relationships between the religion and state authorities by the end of -- the middle of the '90s?  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
The first question, why there were massacres in the churches, is relatively simple to answer.  As Judge Reddy mentioned, there had been prior massacres in Rwanda.  When Tutsi had been threatened previously and had fled to churches or even to secular places like communal offices or schools, they had been safe.  So that those who felt threatened saw the church as a place of refuge, whether they were members of that church or not, simply a church was a safe place, as was a hospital, a communal office, a school.  It was clear very early on, I believe it was Saturday morning, the 9th, when the first church massacre occurred at Gikondo church in Kigali.  So it was clear very early on that the church in fact this time was not going to be a sanctuary, a place of safety that would be honoured.   

But people who were attacked had so few choices, so few options, that many chose to go to a church even if they had heard of massacres in churches elsewhere. 

In some cases, administrative officials encouraged or even ordered people to go to churches.  In some cases, they did that in order to keep people from congregating at communal offices, but in other instances they actually went to the homes of Tutsi and told them to go to the church.  Because this appears clearly established at least in some areas, it appears that this was, in fact, a decision to use the impulse of people to flee to churches as a way to better kill them, to target them more efficiently. 

The question of relationship between the church and the state is obviously more complex.  The most important church in Rwanda is the Catholic church.  The great majority of Christians are Catholic rather than Protestant.  The early Catholic missionaries who had come from Europe after 1900, in the twentieth century, were often close collaborators with the colonial administration and a source of information for the colonial administrators, who believed the missionaries were the real experts because particularly the Catholics would come and spend their entire lives there.  Because of this the Catholic church or certain of the important Catholic clergy had a very large influence on colonial policy.  

Although the church was never as homogeneous, as uniform, as people depicted because there were always other currents, for example, there were always some priests who supported Hutu rather than Tutsi, but the church hierarchy -- once Tutsi had converted to Christianity, the church hierarchy supported the idea of a Tutsi monopoly of power; in many instances, anyway. 

Then, in the 1950s there was the arrival of a new generation of missionary workers after the Second World War.  They were part of a more radical Catholic movement -- for example, the movement of worker priests -- and they were more concerned about a democracy and sharing political power.  Notably, a Swiss bishop named Perraudin was typical of that group.  They encouraged the development of political ideas among the Hutu.  

So, you had a change in church policy that corresponded to and perhaps even encouraged the change in administrative policy in the 1950s as the switch was made from backing Tutsi power to encouraging Tutsi to organize. 

By the time of the genocide, the church, the clergy, was largely Rwandan -- the number of foreign missionaries was relatively small -- but this clergy was itself divided between Tutsi and Hutu.  And perhaps 60 per cent -- it's difficult to know for sure, but perhaps 60 per cent of the clergy, the Catholic clergy at that time was Tutsi.  But the hierarchy was generally Hutu because the Catholic church is very adaptable to political circumstances; it was a Hutu government; the hierarchy was Hutu, to such an extent that the archbishop was for a number of years a member of the central committee of the MRND until the church finally forced him to resign that post.  But even when he was no longer a part of the party structure, he continued to be very close to President Habyarimana and to his wife.  
President Habyarimana made a great deal of his Catholicism and it was an important bond for him, particularly with President Mitterrand of France.  

So, the situation was very complex by the time the genocide was begun and you have cases where obviously Tutsi priests were killed with their congregation, with the people in their church.  You have cases where Hutu clergy defended Tutsi who were attacked, but you also have cases where Hutu clergy at some level were complicit in the genocide, perhaps only, for example, by continuing the practice of announcing from the pulpit on Sunday that there would be a meeting on such-and-such a day and thereby letting it be known that they were aware of the meeting, they probably knew what would be discussed at the meeting and yet they helped to publicise the meeting; all the way from that level or the level of simply saying nothing, to the level of actual involvement in attacks.  

So, it was very complicated, but the impulse to go to the church to seek safety in the church was a much more simple and straightforward kind of reaction. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam, before giving the floor to the Prosecution I should also like to ask you one or two questions. 

You spoke of corpses floating in the Akagera River when you arrived there.  If possible, I should like to know whether you were able to obtain information as to the approximate date of those killings and also the number of victims that were found in the river. 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, the Akagera River moves rather rapidly in the area of the falls, less rapidly upstream, but I believe it would take no more than four or five days for a body to make its way down river past the point where I was, even assuming it were thrown in the water considerably upstream.  That would mean that the bodies which I saw and which were seen by many journalists as late as August would have been thrown in the river probably no more than a week or two before, assuming -- depending on the distance from the point of observation.  That would mean that they would have been relatively recent victims.

The observers of the UNHCR who watched the river from the Tanzanian side noted a decline in the number of bodies passing after the end of April; in other words, the peak of the great numbers of bodies going by was in the last two weeks of April and perhaps the first week in May.  And then there was a period of relatively few bodies.  

And then there was an increase subsequently, and the date that I recall was May 17, although it may have been somewhat earlier in May, when UNHCR people reported a new wave of bodies and they noted that a number of these bodies had their arms tied behind them.  

It would appear that the first and far larger number of bodies represented victims of genocide who were thrown in the river and that the second group represented victims of the RPF, with a distinction in time there of one to two weeks, which would correspond to the time when the RPF arrived and drove away the genocidal killers, and then the period when the victims of the RPF also appeared in the water. 

The total number of victims that went down the river or up the river to Lake Victoria was in the order of tens of thousands.  No one knows really how many but certainly tens of thousands, perhaps a hundred thousand, but that would surprise me.  I would say more likely tens of thousands of bodies. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, madam.  My second question is the following:  The description you gave us in 1997 of the role and powers of the bourgmestre in 1994 in the Akayesu case, is it applicable to all other communes or do you think that there were differences, variations from one commune to the other? 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, there certainly were differences from one commune to the other, with many variables determining that difference.  In some cases, even within a single party -- for example, the MRND -- there would have been differences in the standing, in the power, the authority, of a given bourgmestre.  The kinds of considerations which would determine this would be, for example, the length of time he had been in power, the extent of the organisation of opposition political parties, whether or not there were significant other contenders as rivals to a bourgmestre, the efficiency of the communal police, the extent of the political organisation of the party to which the bourgmestre belonged.  If he were a MRND party member himself, was there a sufficient backup structure for him at that time or had the MRND power been eroded by the development of other political parties?  

It would depend also on his relations upward as well as his relations downward.  What was his relationship to the prefect, to the minister of interior and, eventually, possibly to President Habyarimana.  There were some bourgmestres who were very close to Habyarimana.  Obviously, they had considerably more power than those who were more remote.  Had they family connections in the region?  If they were representatives of a large lineage group and had many relatives who backed them, this also was a determinant in terms of their power. 

So, I'm sorry, I cannot provide you with a more precise answer except to say, yes, there were considerable variations in the effective power; not in the legal authority because the legal authority was the same from commune to commune; but the effective power varied considerably according to local circumstances. 

In general, the bourgmestre had the possibility, for example, to distribute resources, particularly land, and in the context of the genocide this becomes a very important issue, as it had been in the 1960s as well.  I mentioned yesterday how bourgmestres would use the opportunity of vacant lands to increase their power.  And in some places we find very early on the bourgmestre and communal authorities organising the listing and even the distribution of property from Tutsi as a way to increase their power and to mobilise greater numbers to participate in the genocide.  So, that kind of resource is an important thing to look at. 

There are some bourgmestres who obviously were personally unenthusiastic, if not actually opposed, to killing Tutsi but who, in the end, participated because of the combination of pressures upon them.  I know the history best of areas in the centre and the south of the country where that happened, but I cannot exclude that that was also the case perhaps in this case.  

The end result, of course, for the victims was the same.  If the local authority, for whatever reason, becomes a participant in genocide, then the victims have relatively little chance of escaping. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, madam. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you wish to re-examine the witness? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours; the Prosecution has no questions in re-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

Madam Des Forges, we have reached the end of your testimony before this Tribunal.  We thank you for having kindly once more informed us as to the events of 1994, as well as preceding events.  We therefore wish you a pleasant end to your stay in Arusha and a safe journey home. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, madam.  
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, pray tell me, have you finished with your witnesses, both the witnesses of fact for the Prosecution and the expert witness? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I'm advised, Your Honours, that that was the last witness for the Prosecution and, accordingly, we rest our case pursuant to Rule 85 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  I'm most obliged, 
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, you have nothing to say?  We intended to suggest, since you'd requested a 
pre-Defence conference, that we now take the break and at 11:15 we hold the status conference so that you can tell us of the various problems you might have before we adjourn. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, thank you.  I should respectfully pray perhaps for this date to be delayed.  I only came here for the witness.  I did not have time to put together all the matters and issues I wished to submit to you at the pre-trial -- pre-Defence conference.  Perhaps 1 o'clock or tomorrow or 5 o'clock, any other time would suit me.  We don't necessarily need to respect the hearing times.  We could have it at 5 p.m. or 5:30, but rather I'd prefer that at the earliest it be tomorrow.  I would have difficulty meeting today. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We therefore suggest to the parties that we hold the pre-Defence conference tomorrow at 10 a.m., if that is agreeable to you.  Defence, Counsel for the Defence? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, we will attempt to meet that deadline.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You did say tomorrow, Counsel.  You said 5 p.m., 5:30, at that time.  We can't hope to have everyone here.  People leave the building, this place of work at 5:30.  We have to have the meeting in working hours.  And ourselves, we on the Bench, have also other commitments. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Very well.  Very well, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I will now ask Counsel for the Prosecution, 10 a.m. tomorrow, is that convenient for the pre-Defence conference?
MR. KAREGYESA:
It is, Your Honours; we are most obliged.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  We shall now adjourn and the Prosecution, Counsel for the Prosecution, having finished its presenting the evidence, we plan that on the 6th of October hearings will resume, or at any other date.  The pre-Defence conference will be the opportunity to consider the date at which we resume hearings in this case. 

We thank you, therefore, and we will meet tomorrow at 10 a.m. for the pre-Defence status conference.  Thank you all.  The hearing stands adjourned.
