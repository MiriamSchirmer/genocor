WITNESS GII
Cross-examination by Mr. Hopper (continued)...	7






P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  The session is open, ladies and gentlemen.  

Mr. Prosecutor, do you have any information for us regarding your next witness?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  Good morning.  We will complete the cross-examination of Witness GII.  And the next witness will be GIN.  Both witnesses are here with us this morning.  We are ready to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I must say I am taken a little by surprise, given what was said yesterday as to the next witness being GIN, and I haven't completely prepared for cross-examination for GIN.  I had anticipated that another witness would be in place.  For the reasons that were in fact discussed yesterday, there was, as you know, the additional, the serving of additional evidence relating to Witness GIN.  That additional evidence and the fact that it amounts to fresh charges in a fresh location, on the date or day that's never been mentioned, together with other significant features of change of evidence, amounts to a significant change in the expected evidence of this witness.  

The Defence are entitled, as a matter of law, of course, to have fair and proper notice of that.  I received the documents shortly after two o'clock on Friday.  I was not able to access the Accused 
Dr. Rwamakuba on Friday, Saturday, Sunday or yesterday.  Sorry, or Monday.  I was able to speak to him yesterday for about an hour and a half.  There are plainly other matters that I need to discuss with him.  I also need to review, in the light of the evidence, the relatively extensive gap transcripts, and I haven't had the opportunity to do that.  

The Prosecution yesterday, aware, of course, that their witness was here and doubtless anxious in fact to proceed in the light of that, but recognising my difficulty, that is before Mr. Webster's intervention -- and I am talking about Ms. Makwaia here, who is aware perhaps better than 
Mr. Webster of the nature both of GIN's evidence now and of the changes within it suggested that a week would be sufficient.  I was concerned that if it was to be just a week, then I would not be in a position to conduct what would be reasonable and normally expected investigations into the allegations, the further allegations.  The further allegation, of course, includes, and is, a complete new novel allegation that André Rwamakuba attended the Kayanga health centre and organised the massacre or murder of persons within it.  I don't even know where that building is, what it is, who was there, what the surrounding circumstances were, what possible points of rebuttal I can glean from a proper investigation of that matter.  And this after a case has been prepared for five or six years, this in respect of an Accused who's been in custody for almost six years, all this, landing on one's lap, 
two o'clock Friday, before a four-day public holiday, puts the Defence in a totally unfair and unequal position.  

The Court has power and indeed simple ability to remedy some of that difficulty, and that is by giving me time.  For the Prosecution to seek to call the witness today is an eminent unfairness.  The resolution of the matter by an airy-fairy undertaking or possibility of recalling a witness is not sufficient.  It upsets the total balance for cross-examination, for a start.  Not only that, this witness is under sentence of death for another murder or a murder committed in her country.  There is nothing to do with the genocide at all.  In addition to that, she may very well be sick and have AIDS.  So the possibility of recalling all those circumstances is a difficult one.  It would be an unfairness to have her called today.  I need further time to prepare.  Thank you, Madam President. 

Madam President, I forgot and I omitted one important further matter, and for the record, I must include it.  In her original statement, this witness, as you can see from her statement, she says that she knew Rwamakuba because she had seen him many times driving in the area.  That is her source of identification.  Later she speaks to her husband.  She says, "Who is that man?"  

And according to her in her statement, he says, "That is André Rwamakuba."  

Compare and contrast that with what she now says in her new evidence.  She now says that she met André Rwamakuba on two occasions in either '91 or '92, the first at a wedding and on another time at another place, all fresh information, all of it needing to be checked at some stage, all of it obviously needing to be subject of careful consideration and cross-examination.  So those are two extremely significant additions to her evidence.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't think --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think I can add significantly to my submission from yesterday and what I have just said this morning, which is that, we have two witnesses here, GII, who, I assume will finish his 
cross-examination, and GIN.  Although we have other witnesses present in Arusha, we are not prepared to bring those witnesses forward today.  

Now, perhaps my colleague, Ms. Makwaia, who is responsible for the direct examination of this witness, may have additional comments.  I can ask her to take the floor and to address Mr. Hooper's submissions directly.  But that is our situation.  We have two witnesses here, GII, GIN.  We are ready to proceed with both.  We are not ready to proceed with any other witness, and if the Court makes a determination that it would be so unfair to the Defence to continue, we will simply have to adjourn for at least another day or so in order to prepare another witness.  We cannot go -- the only witnesses that we are prepared to go forward with right now are GII and GIN.  So that is the situation. 
MR. HOOPER:
May I inquire as to what has happened to GIT, G-I-T, who was spoken of as someone who is going to come in?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I thought it was quite clear yesterday when I said that GIT was on his way to Arusha.  I did not suggest yesterday that GIT would be brought into Court to testify today.  That is a ridiculous assumption if that is the one that you are making.  When I spoke to the Court, GIT was on his way to Arusha.  So that is the situation.  We either go forward with GII and GIN or we adjourn for today after the conclusion of GII's cross-examining, and then we will attempt to prepare a witness for the following day.  But the only two witnesses that are available today are GII and GIN. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
To make one last comment.  I mean, I am not -- I am ending my submission in any respect, but I do recall that some time last week, Mr. Robinson made a reference to requesting time off to prepare for the testimony of Witness G.  And he also mentioned the long weekend that was ahead of us last week as an opportunity for the Prosecutor to address certain matters.  

Well, we are faced with a long weekend ahead of us, and if the issue of preparing for Witness G is still an outstanding matter, then perhaps if we were not able to continue today beyond the 
cross-examination of GII, this would be an ideal opportunity for the Defence to prepare for its 
cross-examination of Witness G, because if we are only  completed with Witness GII's 
cross-examination, then we would have to tomorrow, which is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, during which time the Defence could devote themselves to the preparation of the cross-examination that they seem to be preoccupied by.  So that's also a consideration. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to proceed with the cross-examination of Witness GII, and the Chamber will use the break this morning in order to prepare the decision to be rendered regarding the witnesses to follow, in particular, Witnesses GIN and GIT -- and G.

Very well.  Can you usher in the witness?
	(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
It may be possible to deal with GIN in-chief, at least to give me the opportunity -- if it is going to be a  short, a relatively short adjournment.  I don't want to sell myself cheap.  I'm just saying, if I don't win the time that I need, then that may be -- give me the opportunity and save the Court its time.  But I don't want that to be a too alluring prospect.  I can put it like that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have taken due note of that observation.  

Yes, Mr. Roach, please. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, Madam President.  I am concerned about the suggestion of the Prosecutor that we use some time to -- in this week to prepare for the Witness G.  I do not want to repeat myself but you note that I have some written submissions before you with respect to that particular witness.  And you'll note also that we are saying that we will not be able to prepare for the Witness G, if the Witness G is brought in this session.  

Now, my friend the Prosecutor has picked up on my colleagues.  I think Mr. Robinson has said if we had the time off; that is not quite my position and I don't believe that that is Mr. Robinson's position any more.  That was a position that we had taken before we had or he had taken before he had disclosure of additional materials, and we would need substantial time with our client at the detention centre, because we do not have opportunities to speak to him about this evidence when he is here in this building.  And, as you know, it is difficult to be at the detention centre on days when we do have court, and it is limited over the weekends.  And so, therefore, I am concerned that you will not give too much consideration to what my friend the Prosecutor said about using this time for preparation of G.  
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to clarify matter a bit, if I may, Your Honours.  

Moving forward with the direct examination of GIN and limiting that witness's testimony to the direct examination is not a satisfactory way of resolving the issue from our perspective.  And simply to reiterate, my recollection of our discussion from last week is that the concern -- the major concern of the Defence in regards to Witness G was the time to prepare themselves for his cross-examination.  And if we are facing the opportunity of not having a court session tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, five days, it would seem to me that that would be an opportunity for the Defence to devote themselves entirely to the preparation of the cross-examination that they expect to be so complicated.  So there is a disappointment, if there is one, with respect to GIN is an opportunity for this Court to move forward in its consideration because there is another factor now that the Court can use in the process of deliberating on whether or not we should take Witness G's testimony on the 17th of May, which is what we have proposed.  

I would simply like to remind the parties and the Court that with respect to this witness, when this witness testified in the Media trial, the disclosure was limited to 30 pages of the eight transcripts that were conducted in Canada and nine, I believe, transcripts of the 26 transcripts that we have disclosed in this case.  So it is of concern to this Defence in terms of the volume of materials that they have to review.  Perhaps they can be guided by how this matter was handled in another trial, where determination was made that only a portion of those voluminous materials were relevant to the witness's testimony.  So I simply want to provide those additional clarifications and renew my submission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
I had spoken to the Chamber before with respect to a difficulty we have with our investigators, and I had indicated that my colleague, Mr. Weyl, who is present today, we have a full reinforcements with us -- had been a motion with respect to investigators.  At that time, Madam President, you had asked me if that was a written motion or if it were just an oral motion.  And I wanted to ascertain what that was.  But now that we have Mr. Weyl, who was responsible for that motion, present, or perhaps if the Chamber would allow him to address that, he would have more information than I do on that point.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.  Indeed, the Chamber must recall that I made an oral motion on the problems on investigators during the discussions that we had on the late disclosure of the six CD-ROMs of the video recording of the Ruhengeri meeting.  That oral motion was based on the fact that we are unable to be obliged to respond immediately to the fact that there was late disclosure if we do not have the necessary means to respond.  So we are still in difficulties since we have incomplete teams, and when I hear Mr. Webster say today that he is unable in 2004, after an arrest which was made in 1998, that today he is unable to examine the witnesses in the time limits provided, I do not think that he should expect from the Defence that it also be ready to go about this dangerous exercise if it is deprived of the means which ought to be its own for being assisted by investigators, because the Prosecutor, if he is unable to respond to his own needs, he should expect ourselves to go about this dangerous exercise ourselves.  

I must add that this issue, for us to be able to prepare the hearing of Witness G, I also filed a brief with the Chamber on this particular matter in order to underscore the fact that preceding decision of the Chamber had provided protective measures for this witness providing a deadline of 30 days for the hearing of this witness, and that time limit of 30 days has long been surpassed, and it is not possible to expect the Defence that since it is obliged to participate in the proceedings, that this remedies the shortcomings of the Prosecutor without investigators, without the necessary time limits under conditions which would also be prejudicial to the rights of the Defence and the respect of the equality of arms. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I hope it was clear that my suggestion of taking GIN's evidence-in-chief this side, as it were, the weekend, was not something I was pleading for.  It was something that was an alternative on the table.  It would be some advantage to me with the witness who is changing testimony to see what in fact he said, to better focus the efforts that I need to make prior to cross-examination.  I must say that I am unable to see how that can be a difficulty for the Prosecution, when indeed it might very well be the case, in any event, that GIN would have concluded her evidence-in-chief, as it were, tomorrow at the end of the session.  That must have been the possibility.  I don't see how that's a disadvantage or an unusual occurrence, as it were, for the Prosecution.  But I emphasise that my concern is that to do proper investigation, as the Court will appreciate, takes longer than a few days, when I don't have an investigator in place in Rwanda to conduct them.  That's the principal difficulty.  Thank you, 
Madam President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I am sorry.  I misunderstood you.  I misunderstood Mr. Hooper in his last submission.  I was under the impression that his suggestion was only to take the direct examination of Witness GIN and to adjourn cross-examination for a later time when he would have conducted his investigation.  If we are only talking about the delay of the weekend, then, of course, it is an appropriate way to proceed because, as he's just stated, we may find ourselves in a position where she's only completed her direct by the close of business tomorrow.  So I misunderstood his previous submission.  So with that in mind, there wouldn't be a problem if we can proceed on Tuesday morning with the completion of that witness's cross-examination, if it comes to that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have taken due note of your submissions and we will inform you of our decision shortly.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 

THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper is going to continue with his cross-examination of your testimony, and we do remind you that you are still under oath. 

Mr. Hooper, your witness.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS GII
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I pass out a piece of paper in which I have written one name and ask you to look at it?  And looking at that name, do you recognise the name on it? 
A.	I do know the person who has this name.
Q.	Did you, in fact, share that shop or accommodation with that person in 1994 or had you at any time? 
A.	He worked elsewhere.  I worked there for myself. 
Q.	And to be clear in your reply, at no time did you share the shop or the accommodation where you were living in 1994 with that named person? 
A.	We worked at the same centre and lived at the same centre but we never had a joint business. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can I pass up another piece of paper to you?  Can you read and write?  You obviously can, you just read that name but there is no difficulty.  If I give you a piece of paper, can I ask you to write a name on it?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness stated that he does not know how to write.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But you can read?
A.	Yes, I can read. 
Q.	It's an unusual combination or lack of combination.  Can I then pass you up a piece of paper with a name on it.  It should be well known to people here.  And I do that because I wasn't able to catch up with the interpreter this morning as to the word that was omitted, as it were, yesterday.  You mentioned being a leader of something in the community, and this is a guess.  Was it that organisation?  Don't name the organisation, but was that the organisation of which you were referring to yesterday? 
A.	No.  What I said was that I was not a leader of the organisation that you have listed. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has just given the title of his post in his community and the Kinyarwanda interpreter mentions that he is not sure if he should mention what was said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, so that we can follow, can we also see the papers that were passed to the witness?  May we also see what was written on that list?
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. Interpreter, may I again try and catch up with you, perhaps in the mid-morning break, over what that name was.  I don't think it matters further.  

Can I move on?   
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I want to ask you, Mr. Witness, your knowledge of MDR meetings that were held in your area.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment, please.  I would like to ask the registry to show that document to the other Defence teams first before we proceed.  I didn't completely understand.  It seems that earlier the witness gave a name, and gave his title that he held.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is correct.  The witness did indicate the position that he had within his community, the position that he held in the cellule. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That should be expunged from the record because that could reveal the witness's identity.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
That was not interpreted. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, I suggest that I'll catch up with the interpreter at half-time this morning and see what that may mean.  I don't need to carry it on with the witness, I am sure.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You may proceed, Mr. Hooper. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You were telling us yesterday that you had no political affiliation, but that it would be right to say you seem to have been aware of the politics in your area.  Is that right? 
A.	I could see people joining different political parties.  However, I never joined one. 
Q.	Did you follow with keen interest the activities of the MDR? 
A.	No, I didn't follow those issues closely.  It wasn't my concern, nor did I have any responsibility with regard to that. 
Q.	And it would follow from your earlier answer, in respect of reading or writing -- let me rephrase the question that I have just put.  Did you read, for example, any papers? 
A.	No, I did not read the newspapers.
Q.	Did you attend any political meetings? 
A.	I did not participate in political meetings for the fact that I was not a member of a political party.
Q.	If, for example, the MDR held a political meeting or rally in ***************************************** places where you lived or near where you lived, would you attend such a meeting out of interest or not? 
A.	I have told you I did not participate in the meetings or rallies. 
Q.	And yesterday you made it plain that you had not set eyes on the man identified to you as Rwamakuba until that first appearance on the 4th or the 5th of April; is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	In ******* is it right there was a house belonging to a man called Anastase Gasana; is that right?
A.	There was, yes; to this day even it is still there. 
Q.	In fact, if we look at photograph 2 --
MR. HOOPER:
And if the witness can be shown photograph 2 from P. 3.  The registry is pointing out photograph 2 to you, in fact, in the far distance of that photograph.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you see the house that belongs to Gasana? 
A.	I don't see it very clearly unless it is the one I see here.  In fact, it is a very large house.  I don't see it very well. 
Q.	Witness, let me put it like this.  Mr. Gasana's house, there then and still there today, is approximately in the direction of that photograph, not very far.  Would that be fair? 
A.	I think I have seen it in other photographs.  There may be a photograph in which we can see it better. 
Q.	Thank you.  If you can point that out to us, Mr. Witness, there is only six photographs there in ********.  Can I take this, Mr. Witness?  Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	It might be the position that you were shown other photographs before coming in to Court? 
A.	I was not shown the photographs.  And I can't see the house. 
Q.	Anastase Gasana had a house which is in the middle of ******** by the side of the main road or the road that we see in that photograph; is that right? 
A.	Yes, on the way to ****** secteur, that is where the house was. 
Q.	And the first photograph I showed you this morning, it shows the approximate area where that house is, you seemed to agree with that a moment ago.  That is right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Anastase Gasana, did you know that he, in fact, was the president of the MDR for Gikomero commune?
A.	I would see him arrive, hold the meetings.  I was not aware of the fact that he was the president of the MDR in Gikomero commune.
Q.	But he lived in ********, didn't he?  He had his house there, his main house.
A.	No, he didn't live in that house.  He built the house simply, otherwise he lived in Kigali.
Q.	But when in ********, he lived in that house, did he not? 
A.	No, he never spent the night there.  He came there to rest but then he would always return to Kigali. 
Q.	Mr. Gasana's wife was Tutsi, was she not? 
A.	I am not aware of that.
Q.	How long had you lived in ******** or thereabouts? 
A.	I lived there since 1991.
Q.	And before then, it is right, you lived just a very short distance away, did you not, in Karerera? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Anastase Gasana in '93-'94, was foreign minister of Rwanda; is that right? 
A.	He was minister for foreign affairs.  He held that position but I am not sure exactly when, which period either way.  In 1994, he indeed was minister of foreign affairs. 
Q.	And after the war, under Paul Kagame's government, he remained in post as foreign minister for Rwanda, did he not? 
A.	He did. 
Q.	And then became Rwanda's representative to the United Nations in New York, did he not? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  I did not continue to be concerned to what happened to that man. 
Q.	Have you heard of a man called Jean-Marie Makombe? 
A.	I know that man.  He is Gasana's brother-in-law.
Q.	Did he live in ********? 
A.	He lived in Gasoro, a bit further away. 
Q.	Same cellule or secteur?  Was it the same secteur? 
A.	Yes, in ****** secteur. 
Q.	As is ********? 
A.	Yes, absolutely. 
Q.	Did you know he was secretary of the MDR at commune level?  Do you know that? 
A.	Well, since I wasn't a member of that party, I didn't know.  I didn't know the party structure and I didn't know what positions such and such a person held within that party. 
Q.	But these were people living or with homes and associations on your doorstep, and you are saying you didn't know what was going on; is that right? 
A.	Makombe lived in another cellule in ******.  Gasana lived in Kigali. 
Q.	You refer to say -- you refer to seeing Gasana at meetings or holding meetings at the MDR.  Is that correct or not? 
A.	I told you that he would arrive in a vehicle with microphones and they would announce that they were going to hold a meeting.  That was given loudly as a message and that's when I saw him; he would announce a meeting that was going to take place at such and such a secteur.  It was under those circumstances that I saw him when he came to sensitise the population.  Even without seeing him, I could have heard the message being transmitted via the megaphone. 
Q.	Sensitise the population to what? 
A.	People were asked to come to the meeting, the meetings organised by the MDR party. 
Q.	Did you ever hear or learn of anti-Tutsi ethnic statements emanating, coming from such meetings? 
A.	At that time, it was before the split in that party, that is when Gasana came to announce that meetings organised by the MDR would be held. 
Q.	What do you know of the split in this party of which you know nothing?  What do you know? 
A.	Later on there was a split in the party and we knew that, and that is when Rwamakuba and the others came asking people to join the wing or faction they belonged to, and they were trying to convince people belonging to Gasana's faction to join theirs.  That is when I saw him in the circumstances that I described. 
Q.	When was the first time anyone came to ******** or that area to recruit people to join as a result of this split you talk about?  When was the first time you were aware that was happening? 
A.	At that time, the 4th and the 5th, on those dates, that's when Rwamakuba came for that purpose. 
Q.	And that was the first time, according to you, that anyone came to recruit anyone for this MDR Power part of the party; is that right? 
A.	That is what I witnessed; even on the radio there was talk of this split within the party on Radio Rwanda, for example. 
Q.	Prior to the 4th or 5th of April, when was the previous MDR meeting that you can recall in ******** or thereabouts? 
A.	In fact, there was never any meeting at ********.  In fact, the meetings were held at the secteur office.  Except for the meeting that Rwamakuba organised, no other meeting was held and at ******** centre. 
Q.	What about meetings other than at ******** but in the area as you've explained, at the secteur office, when was the previous MDR meeting that you remember prior to the 4th or 5th of April?  In your area, when was it?  That is the question.
A.	Well, since I wasn't a member of the party, I didn't follow its activities very closely.  I don't know on which date a meeting organised by the party took place. 
Q.	If you hold a political meeting in Rwanda in your area, do you know -- is it necessary to give notice to the bourgmestre of that intention?  Is that something you know or not?
A.	I don't know.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to object to that question.  I have been very patient.  I wanted to see where he was going.  I think that the witness can only testify to what he saw and not about all of the meetings held by the MDR or MRND or testify about all the lives about those leaders of MDR.  He's been very patient.  He's been asked -- he's been answering Mr. Hooper's questions.  He was asked if there was a meeting, he said that he didn't go to the meeting because he was not a member of a political party.  

As regards the MDR, contrary to what Mr. Hooper said, he said that he knew the MDR because it was a political party, and at one time there was a split within the party.  I think, therefore, that that line of questioning is not relevant and I would ask the Chamber to ask Mr. Hooper to move on to a new line of questioning.  

The witness has testified about what he saw, what he knows, what is contained in his statement, and I think that all of these questions that fall outside of that framework should not be sustained, and I would ask him to move on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to respond to that, Mr. Hooper?  Do you wish to respond to that objection or do you want to rephrase your question? 
MR. HOOPER:
The witness replied, "I don't know" and I move on.  He replied to the question.  He said, "I don't know." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I have the impression that this is an objection regarding the questions to follow as well. 
MR. HOOPER:
I doubt if my friend is so prescient as to know what questions are to follow.  But I will ask another question and you can be the best of judge of that, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall.
MS. FALL:
Yes, thank you, Madam President.  Indeed, I don't know what questions are to follow.  I just wanted to say that if it falls within the framework of the same type of questions he's been asking, I object, because the witness has already answered all of the questions with regard to the MDR.  He was very precise in what he said and about what was in his statement.  And so, I think any other questions regarding the MDR, the meetings of the MDR held outside of ********, I don't think the witness is in a position to answer.  He has already answered. 
MR. HOOPER:
I think that's probably right, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please proceed, Mr. Hooper. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we can perhaps usefully and briefly summarise your position as you know little of the MDR, is that right? 
A.	Yes, you are quite right. 
Q.	You didn't attend. 
A.	I do know very little about that political party.  I told you, Counsel, that I never attended any of these parties' meetings.  I was not a member of that political party. 
Q.	In your one statement that you've made, and which we referred to yesterday, I just want to briefly return to that and to the phrase you used there, where you say in the second line of the first page of your statement that you knew Dr. Rwamakuba.  Sorry, may I start again?  "That you meet 
Dr. André Rwamakuba at the meetings he organised in our area," meetings in the plural.  And I ask you again, did you meet André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I wanted to talk about the two meetings that he organised at our centre.  I do not know whether they properly took down what I said, but I had to say it twice that when he came to our centre -- when he intended to make members of one wing join his wing. 
Q.	It is a direct question and let's make it clear.  Did you ever meet André Rwamakuba, yes or no? 
A.	I told you that I saw him on the 4th and the 5th when he was trying to get people from the other camp to join his own camp, that is when I saw him in Gikomero commune.
Q.	I understand what you say, and so to use the word I "met" Dr. André Rwamakuba, would you agree is wholly wrong?  Would you agree with that? 
A.	I meant to say that I indeed saw him, that I saw him come to those meetings which took place at ********.
Q.	And you can express yourself, as we have heard repeatedly today, in a very straightforward manner.  So is the position this, that in your statement where the word is, "I met André Rwamakuba" that is either a misunderstanding on the part of the investigator as to what you were saying, or it was something that was said by you?  Would that be fair as one of the two? 
A.	I saw him but I did not meet him.  When you say that you have met someone, it would mean that you had contact with the person and that you discussed with the person.  But what I said is that I saw him, I did not speak with him. 
Q.	Let me move on and ask you this.  In the same sentence you say that you met him and this is the next phase I am asking, "At the meetings he organised in our area."  Now, there were meetings and there are meetings, as we know. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel -- Counsel, you have asked this question many times.  We have been very patient.  I think you can move on to something.  You yourself said you would do so.  Please do not ask the same question over and over. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is the position this, that you are changing your evidence between what you said to the investigator and which he clearly records and your evidence yesterday and today? 
A.	In my view, I did not change anything.  In my statement they wrote to say that I met 
André Rwamakuba, but I in fact said that I saw him.  I have indeed said that I saw him between the 4th and the 5th of April and between the 10th and the 11th of April.  I never met Rwamakuba anywhere else in Gikomero commune.
Q.	Let's come to the first of these sightings that you say you made of this man, on either the 4th or the 5th.  I think the 4th of April was a Monday, can you remember that?  It was Easter Monday, do you remember that?
A.	No, I do not remember.  I did not keep track of the dates. 
Q.	Is Easter Monday a holiday in Rwanda? 
A.	No, I do not remember. 
Q.	Why is it that you didn't tell the investigator all those years ago that you saw André Rwamakuba on the 4th or the 5th? 
A.	I believe I told them that I saw him on the 4th or the 5th.  I think that they did not put that down in my statement, but I did indeed say so. 
Q.	Because these two visits are very closely related in time, aren't they, just five days between them?
A.	What do you want to say when you say that those dates are very close?
Q.	What were those two visits closely related together?  It would be natural, if you mention one, to mention the other, to mention the date.  I'm coming back to the question, and you say, well, "I did mention it to the investigator."  That is your response, is it not? 
A.	I didn't know.  I didn't keep track of these dates.  I didn't know he was going to be committing crimes.  He can answer to that question himself.  Here in court I didn't keep track of those details.  I didn't take down any particular date because I didn't know that I would have to speak of those events ever again. 
Q.	Well, didn't you tell the investigator, look, he turned up one day and then turned up five days later?  Did you tell the investigator that? 
A.	I told them that I saw him between the 4th and the 5th of April, and that he came back between the 10th -- either on the 10th or on the 11th of April, and that two days later they distributed machetes and the genocide began in my area and that we immediately fled.  I think that I said all this to the investigators.
Q.	Now yesterday, is it right, you told us that you didn't know the position that André Rwamakuba held; is that correct? 
A.	I did not know the position he held but subsequently, I was able to get to know that he was a minister.  I didn't know him.  If you do not know someone, you cannot know what position they hold. 
Q.	How do you know that he held these positions?
A.	I would see him come there.
MR. HOOPER:
I asked the witness, how did he know that André Rwamakuba organised these meetings.  And his reply was -- and perhaps the interpreter could --
THE WITNESS:
I would see him come to *****'s home, who would meet the members of the MDR and who was trying to make them change camp.
(Pages 1 to 15 by Sithembiso Moyo)






























	1015H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	How do you know he organised these meetings?
A.	I would see him come there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	(No interpretation)
MR. HOOPER:
I asked the witness how did he know that André Rwamakuba organised these meetings, and his reply was -- and perhaps the interpreter could assist me.
THE WITNESS:
I would see him come to *****'s home, who would meet the members of the MDR and who was trying to make them change camp.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	How do you know he organised the meetings?
A.	I would see him come about aboard his vehicle, in the company of the chairman of the MDR at our secteur level, and I could see that he was an important personality, and everybody was saying that Rwamakuba has come. 
Q.	Is that what happened on the 4th or the 5th?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, the 4th or the 5th, of course, we know was a day before the president was killed, or two days before the president was killed.  That's right, isn't it?  Before there was any emergency, if I can put it like that.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Which direction did he come from?
A.	He was coming from ******* and ****** -- and he was coming to ******.
Q.	And to get to Kigali from Ndatemwe, going that way, takes about how long?
A.	I don't have a vehicle to have tried to measure the distance or determine how long -- how much time that would take me, so I do not know.
Q.	That's your honest response.  You're a merchant with a shop in Ndatemwe.  Did you never go to Kigali?
A.	When I would go to Kigali, I would go through a place known as Kajevuba.  There was a tarmacked road, and that's the one I used and from where I took my public transport in order to go to Kigali.
Q.	Well, I'm sure you can help us.  How long do you think the journey takes, if you are in a car and you didn't have to wait for the bus, from where you are, going not via Kajevuba but the other way; do you know?
MS. FALL:
Madam President.  
Mr. Witness, please hold on a minute. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall? 
MS. FALL:
The witness has already answered whether -- that he did not know what the distance was between Ndatemwe and Kigali and that he didn't have a vehicle to be able to do that and that he had use of public transport, and so I think Mr. Hooper should be limited to asking relevant questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is sustained.  You may proceed, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you can't help us at all.  That's your final answer, is it?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Actually, Madam President, the witness had said that it was about  40 minutes if you're on the tarmacked road going to Kigali.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  And going the other way, you can't help us, would that be the fair position?  Going the way that you saw André Rwamakuba -- or you claim you saw him, coming from, you can't help us as to that?  Does that end our discussion on it? 
A.	All I know is that the road that André Rwamakuba may have used or could have used is one which makes you have to make detours in faraway hills. 
Q.	Now, you told us that when he arrived, he met other people of his party.  Do you know who those people were?  Can you name them?
A.	There was Joas Habimana, who was the chairman of the MDR in ******* secteur.  Subsequently, he became a member of the Power faction.  And then there was also ***** and Ndamage.
Q.	Were they members of the MDR?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you know if they held any position within that organisation, within that party?
A.	Joas was the chairman of the MDR at ******* secteur, but later on he changed camp and joined the Power wing.
Q.	Now, the man you saw that day you describe as wearing glasses, spectacles; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would it surprise you to know that Rwamakuba did not wear spectacles at that time, not until -- well, I won't say when -- 2000?
A.	I saw him wearing spectacles.  I saw him on -- I saw him wearing spectacles on those two occasions.  I don't know whether he didn't normally wear them, but on those two occasions when I saw him, he was indeed wearing spectacles.
Q.	And you described him as being stocky yesterday and strong; is that right?
A.	Yes, I did indeed say that he was a robust man, a stocky man. 
Q.	You told us that you didn't know, of course, what was discussed at the meeting that was held, whoever it was who was there.  You don't know what was discussed at the meeting; that afterwards there were youths who boasted of what was said.  Do you remember saying that?  Is that a fair reflection of your position?
A.	Yes.  Later on, Ndatemwe youths were boasting about that.
Q.	What were they boasting about - 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry if I interrupted the witness.   Interpreter, can you finish and I'll come back with a question?  I'm sorry.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has just said that the Ndatemwe youths were boasting about what had been said in the meetings, but that they didn't take that seriously. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What were the youths -- what were the youths boasting of?
A.	They were boasting that they had come out of meetings and that they had the plan of killing Tutsis.
Q.	Meetings or meeting?  I'm talking about the 4th or the 5th of April, that meeting the first time you saw the man in the spectacles.  You said that youths came out, boasting.  What were they boasting of?
A.	They were boasting about what I've just said.
Q.	Can you just tell us again what it was?
A.	They were boasting that they were going to kill the Tutsis. 
Q.	But you didn't take that seriously; is that right?
A.	That is why I didn't tell the investigators that that applied to me personally.  I didn't take it as an absolute truth, and that's why I didn't mention it to the investigators. 
Q.	You're an answer ahead of me, aren't you?  Why didn't you mention that to the investigators, was the question, but I put the question after the answer.  There is no mention of that perhaps important observation in your statement, is there?  No mention of anyone saying, "We're going to kill the Tutsis" in the context -- in any context, let alone of André Rwamakuba.  No mention at all, is there?
A.	I think that I mentioned that, but they didn't include it in the statement. Furthermore, the MDR Power had started killing people.
Q.	Oh, had they?  And where was that?
A.	In Gikomero commune, some people were sleeping outside of their houses.  In Bumbogo, people were attacked and forced to sleep outside their homes, because the killings had already started.  

After the split in the party, the party, together with the MRND and the CDR, began to cause trouble, in terms of security, for the people living there.
Q.	You're talking about killing people, aren't you?  And this before the 6th of April -- please wait until I finish the question.  This before the 6th of April; is that right?  People being killed by the MDR in Gikongoro before the 6th of April; is that your evidence?
A.	Yes, people were already afraid.  They would be sleeping outside their homes because they would be attacked.
Q.	Are you saying -- and I ask it once more -- people were being killed by the MDR in Gikomero before the 6th of April; yes or no?
A.	People started sleeping outside their houses because the MDR Power people were attacking them, sir.
Q.	So when these youths piled out of the meeting, saying, "We are going to kill the Tutsis," that was something you didn't believe; is that right?  That was something you took little notice of; is that right?  Because that was your evidence.
A.	I believed in it because I saw the situation obtaining at that time and I was convinced that they were going to act, sir.
Q.	Well, that's two different answers.  Let's act on your last answer.  You were convinced and you believed they were going to act on it.  Who did you report your concerns to within the commune?
A.	I didn't report to any authority in the commune, sir, because I saw that the authorities were on the side of those who were threatening us, sir.
Q.	And how did you see that?
A.	When we were attacked, the authorities never came to help us.  People were running away from their houses, and when we were attacked, for example, on the 13th, people had already been killed in the secteur of Rwamakuba.  People started already leaving their houses to come to our area, sir.
Q.	You know I'm not asking about the 13th.  You know I'm asking about events on the 4th or the 5th of April, before the president's plane was downed and when the Tutsi youths came out, saying -- the Hutus came out, saying they're going to kill the Tutsis, from this meeting, you told us.  You took it seriously, you told us.  I'm asking you then:  Who did you report it to?  You said, "I didn't because I knew the authorities were on their side."  

I'm asking you, how do you know the authorities were on their side?  That is on the 4th or the 5th of April. 
A.	Well, I saw people fleeing from the killings in the Gikomero region, but people were being killed.  They were being chased away from their properties.
Q.	Nobody was killed before the 6th, indeed, before the 7th of April.  That's right, is it not?  Do you accept that?
A.	People were already being killed in the Kigali area, in my area, indeed, because my commune was -- was an adjunct to the Kigali commune, sir.
Q.	Right.  And this was on the 4th or the 5th of April, yes?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	Or are you making this up as you go along?
MS. FALL:
Madam President.  Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, this is not a question, is it? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, it is: "Are you making this up as you go along?"
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For us, that cannot be a question, Mr. Hooper. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Fall. 
MS. FALL:
Objection to that stance of Hooper, who is rather confusing witness to answer questions.  He talks about this.  He talks about before the 5th and the 6th of April, and then he comes back and asks questions of the witness as to whether it was the 4th or 5th of April, and all that is a gimmick to confuse the witness.  I want Mr. Hooper to be clear in his questions because he comes -- or he uses a question, it leads to other questions and elicits other questions.  So that he should be clear so that the witness could give him clear answers, madam.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Well, if I can respond, it's called cross-examination, and my questions, I would have thought, had been very clear, as I hope the transcript will show.  And I'll ask him one final, clear question. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Before the president's plane was shot down, on the 4th or 5th of April, when you first saw Rwamakuba, killings had already started in your area; is that correct?  Is that your evidence, or do you want to change it?
MS. FALL:
Madam President, objection.  Objection.  The question -- the question -- the question is not clear at all.  He's asking him whether, before the 4th or the 5th April, Rwamakuba was -- he saw him, or whether the killings began before the 4th and 5th April.  That's not what the witness said.  The witness said that he did not see him before the 4th and 5th -- he saw him between 4th and 5th.  So that he should split his question; the witness will answer.   The witness cannot answer this question such as put, madam.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your question should be simpler, Hooper.  Please put witness in a situation where he can understand what you are trying to get at. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you understand my question? 
A.	Yes, I do understand your questions, sir.
Q.	Thank you.  I'm glad someone does. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  The question should be simple so that witness could clearly answer your questions, as simply as possible, so that we are able to navigate in your Q and A.
MR. HOOPER:
I know, Madam President.  I hope --
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Look, Mr. Witness, your position is this, is it not, that killings had started in your area before the president's plane was shot down?  Is that right?
A.	You asked me a question about Rwamakuba; is that correct?  Now, I told you that his party was disturbing the climate.  When there was a split in the MDR, there was no security at all in our area and in all the areas as well.  People were threatened, people were compelled to run away from their houses.  I am asking you, sir, to put questions to me concerning André Rwamakuba.  Do not dwell on anything else, sir.
Q.	May I ask you this?
A.	Let me add, sir, that killings hadn't started, because I was there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please try to answer the questions, Witness.  Questions put to you must be answered, Witness. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	On the 4th and 5th of April, Hutus came out of a meeting and you heard them boasting that they were going to kill Tutsis; is that correct?
A.	Yes, the young people in that centre boasted about that, indeed, sir.
Q.	I'm going to give you another opportunity to go through these questions.  Did you take that seriously; yes or no?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we have a problem here because this question has been put at least three times to the witness.  If witness has answered approximately, you could probably sort -- seek details, but you cannot ask the same questions all the time, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I was trying to respond to the difficulties that you've underscored and trying, in fact, to clarify, if it needed it, this witness's evidence.  But I'll move -- I'll move on.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Before I do so, I suggest to you, Mr. Witness, your accounts of events on the 4th and the 5th of April is not true. 
A.	How can you say that? 
Q.	Let me move on to the events of the 10th or the 11th of April.  You saw the man come again; is that right?
A.	Could you, sir, repeat your question? 
Q.	You saw the man come again on the 10th or the 11th of April. 
A.	That is correct, sir.
Q.	You told us it was between two and three, you thought, correct?
A.	Yes, sir, absolutely.  It was in the afternoon, sir. 
Q.	And he stayed for about an hour and a half; is that right?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	And you think he was in a white car, possibly the same car as he had come in five days earlier; is that right?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	And where did he park that car?
A.	In front of the ***** shop, sir.  In front of *****'s shop, sir.
Q.	And when bags were unloaded, as you told us they were, where were they taken to?
A.	Inside *****'s house, sir.
Q.	And is that a different place to the shop?
A.	That was his house -- let me say he had a bar, rather lower, but where the bags were unloaded, that was his house, sir.  
Q.	I'm unclear.  Was this car, you say, parked in front of the shop or the house?
A.	In front of his house, sir.
Q.	Not the shop?
A.	You have seen the photograph.  There is a house which is on the upper side of the road, on the high side of the road, and that's a big house, and he lived in that house.  And it was from that house that he sold things, commodities.  And then lower down, there was a bar, and that was a place where the bags were unloaded.  That was the place he lived.  That was in the bigger house, sir.
Q.	And it's right that in that house there was no bar; is that right?
A.	Yes, sir.  He also sold Primus in that house, sir.  He sold Primus beer.
Q.	Wasn't that house in fact his home that was also a storeroom but had no other facility?
A.	There were several rooms in that house.  He stored grains or cereals in that house also that he used to sell, sir.
Q.	And the man who came on the 10th or 11th, did he come alone or was he with somebody?
A.	Well, he came with a driver, sir.
Q.	Did he have a gendarme with him?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	Did he have a soldier with him?
A.	No, sir.
Q.	But the war had started again, hadn't it, by then; is that right?
A.	The genocide started in our area two days after.  In the region, people were running away.  The genocide had started.  People were running away, sir.
Q.	You told us that when that man arrived, all the presidents of the party were there.  I'd like you to name the presidents of the party who were there.
MS. FALL:
Madam President, objection.  Witness did not say that all the presidents of the party were there.  He said he saw two persons, Joas Habimana and Ndamage, who were authorities in the MDR.  He did not say that all the presidents of the parties were there, sir -- madam. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, is that what we heard? 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm going to see if I can find the place. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
Question from the draft transcript: "Do you know why Rwamakuba on that day went to *****'s?"  "All of the presidents or chairmen of his party were there."
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Who were the presidents or chairmen of his party?
A.	I was referring to Joas and Ndamage, that is the president or chairman of the Power wing, sir. 
Q.	I'm sorry, Ndamage --
JUDGE ARREY:
Just a minute, Mr. Hooper.  I'd like to know where you were reading from because I don't have that in my notes. 
MR. HOOPER:
I did honestly find it once.  I don't know if I'll find it again but I'll turn it up for you.  Twenty-second of April, page 8 of the draft transcript.  Can I pass it up to you?  Would that assist you? 
JUDGE ARREY:
That was yesterday? 
MR. HOOPER:
I'll pass it up to you.  I'll mark it. 
Madam Chairman, sometimes I think we may have the advantage over you and your Judges because we can get a draft, if someone helpfully goes and fetches it from the transcribers.  Here's a draft. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Hooper.  You may proceed. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And your answer, please?  Who were the presidents or chairmen who were there?  So you gave us an answer.  You said it was -- can you repeat your answer, please?
A.	I said there was all the chairmen or presidents that were there.  I said so because the Ndatemwe centre covered two secteurs.  If I said all the chairmen were there, it was not wrong because presidents of Ndatemwe and ******* were there.  The two of them were there.  So if I said all the chairmen or presidents were there, I mean the two presidents of Ndatemwe centre.  They were there, sir.
Q.	But who were they --
A.	That's the only one I was able to see.
Q.	Was who?
A.	Ndamage and Habimana, Joas, these are people I saw.
Q.	Habimana, Joas was president of ******* MDR, was he not?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	But Ndamage was just a businessman, wasn't he?
A.	No, sir, he was not a businessman.  He was a member of that party.  He was the chairman of that party, sir.
Q.	You told us yesterday, too, that he parked in front of the shop, but now you change that to the house; is that right?
A.	I just told you, sir, that he had two houses.  The first house was on the lower side.  He sold banana wine there.  And then he had another house upper, and he sold Primus beer there.  He sold cereals.  And even behind his bigger house, he had a mill.  It was a big compound that he lived in.  And he also was involved in business, sir.  Do you understand what I'm trying to say? 
Q.	I understand.  Now, you saw, from your position -- about how many metres away would you say you were away from the car when it was unloaded?  How far were you?  You may be able to demonstrate it in terms of the length of this room, for example.  When you saw the car and the sacks and the rest of it, how far were you away from that?
A.	Well, the vehicle was not very far from me.  Between myself and the vehicle, there should have been four shops, four buildings, four shops.  So that I could see what was happening there.  You can bring up the photograph that we saw the other day, and I will estimate the distance between myself and the vehicle, sir.
Q.	Well, if the Prosecution want to do that eventually, they can, but I spent half an hour with you with those photographs, and I'm not going to go back to them.  Where you sit there, in terms of this courtroom -- Mr. Witness, you don't need to concern yourself with the Prosecution at the moment.  
Mr. Witness, from where you sit there now today, how far is it --
MS. FALL:
Madam President.  Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. FALL:
May I object to that thought from Defence that is asking witness not to be concerned about me, that he should not be concerned about me.  Mr. Hooper has the eyes of a lynx -- you know, the eyes of an eagle, to see that witness is looking at me.  Kindly ask Mr. Hooper to refrain from such comments. 
MR. HOOPER:
One thing I don't have are the eyes of an eagle, I can assure you.  And I'll take the point. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is pointing at the photograph.  The interpreters don't have  the photograph.  He's trying to calculate the distance, but the interpreters don't have the photograph.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, Witness, are you in a position whence you are to tell us, in terms of the dimension of this courtroom, the distance at which the vehicle was?
THE WITNESS:
No, madam.  No, madam.  The length of this courtroom is shorter.  It is shorter.  Well, it was not too far, really.  If these photographs were well taken, I could have given you a more exact measurement.  The photograph is badly taken and I couldn't really give you, you know, length. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Witness, Mr. GII, you can see me from where you are, can't you?  Yes?
A.	Yes, sir, I can see you.
Q.	Were you as far?
MS. FALL:
Madam President.  Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Fall. 
MS. FALL:
The witness has already answered.  He has said he couldn't quantify the distance.  The witness was pointing at the photograph.  Probably, we could have it on the screen so that the witness can tell us exactly where he was. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we spent half an hour on where the witness was, yesterday, and it wasn't a great help. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the answer is yes or no or don't know.  Where you sit there, you can see me, can't you?  Were you -- if I was the car that day, were you as far away as I am from you or were you further away?  Were you as far as from me to Ms. Fall, who I can just about see down there, or were you further than that?  Just try and help us, if you can.  If you can't help us at all, then say so. 
A.	The distance separating myself and the vehicle was four to five times the distance between us right now, Counsel.  Listen --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Now the witness is pointing.  "This is where the animals were," says the witness.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm going to let that be clarified, if need be, by the Prosecutor.  I'm going to move on and for the record suggest that you are about 15 metres from me.  If I'm wrong about that, I'll be corrected.  And you're suggesting you're four times that distance, which is 60 metres.  And I'll leave the position there. 
A.	That's not correct, no.  Let's say -- well, it's still an estimation.  I would say 40 metres.
Q.	Very well.  And you saw some bags.  I see from your statement that you say -- what kind of bags did they look like to you?  You say in your statement, for example, "plastic bags, the kind normally used for rice."  Third paragraph, in English.  Is that right?  Were those the sort of bags you saw?
A.	They were like bags.  They were white.
Q.	Were they like -- were they the kind normally used for rice?
A.	The bags were smaller, smaller than the average bag.  But I didn't go close, and that's all I can tell you about them.
Q.	You say in your statement, "in plastic bags, the type usually used for rice."  Is that right or not?
MS. FALL:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like for Mr. Hooper to specify where in the statement he is reading from.  There's only one statement, and I'm not able to see exactly where reference is being made.
MR. HOOPER:
It was really one page.  It's not difficult to find. 
MS. FALL:
My mistake.  Pardon me, Madam President, I have located the passage.  I'm sorry. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Please proceed.  We've had the answer. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And the answer is ...  I feel like a television host doing that.  The answer is what?  We had the answer, I thought.  I thought the voice came from the booth that we'd had an answer.  I'm just asking what the answer was, please.  

Now I've got it wrong.  I've got the wires crossed, all right.  

Mr. Witness, in your statement, you refer to, "plastic bags, the kind normally used for rice."   Is that correct or not?
A.	I said that the bags looked like the type you normally put rice in, just to indicate more or less the size of those bags.  They weren't very large. 
Q.	And why did you count them so that you remembered them years later?  Why did you count them?
A.	I could see the place clearly.  I saw them start to offload them, and when they were offloading them, I counted them.  I didn't forget.  I didn't forget the number, because later on, after the bags were distributed, I noticed that machetes were inside.  That is why I kept these things in memory.
Q.	And where did the bags come from in the car that you so clearly remember?
A.	They were in the back of the vehicle.
Q.	Yesterday, you said they were in the boot of the vehicle; is that right?  

And, please, I don't see why this should be interrupted. 
A.	Yes, it's the same place.  I don't know those technical words.  I don't know if it was in the boot or -- I don't know how you call that.  I just know it was in the back.
Q.	Well, you know what the boot of a car is, don't you?  Or are you saying you don't?
A.	Yes, I know that that exists, and that is the same place that I wanted to talk about.  Thank you.
Q.	And in your statement you say you see the bags on the back seat.  Do you remember saying that to the investigator?
A.	No, that is not what I said.
Q.	And the investigator got that wrong, too?
A.	Yes, that's what they said, but they misunderstood me.
MS. FALL:
I think if we refer to what was said before, we look at the question, and the witness answered the question, he said it was in the back of the vehicle.  The interpreter said "boot".  Later on, they even said -- they came back and said, did the interpreters, "The witness said, 'in the back of the vehicle' and we translated it as 'boot'."  We need to be more explicit, that when he took up his interpretation again that we realised that he was speaking about the boot.  

I just wanted to underscore that for the Court, Madam President.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it's all on the transcript, and I'm happy to move on. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would it be right to say that you're not in a position to say with certainty that the bags you later saw on the 13th were necessarily the same bags as you saw on the 10th or the 11th?
A.	No, they're the same ones, the same ones.  Because when they were taken out, I saw them.  It was on the 13th.  Those bags looked exactly like the ones that I had seen prior to that.
Q.	Did you know what the position was -- in fact, I'm moving on to another subject.  I don't know if that's, looking at the clock, an appropriate moment.  And I suspect I've got about an hour, perhaps a little more, with the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall take the break now.  These proceedings are adjourned for 15 minutes. 
	(Court recessed from 1115H to 1139H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
These proceedings are resumed.  

Mr. Hooper, you may proceed. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Just one residual question.  Had you ever seen bags such as bags of rice being taken into *****'s house on any previous occasion?
A.	The bags that I saw in the vehicle are the bags that were offloaded and brought to *****'s.  I never saw any other similar bags brought to *****'s house.
Q.	But didn't ***** use that house as a storeroom for his commercial goods?  Wasn't it quite normal for such goods to be taken to his house?  There's two questions there, but perhaps you can address them both, if that's possible. 
A.	In fact, he saw -- he sold beans and sorghum.  These were not small bags that contained beans or sorghum.
Q.	But they could have contained rice, that sort of bag; is that right?
A.	No, he did not sell rice, no.  His shop sold foodstuffs, and usually that type of food is kept in large bags.
Q.	And whose was the windmill?
A.	His mill belonged --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, could you please repeat your question?  We did not get the translation. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Who owned the windmill?
A.	The mill belonged to *****.
Q.	And what did he mill there?
A.	The mill was used for different types -- to mill different types of materials or goods brought by the locals.

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, do you have the map, the green map or sketch, in front of you?  If not, can you have it, please? 

Do you understand that, that sketch, that plan? 
A.	I can see that it puts down the different secteurs in Gikomero commune.
Q.	And do you understand that where it's green, it's trying to demonstrate the hills, the highland, as opposed to the lower land, which remains in white?  Do you understand that? 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, Madam President, I believe that if we want to use this document, it would be good for --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness --
MS. FALL:
Perhaps we should ask the witness to stop. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when Madam Fall rises to her feet to object, you must stop for a moment, and then the floor will be given back to you. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry, I did not see her, Madam President. 
MS. FALL:
For all of us to be able to follow clearly, perhaps we should put this map on to the projector, the overhead, so that we can see exactly which areas Mr. Hooper is making reference to. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, does that proposition seem reasonable to you? 
MR. HOOPER:
It doesn't help me but --
MS. FALL:
Madam President, pardon me.
MR. HOOPER:
If everyone wants it on the screen, that's not a problem, but then it occupies the screen.  If we've all got it and if there are sufficient copies, I'm not going to ask this witness to point to it.  It's a difficult exercise, I realise, getting witnesses to do that.  So we can see it.  And I understand he can read and he's identified and recognised that there are secteur names here, and with, I hope, reasonable assistance from me, we should be all right.  That's all right. 

MS. FALL:
Madam President, I want to take advantage of this opportunity to underscore the provenance of this document.  This is a document that we received only when Mr. Hooper decided to give it to us.  I would like to ask where the document comes from, and I insist that we put it on the overhead projector so that we know exactly what questions are being put to the witness and which areas are being referred to. 
MR. HOOPER:
	Well, let's put it on the overhead projector.  I have no problem with that. 

In terms of its provenance, you may remember in the last session before Christmas, when Mr. Upendra, I think, gave evidence, we were left in our book with a difficult map, in my experience, to follow, and I asked Mr. Upendra if it was possible for the United Nations resources to produce a map that was both legible and helpful, and we haven't had anything.  He did say he would produce one.  This -- the provenance of this map is reasonably reliable, in as much as I drew it.  It's been extracted from a tourist map.  It reflects, as best I can, my experience of the area as well.  I've shown it to locals who, in the main, tend to agree with it.  I don't vouch for its entire accuracy because the road system is relatively complex, and before I rely on this map, I want to point out that because the road system is important in this case, that it's, I hope, a fair representation of the general geography and in an area that's fairly complex, I hope it assists the witness as well as the Judges and indeed perhaps the Prosecution. 

I should point out that there are limitations inasmuch as I could have demonstrated the difference between tarmac and non-tarmac, and I'm afraid that came as an afterthought.  So all the roads are in red.  You will discern that on the main roads, such as the road that runs along the bottom from left to right, on which the name Kanombe appears, for example, that's slightly thicker line -- it's difficult to discern -- than the smaller roads that lead from it.  And similarly the road that leads from Kigali which is in the bottom left-hand corner and goes up to Kajevuba and up from there, as you may know, to Byumba and Uganda, that road is also wider marked, and that also is tarmacked.  Those roads are tarmac, and we know that because Mr. Upendra told us.  All the other roads -- all the other roads indicated on this plan, with perhaps one exception, for a small area, are, in fact, unmade roads.  Now, as we progress, I have a facility to correct this plan as and when it becomes necessary.  It's a simplistic -- it's a sketch.  It's not a map.  I wouldn't recommend going walking with it, for example, on these hills, but it may assist.  And the real purpose here is really to demonstrate the upland/lowland area and the relative position, and I mean relative, of the various secteurs, which are in bold print. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President? 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Fall. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I am opposed to this because, based on Mr. Hooper's own statements, when he says that this is not a reliable map, I don't know how we can use the map.  If it is unreliable, I don't know how we can use it, especially since I don't know if Mr. Hooper is a cartographer or not and if he can exactly specify which areas he wants to make reference to.  Honestly, I don't think that this map can be used as evidence in this case. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
This map isn't going to be evidence.  This map is a sketch.  It's an aid.  It's to assist us all so that you can see looking at it clearly where ****** is in relation to ******* relatively, to Kayanga, to Gikomero, and that is accurate.  And if there are any inaccuracies in this, the Prosecution, I'm sure, can quickly correct and point them out.  That's not a difficulty.  I introduce this map as a fair representation of the area.  I have underscored, I hope, that there may be, as any sketch will of this area, be perhaps some matters that may need correction.  I don't think so; otherwise I wouldn't have presented the map as it is.  If that's the case, we can do it.  I think for the purpose of the exercise, which is to assist a witness to help us, then this map, which is relatively simple, will discharge that.  Certainly nothing inappropriate about using a sketch.  The fact that it's come from the Defence as opposed to the sketches that we've had so far, which have not been particularly helpful, I'm sure isn't itself a criticism.  I hope the fact that it comes from my hand isn't a criticism at all.  I think it will expedite matters as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Fall? 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would like to come back to my objection, in the sense that if we consider that this is only to facilitate matters and it's not an exact representation, I think that given the level of education of the witness this may be problematic.  Mr. Hooper just said that these are hills, all of the green representations are hills, but we have no idea which hills he's making reference to.  So I think that this may be a source of problems for the witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, may I just indicate the hills are indicated, most of them are named, by secteur, as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  If we have understood you, you want to submit this sketch, which you yourself drew up and which you do not intend to tender in the -- for the record. 

We are going to ask the witness if he can find his way around this sketch, if it is possible for him to answer the questions by looking at this sketch.  If he cannot do so, he should state as much. 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot find my way about this sketch.  All I've known is that there are names of secteurs, which are secteurs of Gikomero commune.  As for the rest, I wouldn't be able to know my way around this sketch, given the other information we've been dealing with.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ask your question, Mr. Hooper, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I ask the witness to look at P. 3 again and at the map of Gikomero at page K0276228?  And seeing that, Mr. Witness, can you read enough to be able to read that map?  Does that map help you?  Can you help us, please? 
A.	I don't know how to interpret maps.
Q.	All right. 
A.	I can see where ******** centre is mentioned, Gikomero, but otherwise, I can't find my way around on this.
Q.	All right.  Well, I'm going to ask you questions, and let's take the maps from you, but I'm going to look at my green map because it helps me relatively, and we'll see how we go. 

I want to ask you about the 10th/11th of April.  Now, first of all, you can't help us better, can you, as to which day it was that the man in the white car came with the bags?  You can't help us better as to which one of those two days it was; is that right?
A.	I didn't know why the bags were being offloaded.  I didn't think about remembering the date.  But later on, since April 1994, after four years, I was asked questions, and I gave an approximate date.  I think that I said that it was around the 10th or 11th.  I think it was between the 10th and 11th, and that's what I said.
Q.	Indeed, you did.  And you made a statement to a man called Mr. Sidibe in 1998, six years ago, and four years after these events.  Can I ask you this?  Can you help me as to any reason there might be in your mind as to why the Prosecution investigator came to you?  How did he happen to come to you?  Can you help me with that? 
A.	I saw them arrive, but I couldn't tell you how they were able to reach me.
Q.	Had someone sent them to you, as far as you know?  Why did he come to your door?  Any idea at all? 
A.	I didn't know.  I saw them show up.  They put questions to me, and they wanted the information that I had.
Q.	Can you remember what the questions were that were put to you? 
A.	The information that I'm giving to you.  Now you are aware of that information as well.
Q.	Now, by the 10th of April, four days after the president's plane was shot down, is it right that the war had started again? 
A.	Are you speaking of the 10th and 11th, Counsel?  I didn't completely understand your question, Counsel.
Q.	By the 10th or 11th of April, had the war started again? 
A.	At that time, people were fleeing; for example, some people who lived in Gikomero commune.
Q.	And what were they fleeing? 
A.	They were fleeing the killings.
Q.	And where were the killings that you heard of on the 10th or 11th of April?  Where were those? 
A.	In some parts of Gikomero commune, near the area that goes towards Kigali.
Q.	Now, Butare commune, a separate commune to Gikomero, is on the other side of the valley from ********, is it not? 
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Did you know that the RPF army had taken that area by the 10th of April?  Is that something you knew, or not? 
A.	I did not know that, sir.  When the war started, we were told to stay at home.  That is after the downing of the president's plane; that is, President Habyarimana's plane, sir.
Q.	By the 10th or 11th, did you know where the RPF army had reached? 
A.	No, sir, I did not.
Q.	Did you have a radio? 
A.	Yes, sir, I had a radio, sir.
Q.	Did you listen to it?
A.	Yes, sir.  At certain times, I did; at other times, I did not, sir.
Q.	Did you listen to the RPF radio station as well as Radio Rwanda? 
A.	No, sir.  I listened to Radio Rwanda programmes, sir.
Q.	Did you never listen to the RPF radio? 
A.	No, sir.
Q.	As a Tutsi, you weren't interested to listen to what perhaps the other side was saying?  Is that right? 
A.	No, sir.  It was not easy to catch those programmes in our area.  When you tried to tune in, you couldn't, sir.
Q.	Is it right that Gikomero, the entire commune, was within a United Nations weapons-free zone?  Was that something you knew or not? 
A.	I don't know, sir.  I did not.
Q.	Did you ever hear of any restrictions in moving weapons, including machetes, for example? 
A.	Who would have given those instructions?  Who would have made such orders, sir? 
Q.	Did you ever hear such a thing announced on the radio, for example? 
A.	No, sir.  I didn't hear such an announcement.  All that was said was that people should stay at home, sir.
Q.	Did you know if it was difficult or not to get from where you were to Kigali, on the 10th or 11th of April?  Did you know anything about that?  
A.	Well, at that time, nobody could move.  We were told, at any rate, on the radio, it was announced that nobody should leave home, one should stay at home.  This is what was said over the radio.
Q.	Did you see many vehicles using the road? 
A.	Well, in our area, there was a countryside.  There was not a lot of vehicles out there in the countryside, sir.
Q.	Does anyone have a machete there?
A.	Well, people do have machetes.  Each family has a machete, and machetes are used to cut bananas, to cut wood, firewood, for example, sir.
Q.	You told us that there had been instructions, that *****, Ndamage, Habimana, had instructed people at *****'s home.  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, sir, I do.
Q.	What instructions were given at *****'s home that you heard?  Because I appreciate you weren't there.  What were these instructions? 
A.	Well, he and the people I already mentioned, following that meeting, the ******** youth, were boasting, they were talking loud.  I saw that there were people coming in and going out, and so on and so forth, sir.
Q.	What instructions are you saying -- which date are you talking about, sir?  Can you tell me? 
A.	I told you, sir, that when Rwamakuba came, that was the 4th and the 5th.  And then later, that was the 10th/11th-ish, it was at that time that those people were there.  Now, in the other afternoons, there were little groups here and there.  You saw meetings being held here and there, sir. 
Q.	But these instructions at *****'s home, when did those occur? 
A.	At the dates I mentioned, sir.  Then later, for the other days in the afternoons, there were people around, and they had little meetings here and there, sir.
Q.	But your evidence was that there were instructions and it happened quite often, and I'm just asking you what instructions are you talking about? 
A.	Well, they taught them how to attack Tutsi with machetes, and machetes were distributed, sir.
Q.	And how do you know that, that instruction was given? 
A.	Yes, sir.  Instructions were given at *****'s.  There were no meetings.  On the 14th, after having distributed machetes, he ordered people to go out attacking people with machetes.  Usually one doesn't attack people with machetes, but at that particular time, it was done, sir.
Q.	That was on the 14th, was it? 
A.	Thirteenth, 13th, sir, April 13th.
Q.	Sorry, there may have been a mistranslation or perhaps you -- a slip of the tongue.  You said in evidence --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	You said in evidence people were coming out saying one day they would kill the Tutsi.  I come back to that in this context. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, could you just bear with us so that we get the translation? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda interpreter says that he did not hear what the witness was saying because Mr. Hooper and the witness were talking at the same time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you repeat your response, your answer, please? 
THE WITNESS:
Which answer are you referring to? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The answer you've just given. 
THE WITNESS:
You asked me what day was it that machetes were distributed.  I said it was on the 13th.  It was on that day that ***** gave orders that the killings start, and he gave those orders at the time machetes were being distributed, sir. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, could you proceed?  Please just mark a little, one, two seconds, so that we have the answers clearly.
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly, Madam President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You spoke in your evidence about ***** and the others giving instructions, and you had said that it happened quite often.  And you were asked what happened quite often, and in that context, you said, "People were coming out saying one day they would kill Tutsi."  Do you remember saying that?
A.	Yes, sir.  Those young people were saying that.  They were boasting about it. 
Q.	When was the first that you heard that boast? 
A.	Well, I heard it on the 11th, on the 11th, sir.  Even usually the environment wasn't good, there was tension, people were scared, they thought they were going to be killed, because people were saying it loud, sir.
Q.	Were there any road barriers at ********?
A.	On the 13th, they started erecting roadblocks to stop people.  They did.
Q.	Now, you told us that you didn't know what was in the bags until you saw them being distributed on the 13th.  What time was that?  Can you remember? 
A.	It was in the morning, sir.
Q.	Was it very early in the morning?  Can you help us with the time? 
A.	At about 8, 9 a.m.
Q.	And had you opened your shop in order to -- well, had you opened your shop by then?
A.	No, sir.  I was no longer in business at that time.  I spent the night there just to guard my property.  I was thinking that one day peace will come back, sir.
Q.	So you slept in your shop on the night of the 12th; is that right? 
A.	Yes, sir.  I slept in my shop.
Q.	Were you quite alone? 
A.	I don't -- I don't remember.  There was a young brother of mine that came from time to time to spend the night with me, but on that particular night, I really don't remember whether he was there or not.
Q.	What time did you flee ********?
A.	I ran away on the 13th, sir.
Q.	What time? 
A.	It was during the time that the machetes were being distributed.  I saw that machetes were being taken out of bags and I went behind the house and I left.  I ran away, sir.
Q.	And where did you go straight away? 
A.	I went to alert my family.  They were not very far away.  And then immediately all of us ran away, sir.
Q.	Can you just help me, in relation to ********, did your family live closer to ****** or closer to *******?  
A.	Rather closer to ******* but not too far away from ********, sir.
Q.	And having gone to your family -- by your family, do you mean your parents? 
A.	My sisters, sir.  My sisters were there, and my elder brother, sir.
Q.	Was anyone in your immediate family killed? 
A.	No, sir.  My family members that were with me at that time ran away with me, but some neighbours were killed there, sir.
Q.	In ********, do you know, during that period of genocide, how many Tutsis were killed, Tutsis that you knew?  How many do you say were killed? 
A.	There was an old lady with her three boys.  The soldiers were told that those people were Inyenzi.  The two of them were very badly beaten.  They were admitted into hospital.  And at around the 9th or the 10th, they were really beaten up and they were admitted into hospital.  Now, two people went to the hospital to give them assistance at the hospital.
Q.	Were those two people --
A.	So that they had two nurses or guards with them at the hospital.
Q.	Were those two people who were beaten up and then taken to the hospital, were they called Rutembeza and Rutembyu? 
A.	Yes, sir, those two people did.
Q.	And I'll spell those names:  R-U-T-E-M-B-E-Z-A, Rutembeza; and Rutembyu, R-U-T-E-M-B-Y-U.

And is it right that those two Tutsis, inhabitants of ********, as far as you heard, were later killed? 
A.	They were taken to Kayanga hospital.  When the war erupted on the 13th, they found them at the hospital.  They were killed at the hospital.  They were killed with their nurse or their guard.  There was another one called Gakumba, whose wife and children were also killed.  There were also members of his family that ran away with Gakumba's family and the people from *******.  There were many people that were killed on that day.  I can remember some of the names of victims.
Q.	Let me put this to you, then:  Is it right that only the two people that I've named, Rutembeza and Rutembyu, both Tutsis, were the only Tutsis from ******** -- understand the question, from ******** -- who were killed during this period?  Is that right or wrong?
A.	You're quite correct, because other Tutsi ran away when they heard about the killings that took place the 13th.  They ran away, sir.  And there was Ndeze who was killed, and other Tutsi ran away to Vugavuge, a place called Vugavuge.  There was an old lady who was a neighbour; she was called Kankindi.
Q.	Let me come back to the question.  Rutembeza and Rutembyu, were the only two Tutsi inhabitants of ******** who were killed in this period; is that right or wrong?  Yes or no? 
A.	Those were the only people that were very near, very close to us, that were killed.  They were beaten so badly, and then we found them at the hospital, and then the soldiers killed them.
Q.	Yes. 
A.	The soldiers, first of all, beat them up and then they were taken to hospital and then later on they were killed.
Q.	Those two Tutsis were -- belonged to a?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Those two Tutsis, Rutembeza and Rutembyu, belonged to a Christian sect known as the Pentacolists (phonetic), and is it right that they had gone to church and breached the curfew and were then seen by soldiers and beaten up?  Was that, as you know, the history? 
A.	No, sir.  No, sir.  That is not true.  They were reported by ***** because they were at a neighbour's, a neighbour that is called Rusagara.  They were arrested and beaten up very severely, and the other Christians took them to the hospital.  And they left with their elder brother and their sister.  With the eruption of the war, that was on the 13th, they were found at that hospital and they were killed there.  They were killed by *****'s group.  They were killed by *****'s group.
Q.	You weren't there, of course, to see any of that; is that right? 
A.	They were beaten in front of *****'s house.  I was in my house but I could see them.  I was getting scared myself, because I thought they were also going to kill me after, after that.
Q.	And what date would that be, sir? 
A.	I told you that it was around the 10th, sir, probably one or two days, give and take, before the 13th.  That was when they came and started destroying our houses, sir.
Q.	So, having seen these two beaten up, as you tell us, and fearing they would attack you, why didn't you leave then? 
A.	Well, I had my belongings that I had to keep, and I said to myself, "Where can I go?"  I didn't have anywhere to run to.
Q.	Was there at one time a FAR Rwandese army position near ********? 
A.	Well, their positions were at Vugavuge's secteur office at ******.  That's where their positions were.
Q.	And do you know how long they held that position? 
A.	Sir, I know that the soldiers' positions were there for a very long time, sir.
Q.	Do you know when they left that position? 
A.	They ran away with the Inkotanyi's advance.  They confronted the Inkotanyi and then later on they retreated and fled, sir.
Q.	And, in fact, was that on the 13th? 
A.	Thirteenth of which month, sir? 
Q.	The 13th of April. 
A.	I said that the distribution of machetes was carried out on the 13th, sir.
Q.	Did the FAR army position, ******, that you've just been talking about, which retreated in the face of the RPF advance, did that retreat take place on the 13th of April? 
A.	No, sir, they were there on the 13th. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, may I object to this line of questioning in as far as, first of all, it is not -- it is not in the examination-in-chief of the witness?  Therefore, several questions that are being raised are outside the framework of that examination-in-chief.  I believe that it's too much now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you like to respond, Mr. Hooper, to Mrs. Fall's objection? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, this witness seemed to be talking about this retreat.  It happens to be my case it was the 13th.  So I think I'm entitled to put that question as part of my case.  But also, the defendant (sic) displayed or appeared to be displaying some knowledge of it.  I think he may have come back to saying -- or clarified his position by saying he doesn't know, in which case I can't take it further.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Would you like to add something, Mrs. Fall? 
MS. FALL:
Simply that the witness answered vis-à-vis the question.  He didn't say anything about retreating Rwandan Armed Forces; said that when the Inkotanyi came, the Rwandan Armed Forces left.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection accepted. 

You may proceed, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Between eight and nine o'clock, you saw the distribution of machetes that causes you to flee.  Were these bags brought out of *****'s home? 
A.	Yes.  I ran away from my house, having seen the machetes being distributed.
Q.	I suppose you didn't stay very long to see what was going on, having seen people being handed machetes.  Would that be fair? 
A.	That's why I was telling you that I ran away immediately.
Q.	And the bags that these machetes were taken from, was the position this:  That those bags merely looked very much alike the bags you'd seen earlier?  Was that the position? 
A.	Yes, sir.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The question, Mr. Hooper, what was it? 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Was the position this:  That the bags that you saw the machetes being taken from looked very much alike to the bags you'd seen or say you'd seen on the 10th or 11th? 
A.	That is correct, sir. 
Q.	Because on that occasion, you were still what, 40 or 50 metres away from what you were looking at?  On both occasions when you saw the bags, they were 40 or 50 metres away from you, were they not?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you're repeating the same question.  I believe the witness has already answered this question. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it's in a second context of the 13th I'm asking it now and confirming that that's the position. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that right, Witness? 
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I wish to correct what Mr. Hooper said, that it was between 40 and 50 metres.  The witness, in this specific case, had said that it was 40 metres, 4-0.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that right, Mr. Witness, that you were, on both occasions, 40 metres away from any bag? 
A.	Yes.  I was in front of my house.
Q.	Have you ever become aware of any killings in your area that were committed by RPF troops? 
A.	No.  I didn't get to know any such killings.  When the RPF came, it was in order to save people and not to kill them.
Q.	So you've never heard of any killings or suggestions of killings by the RPF in Gikomero?  And by "Gikomero," I mean Gikomero commune, including your area. 
A.	The RPF never killed anyone.  It was Habyarimana's soldiers who were killing members of the CDR, and the Power-CDR wing were the ones who were killing.
Q.	It's my case, you see, sir, is that there were killings and that you joined in and participated in killing people who had been your neighbours. 
A.	I was being pursued.  I could not go and kill in my own turn. 
Q.	When you -- when -- I'll return to that in some more detail, as I'm duty-bound to.  But when you fled on the 13th, where did you get to that day? 
A.	I fled to a place known as Kajevuba.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You cannot accuse the witness in such a manner before the Trial Chamber.  The Chamber will not admit such questions.  You cannot just get up and say that he killed people.
MR. HOOPER:
Let me -- I appreciate your authority, Madam President.  I will return to it in a moment and we can perhaps raise the issue then.  The witness has just replied that he got Kajevuba on the 13th. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What time did you get there, sir?  Can you remember? 
A.	I reached Kajevuba at about ten.
Q.	So it follows you got there very quickly?
A.	It would take you about 40 minutes to walk from my home.  It's not very far.
Q.	And did you take the road? 
A.	No.  I took the village footpaths.
Q.	And you met no obstacle on the way? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did your parents escape too? 
A.	I didn't have any parents.  I was with my little brothers and my sisters.
Q.	I appreciate your parents were living a little way away, but did they escape too, make their own way somewhere safely or what?
A.	No.  My parents were already deceased at the time.
Q.	Then I may have misunderstood, and I have misunderstood your answers yesterday.  And aside from the two people who were beaten up and taken to the hospital, all the other Tutsis in ******** escaped also, didn't they? 
A.	The other Tutsis also fled when they saw the machetes being distributed.
Q.	So the answer is yes, all the other Tutsis escaped as well?  The answer is yes, is it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And what about the Tutsis of ******?  Did they all escape too? 
A.	Yes.  But let me add that, at the time, after the machetes were distributed, the Power faction members went to attack them.  When they reached the place, there was a military commander who repelled them and stopped them from killing the local population.  I was not present, but they told us that they went to attack Maniragaba and Rukigama's (phonetic) houses, and the soldiers shot in the air and that is how the attackers turned back.
Q.	And those soldiers, FAR soldiers, were led by a Tutsi officer; is that right? 
A.	No.  I don't know anything about that, but they did say that he was a very pleasant man who said that the Tutsis must be killed.
Q.	So all the Tutsis but two in ******** and ****** fled and were not killed?
A.	Yes.  There were only four Tutsis who were killed.  Another Tutsi known as Augustin Ntidendereza was killed, and that makes it five.  As for the others, they were able to escape death because they had fled.
Q.	And where did you first meet the RPF? 
A.	I believe they reached my area on the 15th.
Q.	Where did you first meet them?  When and where did you first meet them? 
A.	When we reached Kajevuba, we started to hide in the bushes, and on the 15th the Inkotanyi came by there as they were on their way to Kigali.  When the local people saw them, they fled, and when we realised that the killers had left, we went close by our houses.  And when the Inkotanyi came back the second time around, that's when they took us and led us to Butare.
Q.	Was it not the case that Kajevuba was in RPF hands by the 10th or 11th, already there, well before you went there on the 13th?  Isn't that right? 
A.	No.  At that time the RPF was still on the Byumba side.
Q.	All right.  Does the name Samuel Nsengiyumva mean anything to you?  That's Samuel Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A? 
MS. FALL:
	Madam President, I would like to raise an objection.  This is one of the questions concerning the RPF positions, and I do not believe the witness is able to answer such questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, he said no to the question when I put it that the RPF were already there by the time he got there.  He said no, which was the thrust of the question.  And he's answered it in that way.  I haven't other questions to ask him in respect of the RPF positions.  And I had moved on to a name, Samuel Nsengiyumva. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you've had a little time to think about that now.  Now, does it mean anything to you?
A.	Yes.  I know that individual.
Q.	Was he a friend of yours? 
A.	He was Joas Habimana's son.  He was not my friend.  He was one of those persons who destroyed my house.  He was one of the killers. 
Q.	Was his mother a Tutsi? 
A.	I don't know anything about that.
MS. FALL:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mrs. Fall? 
MS. FALL:
I am really trying not to interrupt.  I must, however, object, because Mr. Hooper is going well beyond the scope of the examination-in-chief, and I do believe that it would be in order to ask him to stay within that scope, because he's wandering too far away. 
MR. HOOPER:
I can contribute a response to that which may assist. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper?  Your response? 
MR. HOOPER:
This is my last area, and I'll be closing my cross-examination very shortly.  It's relevant because it's my case and because I have a duty to put allegations to a witness, to confront the witness with any allegations, and that's what I propose to do. 

And can the witness remove his earphones, please, at this point?  I think he's heard quite enough.  I'm sure he knows what's coming. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you remove your headphones, Mr. Witness, please? 
MR. HOOPER:
I have statements from people who implicate this man in the murder of several people, in the events after the 13th of April, on this hill, on this area, when there was, on the Defence case, widespread slaughter of local Hutus by the RPF, starting on the 13th and continuing for at least two months.  It's the Defence case that several thousand Hutus in this area were murdered, that there was widespread revenge, recrimination and just wholesale slaughter.  That's the Defence case.  That goes to a separate issue.  But as far as this particular witness is concerned,  if I have, as I have, statements from people who have implicated him, who I may call in due course, then I'm duty-bound to put those allegations to him and I would be criticised if I didn't.  I certainly would deserve to be criticised if, on a future occasion, I made or a witness made such a statement in their evidence and I had not put it to this witness.  And there is good authority for that, which I quoted earlier.  I can produce it again if you wish it.  Recently touched upon in the Kamuhanda case, paragraph 2, I think, 82 of the judgement, but I may have got those figures round about the wrong way.  And under the Rules, I can also put to the witness matters, of course, that arise by way of positive case, which is the position here, under Rule 90.  I'll just try and get the -- that's under 90(F)(ii), which was introduced, I think, at a later -- after the introduction of these Rules because of the concern of the then President of the Tribunal, Judge Pillay, that in case after case, the case for the Defence was not being put to witnesses, and I know that she expressed such a concern and certainly at the time, as I understand it, of her tenure of the office, this Rule, by coincidence perhaps, I know not, was introduced.  It reflects the system in most common law systems, but not in America for some reason, that you have a duty to put your case so that the parties know what you're saying, the witness has an opportunity to deal with it, and the judge better sees the geography of the case.  That duty isn't expressed under the Rules of the ICTR, but that particular section, as I understand it, was later introduced in order to embrace that.  And as I say, there was clear reference in the case of Kamuhanda, where, by coincidence, Witness -- well, Witness GK, who may become familiar to you in this Court, did not have a matter the Judges considered pertinent put to her, which is the Defence case.  And to some extent, or expressly, there was criticism in the judgement -- you can see that -- for the failure of the Defence to put that matter to her. 

In this case, here is a witness who says that there was absolutely no killing done by the RPF at all, in answer to my question, who will maintain that he has clean hands, I'm sure, and is responsible for no wrong-doing.  So it comes under that and the earlier section in respect of potential credibility.  I have five names of people, specific -- five -- six names of people who we say this witness was directly implicated in their killing. 
MS. FALL:
Madam President?  Madam President, by your leave, I wish to raise an objection regarding Mr. Hooper's continuation in this line of questioning.  It is true that Rule 90 bis -- 90(D) says that the --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, the interpreter did not get the rule to which counsel is referring. 

MS. FALL:
The witness has answered, and I do believe that we are not here to try the RPF.  We are to abide by what information is in the indictment, and I do not think it is the time nor the place to put such questions to this witness.  And in any case, regarding the statements which -- the statements to which counsel is referring are not in the possession of the Prosecutor, and I wish that he should no longer be allowed to continue in this line of questioning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Judge Lattanzi has the floor. 
JUDGE LATTANZI:
Mr. Hooper, I would like you to explain to us how, through these questions, you are going to be checking on the credibility of this witness, because you know that, according to the Rules of Procedure, he may refuse to say anything which may incriminate him.  So I have some doubt how are you going to be able -- through this line of questioning, are you going to be able to challenge his credibility?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the witness has, of course, as we know, a right of silence.  The Court can request him to answer.  But ultimately it must remain physically a matter for him. 

In terms of credibility, if you have a witness before you who has murdered -- and you frequently do in these cases -- then that must be an issue of credibility and of concern.  I don't think I can really say more than that.  I'd say that it's plain on the face of it that it would go to an issue of credibility. 

There is some secondary issues that lead from this as well, and that is that -- and I'd like to make my position plain.  This isn't some kind of revisionist posture, I hope, that I'm assuming on behalf of the Accused.  I accept that there were widespread and terrible atrocities aimed at the Tutsis as a group, and indeed that also occurred in areas of Gikomero commune, but there was an aftermath too, and in some ways, it's our case that Gikomero was an exemplar of that, and that there was widespread killing of Hutus in which local Tutsis, some of them, joined in pillaging and the rest.  And it's also our case that because of that, there has been a degree of effort on the part of some authorities to cover up those killings, sometimes to make false allegations against others, and even that there has been a group that have been particularly active in respect of that.  So there is a number of issues here. 

There is further issues as well that lead from this, but I won't say more at present. 

I should also perhaps take -- can I take the opportunity just to briefly point out that when you look at Rule 90(G), the English and the French may have slightly different -- there is a slightly different balance, and I would merely say that looking at the English, and that may be the wider, that where there is that discrepancy, as you know, the Rule is that it's to favour the discrepancy that favours the Accused should follow but there is certainly perhaps some looseness of language there between the two.  Or I'm led to believe that by Mr. O'Shea, who isn't here to assist me this morning, but having gone through it slowly -- and I see nodding -- there is a difference there, or there may be.  I'm not saying that there necessarily is.  There may be.  It's an argument that we came to anticipate.  But there we are, we haven't met. 
JUDGE ARREY:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, I'm looking at the English version so I don't know under which Rule -- I have seen the English -- that you can now cross-examine this witness on alleged murders that he's supposed to have committed just because you have witnesses who have made statements to that effect.  So under which section of the Rule are you going to pose those questions to him?  You yourself have said that under the common law system in America, it's not allowed.  I am more used to the British common law of justice, as you are, so I don't know how you can cross-examine this witness on murders that he's alleged to have committed, because that didn't come in the examination-in-chief and you can't even say it goes on his credibility. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
JUDGE ARREY:
I don't think you can bring that under credibility.  I don't see how.
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Well, looking at G(i), "Cross-examination shall be limited to the subject matter of the evidence-in-chief."  That is the -- a basic rule of practice, as I understand it, in many states in the United States, not necessarily of all.  And as I understand it, that rule is limited to practice in the United States, in some of the states, maybe most of them, in fact.  It then goes on, "and matters affecting the credibility of the witness."  And I think our two common law jurisdictions, inasmuch as America, one, and the rest of the world, I think matters affecting the credibility of the witness are also matters that can be properly be the subject of cross-examination.  And there would be generally little difference, I would have thought, in how that's approached. 

If a witness has participated in killing, particularly at or about the same time as the allegations that he's making, then that would be, in my submission, a matter that could go to credibility of the witness, if it were true.  We are not here, subject to an admission at this point, to establish that at this stage. 

And second -- thirdly, "where the witness is able to give cross-examination" -- "cross-examination shall be limited where the witness is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the 
cross-examining party to the subject matter of the case."  So that would be the -- that would be the third limb.  So I'd say, well, it arises on two and it arises on three. 
JUDGE ARREY:
Yes, but if I may interrupt you, "to the subject matter of the case."  This is the case that we are doing.  It's not on some other case that this fellow is being charged with.  It should be relevant to the subject matter of this case that we are doing in the Trial Chambers. 
MR. HOOPER:
I agree entirely with that, but the word is, "where the witness is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the cross-examining party."  It's my case, not the Prosecution case.  That is the criteria. 

My case is that there was widespread killing, and I'd submit that that's a relevant factor, by the RPF, that affected, for example, numbers.  It affects the basis that the -- it affects the -- it may introduce an element of cover-up and concealment of fact that may be reflected in false testimony, for example.  Then that becomes a relevant matter.  It becomes, for example, relevant to numbers.  For my part, I'm not terribly keen on arguing numbers before this Tribunal, of numbers killed, because, on any figure, they are massive, but it does become relevant when, in another context, when one is looking at sites and exhumations and things in support of particular killings.  And I stress, and I very much stress, it's not my case that there was not, in fact, massive slaughter of Tutsi people in Rwanda, an appalling abhorrence.  I want to underscore that because I don't want the wrong weight to be attached to what I'm saying in an open court, but there is another side of the story and it's a relevant one. 

But in particular, in respect of this witness, credibility and those facts rather go hand in hand, in my submission, and if I'm right about the further matter, then it goes further than that.  I have a duty, a positive duty, whether I want to or not, to confront the witness with that allegation.  And I've given some authority for that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may comment briefly, I think --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, please.  I believe Judge Lattanzi has a question. 
JUDGE LATTANZI:
I wish to have a point clarified for me.  I can see that the English version is more expansive than the French, which refers to witness testimony, but what is not clear to me is the grounds which you're relying on, because, first of all, you started by saying -- and please let me, Mr. Hooper, to say that you should be a little bit more orderly and systematic in your examination, because, first of all, you said that you were using these arguments in order to test the credibility of the witness, but now it would appear that you are maybe using this line of questioning in order to bring forward your Defence case, but although the Trial Chamber is not confused by your cross-examination, sometimes I must avow that we have difficulty in following you.  Can you please be clear?  Is it in order to test the credibility or is it in order to put forward your case, or is it both grounds at one and the same time?  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'd put it as the latter.  It's both.  As I said, they walk hand in hand at this juncture.  But I could place it quite singularly on credibility.  That would, in my submission, be sufficient, and I'm merely indicating that there is a further limb that I could also pray in aid in support of my contention that these are matters that are appropriate to put to the witness, and further, on the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, I have a duty to put to the witness.  In other words, it would be improper for me to avoid putting it to the witness.  That's my understanding. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  My concern actually goes along the lines of the question raised by Judge Lattanzi a moment ago, because it seems to me that counsel is confusing the issues of credibility with the Defence case that he's trying to put forward, but in either case, there is no grounds to pursue this line of questioning any further.  The witness has already answered the question of whether he participated in any killings.  He said no.  At that point, the questioning must stop, because even if Mr. Hooper has witness statements that go to this issue and plans to call witnesses on this issue, if we are addressing an issue of collateral -- an issue of credibility, the witness's acts in that regard, assuming that there was some basis for them, is a collateral matter, and you cannot bring witnesses into Court to testify on an issue that is collateral or secondary to the substance of the witness's testimony. 

Now, admittedly, or concededly, that's a common law argument.  I don't know -- I'm not familiar with any line of argument that has been offered or tested in the jurisprudence of this Tribunal, but once -- on issues of credibility, you cannot bring witnesses into a Defence case simply to disprove or to build a case around issues of credibility.  If you bring in witnesses, it has to be for the Defence case, and even in terms of the Defence case, Mr. Hooper is telling us that his case is that these killings were committed by the RPF.  Well, we are not trying to hold Mr. Rwamakuba responsible for killings after the arrival of the RPF.  If we looked at the indictment, which is after all what guides us in this trial, I believe the paragraph that this witness is testifying to is No. 26. -- or excuse me, it's under paragraph 35 and it's 35.1, and the substance of the allegation is that André Rwamakuba distributed machetes to ***** and that those machetes were used subsequently in the attacks against the Tutsi.  It has nothing to do with killings that took place after the arrival of the RPF.  And if we look to paragraph 53.2, I believe, which is the paragraph under the extermination count -- 54, rather, 54.1, that deals with the killings that are attributed to André Rwamakuba.  The only killings in Gikomero that are attributed to him under the indictment are the killings that took place in front of the bureau communal.  It has nothing to do -- the specific allegations in the indictment do not concern the killings in ********.  So if we are going to use the indictment to guide our practice before this Tribunal, this line of questioning is not relevant to any determination of fact that this Trial Chamber has to make. 

If Mr. Hooper is going to make a Defence case, he has to make it on a legal basis of a defence, and simply to suggest that there were RPF killings after the arrival -- or after Gikomero fell -- was in an area that was controlled by the RPF, is not a defence to the allegations being lodged against André Rwamakuba. 

Furthermore, it stretches credulity of this Trial Chamber to make an argument that this witness is going to manufacture stories simply to accuse a person that he claims he only met or became acquainted with on the 4th or 5th of April. 

So, on those three grounds, this goes way beyond any issue that this Trial Chamber should address for the testimony of this particular witness. 

Mr. Hooper has had a very expansive cross-examination.  We've gone way beyond the direct examination.  We've gone way beyond the issues that are raised by his testimony for purposes of proving this indictment, and some limits need to be set, and it's ultimately an issue of discretion for the Court, and our submission is that the Court should exercise its discretion to tailor this 
cross-examination to reasonable -- within reasonable bounds.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, please be brief. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President, I will be very brief.  I just want to put a grain of salt in this question of principle, regarding Judge Lattanzi's question.  Just as regards credibility, I must admit, as I see things as a French lawyer, I think that when a witness testifies, he says the truth, the whole truth, even if part of the truth disturbs him.  If it is his responsibility and his -- or his right not to answer a question that may incriminate him, the Accused also have the freedom to ask any questions of him, and if there is a refusal, the Chamber can eventually ask the witness to respond, just to have that bit of truth that may come out, which it can make deductions from that, to whether or not the witness refused all the way to respond, there might be something that may incriminate him, in the sense that it may also affect his credibility, he only said part of the truth or part of a lie perhaps, if part of the truth may disturb him. 

So I have the feeling that asking questions doesn't necessarily imply giving answers.  It implies certain types of answers, and the Chamber can make deductions as to what may or may not be the credibility of this witness who may be hiding something or who may only be giving partial truth.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapped) ... witness's testimony is that he answered the question put to him by Mr. Hooper.  He said he did not participate in any killings.  But Mr. Hooper wanted to go beyond that and ask additional questions, and that's the point at which my colleague rose and made an objection.  So we have not even gotten to the point where raising an issue of a witness's refusing to answer a question or being put -- answering questions that would incriminate him, because the witness has already stated on the record that he did not participate in any killings.  So that's where the questioning has to stop and that's the point at which Ms. Fall rose to her feet to object.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber sustains the objection.  You may not put that question to the witness. The witness said that he did not participate in any killings.  

You may proceed. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you see any Tutsi killed at any time during the period that we are concerned with?
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I would urge Mr. Hooper to please specify exactly which period he is referring to. 
MR. HOOPER:
During the period of the genocide. 
MS. FALL:
That period comprised several months.  Could Mr. Hooper be more precise as to the day or the month?  And I think that Mr. Hooper is in a position to do that, and this may facilitate the witness's answer to the question. 
MR. HOOPER:
I am content with my question. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you see any Tutsi killed during the period of the genocide? 
A.	I saw how those men were beaten.  Later they were brought to the hospital and they were killed subsequently.  I fled.  I was not able to see any other massacres.  Two days after my flight, the Inkotanyi came and moved us away.  It is for that reason that I was not able to see the massacres.  You can imagine if I was close to the scene of the massacres, I would have myself been a victim of the killings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you wish to intervene, Mr. Prosecutor?
MS. FALL:
No.  I think that the witness did speak of the period that concerned him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you have any more questions?
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Were you ever at Makagote camp?
A.	I do not know that camp, the camp you have just named.  I was only in Rutare.  I found refuge nowhere else. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, can you please spell the name that you have just given?  
MR. HOOPER:
M-A-K-A-G-O-T-E.  And these are the last matters or last matter. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were taken to the Rutare.  Were there many people from ******* and ****** in Rutare? 
A.	Yes, they were there and they were many. 
Q.	Were there many Hutu people there too? 
A.	There were.  The refugees were from both ethnic groups. 
Q.	Can you estimate the numbers for us?  If not, say so? 
A.	There were so many, I wouldn't advance a figure.  They were from several different communes. 
Q.	Returning to the subject of Makagote camp, you say you weren't there.  Have you ever heard of that camp? 
A.	I don't know what you are referring to.  The name of that camp is unknown to me.  The only camp close to us is Karama and Gicaca, and a place located in Gikomero.  Makagote camp as a refugee camp brings nothing to light for me. 
Q.	In ********, an area you know very well, are there many Hutu living there, who were living there in 1994 before this tragedy? 
A.	There were, and even some of them own businesses.  Even *****'s wife is still there. She's got the house and the shop, and there are still even Hutus there today. 
Q.	Would it be fair to say that most of them who lived there in 1994 no longer live there, for whatever reason?  
MS. FALL:
Madam President, I think there is an objection.  I have an objection to this line of questioning which I consider as irrelevant. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I won't pursue it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you going to abandon that line of questioning, Mr. Hooper?  Please finish quickly if you are in a position to do so.
MR. HOOPER:
I have finished.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Mr. Hooper.

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any re-examination for this witness?  
MS. FALL:
Yes, but it will be brief.  I will not take much time in doing so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time do you estimate?
MS. FALL:
Fifteen or so minutes maximum, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach.  Mr. Roach has asked for the floor.
MR. ROACH:
Madam Chair, I should like to put some questions to this witness, and I think I might be about half an hour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We believe -- we thought that other counsel did not want to intervene, but apparently, it appears that there may be questions from the other Defence teams.  As such, we are going to stop here and recommence tomorrow morning at nine with questions from the other Defence teams.  

I would therefore ask that the witness be ushered out of the courtroom so that we can proceed to make a few rulings.  
	(Witness stood down)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now going to give our ruling on all oral applications from the Prosecution for Witness G to testify on the 17th of May 2004.  

The Prosecutor made an oral application on 15th April 2004, for Witness G's testimony, who should have testified in the next session, to be moved up to 17th May 2004.  The Prosecutor based his motion on the fact that the witness will also be heard by teleconference from The Hague in the cases of Bagosora and Bizimungu during the same period.  

The Chamber note the oppositions of the parties linked to questions of preparation.  The Chamber also noted that non-redacted documents concerning this witness which were disclosed on 23rd October 2003, were disclosed to the Defence on 17th April 2004 as redacted documents, in applying under the decision of the Chamber for special protective measures dated 20th October 2003 and the oral decision of 15th April 2004.  

Furthermore, the Chamber notes the fact that the Defence was informed of the testimony of this witness in other trials and received disclosure of the closed session testimony of Witness G as well as exhibits admitted under seal, in the Media trial, on 19th April 2004.  

The Chamber also notes the Prosecutor's affirmation, according to which, most of the eight summaries regarding the interviews of the witness with Canadian  authorities which the Defence says comprises 300 pages, it's not regarding Witness G, as regards this case.  Nevertheless, there is concern about a proper preparation for the Defence as regards this witness.  

Consequently, for those grounds and for reasons of judicial economy and logistic reasons, the Chamber decides to grant the Prosecution motion and authorise the testimony of Witness G for 17th May 2004.  But the Chamber, satisfied with the fact that the Defence must have sufficient time to prepare itself, decides to grant the Defence five days from the period 10 to 15 May 2004 to prepare itself for the cross-examination of the Witness G.  

As regards Mr. Roach's motion for Witness G to testify in person in Arusha, the Chamber will not come back on its decision of 20th October 2003, in which it indicated the reasons for which Witness G is authorised to testify by video conference from The Hague.  

As regards Witness GIN, the Chamber set the date of the examination-in-chief for tomorrow, Thursday, 29th April 2004, if we finish with Witness GII.  The cross-examination of that Witness GIN will only take place starting from 14th May.  That will give -- it appears it is the 4th of May and not the 14th of May, 4th May.  

As regards -- for that purpose, the Chamber urges the registry to facilitate for the Defence access to the detention facility, to permit the Defence to meet with the accused persons.  It also urges the registry to avail the Defence for Ngirumpatse an investigator speaking Kinyarwanda. 

There are also two oral applications regarding Rwanda and Benin, the governments.  Indeed, the motions regarding Rwanda and Benin were filed by Mr. Robinson on 29th March 2004, motions to the effect that these two states have still not cooperated in spite of the Chamber's decision of 11th December 2003.  

Mr. Robinson asked that the Chamber reiterate its decision and report the non-cooperation to the Security Council.  The Chamber notes that these two governments asked for a deadline for response, which proves that they are preparing their cases.  In addition, the Chamber urges the registry to continue to follow these issues closely and to report back to the Chamber on the progress of the events.  

I saw Mr. Weyl stand up earlier.  Was there a problem, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President, I thank you.  I would like to thank the Chamber for the decision it has just handed down, authorising the Defence to have a Kinyarwanda investigator -- a Kinyarwanda-speaking investigator with us.  I just wanted to raise one issue.  

The combination of the two decisions regarding the cross-examination of GIN starting on 4 May leaves very little time for us to be operational.  We are on -- today is the 28th.  We have just been authorised today to have a deadline.  We can have the investigator by the 30th if he gets his airline ticket on the 29th.  That leaves us very little time to work efficiently given those deadlines. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will see that in due time when you are able to tell us how much progress you have made. 

Mr. Robinson, do you have something to say?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Thank you, Madam President.  In light of your ruling with respect to Witness G, there are a few ancillary matters that I would like to raise.  Perhaps we can do that tomorrow in the morning if you are in a hurry right now.  But I think there are a few logistical issues regarding The Hague, that's as appropriately raised with respect to Witness G.  So if you would like to hear it now, I can do that.  If you want to hear it tomorrow morning, we can do that as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time do you think that will take?  It is only -- how much time do you think that will take?  If it is only five minutes, you may proceed, Mr. Robinson.   
MR. ROBINSON:
I can speak for about five minutes, but I don't know what will ensue from all that.  But very briefly -- first of all, this is a video conference, so there is two sides to the conference.  There is the side in Arusha and there is a side in The Hague.  And in the Media case, the lawyers were in both places to make sure that the witness didn't have any prompting or coaching in The Hague, and so there were lawyers in The Hague and there were lawyers here in Arusha.  And I assume that the same procedure and protections will be applicable to us.  And so, I just want to -- before I start booking my ticket to The Hague, I just want to let you know that I choose to be in The Hague for this witness so that I can have as much confrontation as possible under the circumstances.  So that is my first point.

My second point is that I request that my client also be with me in The Hague so that he can assist in the cross-examination.  This has been done twice before, people from the ICTR have been transported to the Hague; both Prime Minister Kambanda was in the Hague in the detention unit of the ICTY, as well as Mr. Rutaganda when he had an Appeals Chamber witness testifying in the Hague in his appeal, and so there is precedent for that procedure as well, and the week of the 10th of May can be used to transport Mr. Nzirorera to the Hague so that on the 17th, without any interruption, both he and I are prepared to question the witness and it can be broadcast here to those of you in Arusha.  So that's my proposal and I want to raise that with you as early as possible an opportunity so these arrangements could be made that are satisfactory. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  Very briefly, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I suppose fundamentally, this is an issue to be resolved between the Trial Chamber, the registry and the Defence.  I mean, it is really a question of logistics.  So it doesn't affect us materially from the Prosecution side.  But I have spoken with my colleague, Senior Trial Attorney Steve Rapp, who was the examining attorney of this witness in the Media case, and we will also participate in this trial by examining this witness.  And he informs me that when they conducted the proceedings as in a manner suggested by Mr. Robinson, that it was not a satisfactory experience, that even the Defence thought that being in The Hague was not useful to them.  

Now, of course, Mr. Robinson has a right to conduct his case as he sees fit.  But I just offer that as a comment to the Trial Chamber, that my understanding is that even the Defence were not satisfied because of the -- it was disruptive.  Their presence in the room caused papers to rattle.  It interfered with the broadcast, and the Defence counsel themselves thought that they would not conduct the proceedings that way were they to do it a second time.  

But in regard to Mr. Robinson's application as to the rights of the Accused or Defence to the extent -- to making arrangements in a way that is really wasteful -- and if Mr. Robinson insists on consulting with his client during the cross-examination of this witness, he can do that from Arusha and sit next to him in this courtroom and watch the screen as everybody else does.  His presence in 
The Hague is not going to guarantee the integrity of the proceedings.  What will guarantee the integrity of the proceedings is the manner in which Court Management and registry handle the arrangements in The Hague, and they are there to ensure the integrity of the proceedings.  So it does not require Defence counsel to sit next -- to sit opposite a witness for this Court to be assured that there is nothing wrong or nothing unfair or prejudicial transpiring.  That's fundamentally the responsibility of the registry or Court Management.

	1340H
MR. WEBSTER: (continuing)
	So I offer that so that the Court can take it into consideration when it deliberates, but my suggestion is that it would be wasteful and not in the interests of smooth management and judicial economy to send both Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Robinson to The Hague simply to ensure the integrity of the proceedings, but fundamentally it's an issue of the Court to decide with the registry. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could just briefly reply, the taking of testimony by video conference is an extraordinary measure that you found to be warranted for the protection of this witness, and I don't quarrel with that.  But it is a limitation on the right of an accused to confront his accuser, and so the Trial Chamber should be making every effort to minimise that problem on the Accused.  And one effort that can be made is to allow the Accused as much confrontation as possible without prejudicing the security of the witness.  And so by myself and Mr. Nzirorera being in The Hague, we're having as much confrontation as possible under the circumstances without causing any problems for the witness, and I think that's a proper balance, and our rights should be considered when the 
Trial Chamber makes that decision.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber will give its ruling.  I did want to point out, Mr. Robinson, we would all like to go to The Hague for the examination of Witness G.  

Very well.  Thank you to all.  Good afternoon to all.  We will see the parties tomorrow.  These proceedings are adjourned.
