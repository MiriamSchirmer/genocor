P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Court is now in session.  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  

Counsel Kouengoua, we were to hear Mr. Ndengejeho.  Is he here?  Have you met him? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Lordships, the Prosecution, the Registry, the Interpreters, the Court Stenographers.  

I have not yet met Pascal Ndengejeho, Madam President.  It might be -- I say "might be" because I heard some sort of information according to which he missed the plane, but he is arriving in Arusha something like 14 -- 2 p.m., 2:30, 3 o'clock.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, it would appear that he has arrived and might be here in 20 minutes or so.  Will you be prepared to proceed with examination of Mr. Ndengejeho if he is here in 20 or 30 minutes? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No, madam.  I have never met this gentleman.  The first thing is at least to meet him.  We never met.  I don't know who he is apart from what he has written and perhaps some telephone conversations.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then what are you asking the Trial Chamber?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
To postpone until tomorrow, Madam President.  I was at the hotel this morning at 10 o'clock as told, at Hotel Impala, to be on time, but at the hotel they told us there was no one of that name, and we came back to headquarters -- the Tribunal, and then that's where we heard the information that's just been given.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you, Counsel.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, have you any observations to make as to the Defence's application? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I leave it entirely to your discretion, Your Honours, but I see no reason why the witness should not be able to take the stand maybe after half an hour session with counsel, considering that he is not a witness of fact.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Counsel Kouengoua, as you know, we have a heavy work schedule, so this is what we have decided: we will sit at 4 p.m. leaving you the time to meet Mr. Ndengejeho and discuss matters with him, and we will continue, if necessary, tomorrow.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, as it's your decision, I can't do nothing about it, but I would like the Trial Chamber to take account of human factors.  I think, for example, he's lost his luggage.  The witness has lost his luggage, so I think we should have -- take these things in regard (sic).  I think the witness section should have given us information.  

I hear that this gentleman might even have lost his luggage.  He is arriving --- we were expecting him at 9:00 this morning, he is arriving at 3 p.m.; he's the Tribunal's witness.  But if we had all the appropriate information from -- if we had all the pertinent information from the witness section, I don't think that would be -- that would be the decision you'd take, but that is yet to be seen.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is yet to be seen.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
But if it turns out to be correct, I don't think that we can, for reasons of principles that might -- we might hold close to our hearts, but this gentleman, we don't know what he's been through.  He left a conference in Johannesburg on the 17th; he has lost his belongings; he has no time to sleep between planes --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have not yet seen the gentleman.  When he is here we will see him and then we will hear what he has to say.  So we will reconvene at 4 p.m. 

The hearing stands adjourned.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Trial Chamber is now in session.  

Counsel Kouengoua, has Mr. Ndengejeho arrived?  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I think he is here.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndengejeho is in Arusha.  Is he really?  But is he within our walls?  Very well.  I think he is here we can bring him in.  Please call the witness. 

Mr. Ndengejeho, good afternoon. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are about to testify before this Tribunal.  We have just taken a decision in that regard.  We will ask you to identify yourself and take the solemn declaration before beginning to testify. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  My name is Ndengejeho, Pascal Byron.  I am a Rwandan by birth, presently living in Namibia, which is where I work.  And I was contacted by the Tribunal to come and testify as an expert witness.
(Declaration made by Pascal Byron Ndengejeho in French)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Thank you, Mr. Ndengejeho, you may sit down.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is not the first time that you testify before this Tribunal.  You know the procedure.  The Defence will examine you.  You will no doubt be cross-examined by the Prosecution, and Their Lordships might also seek certain clarification from you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I am at your service. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Ndengejeho.  

Counsel Kouengoua, you have the floor, sir.

MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Lordships.

PASCAL BYRON NDENGEJEHO,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Professor Pascal Ndengejeho, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	I am to undertake the examination-in-chief.  And solemnly, I extensively apologise to you for not having been able to speak with you earlier.  It wasn't because we didn't want to, but because it was not possible.  

I should like to ask you, Professor, if the document you forwarded to me for filing with the Tribunal -- have you kept yourself a copy of the document?  Have you yourself, kept a copy of the document you sent to me for filing with the Tribunal? 
A.	Counsel, perhaps I should not say so, but I arrived in Windhoek on the 17th, at about 11 o'clock from South Africa.  And since the month of October, I had informed that I would be in South Africa from the 12th to the 17th, in a meeting, a very important meeting for Africa, concerning the directors of the media, managers of the media, who had to ensure that the message of reconciliation is broadcast throughout SADC.  

So I arrived in Windhoek at 1100, passing by my office.  I saw that I did have an invitation to come to Arusha, and I directly telephoned to the witness section, who told me that there was a ticket sent by DHL, and that I was to travel the following morning at eight o'clock, which means yesterday morning at 8 a.m.  So I prepared my luggage.  I did everything I had to do, following the calendar that had been given to me.  But unfortunately, my suitcase was lost along the way, and the airline ensures me that my suitcase will arrive today or tomorrow.  So all my luggage, all my documents have been lost and the proof is that the airline recognised that the luggage hadn't accompanied me.  I made a claim for the documents to come as soon as possible.

As regards the document in question, I have a copy of it in my luggage, which I hope to recover today or at the latest tomorrow. 
Q.	Thank you, Professor.   When Madam President welcomed you, she mentioned the decision that had been taken on the 11th of November, and you have been disqualified, I am sorry, that's the term.  

The Trial Chamber decided that you would only testify today as a witness of fact, and not as an expert witness.  That was the decision.  So before going any further, I thought you should know that. 
A.	When such a decision is taken, Counsel, the interested party must be informed.  You have to date not informed me.  If my status changes, I have to be informed as I was informed, and take the decision to agree or not.  I have the right to be also informed and I have the right to accept or not.  But now you are informing me of a decision.  I work very often with written documents.  I cannot say that I have been seized of the decision because I haven't been notified in writing.  I consider that, as I was contacted in writing, I must be disqualified in writing, and this other status thus offered me, should also have been notified to me in writing. 
Q.	Professor, that is not the commentary that I wanted.  I merely wanted to inform you of the decision.  The decision was only confirmed yesterday, and I did not see you before.  I could not inform you before, because it was not humanly possible to do so.  That is what I wanted to tell you.  

Now, Professor, you are here because there is a defendant here, Gacumbitsi, Sylvestré, whom I am defending, and you have been called as a witness.  And I should like to ask you, Professor, since the accusations levelled against Gacumbitsi --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are providing Mr. Ndengejeho with a copy of the decision of 11th December (sic), for him to peruse.  We could not do so before.  We are very sorry for that.  

Pray continue, Counsel Kouengoua. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, madam. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	I was saying -- I don't know if you are following me or if you are reading the document you have got in hand.
A.	Please forgive me.  But a few seconds are not enough to read and understand the document.  I must have the time to read the document, understand it and then I will appropriately follow up.  And moreover, I am told that I am disqualified.  There are perhaps -- there must be reasons which -- and I can make my contribution there.  Either there has been a mistake or it is not there accountedly (sic), a document drafted by experienced lawyers, Judges, in just a few seconds.  I am sorry, but that is not the way things are usually done.  Thank you. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Professor.  But you must raise this problem with the Judges and not with me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Take the time to read the decision that has been handed to you, and tell us whether you intend to testify or not before the Tribunal. 
THE WITNESS:
How much time do I have to read and analyse this?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How much time do you need?
THE WITNESS:
Well, as I said, Madam President, a document such as this, drafted by Judges, I need to read it, I need to consult.  I have to work out the implications, because I have another one sent to me by the same Tribunal, so I want to compare them.  "We have decided to offer you on behalf of the Registrar of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, an assignment on the consultant contact as an expert witness for the required preliminary work."  

Now, if we are going to change, I need to compare, and I have the right, I believe, to take advice, unless I am very much mistaken.  So a document such as this, of which people have spent many days, hours and hours working out what they are going to write down, I can't do it in five minutes nor an hour and 20 minutes.  I do not feel capable of answering without having worked out the implications of this document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Ndengejeho. Counsel for the Prosecution, you have asked to speak, please pray do so.  
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I realise we are pressed for time, and we have wasted the last half hour over a matter that is au fait accompli.  You ruled on the 11th of November and reinforced your ruling yesterday, that the witness in the box isn't an expert.  Neither he nor his counsel can take it any further.  

The mere fact that he was accredited by the Registrar as an expert, in itself, is just for purposes of remuneration, and has no bearing on the finding of this Chamber when qualifying the witness.  

I refer Your Honours to Article II of the guidelines on the remuneration of expert witnesses appearing before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and I quote:  " Obviously, it is the right of the Trial Chamber to allow the witness to make a deposition as an expert on special issues referred to it or tear the witness's testimony and where necessary, assess its value.  However, the conditions defined under the UN Financial and Accounting Rules and Procedures, require the submission of the expert witness's references, as well as evidence of his expertise, to the Registrar to back up any request for payment of his fees or reimbursement of any expenditure incurred by him".  

The point I am underscoring, Your Honours, is that the mere fact that he was accredited as an expert by the Registrar, does not impact on your decision of the 11th of November, and we should be moving on, considering that we are pressed for time and we have lost the last half hour. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Mr. Prosecutor, I think the issue here at  the present time is -- apparently this is the first intimation this witness has heard that he has not been accepted as an expert witness, and I think he needs to elect whether in the circumstances he still wants to give evidence.  It may well be that after he has read the order of this Court, the ruling of this Court, he may choose not to wish to give evidence.  And I think for that purpose, he needs time as he says, to read and understand why he is being disqualified. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
It could have been made easier if the Chamber just told him that -- you know, in bullet point form, that he has been disqualified and give him the option, because reading that decision or not won't take matters any further.  The question should be posed:  Does he want to testify or not, considering paragraph 9 and the orders in that decision?  Most obliged, Your Honours. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I think objectively speaking, the Prosecutor is extending the logic of his reasoning a bit far.  I already -- I don't understand this.  The difficult situation in which we are is because of the Prosecution.  

The witness raises a problem before the Trial Chamber.  The Trial Chamber is looking for a solution, and the Prosecutor bursts in.  

Very respectfully, Madam President, there should be differences between the Prosecution and us is perfectly normal.  But a witness who comes here to testify must be left the time to decide what to do or not.  There was a decision on the 11th.  The gentleman has just been informed that the decision was taken on the 11th affecting him, and the Prosecutor is following a logic which is -- something I have not seen somewhere. You remember he said something on Monday, the 17th, at three o'clock.  I said that if the Prosecutor has an objection, he should raise a motion, an application whether oral or written, but the problem is raised before the Trial Chamber.  It is to the Trial Chamber to take the decision and the Defence has introduced the witness cannot do anything about it.  

Always we are reminded that we must be expeditious -- and all the time you are pushing people, and I don't think that is normal.  Madam, I think the fact that we don't often interrupt is a bit not out of weakness, but because out of knowledge and respect for legal proceedings.  We should like the Prosecution to also follow those rules, otherwise it is not normal.  We are doing all we can to end this trial within the allotted time.  

I have been running across town three times to the Impala because of the Prosecution.  We know how things should be done.  I am very sorry for speaking the way I do, but I think it's a third day of repetition.  We should nonetheless, in the heat of action sometimes be allowed to commit some mistakes.  But I beg the Prosecutor to remember this so that we can move forward -- so as to move forward, Madam President.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber, considering that Mr. Ndengejeho does not have his documents with him inasmuch as his luggage has not come with him; inasmuch as we have just now handed him the decision taken by Trial Chamber, we consider that he needs time to prepare himself, and we will therefore adjourn until tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.  And we hope that Mr. Ndengejeho will at that point be ready to tell us whether he is ready to testify before the Trial Chamber.  

Thank you, Mr. Ndengejeho.  I am sorry.  You wanted to say something?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I shall be very brief.  I shall be very brief, Madam President.  In fact, I should have added that it is torture for me.  I have just learned from the driver that we were arriving at 0900, but the itinerary worked out a week ago indicated that I was supposed to arrive at 13:25 or 1:25.  I arrived at about 
2 p.m. at the airport.  At 2:45 I arrived at the hotel.  I was told I must come to testify, and for someone who has lost his luggage, for me, it is torture.  And I merely wanted to draw that to your attention, because when I said, "Give me at least a minute to wash my face", I was told, "No. No, you have to go to the Tribunal."  I wanted to point this incident and to bring this incident to your notice.   So whoever said I was supposed to arrive at nine this morning, didn't know anything about it; it's another lie being slipped in amongst all the others, as usual.  I was never due to arrive at nine this morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have taken due note, and the session is adjourned until tomorrow.
