EXHIBIT
Prosecution Exhibit No. P14....................................................................................................8




P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Court is in session.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  
The Trial Chamber had heard the parties at some length yesterday with respect to Prosecution exhibits.  I would like to mention that we received a free translation of Exhibit DO1, as the exhibit was in Kinyarwanda.  The Trial Chamber, considering that -- during cross-examination of Prosecution Witness TBK, the Prosecutor disclosed to the Defence a document in Kinyarwanda containing the confession of Witness TBK, before Rwandan authorities.  Considering that it wasn't until after the testimony of Witness TBK, that the Defence asked that his confession be admitted as an exhibit, the Prosecutor accepted that the document be admitted on the condition that the witness statement given to the investigators in May 2003 would also be admitted as a Defence exhibit, and considering that the Defence objected to this second document being admitted; order as follows:  Witness TBK is called back to testify to identify the confession made before Rwandan authorities, which was admitted as Exhibit DO1; dismisses the Prosecution's motion that the witness statement of --  the witness statement made by Witness TBK be admitted as a Defence exhibit.  We therefore order that 
Witness TBK should come back and testify.
Could you bring Witness TBK into the courtroom, please?

WITNESS TBK
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness TBK.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have already testified before this Court.  The Prosecutor examined you.  You were 
cross-examined by the Defence, and you had mentioned your confession before Rwandan authorities.  The document -- the -- your confession was admitted as an exhibit, and what we would now like is for you to look at the document and for you to confirm or to deny that this is your confession before the Rwandan authorities.  

Please, place document DO1 before the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I don't know how to read very well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could a Kinyarwanda interpreter please come forward and assist the witness.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, good morning.  Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please show the witness the document.  Tell the witness what is the content of the document and verify that he is the one who signed the document, and see if he signed the document and if he acknowledges the content of the document.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, Madam President.  
Madam President, the witness acknowledges that this is indeed the letter he wrote to the Kibungo state prosecutor's office.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber wishes to be placed on record that Witness TBK recognised the document numbered DO1 as constituting his confession before Rwandan authorities.  I thank the interpreter.

I now wish to address the parties as regards what we have now specifically said.  Have you got any comments?  But we would invite you to be brief inasmuch as we have already expressed the decision we reached.

Counsel for the Prosecution, please. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.  You will note from Exhibit DO1 that; one, it is a letter by this witness to the Prosecution authorities of Kibungo in which this witness confesses a particular crime, namely, the murder of Ntagozera with which this witness concedes he was charged.  This letter,
Your Honours, is dated 23rd November 2000.  Now, it would be unfortunate, Your Honours, for us to proceed in such a manner without the Defence indicating or justifying why they have placed this document, on the record because we submit we see no contradiction or inconsistence whatsoever.  More specifically, Your Honours, it would be unfortunate if the Prosecutor were denied the opportunity of re-examining this witness.
We waived the right to re-examine because at the point -- at that point in time we felt there was
nothing to re-examine on.  Today however, with the witness in the stand and having identified the document, the Prosecutor requests that she be permitted to re-examine this witness, more specifically on a pro justicia statement that predates this confession, a pro justicia statement made by this witness to the Rwandan Judicial authorities on 6th of April 2000.  That is seven months before his confession.  
This witness made a statement in which he gives evidence against the Accused.  It's only when both documents are properly before Your Lordships that you will have an informed deliberation.  You cannot have an informed deliberation of the credibility of this witness without taking into consideration his statement made to the same judicial authorities prior to his confession, which statement, 
Your Honours, is consistent with the statement he gave to the Office of the Prosecutor in May this year.  Simply put, Your Honours, we are asserting our right to re-examine this witness on the basis of the opening made by counsel who sought to introduce this document after cross-examination was completed. 
We are most obliged.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, counsel for Prosecution.  Counsel Kouengoua, you have the floor. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Lordships.  Good morning Counsel for the Prosecution, and good morning, Registry.  

I thank you, Madam.  When Madam President invited the parties to speak, she said -- she specified at the outset that the Trial Chamber had already given forth its decision and that we should, therefore, not speak at length.  I think that what had been said here and what can be noted, the Trial Chamber's voice pre-empts all others, and I for my part should merely like to point that -- also that if the witness has been recalled here this morning, that if the document in Kinyarwanda was entered in evidence, so the witness necessarily had to recognise authenticity of the document, which has been done.  
Secondly, I believe that counsel for the Prosecution had said something very serious.  I don't think he probably was aware, but in speaking he said the statements made by this witness can only be credible when you have in hand what he said to the Kibungo state prosecutor's office.  He said that otherwise, these statements are not credible.  Madam President, Your Lordships, I hope Counsel for Prosecution weighed his words.  In other words, the witness he calls to testify, he is now saying he is not credible.  I hope he thinks that over.  Moreover, Madam, we asked this document to be placed on the record that has been agreed to.  We have nothing else to add.  I think that is what you wanted to hear from me, Madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua.  Counsel for the Prosecution, you have no further observation or comment?  We could deliberate between us, the Judges, but if you have something to add, please proceed.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Just to correct Counsel's misrepresentation of what I said, I am not doubting the credibility of this witness at all.  What I am saying is that for Your Lordships to be able to have an informed deliberation about the credibility of this witness, you need to have all his statements to the Rwandan authorities before you, because the two statements serve different purposes.  One is his confession about his own active murder, the other is a statement made in connection with the investigation of the crimes committed by the Accused.  And because counsel is not justified by Exhibit DO1, he has not impeached the witness.  I am a bit at a loss with this kind of procedure. 
Most obliged, Your Honours. 

MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, be very very brief, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The French interpreter spoke of statements that were not credible, and counsel for the Prosecution has said once -- unless you have all the documents, you cannot deliberate on the credibility of the witness.  What I said before and what I say now is that I question the document -- the witness on the basis of the document produced.  That's all I have to say.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you have now spoken to us of the pro justicia document bearing the statement  -- the witness's statement to the Rwandan authorities.  That document has never been brought to this Trial Chamber, I believe.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, we even availed you an English translation of the same document.  In fact, initially it was in French, and then we had an English translation for the benefit of Judge Reddy.  I have a copy of the English translation and the French translation, and these were availed to you before this witness took the stand, I think it was on Monday morning.  These are the documents we received on Saturday from Kigali by pouch, translated over Sunday night, and disclosed to Defence and the Chamber on Monday morning.  

Your Honours, I am just advised we are in open session and this witness's name was read out in the course of the Kinyarwanda interpreter reading to him the letter.  So one, that portion should be expunged from the open session record, placed under seal.  And maybe any further discussion that involves his name should be in closed session.  Most obliged.

Counsel Kouengoua, do you have this pro justicia document?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, we can't find that document.  Madam President, I don't know what document it is because the document I asked to be entered in evidence concerned this witness.  I don't know what document you are talking about.  Was it given to us the same time as the confession?  Was it the same day as the confession?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document was given to us on Monday, and we have checked and indeed it was.  I will give you a copy of the document if you don't have it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, we have the witness's statement, we have the pro justicia document just referred to which concerns Witness TBK.  We would like you, therefore, to tell us whether you want to enter these documents as Prosecution exhibits.  I should like to add that everything concerning the identity of the witness be placed under seal.  
Counsel for the Prosecution, can you enlighten us as to your prayer?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.  First, I still don't know why or to what use counsel for the Defence intends to put to use Defence Exhibit No. 1, but I am suggesting, Your Honours, that in the same manner that you had this witness identify his confession, you could similarly have him identify a statement he made to the Rwandan authorities prior to his confession, and enter it into the record, and you could do that as a Chamber if you don't want the Prosecution to take advantage of the witness's presence.

Most obliged.
JUDGE REDDY:
For my part, let me make it clear that when we made that order denying the right to admit the statement made to the Prosecutor's office, we were dealing with the question of whether you can insist that it should go in as a Defence exhibit.  That's really all we were doing.  We are not suggesting for one moment that it can't go in as a Prosecution exhibit because it could have different implications.  For myself, I see nothing wrong with you now getting the other statements identified so that we have the full picture before us.  
And as for what use we will make of this statement, I understand the law on the subject to be crystal clear:  This is not evidence.  The statement can only be used to testify to the credibility of the witness and to identify any contradictions or any variations between the sworn evidence and what appears here.  This, or even the statement that you wish to put in, have no other view -- value.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Judge Reddy.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Madam President, I don't know if counsel for the Prosecution has finished", mumbles Counsel for Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, have you finished?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes, Your Honours.  Having heard Judge Reddy, I was waiting for the decision of the panel of Judges, because I thought those were his personal remarks.  I was waiting.  Are you allowing me to show the witness this document so that he identifies it, so that we put it onto the record?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you may, Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel for the Defence asks for the floor.  Madam President says just wait, we will give you the floor subsequently.
MR. KAREGYESA:
If we could have a Kinyarwanda Interpreter come over, read this pro justicia statement to the witness and have him identify it for the purpose of entering it into the record.  I don't know, since it includes his name maybe -- and other identifying information, we should have it done in closed session,
Your Honours.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What do you -- what is it?  What do you want? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The document that's being shown to the witness has nothing to do with the preceding document.  I will show that the witness even signed this document, and even before we get there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel for the Defence, we will see.  That is what we will see.  We are just showing him the document and he will tell us whether he acknowledges it, whether he signed it.  Please do not anticipate.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, please, I am sorry.  The document we just entered was a confession made in May and that is why we were not talking of the pro justicia yesterday.  The prior statements have no probative value.  This pro justicia has just come up today.  Yesterday the document in question was the witness statement.  The preliminary statement.  Now there's a third document.  Counsel fore the Prosecution, yesterday was asking for two documents to be entered.  The confession of 23rd November 2000 and the witness statement of May of this year.  This is the third document.  
Thank you, for your attention.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Interpreters, could you please help us and help the witness to identify the contents of the document as being effectively his words.  But before that we are going into closed session.  I apologise to the public, but we have to go into closed session to protect the witness.

	0945H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have another witness for us this morning?
MR. KAREGYESA:
No.  Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  Your Honour, the Prosecutor -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.  You may open the curtains.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor has an application.  Your Honours, the Prosecutor applies for leave of this Chamber to drop Witnesses TAE and TAN from its list of Prosecution witnesses, and the grounds of the application, Your Honours, are that Witness TAN has refused to travel to Arusha to testify, and this information was conveyed to us by the WVSS this week.

You will recall in regard to Witness TAE that we had requested an adjournment yesterday to enable counsel to proof the witness.  Unfortunately, Your Honours, the witness is extremely fragile and has been unable to cope with recalling the tragic events of April 1994.  She is barely able to speak of her experiences and it would be futile, Your Honours, to subject this witness to court proceedings that she would not be able to withstand.  So we are asking for the leave of this Chamber to drop Witness TAE.

Now, Your Honours, if leave is granted to the Prosecutor to dispense with the appearance of these two witnesses, we would be left with two witnesses of fact -- TBH, TBG -- and the expert witness, Alison Des Forges, and these three remaining witnesses, Your Honours, can be heard next week and disposed of within our deadline of Thursday, the 28th of August 2003.

I am most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that all right with you, Mr. Kouengoua?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, it is clear that there is an enormous problem.  I notice, regrettably, that the Prosecutor does not keep to his word.  Here, openly before the Trial Chamber, he promised me that he would allow me the whole of this weekend to prepare for Alison Des Forges.  This is what he said when he asked you for permission, when he would not be here from the 11th to the 15th for Cyangugu.  Now is he telling you that TBH, TBG and Alison Des Forges -- well, Madam President, I will finish on Wednesday, as agreed. 

And then what should I do on Monday?  Who should I expect, TBH, TBG or Alison Des Forges; which witness should I expect?  Obviously, I did nothing about this enough yesterday when I drew the attention of the Trial Chamber to Witness TAF, TAE (sic).

Madam President, I said, and I will never repeat this enough, it is not normal that someone should be talking of a shock ten years after.  I think this shock experienced by some Prosecution witnesses -- Madam President, I was saying that the trauma, the alleged trauma of TAE, TAN -- or TAE -- TAN is understandable because it is not that easy as TAP (sic) to withstand in a short time the change that will occur.  

Madam President, does the Trial Chamber still accept that this Wednesday, the 28th, this session will come to an end; that is, for the Prosecution witnesses?  If that the case, then at some point in time the Trial Chamber should intervene to have the Prosecutor call the other witnesses.  This would be submitting the Defence and the Trial Chamber to an impossible task.

We were told that on the 28th it would be Alison Des Forges, and that would be the end.  Today, we are told that TBH and TBG would come next week, but, in any case, I will finish on Wednesday.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the Prosecution (sic).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber allows the Prosecution to withdraw Witnesses TAE and TAN.

Prosecutor, are you in a position to tell us the witness who will be called first?  Is it one of the two witnesses that you named, TBH, TBG?  In which order will they be called?  Of course, we are also referring to the expert witness, Alison Des Forges.  In which order will these witnesses be called, TBH, TBG and Alison Des Forges?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the proposed order that the Prosecutor intends to call these is Witnesses TBH, TBG and Alison Des Forges.  There is a caveat, however, Your Honours, that this weekend the Prosecutor is going to meet all three witnesses, and counsel and Your Honours are -- should bear in mind that there is potential for a review of this order.  In short, counsel should be ready to proceed with whichever witness the Prosecutor calls.  We will try, as much as we can, to stick to this order, but these are the last three witnesses, and one of them hasn't arrived.  Only two are here.  We are going to assess them over the weekend and anything could happen.  So counsel, who has had the brief for over two years, should be ready to proceed with whichever witness comes first.

Most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Could you tell us the witness who is not yet here, Prosecution?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Expert witness Alison Des Forges.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we going to adjourn the proceedings now.  The proceedings will resume on Monday, next Monday at 8:45, as usual.  We thank you.
