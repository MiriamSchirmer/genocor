P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. TOURÉ:
Thank you, Mr. President.

The Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen, presiding, Judge Mehmet Güney, Judge Liu Daqun, 
Judge Theodor Meron, Judge Wolfgang Schomburg is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 8th of February 2006, for the appeals hearing in the matter of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi versus The Prosecutor and The Prosecutor versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, Case No. ICTR-2001-64-A.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  I would now ask for appearances.  

The Defence first. 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Appeals Chamber.  
Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's Defence team comprises Anne Ngatio Mbattang, who is a member of the Cameroon bar; Kouengoua, also of the Cameroon bar; and we are assisted by Sterling Minou, similarly of the Cameroon bar.  

May I take the opportunity on behalf of my Defence team, Mr. President, Your Honours, to convey my greetings to members of the Office of the Prosecutor, the registry, the court reporters, the interpreters and translators.  And if you allow me, and if it is not too late, our best wishes, happiness and good health.  It is true that this will be the sole opportunity that we will have.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Now may I have the appearances for the Prosecution. 
MR. WESTON:
Thank you, Your Honour.  May it please the Court, my name is Neville Weston.  I appear for the Prosecutor in both the appeal and the cross appeal.  I also appear with my colleagues, 
Mr. George Mugwanya, Mr. James Stewart, and Ms. Inneke Onsea.  May it please the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is an appeal by both sides in the case of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi against the Prosecutor.  The appellant Mr. Gacumbitsi and the Prosecution, both appearing for the judgement rendered on 17th June 2004 by Trial Chamber III composed of Judge Vaz, presiding, and Judges Reddy and Egorov.  
The Trial Chamber found the appellant, Mr. Gacumbitsi, guilty of genocide, count 1; extermination as a crime against humanity, count 3; and rape as a crime against humanity, count 5; all this being for his participation in crimes committed against the Tutsi population of Kibungo préfecture in April 1994.  The Trial Chamber sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 30 years. 

Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's appeal as set out in his notice of appeal filed on 20 July 2004 and in the appellant's brief filed on 4 October 2004 consists of allegations of legal and factual errors on the part of the Trial Chamber.  

In ground 1 he alleges errors in certain interlocutory decisions of the Trial Chamber, including the dismissal of a motion to postpone, which dismissal had the effect, so he says, of denying the appellant sufficient time and facilities to prepare his defence.  

He also alleges errors relating to his convictions with genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity, and rape as a crime against humanity.  He submits that his sentence should be reduced to 15 years in the event that his convictions are not quashed on appeal. 

The Prosecution responds that all grounds of appeal raised by the appellant should be dismissed. 

Now, the Prosecution's appeal comprises six grounds.  In its appeal brief filed on 20th September 2004 and its amended notice of appeal filed on 16 December 2004, the Prosecution avers that the 
Trial Chamber erred in various respects in sentencing in acquitting the appellant of murder as a crime against humanity, in failing to find him criminally responsible for certain rapes, and in its enunciation or elements of rape, also in referring to and refusing consider joint criminal enterprise as a mode of liability, because it had not been pleaded adequately in the indictment, and in failing to conclude that the appellant had authority -- or had authority to order the conseillers, Interahamwe, gendarmes, and other participants in the attack in Rusumo commune. 

The appellant objects to all grounds of appeal raised by the Prosecution, except ground 4, elements of rape, with respect to which he does not take a position.  

During the hearing counsel may argue the grounds of appeal in the order they consider most suitable for their presentation, as long as they indicate which grounds they are arguing and provided that they adhere to the time periods stipulated in the scheduling order issued on 8 December 2005.  They may not enlarge their pleaded grounds of appeal.  

This hearing will proceed according to that scheduling order.  Sylvestre Gacumbitsi will present his submissions this afternoon until 4:15 p.m.  Following a 30-minute pause, the Prosecution will then begin to present its response from 4:45 to 6 p.m. and will continue its presentation tomorrow morning from 
9 to 9:45 a.m. 

Sylvestre Gacumbitsi will then have 30 minutes for the reply from 9:45 to 10:15 a.m., and thereafter, if he wishes, he may present a personal address limited to ten minutes.  The hearing of the appeal of Mr. Gacumbitsi will conclude 10:25 a.m. tomorrow.  The Prosecution will have until 1 p.m. to make its submissions.  After a pause, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi will have an opportunity to respond from 3 to 5 p.m.  The Prosecution will reply from 5:30 to 6 p.m.  

The Judges may interrupt the parties at any time to ask questions or they may ask questions following each party's submissions. 

I would like now to invite counsel for Mr. Gacumbitsi to present submissions in support of his appeal. 

Ready, Counsel?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
I am much obliged to you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

Most respectfully, my first complaint would be if the registry can enable me to see the clock that is on the wall so that I can be able to check how far I'm going and how much time I've got left.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It's ten past two now -- eleven past two.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
I am much obliged, Mr. President, and Your Honours of the Appeals Chamber. 

On the 17 of June 2004, Trial Chamber III of the ICTR found Sylvestre Gacumbitsi guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity, extermination and rape.  That judgement came about following an indictment initiated by the Prosecutor in June 2001, and it comprised five charges, namely, count 1, genocide; 2, complicity in genocide; third count, extermination; 3, murder -- 4, murder; 5, rape. 

To carry out an objective appraisal of that judgement, it is important to recall the facts and the proceedings.  Mr. President, Your Honours, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi who came from the remote areas of Rusumo -- thank you.  

I was saying, Mr. President, that Gacumbitsi, having come from the remote areas of equatorial forest in Rusumo, can only produce the facts here, the facts that he believes are true, only the facts.  And the law lies with you, and it is for you to apply them to the facts before you.  

That having been stated, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was born in 1943 in the Rusumo commune, Kigina secteur, Kibungo préfecture.  He was a teacher that was highly appreciated by his pupils and members of the population.  He was also president of the banque populaire de Rusumo and the bourgmestre of Rusumo from '83 to 1994.  

On the 6th of April 1994, a plane transporting the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi crashed, and that crash occurred, whereas since the 1st of October 1990, there had been an armed conflict raging in Rwanda. 

Rusumo commune is on the eastern area of Rwanda at the border with Tanzania, and when the Rwandan Patriotic Front moved into Rwanda, and after their victory over the Rwandan armed forces in 1994, a segment of the population, including the Accused, sought refuge in Congo and in Tanzania so as to avoid being killed. 

Mr. President, on the 20th of June 2001, following the confirmation of the indictment I referred to earlier, the Prosecutor had Sylvestre Gacumbitsi arrested in the Mkugwa refugee camp, which is located in Tanzania.  He was transferred on the same day to Arusha and kept in detention at the UNDF, with the UN detention facility.  

On 26th of June 2001, he pleaded not guilty to all the charges brought against him.  On the 26th of July 2002 the Trial Chamber rejected a preliminary motion filed by the Defence which referred to the vagueness, vacuousness, and the need for an amendment to the indictment.  That was -- that was rejected. 

Now, with the multiple difficulties encountered by the Defence in preparing its defence of the Accused, on the 22nd of July 2002, it seized Chamber with a motion seeking a postponement of the trial.  That application was not entertained, but then the Trial Chamber made the Defence feel that it had duly noted the well-founded difficulties that it had raised.  And on the first -- and it said, sorry, that this could be taken up again at the time when it would be submitting its own case, that is, in the course of the status conference. 

On the 1st of August 2003, that is, after the Trial Chamber had noted the difficulties encountered, the difficulties being faced by the Defence, that same Chamber did reject the application of the Defence because it had received a list of five Prosecution witnesses who were all detainees in Rwanda.  The application of the Defence was simple.  We said, "Prosecutor, please inform us on the reasons for the release of those who have been brought here so as to enable us to prepare our defence." 

The Chamber decided as follows:  "Prosecutor, if you have the documents on the grounds of which you have brought this person here, could you make them available to the Defence so that you can explain; otherwise, you will explain yourself within 48 hours."  Well, the Prosecutor did nothing about it, and when I repeated this fact in the course of the trial, I was blamed.  And that is verifiable.  It is in the records of the proceedings. 

On the 28th of August 2003, and based on the purport of the decision made on the 28th of July 2003, the Defence, in view of being told by the Trial Chamber that it could take up this matter again, was told that it had no such -- no such right.  Because during the Prosecution's presentation, Defence did not have any opportunity to meet with its team.  Again, the Trial Chamber said, "Defence, you are facing a lot of difficulties, but the trial cannot be postponed because the date had already been set since the 10th of July. 

The Defence submitted to -- at the registry a report by its expert witness.  And pursuant to Rule 94 bis of the rules, the Prosecutor had 14 days to indicate, firstly, whether it accepts Pascal Ndengejeho as a witness or does not accept him, whether they accept the expert witness statement or he wishes to cross-examine the expert witness. 

On the 17th of October 2003, the Prosecutor reacted by indicating that if the Trial Chamber accepted Mr. Ndengejeho as an expert, it was the intention of the Prosecutor to cross-examine the said expert.  

Well, Your Honours, it was agreed that the trial will come to an end on the 31st of October.  But then on the 20th of October, a Judge was unavailable, and our trial was accordingly adjourned.  And we all met in the Chambers of the presiding Judge, and in the course of our discussions, a decision was made that the trial will resume on the 17th of November.  

And it resumed with the hearing of two factual witnesses, followed by expert witness, 
Professor Lecompte from Paris and Ndengejeho, and finally, with the Accused Gacumbitsi.  So we ended and my team goes back to Cameroon, and nothing else could be done. 

Mr. President, Gacumbitsi, whom I am defending today and whose rights have to be restored by yourselves, enable him to understand what he is being blamed for, because if this matter had been addressed, otherwise, we wouldn't have been here today.  I'm in Cameroon with my team.  I'm in Cameroon, and the Prosecutor files a motion so that all my investigators can be thrown out, and the Trial Chamber doesn't find out whether we had already received such a motion.  Now, they only told us our expert was no longer an expert, his report was dismissed or rejected, and the gentleman who had to come from the Paris would longer be allowed to appear.  

What you might not know is that when we get to Arusha on the 13th of November and went to see our client in prison, he produces a copy of a decision made by the Court.  The criminal Tribunal is an international institution.  It is highly respected.  If decisions have to be issued in the dark, if these decisions have to be made behind the Accused who has no powers who has no office here, 
Your Honours, please, ensure that these proceedings are observed.  No one today can understand that this kind of thing can happen in 2003.  Unfortunately, that's the experience that Gacumbitsi had. 

We asked that that decision be reviewed or reconsidered.  Your Honours, these are words that we hear, and I'm sorry to say so, this is what we hear in those countries they call banana republics.  And the Prosecutor was asking that the decision be rendered before the 17th October, that is, before the commencement of trial.  And as of today, nobody had told us why we had to resume on the 17th of October just by the fact that we have asked for it.  And this is what they call international justice?  

Mr. Gacumbitsi, who didn't understand anything, didn't know what was happening.  And I myself, I must confess, as his counsel, I didn't understand anything.  I don't know whether some day I will be asked what kind of prejudice Gacumbitsi has suffered, unless it is considered in some other units which are not ours, but it is serious enough.  

Gacumbitsi maintained a dignified attitude, and he told his counsel, "Well, Counsel, I've done nothing.  Move on.  The Prosecutor will find what he seeks.  Trial Chamber believes in justice, and it is in that Trial Chamber that I trust and that I wait for justice." 

These are the errors, interlocutory errors, which prevented us.  And if I were in the position of those who came here to tell us what happened, who traumatised us, and this is within a period of four months in 2003. 

Your Honours, in spite of all these difficulties, we felt, as we were told by the Trial Chamber on the 6th of June 2002, that when it comes to substance, we'll see what will happen; this will be corrected.  And we believed them, because if one doesn't believe in justice, there is nothing else to do.  We believe in justice.  We are before you.  We still believe in justice unless we have something to blame ourselves for.  And it's my hope that soon we will tell you what kind of fault we have committed.  When a trial is adjourned, each and every one has to go home to rest and to greet those who -- or commend you for this trouble that you go through every day. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, let me now get to the judgement rendered on the 17th of June with respect to the first count, namely, that of genocide.  I would like once more to say that errors were made. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It will be helpful if you would mention what ground you were on.  What ground of appeal are you on?  What ground are you now, what ground of appeal?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
I am on the first ground of my appeal, namely, the errors committed.  Thank you.  That's okay, 
Mr. President. 

I was saying, Your Honours, that errors were committed by Trial Chamber, that is, with respect to the evidence adduced in support of the crime of genocide. 

Now, the Trial Chamber brought Witness TAW.  That witness had the gift of being everywhere at once, for having claimed, to having heard, seen or even guessed things, whereas he wasn't there.  It was this witness who said that early in the morning on the 7th of April 1994, the accused met Major Ndekezi at the temporary gendarmerie camp in Rwanteru.  He met Major Nsabimana at the military camp of 
la chute and, in the same day, Colonel Rwagafirita of the gendarmerie.  That appears in the judgement of paragraph 42.  

He even adds that the Accused, as the secretary of the commune, to type a message intended for the conseiller de secteur summoning them to a meeting the next Saturday, namely, the 9th of April 1994.  He even states that the message was given to the persons concerned by the communal policemen.  And this appears in the judgement, paragraph 43. 

Yet today, in the case before, it is public knowledge that in 1994, there was never a gendarmerie camp in the Rusumo commune, that there was no Major Ndekezi in Rusumo, let alone a Major Nsabimana in 1994 in Rusumo. 

The Prosecutor, who, at the time, had the possibly to verify or to check on such evidence, did not engage in that exercise.  The Defence tendered a document titled, "Situation of the officers or status of the officers in the Rwandan army" from the ministry of defence and dated 5th of March 1994.  And in that document, it is clear that there was no gendarmerie major serving in the Rusumo commune in April 1994 and that there was no gendarmerie officer by the name Rwagafirita in that unit on that date. 

Well, as for the summoning of anyone, the Trial Chamber felt that it was an insignificant diversion.  That appears on judgement, paragraph 83.  
The Accused stated further on the 7th of -- that on the 7th of April, he met his superior, a neighbour in the service, a sous-préfet by the name Joseph Habimana.  

TAW stated that on the 8th of April 1994, the Accused participated in a meeting not far from Kibungo that was summoned and chaired by the so-called Colonel Rwagafirita, where, in actual fact, the said meeting was summoned and chaired in the meeting hall of the préfecture by the préfet, Ruzindana, Godfroy.  That meeting was read over the radio, and the tape was disclosed by the Prosecutor to the Defence, and that appeared as exhibit -- or tendered as exhibit here.  But the Trial Chamber didn't take that into account. 

TAW, since he is the only one, stated before the Court that on the 9th of April, the Accused presided over a meeting which was attended by conseiller, heads of cellule, and representatives of political parties.  He claimed that one conseiller, who was heard as Witness TBH before this Court, participated in that meeting.  And he said that at the meeting a discussion was held with respect to the distribution of weapons for the destruction of the Tutsis. 

In addition, Prosecutor brought Witness TBH, who was a conseiller, who is alleged to have told TAW that there was a distribution of weapons or the promise was made that weapons would be distributed for the destruction of the Tutsis.  And that was on the 25th of August 2003, that that testimony was provided.  TBH stated before this Court that during that meeting, which he attended, there was no question on -- no issue raised with respect to the distribution of weapons. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, my own humble experience cannot be compared to yours, but for the first time, this witness, TBH, for more than 20 minutes, not even being questioned by the Prosecutor, not even by the Defence, but by the Bench, he said he had never heard of any such meeting prior to his arrival in Arusha to testify as a witness.  

Later on, you will understand that he came to Arusha in 2003, whereas in that indictment dated 2001, there are paragraphs dealing with what he said.  We will get back there.  

When TBH said that he said nothing to anyone, we had expected the Trial Chamber to note that inconsistency between what TAW said and what this witness said. 

Despite that flagrant inconsistency, the Trial Chamber found that there was corroboration in those testimonies.  TAW said on the 10th of April 1994, the Accused collected boxes or cartons, depending on the versions, and those boxes contained weapons.  Whereas, during the trial, he was the only one to have seen the cartons or boxes containing weapons.  In the course of cross-examination, he said he did not touch any of those boxes, nor did he see the type of weapons contained therein.  He then added, "I did not have the strength to offload those cartons.  I stayed in the vehicle, and I was worried."  That was during the session of the 20th of August 2003, page 70, paragraphs 26 to 29.  

Yet in paragraph 58 of the judgement, it is alleged that he assisted the Accused in offloading 15 boxes or cartons.  Yet, the witness had said, "I didn't touch those boxes," whereas in the judgement it is stated that he assisted the Accused in offloading the boxes. 

And yet on that same day of the 10th, there were disturbances in the same secteur of Nyamugali, and the Accused was involved, allegedly.  And for the Accused to be involved, he was assisted in this by AU3, a Defence witness.  

The Chamber admitted that AUW (sic) was acting by deduction, and this is in the judgement at paragraph 84.  It is said that he was acting on the basis of deduction.  This is a witness who is acting on the basis of deduction, and he is forgetting that what he said is going to lead to a sentence -- sentencing of someone who is 53 years old.  TAW admitted at the end of his cross-examination, he said that he could not lie on this point, whereas he had already amply done so on other matters, namely, that the Accused did not know how to handle weapons.  If he said that, he admitted implicitly and necessarily that he had already lied. 

When he was examined on the 20th of August 2003, AW (sic) said that there was one certain Sebundani who said, "Your Honours, when we arrived in Arusha on the 1st of February 2006, the Prosecutor disclosed to us -- urgently disclosed to us information dealing with disclosure of 
disculpatory (sic) evidence by the Prosecutor on appeal."  

Your Honours, my speech of a few moments ago may be representing anything, but this is what I have become in February 2006, in other words, a few days before the hearing before this Chamber.  And this disclosure was done on the basis of Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  In other words, each time that the Prosecutor is in possession of evidence which might exculpate the Accused, this evidence should be produced and disclosed to the Defence. 

May I continue, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Thank you.  Thank you.  

I was saying, Mr. President, and I'm sure you yourselves received the same document, this disclosure which the Prosecutor has just given, as we speak, but it is difficult, Your Honours.  This document is dated 18th March 2003.  

The Prosecutor claims that it has just received a document which was dated 18th March 2003.  It's not the date which is important.  What you need to see in this document ******************* allegedly was at the commune and was allegedly sacked by Gacumbitsi two years earlier, and that's what is said.  

The last sentence of his testimony to the Prosecution is important:  "It is not because at the time I had been **************************** at the commune that I allegedly made these allegations against Gacumbitsi.  That is not true."  Gacumbitsi was sentenced in 2004, and the document was in October, but we did not receive it. 

Your Honours, when I asked A -- TAW at the time, "While you were there, who was helping Gacumbitsi?"  And then they gave the name of this witness.  And even before the testimony of that witness, **********************, he said that in April 1994 he was a farmer.  And he, at the time -- in 2003 he was at Nsinda prison.  

Now, if you have found that passage, Your Honours, I will come back to what I had told you earlier regarding TBH.  The Prosecutor did not look but for witnesses who had had problems with Gacumbitsi before the events of 1994.  And we'll come back to this in a moment, and you will see how a document can be fabricated, how evidence can be trumped up.  And it is done with a great deal of finesse.  Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  You know when you want to arrest somebody and have him sentenced, anything is possible.  But I am happy to note that the Appeals Chamber will see in different light what we have done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, are you moving on to a different ground now?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
I am still with the first ground, Mr. President, because in relation to what I prepared as a brief, this information has just come to disturb everything, because I wasn't aware of it.  I did not have it in my possession, and I would wish to use this information, unless there is a contrary view on your part, 
Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  That's just an inquiry from me.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Much obliged, Your Honour. 

Another thing, Mr. President, Your Honours, regarding -- 

May I proceed, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I was saying that the other disturbing witness by the Prosecutor is Witness TBH.  TBH was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment in Rwanda.  He came before the 
Trial Chamber, and he testified that he attended the meeting and that Gacumbitsi never spoke of any distribution of weapons but that Gacumbitsi had asked them to go and kill Tutsis. 

When he is asked whether during his trial in Rwanda he mentioned Gacumbitsi's name, he says that he did so on several occasions, in his confession and during trial.  I looked at the judgement and his confessions, but the name does not appear.  The Chamber stated that he was a credible witness.  TBH is one of the rare witnesses who said during trial that the Prosecutor came to see him on a Friday to tell him that the statements that he had done previously were not in conformity with others and he needed to change them so that he could come and testify before the Trial Chamber.  He said this in public, but in the judgement it is stated or determined that that witness is a credible witness. 

The other witness is the famous Witness TBI who is sentenced at Nsinda prison.  He states that Gacumbitsi allegedly asked a group of 40 people, both Hutus and Tutsis, to kill Tutsis.  He states further that on the same day, Gacumbitsi asked André Nyandwi to stop Tutsis from crossing the Akegera river in boats.  And that was on the 14th of April.  But this version of facts by TAW, he said that these events took place on the 10th of April.  And this is appearing at paragraph 58 of the judgement. 

The Accused is asking that Tutsis be killed before 40 or 50 people, both Hutus and Tutsis.  On the same day, the 14th, he too tells the people who killed the Tutsi, says, "Do not kill the conseiller de secteur because he's a Tutsi."  And that witness said that this Tutsi is alive, and his property was never looted.  This is at paragraph 80 of the judgement, Your Honours.  

It is said that Tutsis were supposed to be killed, and the secteur conseiller was not supposed to be killed.  The person is allegedly alive, and his property was never -- was never looted.  The Defence provided sufficient evidence that from the evening of the 13th April 1994, the Accused was hiding following death threats from wrongdoers following consecutive arrests and security meetings. 

RDR said that on the 14th of April he saw neither the Accused nor any official or responsable from the secteur.  He further said and testified that there was never any meeting in his area in April 1994.  

There was sufficient -- the Defence adequately showed that there was abundant counter-truths in this case.  TBJ is the one who claimed that he walked 10 kilometres in one hour, and he testified before the Trial Chamber Judges that they could not find the Accused in Kigarama, and yet, TBJ also could not find him.  He could not find the Accused in Kigarama, because that person had, from the 13th, been in hiding. 

From the witness statements one fact stands out.  Besides the detainees who have come from Rwanda to testify, no one met or saw the Accused on the 14th of April 1994.  The Chamber, in concluding that these -- these witnesses were credible, committed a serious error of fact which invalidates the conclusions in the judgement and, thereby, the verdict. 

Your Honours, each time that I give you the name of a witness, I am telling you what is the relationship between that witness and the Accused.  I have spoken about his driver who testified before the 
Trial Chamber, a friend from many years, did not protect his -- his property, whereas he had left him a letter.  Gacumbitsi was his friend, and he was going to look after his children.  I hope that when he was saying this, he was believing that before your Chamber, people were still being condemned to death, and yet, this is not the case.  

TAQ.  I spoke about the finesse of the Prosecution.  Who was TAQ?  TAQ is a young woman, a Tutsi woman, who ******************************************************************************************* repudiated her, and ************************************************************************************* husband.  And the Accused tried in vain to have that marriage restored, but he failed, and that was a humiliation for him.  And that is how the Prosecutor came to look for her.  

TBH was ********************************, and he was in position, but when -- 
MR. WESTON:
Your Honour, I hesitate to interrupt, but there are some matters which my learned friend has just raised which need to be discussed in the absence of the public regarding identity of witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're asking for a closed session?  
MR. WESTON:
That is so, Your Honour, yes.  If my friend is going to continue on doing what he's doing now, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, your colleague on the other side is asking for a closed session, but only if you continue with your present line of speech making.  Are you going to continue with that line?  Shall we grant him a closed session?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Your Honours, very respectfully, I do not believe we need to go into a closed session.  Since I have started speaking before you, I have only mentioned the pseudonyms of protected witnesses.  The only time when I gave names is what was disclosed to me.  Ever since I've spoken, I've been speaking of TAW, TAQ, and so on and so forth.  I've never revealed any identity whatsoever.  

And Mr. President, Your Honours, the last decision of the Chamber concerning my motion stated, and that is the situation, because one of the people -- the Prosecutor disclosed this to me.  One of the protected witnesses testified in open court in Brussels.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you heard the Defence say, in effect, that they have no intention of disclosing the identity of witnesses, that they have only so far referred to pseudonyms.  I take it that included in that submission is an averment that they have no intention of disclosing the identity of any protected witnesses.  Do you still propose having a closed session?  
MR. WESTON:
Your Honour, the problem is that my learned friend, in discussing the witnesses he's just been speaking about, gave evidence identifying them which was given only in closed session during the trial and not found in the judgement.  That is my concern.  I accept, of course, he did not give their names, but he gave other evidence which was used only in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shall we proceed, and if he does that, then you can raise a new objection?  
MR. WESTON:
Very well, Your Honour.  Yes, I'll place that on the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Our colleague wishes to ask a question.  
JUDGE MERON:
Just to continue on the guidance that my learned presiding Judge gave you, Counsel.  I think the message to you is that you should not describe protected witnesses while you are giving, of course, the letters only, in such a way that the person in the public out there would be able to guess who they are.  So, please, be careful on that, because in one case I believe that you went beyond that line.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Honourable members of the Appeals Chamber, if I went too far, I do apologise.  And if this proves to be true, I withdraw.  

Please take paragraph 109.  It's the judgement which gives the identity of the witness.  And I only provided the pseudonym.  It's in the judgement, and the judgement is public.  Please take paragraph 109, and the witness is described in full.  I am not the guilty party in this case. 

Let me proceed by your leave, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, we shall now be moving to the fourth ground of my appeal, but this -- we shall come back to this witness much later, because when we look at the matters which deal with this particular point, it is the witness who testified that she saw Gacumbitsi at the Nyarubuye parish on the 15th and the 17th of April 1994.  

On the 17th of April 1994, TAQ said the following before the Chamber:  "I was hiding in the bushes," she claims.  "I saw a convoy of three vehicles going past.  In those three vehicles megaphones were being used.  I recognised Gacumbitsi's voice."  When asked by the Judge whether she saw Gacumbitsi in the vehicle, she answered no.  "Who did you recognise in the vehicle for you to say that that was Gacumbitsi's vehicle?"  She answered, "I recognised his driver, the driver."  "What was his driver's name?"  ************************* And that statement has just been disclosed to us by the Prosecution, and that was taken in 2003. 

Now, Gacumbitsi is going to commit genocide, and he's -- he's being driven ***************.  I don't see why we should be having a closed session.  This is what is written here in black and white.  I have not betrayed anyone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. WESTON:
Your Honour, again I'm loath to interrupt, but the material which my learned friend is relying upon does not form part of the judgement, it does not form part of the trial record.  It was disclosed recently as part of the Rule 68 disclosure by the Prosecution.  If my learned friend wishes to use that evidence or that material in any way, in my submission, it should be done properly, that is, by way of a Rule 115 application.  That is, he must demonstrate how it satisfies the criteria laid down by Rule 115.  

It is unfortunate the evidence -- or the material was disclosed so late.  However, that does not permit my learned friend to come here now and use the material in that way and circumvent the Rule 115 procedure.  I respectfully submit that my learned friend withdraw the submission he's just made.  If my learned friend does wish to rely upon the document that he does have, the application should be brought in the proper way.  Those are my submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel, that point, to be sure, occurred to the Bench.  The material communicated by the Prosecution to you and to the Bench does not form part of the record until and unless you have made a Rule 115 motion and that is determined in your favour.  So will you please refrain from referring to this material?  Right?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Mr. President, Mr. President, Your Honours, I thank you for those observations.  But it's certain two days after I received this document, I was approached and I was informed that they regretted having disclosed them to me.  If that is the case, Mr. President, Your Honours, there is no problem whatsoever.  

But the Prosecutor is well aware from the first day we have been here and we are looking for the truth.  What is it that is going to lead us to the truth?  We need to go through Rule 115.  I've tried to use motions on the information that I had on the trial in Brussels.  And I come here and I did not know that lies were told to the Judges of the Trial Chamber.  And, Your Honours, should we adjourn so that I can go and file my motion?  This is information which is contained in all of the Gacumbitsi trial.  What do we need to do?  How should we proceed?  Do I need to file a motion for an adjournment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're not here to give you any advice.  You must chart the course ahead of you as seems best.  What we are keen on is to proceed with the oral arguments on the existing basis.  Now, will you kindly proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Much obliged, Mr. President, Your Honours. 

Mr. President, Witness TAO claimed before the Judges of the Trial Chamber that he saw Gacumbitsi at the Nyarubuye parish on the 15th of April at 1300 hours.  And this witness said at trial that Gacumbitsi arrived.  Initially he saw the witness arrive, and then later on he, rather, saw his vehicle arrive.  And this is at paragraph 119 of the judgement.  And that some time later he took a machete and cut off Murefu's head. 

Mr. President, having been heard on the 15th of April 1994, in other words, four years after the events, TAO did not mention anything about this cutting off of Murefu's head.  This is such a horrible scene, and how can it be forgotten in such a short period of time?  But since he was heard on the 20th and on the 30th and the 31st, maybe the Trial Chamber felt that what the witness had said was credible. 

When you look at the Prosecution witnesses' statements, statements which were not either consistent nor corroborated, the Defence produced Witness NG2, who was living in Rukira commune, was one such witness.  And he was amongst the attackers at Nyarubuye parish.  And he said that he never saw the Accused there.  

ZHZ was amongst the assailants, and he was also living in Nyarubuye.  He stated that on the 14th of April there was an attack on Nyarutunga at the Birembo area, and that the attack was led by gendarmes from Murundi, and that it was the same gendarmes who were later to be seen at the parish on the 15th.  

Given the events that took place in Nyarubuye, Your Honours, for which the Defence has done a great deal of work, the Accused has always denied his participation, not only because he was against violence in his commune and -- because he was also informed of this on the 16th of April by someone who was living in Birembo, and it is claimed that this information came from one Brigadier Neza.  Paragraph 133 and 134 of the judgement.  He never said any such thing. 

Regarding the credibility of witnesses, I said a moment ago that the Chamber had found all witnesses to be credible, despite what I have said to you earlier.  But the Chamber is full of praise and determined that the witness statements, statements of witnesses for Prosecution, and it -- the Chamber simply or merely concludes that it had taken note.  

Honourable Judges of the Appeal Chamber, you will see that the Judges of the Trial Chamber said that the testimony of the Defence witnesses were true, but there is some disequilibrium, and this is in relation to the presentation of evidence by the Prosecution and by the Defence, whereas Article 20 of the statute recommends that there be fairness and equality of arms.  We did not benefit from any such equality, Your Honours. 

In the provision of evidence for count 1, in other words, genocide, the Accused is reproached for having been guilty of murder for members of the Tutsi ethnic group and for having caused serious bodily harm with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group. 

To find an accused person guilty of the genocide, the Chamber must be convinced that he had the requisite intent under Article 2 of the statute.  Then it must be demonstrated that the alleged perpetrator committed one of the acts spelled out with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group as such, based on national, racial, ethnic, or religious grounds.  That position was set out various times by international jurisdictions.  Let me mention Ntakirutimana, paragraph 784, the Bagilishema judgement, paragraphs 60 and 61, Musema, paragraph 164, and Rutaganda, paragraph 49. 

In the rightfully impugned judgement, the Chamber rightfully points out that to destroy, in whole or in part, an ethnic group does not imply a numeric approach.  It is sufficient to prove the Accused acted with intent to destroy a substantial part of the target group.  Judgement, paragraph 258.  

In their factual findings, the Chamber found that the Accused did murder Murefu, and yet, the Accused not only denied killing anyone, even more, he was never prosecuted for killing a certain Murefu. 

The indictment is the sole charging instrument.  Nowhere does it list the name of Murefu.  Here it is important to point out the essential elements of a crime in response to the seven following questions necessary for any investigation for Prosecution for the judgement:  First, who committed the crime?  Where was the crime committed?  When was it committed?  What was committed or omitted?  Who is the victim?  What is the meaning of the crime?  And why was the crime committed?  

Your Honours, each time that an investigator, a Prosecutor, or Judges do not respond to those criteria, there are strong chances that the decision is defective. 

As I was saying earlier, TBJ declared that the witness said that no Hutu should be touched, but incited that Tutsis should be killed, unfortunately, was proven that the Accused was never in any of these places on the dates indicated.  All of these things, Mr. President, Your Honours, come from the fact that the indictment against Gacumbitsi was not on indictment at all with regard to genocide, for which the Chamber found that Gacumbitsi gave the signal to kill by killing Murefu -- by cutting off, rather, Murefu's head.  I should like to read a few names.  Here are the victims spelled out in the indictment.  There are 14 of them:  Kagumya, Gahondogo, Runuya, Maniriho, Kagumya, Gashumba, Mutempundu, Mukabera, Nyamvura, Mukadusabe, Bimenyimana, Uwiragiye, Mugiraneza, Tuyiringire in paragraph 12 of the indictment, paragraph 28 of the indictment.  Those are the 14 victims mentioned by the Prosecution in the indictment. 

In the judgement you have before you, Your Honours, there is no mention of any one of those.  None of them were adduced in evidence or talked about in evidence, and yet, the Chamber found new and different victims.  Here are you:  Murefu, Simon Buhonogo, Rugegena, Tassiana Mukamwiza, Marie, Béatrice, Rukomeza, Mutunzi, Vianney.  In paragraph 152, 176, paragraph 176, 179 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you will allow a colleague to put a question.  
JUDGE GÜNEY:  
Counsel, if I'm not mistaken, you are submitting your oral arguments with respect to ground 2 of the appeal regarding genocide.  Perhaps it would be opportune, if you would agree, to stress or clarify some matters regarding the mens rea for the crime of genocide and, additionally, tell us, if possible, the genocidal intent be established by drawing inferences on the facts and events in this case.  

Next, you can submit your arguments with regard to the fact that Mr. Murefu's murder was not mentioned.  As such, you will shed light on matters for the Chamber, and this certainly could help us in coming to an opinion on these matters.  Thank you.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
And thank you, Your Honour. 

When I mentioned the names of the victims in the indictment and in the judgement, it's because in the written submissions I did not mention them.  I developed my arguments in my various briefs.  
JUDGE GÜNEY:
Pardon me for interrupting you.  One more thing.  One more thing, Counsel.  You only have one hour remaining.  You only have one more hour for your submissions.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Absolutely, Your Honour.  That is why, unfortunately, I must move quickly, and I am taking into account what time it is.  And I do not want to go beyond the time that has been given to me. 

As I was saying, Your Honours, regarding to those -- with regard to those crimes, the Chamber committed an error in law saying that the Accused was guilty under 6.1 of the statute by virtue of his planning the alleged act with others.  This is in the judgement, paragraph 271.  In its legal submissions the Defence refuted at length the existence of others who had planned to commit genocide.  The Prosecution -- the Prosecution failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of all the people mentioned by Witness TAW.  The Accused could not have planned the crime alone, as planning presupposes that several people get together to conceive the crimes, the mode of perpetration and the possible consequences.  The Prosecutor never undertook such an exercise.  Gacumbitsi in those conditions attempted to prove his innocence.  Normally the Prosecution must prove his guilt.  We proved that we didn't do anything.  Where, in fact, we should have -- that should not have been the case. 

As I was saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, Trial Chamber III to find the Accused guilty of genocide did not establish the dolus specialis of the Accused.  Even if the motive is generally not a constitute of element of responsibility of crimes under the ICTR's jurisdiction, it may partially cover the special interests required to qualify the genocide and certain other crimes; that is true, legally.  

But I continue.  I will say, Your Honours, the legal assessment of genocide comes in after the facts, the facts committed or qualified.  If we don't have the facts, how can we validly qualify them?  I spent all of my time this afternoon demonstrating to you that the facts indicated didn't -- never existed.  If they don't exist, Mr. President, Your Honours, it's not jurisprudence or doctrine that will create them.  Facts will lead to a trial.  Facts and acts committed that are given a legal qualification, if they don't exist, how on earth -- pardon me, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

Judges are told such and such a man killed.  Judges know he didn't kill.  The Accused cannot defend himself.  What must we do?  The Judges know he didn't kill anyone.  We are raising different theories of law.  When you start out with facts, I broke them down.  From the very beginning Gacumbitsi said this that he didn't do anything.  It is in that context that I challenged his guilt on the count of genocide. 

Dolus specialis, Your Honours, requires that people act not only with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group qualified as such, but he has a willingness to achieve the result but also the consequences following from his actions.  They say Gacumbitsi asked that all the Tutsis be killed prior to the 12th, but he also said, "Don't kill any Tutsis in my secteur."  The criteria set out in law is that a person who is killed must belong to a targeted group because that group people seek to destroy in whole or in part.  Either Gacumbitsi asked that they be killed or he didn't ask that the Tutsis be killed. 

Your Honours, serious harm to the physical or mental integrity of members of the Tutsi ethnic group, with your leave, shall be examined when we look at rape.  But for the time being, the Chamber committed an error of law and fact by using the same facts to qualify genocide and extermination.  Namely, the Chamber, to find Gacumbitsi guilty of genocide, said that he killed Murefu.  The Chamber then said Gacumbitsi is guilty of extermination on the basis of the fact that he killed Murefu.  And yet, it was shown abundantly that nobody knows who Murefu is.  

The Prosecutor accuses Gacumbitsi to have personally committed criminal acts.  He must spell them out in the indictment:  The basic facts, such as the identity of the victim, the time and place of the crime, and the mode of perpetration.  The Chamber decided as such in Semanza in the judgement of 15th May 2003 in paragraph 45.  

For such serious acts, the Prosecutor absolutely had to specify the identity of the victims, perhaps not totally, but at least by indicating who they were, and he could base his arguments on that.  It doesn't seem to me -- Your Honours, you will see that with regard to that requirement to identify the victims, the indictment and the judgement of the judgement of the Chamber are completely opposed to one another.  No resemblance, no common traits between the indictment and the judgement with regard to Gacumbitsi's actions regarding those people who were killed.  

I told the Chamber, and you will find this in my submissions.  For example, contrary to Articles 18 -- 17 and 18 in the statute, one of the witnesses who's mentioned in the indictment was only heard on 
12 November 2002.  Gacumbitsi was arrested, therefore, and after that, they went looking for elements that could support their indictment.  But in law, you need the facts and elements in hand, and with those you put the indictment before the Judge to confirm or not the indictment.  I raised this issue in 2002.  Unfortunately, the Prosecution -- and I believe they produced evidence -- told the Tribunal.  When we get to the merits, you will have an opportunity to assess this. 

In another document, Mr. President, Your Honours, and the Prosecution acknowledged this -- this was also disclosed to me on 2 February when I arrived in Arusha -- they acknowledged that their indictment was vague and unspecific.  The Defence -- 
MR. WESTON:
Your Honour, I must object.  Again, with respect, my learned friend is going outside of the trial record and using material which was disclosed under Rule 68.  We submit it's inadmissible, and we object to its -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it Rule 68?  I take it he's referring to oral communications in which you gave notice on the way you would approach your arguments.  
MR. WESTON:
We object to any use of material that's not contained in the trial record.  I understood him to be using something that may pertain to the Rule 68 material.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, are you proposing to use any Rule 68 material, or were you referring to his other document in which he mentioned the approach that he would be taking during his oral arguments?  
(Pages 1 to 20 by Sherri Knox)



















1530H 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
It's what the Prosecution said.  It's the same document.  It's Rule 68 material.  It was under Rule 68 that the Prosecution disclosed the materials to me.  I believe, Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will you take heed of the point the Bench made to you before, that you cannot use that material without having moved a motion under Rule 115?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
That is correct, Mr. President.  But the document I have just raised is not a reference document.  There is another one.  It is not part of the trial record.  It's completely different.  And the Chamber's observation -- as you see, I have two different documents.  This was not the document.  I know what I will do with it in due time.  What I was talking about was a different document.  Let me proceed, with your leave, Your Honour.  

As I was saying before I was interrupted, the Defence believes that the vague and speculative nature of the indictment is aggravated by the fact that Gacumbitsi must answer to cumulative offences on the basis of acts that cannot be attached to a single indictment.  The Defence submits that in law it is inadmissible to charge both genocide and crimes against humanity purely on the basis of the same facts.  Furthermore, it is inadmissible to try a single individual in one indictment for genocide and complicity in genocide when he is the only person being tried.  

During his trial before the Trial Chamber, the Accused stated that following death threats on the 12th and 13th of April, he became frightened and went into hiding.  So to find him guilty of extermination and rape, the Chamber never said what they made of that alibi.  He said that during the 15th, 16th, 17th and following days he was hiding, and since hiding he was not able to write down in his diary what he was doing.  Even the Trial Chamber acknowledged on several occasions that the Accused was hiding, but he did not mention -- pardon me.  Even the Trial Chamber acknowledged on several occasions that the Accused person was hiding, but they didn't mention whether or not that influenced their decision.  This can be found in the judgement, paragraphs 81, 133 and 141.  That is why, Your Honours, that alibi was never dealt with, we submit.  And we propose to you that you rule and find that from the evening of the 13th to the next day, Gacumbitsi, since he was threatened with death, was hiding, and because he was hiding, the people who came to see him could not have seen him.  That's science fiction.  They couldn't see him, and if he wasn't there, he couldn't commit the crimes; and if he couldn't commit the crimes, it would be abnormal for him to be convicted on the basis of those acts.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I revert to my all too frequent interventions about the ground on which you were on, and may I also refer to Judge Güney's wise observation about the time you have left.  Could I ask that you leave a few minutes for the Judges to ask any questions.  You are due to finish at 4:15, and so I would suggest you conclude a few minutes before that time.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Most obliged, Your Honour.  I will do my best to respect those orders.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I am now dealing with ground of appeal regarding rape as a crime against humanity. 

Mr. President, the Trial Chamber found Gacumbitsi guilty of rape under Article 6(1) of the statute, because the Accused allegedly incited TAQ and another woman to be raped. The Defence established that that witness was not credible.  It is important to say that the Prosecution never proved beyond a reasonable doubt that there was such incitement to rape.  And that the Accused ever incited individual criminal responsibility to incur, under Article 6(1) to be met, means that a rape must have been committed, but also that those committing the rapes have acted on the orders of the Accused.  That presupposes a three-way correlation between the alleged rape, the alleged perpetrators and the Accused person.  Yet, the only witness, TAQ, never saw the witness (sic) on the 17th of April.  For his part, the Accused never saw those who may have raped TAQ.  We must say that those rapists, who were depicted as assailants who were chasing cattle, never saw the Accused, according to TAQ.  The only crime he is convicted of is the rape of TAQ and the other woman, and yet TAQ said that she did not see Gacumbitsi, but she said that Gacumbitsi said some things through the megaphone to other people, and those things incited people who were chasing cattle to go and rape.  TAQ did not see Gacumbitsi.  Gacumbitsi did not see any attackers.  The assailants did not see Gacumbitsi.  How can we then talk about incitement in such circumstances, Your Honours?  

The Prosecution must undertake that exercise.  I know that in 1994 there were many events in Rwanda, but here we are dealing with Gacumbitsi alone.  For incitement to be established, we need this three-way requirement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Schomburg wishes to ask a question.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Counsel, is it your submission that incitement to rape can only be committed in the way you tried to convince us that the inciter has to be present when the crime is committed, and, additional, the victim has to see or to be aware that the alleged inciter is at the crime site?  Is this really your submission?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  That is only a second part.  On the 17th of April 1994, Witness TAQ said he (sic) heard the voice of the Accused over a megaphone.  She did not see the Accused but heard his voice, but she saw his driver in the Accused's vehicle, but not the Accused.  Following that speech, she was raped, along with another woman.  The Judges say Gacumbitsi is guilty for that rape because he incited the rapists.  That is the issue here in this case, Your Honour.  

Following recommendations from Mr. President, we had some reservations.  We reserved our arguments.  You will see, Your Honours, the driver spoken about did not exist.  It was never proven that Gacumbitsi was present.  The only witness to this didn't see him.  She saw the driver.  The driver wasn't there.  Gacumbitsi says that, "I was in hiding."  Now, we have only the rapists who remain.  No one saw them either.  The victims -- and the victim is the only witness -- and this was only the second part of my argument, not the first.  

We start with the facts and then examine them with the law.  This case of rape could not have existed.  The constitutive elements for it, especially the material elements -- the lack of material facts, were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  

Your Honours, can we convict someone for incitement if the person herself doesn't know who incited, if we don't know what the incitement contained?  Here is someone who was hiding in a hole for days and days because people wanted to kill him, and now they say that 30 kilometres away from where he was staying, he is guilty of inciting rapes.  That is why I wanted to go over the legal elements of that crime.  But I started with the facts, and I hope that this answers your question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Güney will ask another question. 
JUDGE GÜNEY: 
I have a follow-up question, Counsel, following that of my honourable colleague, Judge Schomburg.  

Perhaps, regarding the ground of appeal dealing with rape as a crime against humanity, ground of appeal number 4, perhaps it would be useful for you to shed light on the matter by answering the question:  Were the rapes part of a generalised and systematic attack?  And the definition given of a systematic and generalised attack, what do you make of it?  The Trial Chamber gave a definition regarding the systematic and generalised attack -- a widespread and generalised attack.  Do you, first of all, agree with that definition?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Your Honours, the definition of a widespread attack given by the Trial Chamber is a legal one.  The definition of widespread and systematic attack is qualified.  Now, the question is the following:  In Rusumo commune, regarding that date and those acts, was there a widespread and systematic attack?  In the indictment and supporting materials, Prosecutor says that in Rusumo commune, in particular, and in Rwanda, in general, between the 1st of January and the 31st of December 1994 there were widespread and systematic crimes committed.  Perhaps that was the case.  Perhaps judicial notice was taken in other cases, but that wasn't the case here.  A widespread attack was not the basis of this allegation against Gacumbitsi with regard to the rape of TAQ and the other woman.  Even if we supposed, Your Honours, that there was a widespread and systematic attack, we must demonstrate that the Accused was part of the attackers and that he had 6(1) or 6(3) responsibility.  I have no problem whatsoever with the legal definition, but does it fit with this trial?  That is the problem that this Honourable Chamber has to deal with.  For the Defence, the answer is quite simply no, for the reasons that I spelled out and that I have also tried to explain to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Counsel.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Most obliged, Mr. President. 

Many submissions have been made with regard to the crime of rape.  Let me now deal with the last point in my appeal.  Your Honours, Gacumbitsi was convicted with a sentence of 30 years.  On the day of judgement he was 61 years old.  We had indicated, and submitted, and it was acknowledged, even by Prosecution witnesses, that Gacumbitsi was a model teacher, that Gacumbitsi was an honest bank manager, and that he was a model bourgmestre.  In their opening statement of 28 July, even the Prosecution says that he had "great relationships with the people, even with the Tutsis."  He had a brick-making operation with one of his Tutsi friends, even.

Mr. President, Your Honours, the life expectancy in Africa is now 45 years.  Just a few years ago it was 40 years.  Gacumbitsi is over 60.  If for some extraordinary reason you haven't followed me, if for some extraordinary reason you grant the Prosecution's request, and you must convict, do you believe that an old man, 63 years, who is before you today, can have the same sentence as someone who is 30 or 35?  

Gacumbitsi has a family.  He's a father of six, Your Honours.  I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that Gacumbitsi has an entire family that still lives in Rwanda.  His wife and children do.  Despite the fact that he is in prison in Arusha, Gacumbitsi is known in society as someone who did nothing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  

Gacumbitsi has a family in Rwanda.  His wife and children are there.  If Gacumbitsi committed the acts alleged against him, there would have been revenge on his family.  Even Prosecution witnesses acknowledged this:  That thanks to Gacumbitsi many people were saved.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, perhaps this man will stand before you tomorrow and you will see -- I am asking you to do this, not simply because you have pity on him, but to do it based on the UN resolution that created this Tribunal.  

Mr. President, let me remind you:  You remember that I wrote a letter to you telling you that there was a trial in Brussels, Belgium, regarding events at Nyarubuye.  During that trial, there were two accused persons with more than 50 witnesses.  It demonstrated adequately that those who were being prosecuted were rich businessmen.  They organised, they prepared, and financed, and funded, and personally killed and raped during the events in Rwanda.  The Judges in Brussels convicted those category 1 criminals to ten and 12 years respectively.  

One of your missions, Your Honours, with regard to that resolution is to promote the reconciliation of the Rwandan people.  For Gacumbitsi, his family and children are in Rusumo in the same neighbourhood, in the same home.  Your decision must allow him to go back to his children.  

Many want to return home -- there are not many who would not want to return home.  And so, Mr. President, a conviction for 30 years -- a sentence of 30 years is not a sentence of hope, especially based on the facts that the events as I described never occurred.  

The last thing I wish to say, Mr. President, which is why I said that the court of assizes in Brussels gave me the judgement.  One of the witnesses I mentioned, who figures in my submissions, is a complainant in that trial in Brussels, is claiming damages -- is claiming damages in Brussels and has requested damages during the entire time they were before that tribunal or that court.  At no point in time did he ever say that he saw Gacumbitsi with those people who were tried in Brussels.  

Your Honours, Mr. President, taking into account the time allotted to me -- as I was saying, Mr. President, the last thing -- the last request that I make of you on behalf of Gacumbitsi, in the case you are still not convinced, is to be part of the history of that country.  Give Gacumbitsi a sentence of hope.  

He wishes to go back to his family.  In so doing, I am convinced that you will have administered sound and equitable justice.  I thank you very much, Your Honours, for your kind attention.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Meron.  

JUDGE MERON: 
Could I ask a question of the Prosecutor?  

Prosecutor, it seems to me that earlier during the hearing the Defence tried to draw our attention to material which has been disclosed to him, apparently recently under 68, and that you objected on the ground that this was not introduced to us under Rule 115.  Did I understand you correctly?  
MR. WESTON:
That is correct, Your Honour, yes. 
JUDGE MERON: 
Would you please guide us on the following question:  Under 68E the obligation -- the disclosure obligation applies also, of course, after the end of the trial, after the completion of the trial, so that material does not form part of the record of the trial: right?  
MR. WESTON: 
Yes, that is so, Your Honour.  Yes.  
JUDGE MERON:
So in what way is 115 the only way in which the Defence can draw our attention to exculpatory material?  
MR. WESTON:
Your Honour, our submission is that the evidence -- or the material -- to use a neutral term -- material has now come to light.  The Prosecution in disclosing the material did so, if I may say so, out of an abundance of caution.  We take a certain position that the material does not exculpate the Accused, but it potentially may be seen by others to have that affect, so that is why out of fairness it was disclosed.  That being so, we say that if the material -- for the material to be considered by this Court, the material, as it was not part of the trial record -- and I don't seek to blame anyone for that -- but as it was not part of the trial record, the onus is now upon the appellant to show that that material could satisfy either the threshold test under Rule 115, that is, it either could or would affect the verdict.  We, of course, say that it can never satisfy that test on its face.  

Now that material has been disclosed, the appelllant is trying to make use of that material to draw certain conclusions of fact.  That witness has not, of course, been subject, for example, to cross-examination.  We submit that the only mechanism provided for under the Rules of Procedure and Evidence for the reception of such evidence is under Rule 115, and the appellant has not tried to do that.  As it is not part of the trial record, he cannot go behind the trial record and use it now in the form that he was using it.  If the appellant wishes to make any use of it, we submit that it should be done in the form of a Rule 115 application.  They are my submissions, Your Honour.  
JUDGE MERON: 
Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecutor, as you will appreciate, sometimes views are divided on the Bench as, indeed, with all members of the legal fraternity.  But my views correspond very largely with your own position, and I shall proceed accordingly.  

What I want to ask Defence counsel is this -- I am referring to paragraph 12 of the indictment.  Is a man -- paragraph 12 of the indictment -- you are with me, Counsel?  Paragraph 12 of the indictment.  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Yes, I am with you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, a man may be charged for the genocide of thousands of people.  Is there something in the law which obliges the Prosecution to identify each one of those victims and to give a specific description of each one, or is it sufficient if the Prosecution files an indictment against the Accused alleging that he committed genocide against thousands of people?  Does he have to -- does the Prosecution have to condescend to details of each and every one of the thousand-odd victims?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
I am obliged, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I will start by the end of your question, if you allow me.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, serious crimes against humanity, genocide, extermination, acts of violence, are so serious, and quite often are committed on such a scale as well, if you were to ask a Prosecutor to identify all the victims, say, a thousand deaths or a thousand murders, that would not be easy.  No human being can ask that of a Prosecutor, Mr. President.  I fully am aware of that.  However, Mr. President, in those circumstances, I have never been a prosecutor -- where the Prosecutor says in Arusha on the 8th of February 2006 there were 10,000 deaths, and everyone does recognise that there were a lot of deaths, and then on the day of trial he is going to produce people who are going to identify those who are dead - died -- sorry. That is what is required in legal logic.  

Now, on the 12th, the Prosecutor provides the names, he provides the names, and I am sure -- I am looking at you -- that from your extensive career, it is the first time that all the names mentioned, all the victims were not subsequently maintained or upheld by the Appeals Chamber.  Now, what worries me in this whole case is that it would appear as if the judgement substituted some other victims for that of the Prosecutor.  Now, under the rules, say, 47, it says, "If the investigation allows for adequate or sufficient evidence in support of his submission that the victim has committed -- sorry, the Accused has committed (unintelligible) and an indictment is provided, together with all the supporting material, so these are the names that were provided."  You see, when the confirming Judge sees the names of the victims, naturally he would be following the indictment.  

It is my view, Your Honours -- except my reasoning cannot hold water -- that what the Trial Chamber should have done was, of all the victims mentioned, none, indeed, existed, instead of going to seek out its own victims in order to convict Gacumbitsi.  That is the requirement, sir.  

I am referring to the Trial Chamber, sir.  I must have said Appeals Chamber, whereas I was talking about the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In that matter, Mr. Kouengoua, we all commit lapses in lingua very often -- I do -- so that is not a matter for any degree of regret.  

What I have to ask you is this:  Take the case which I have instanced.  Suppose the Trial Chamber was in this position that it was satisfied that hundreds of people were killed; does the failure of the Trial Chamber to make a finding in respect of these 12 names conflict with the import of its finding that hundreds of people were killed?  You see, when you read this indictment, it says -- paragraph 12 says, "Many civilian Tutsi were killed, among them Kagumya,"  et cetera.  So these were only examples of the fact that many people were killed.  What I want to know from you, is the failure of the Trial Chamber to make a finding in respect of these names which were specifically mentioned, is that necessarily in contradiction with its main finding that many people were killed, assuming that it so finds?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Mr. President, the most plausible position would have been the following.  On the 12th, Prosecutor would mention people among the thousand that were killed.  Then he appeared before the Court, and the Court discovers that there were some other people who were killed but who were not mentioned or listed by the Prosecutor.  Then the Chamber, or the Court, would then add to the number of victims, that is, those already mentioned by the Prosecutor in the indictment.  In other words, when reading the judgement, we shouldn't have ten or 14 victims, we should have, say, 24.  That would make sense.  What the Chamber is telling the Prosecutor, implicitly, is that the victims you are talking about in your indictment were not mentioned by any witness.  And that is the truth.  The Prosecutor acts on the basis of the information he obtains.  The Prosecutor wasn't there when the acts were committed.  He is not expected to provide the names of all the victims, but if he did so -- and Rule 47 is quite clear in this -- in other words, he carried out investigations.  But the Trial Chamber cannot replace the Prosecutor -- when it comes to replace the Prosecutor.  I do not believe -- and I did seek your leave -- in law, and in my own practice, a crime can be disqualified when it comes in a certain order that the Trial Chamber cannot replace or substitute or add some other victim.  It cannot even identify a victim which was not mentioned in the indictment by the Prosecutor.  So that is the issue, Your Honours.  The victims appearing in the judgement are those mentioned with no reference.  The Prosecutor surely must have conducted investigations and they must have been consistent. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me ask you another question, if I may.  You referred to the killing of Murefu, and I believe you had in mind paragraph 285 of the judgement, which said, "Having mentioned the killing of Murefu, the Chamber, therefore, finds that he committed the crime genocide."  And the Chamber was concerned there with the word "committed" as distinguished from the other words in Article 6, paragraph 1.  

Now, when you turn to page 43 of the judgement, you find that the Chamber found that the Accused -- "The Accused directed the attack and participated in it."  You have 171, "The Chamber finds that the Accused directed the attack on the 16th of April and the attack of the previous day."  And you find in paragraph 172 that the Chamber found that "The Accused directed the attacks against Tutsi civilian refugees, and personally took part in the attacks."  So isn't that a little wider, do you think, than merely linking the genocide to the killing of Murefu?  What I am putting to you is this:  If you read paragraph 285 of the judgement, you get an impression that the committing of genocide -- you are not hearing me, Counsel?  
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
No, I am following you very well, sir.  You said 172 or -- I don't know whether you have a French version, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me go back.  Yes, that could be the problem.  That could be the problem.  Well, if you look at page -- paragraph 285, 285, of the judgement, you get the impression that the Chamber was linking the committing of genocide to Murefu's killing.  But when you look at the other paragraphs to which I have averted your attention, it looks there as if the Chamber was saying, "Well, look, he directed these attacks and he personally engaged in them."  So does that -- is that susceptible of meaning that the Chamber took the view that this man committed genocide, not merely because of Murefu's death, but also because he participated in the attack, and he directed the attacks, and he personally engaged in them? 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
(Microphones overlapping)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, I am being (unintelligible), Counsel. 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Obliged, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, the problem here is that no reasonable person can say in this courtroom that in 1994 there weren't killings, or there weren't murders in Rwanda, and specifically, in the Rusumo commune, which is a correct global approach to the matter . But the problem -- and that is my concern -- it is that Gacumbitsi says, "I wasn't there."  And the Prosecutor says, "You were there.  And the evidence lies in the fact that you killed Gashumba, Mutempundu," et cetera, which is an element of evidence of the involvement or participation of Gacumbitsi in the attacks.  Now, when the Judge weighs the evidence, notices that if we move in that direction, Gacumbitsi really was not there because these people mentioned here, "We don't know where the Prosecutor got them from."  In the case of Murefu, they say that the launching of the attacks were initiated by the Accused, who killed Murefu.  Yet, Your Honours, it was not during the trial that Gacumbitsi committed genocide.  That genocide was committed in 1994.  The indictment was prepared in 2001.  When we received this indictment we drew the attention -- or we sought its amendment before the Trial Chamber.  Even if the Prosecutor had wanted to bring in new elements, for instance, in the case of Murefu, according to Rule 50 the Prosecutor could have sought authorisation to amend this indictment.  How can we bring in things that do not figure in the indictment before the Trial Chamber and such matters considered by the said Trial Chamber?  

Gacumbitsi mounted his defence on these 14 deaths appearing in the indictment.  When the trial starts on the 21st of July, he is told that he has to defend himself against the death of Murefu, whereas that never appeared in the indictment.  That is the problem I think. The requirement of the statute and the rules do clearly state that the Accused must be informed of what he has done so that he can mount his defence properly.  Throughout this trial, we tried to defend ourselves based on those 14 deaths listed by the Prosecutor.  At the end of it all, and at the very last minute, some ten deaths are pulled out of the hat.  They don't appear in the list.  And now we are being required to defend ourselves against those ten deaths.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kouengoua, my colleague Judge Schomburg has a question for you.  
JUDGE SCHOMBURG: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Coming back to paragraph 12 of the indictment, where it reads, "Many civilian Tutsi were killed, among them" -- and then a number of names follow.  Leaving aside for a moment those names, would you accept that among them, inter alia, Murefu would be one mentioned in the indictment among those, as it reads in paragraph 12?  And then in paragraph 285, that "the Accused killed Murefu and thereby committed the crime of genocide."  This is the factual side of my question.  The legal side:  Isn't it correct, that leaving aside all the other alleged victims, that it suffices for the crime of genocide that only one person was killed, that the core element of genocide is the intent to kill people.  We have the attempt, if nobody is killed; but if only one is killed, then it amounts to genocide.  Do you agree? 
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
Your Honour, when we talk about the crime of genocide, the approach is not necessarily in terms of numbers.  To kill 20 people, 50, or 100, that can be done without it being referred to or qualified as genocide.  Genocide arises when the perpetrator of such deaths or murders intends to destroy, suppress, all or part of a group based on racial, religious, political reasons.  That is how genocide is defined.  So even if you kill -- even if you injure one person within that definition, you could be found guilty.  But you can throw a bomb in this courtroom and 200 people are killed, genocide wouldn't have been constituted.  But just one person could be or could amount to genocide.  So we agree on that.  

Your Honour, if the Prosecutor says that I have killed someone because the person was Tutsi, I must say, first of all, whether I killed, whether I did not kill, and I have to plead guilty or not guilty.  For me to so plead, it must be stated in the indictment who they claim I killed.  Now, the Prosecutor gave 14 names, and the Accused says, "I didn't kill anybody," and then the Judges say, "No, you didn't kill anybody of the 14th," but then there are new names.  They could have added those new names in the indictment.  

The accusatory instrument before the Trial Chamber is the indictment.  We don't go beyond the indictment.  That is what triggers the trial.  So, it is improper, it is irregular.  If the accusatory instrument is vitiated, if it is vague and defective, as we say on our side, what does one do?  I believe it is your heavy -- your duty to overturn, to quash, because in the final analysis, it is better for there to be 10,000 murderers free than one innocent person in detention.  That could also serve as some genocide.  That is my answer, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kouengoua, for that remark and now we are -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the adjournment until a quarter to five.
(Court recessed at 1625H)
(Pages 21 to 31 by Judith Baverstock)











(Court resumed at 1645H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, before the proceedings resume, I would request the Registrar to redact any language potentially identifying any public witness from the public version of the transcript of these proceedings, including specifically the mention of a witness who was the wife of one of the appellant's relatives.  

With that, I would turn to the Prosecution and ask whether counsel is ready.
MR. WESTON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecution is ready to respond.  I might say, at the outset, I will address the grounds concerning genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity and the sentence ground raised by the appellant.  

My colleague, Mr. Mugwanya, will raise the ground of rape, as a crime against humanity, and, if necessary, my colleague, Ms. Osea will address the first ground of appeal, that is, the ground concerning the alleged procedural issues which have been raised.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  

If the Court pleases, the case against the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, for the crimes of genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity, and rape were perfectly straightforward.  The evidence led by the Prosecution, and the evidence accepted by the Trial Chamber, shows beyond any reasonable doubt the guilt of the appellant.  It is our submission that there has been nothing raised by the appellant today which could cause any reasonable trier of fact to come to the conclusion that the appellant was not guilty of the crimes of which he was convicted.  

It is our submission that it is necessary to look at all of the evidence which was called by the Prosecution against the appellant at his trial in an integrated manner, that is, to consider how the evidence of each witness coheres with the rest of the Prosecution case.  We submit that when that is done, the only reference that one can reasonably draw is that the appellant is, in fact, guilty of the three crimes in question.  

Now, it is certainly the case, in almost any case where you have eyewitness identification evidence plays some part, where you have a number of eyewitnesses giving evidence about the activities of a person over a number of days, in different locations, in a dynamic situation, where those witnesses perceive from a different vantage point, that there will be differences between the accounts given.  

That, really, is merely just a reflection of human nature.  The human beings, when seeing an event, when hearing an event, and recalling an event some years later will remember some things and may not remember others.  It would be rare that three people, seeing events such as the ones described here would be able to give a perfectly consistent, a perfectly matching account.  In fact, if that was done here, one would automatically become suspicious how witnesses would be able to do that. 

What the Prosecution has shown at trial, and on the appeal record is this:  That there is a detailed narrative which shows that the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, from early April 1994, was involved in the planning of attacks upon the Tutsi community; he was involved in the distribution of weapons; he was actively involved in the instigation of systematic violence by the Hutu majority towards the Tutsi minority; that he himself took a direct and leading role in the commission of that violence.  The body of evidence relied upon by the Prosecution comes from a number of different witnesses.  Contrary to the submissions which we have just heard from learned counsel for the appellant, it is the case, as the Prosecution submits, that a number of those witnesses do, in effect, support each other, that they do -- as the appellant uses the term -- in law corroborate each other.  

Now when anyone takes this integrated approach to looking at the evidence, not only does one see that each individual witness stands alone as a reliable, credible witness as to the events to which they testified, but also the totality of the evidence.  And I must stress that phrase, the totality of the evidence points unambiguously to the guilt of Mr. Gacumbitsi and, indeed, enhances the evidence of each individual witness.  

In evaluating the evidence, it is important to keep in mind that, of course, there is no requirement in any jurisprudence of this Tribunal, and there was certainly none cited by the appellant today which requires a witness to be corroborated.  

Furthermore, there is no requirement, whatsoever, that merely because a witness happens to be a victim or a survivor of an attack -- and obviously it is dealing with some traumatic event -- that their evidence must be approached with caution.  

Notwithstanding that, that seems to be the tenor of the appellant's written submissions and, if I may respectfully say so, the tenor of these submissions today.  

The evaluation of evidence is, quintessentially, a matter of impression for the Trial Chamber.  The 
Trial Chamber are the ones best empowered to assess the reliability and credibility of an individual witness and to determine the probative weight of such a witness.  

This Chamber, of course, can only intervene if the appellant can indicate, can illustrate, can point to, some error in the approach of the Trial Chamber which shows that no reasonable trier of fact could have come to the conclusion which the Chamber did.  

If I may commence with the first batch of witnesses who were discussed today by learned counsel for the Appellant, the (unintelligible) about the Witnesses TBH and TAW, each of these witnesses, of course, is an important witness for the Prosecution.  

Furthermore, there has been nothing shown today, in my submission, which would cause any doubt to be cast upon the reliability of the testimony of either of those witnesses.  

TBH, as the Chamber will recall, gave evidence of attending a meeting convened by the appellant where there was discussion, in fact, if you like, instructions given by the appellant to his subordinate that the Tutsi majority within the préfecture, within the commune, were to be mobilised, as it were, mobilised to commit acts of violence against the Tutsi.  TAW gave evidence of a meeting taking place, but not, of course, being present at that meeting.  

TAW said that TBH told him there was discussion of distribution of weapons.  TBH later, of course, said that he could not recall that.  

Now, as I said, the evidence to the effect of these witnesses is very important to the Prosecution, shows that right from the outset the appellant was involved in the planning of systematic violence by the Hutu against the Tutsi.  

Now, contrary to what my learned counsel for the appellant submitted today, the mere fact that there is a discrepancy between the accounts of TAW and TBH does not mean that the accounts of one or both witnesses can now be rejected.  

It, of course, is axiomatic that is a matter for the Trial Chamber, it is a matter open for the Trial Chamber to accept all of the evidence of a witness, to accept some of the evidence of a witness and to reject some of the evidence of a witness.  

The test, which my learned friend seems to be submitting, was this, that unless there was a perfect dovetailing between the testimony of two witnesses, unless their evidence matches perfectly, that the evidence of both is inherently suspect.  

That proposition is unfounded in law.  There is no (unintelligible) in jurisprudence which supports that proposition.  
Not only is it unsupported in law, it is our submission that, in fact, when you consider the evidence, it is actually quite a baseless submission.  

What we have is two witnesses giving evidence of an event in 2003; so, they are talking about an event that happened eight or nine years prior.  Both of them, of course, later witnessed traumatic events.  The mere fact that TAW may recall something which TBH doesn't, does not mean that TAW is a suspect witness.  Nor does it prove the reverse, that TBH, of course, is not telling the truth.  It is simply the fact that two men, after the event, recall matters differently.  

Now, it may be the case, of course, that TAW, knowing that the Accused did engage in -- or the appellant did engage in the collection and distribution of arms, and knowing that the appellant was involved in the systematic violence, one reason or another, subconsciously thought that TBH told him these things.  It really does not matter.  

At the end of the day we have this, both men attended the meeting; both men talk about the appellant, Gacumbitsi, indicating that violence is to be done to the Tutsi minority by the Hutu.  As I understand matters, the evidence of each man does, in fact, corroborate the evidence of each one.  

It is our submission -- and we set up the authorities in our written brief -- that it is not necessary for one witness to support another witness in every material way for their evidence to be supportive.  It is enough, we submit, that the evidence of a witness in some material manner, some material particular, supports the evidence of the witness in question.  

We, therefore, submit that there was no reason at all, demonstrated by the appellant today, as to why any doubt should be cast upon the credibility and reliability of either man.  That being said, the evidence of each man is undiminished; the evidence of each of them carries a significant degree of cogent and probative weight.  The Trial Chamber has not been shown to have committed any error in its approach in the evaluation of the witnesses.  

It was further suggested by counsel for the appellant that a number of witnesses, including TPH, are suspect because they are either accomplices or have suffered some other criminal sanction in Rwanda.  

Again, we say it is axiomatic within the jurisprudence of this Tribunal that merely because a witness may be legally characterised as an accomplice, there is no requirement for corroboration.  It is simply a matter for a Trial Chamber, assessing the witness, to determine what weight, if any, it will give to the witness's testimony.  That was done here, but, as we said, the question is moot.  There is, in fact, probative evidence for the witness of TBH.  
TBH, of course, is corroborated in a number of other ways.  The witness gives evidence about the business of the appellant on the 14th of April 1994 where the appellant instigated violence by driving to various marketplaces, speaking through a megaphone and urging the Hutu to attack the Tutsi.  

TBH's account, of course, is supported by the Witness TBJ.  Also you have the weight of the evidence of TBK and TBI who gave evidence of similar contact by the appellant at that time in other places.  We submit that the evidence of these witnesses be considered as an integrated whole, which is the only proper way to approach the witness.  It shows that TBH is both a reliable and credible witness.
We submit that there was no error in the approach of the Trial Chamber.  

If the Court pleases, another matter which was raised by counsel for the appellant today is this:  There was an attack made upon a large amount of the testimony of Witness TAW.  The Witness TAW gave evidence of accompanying the appellant on the 7th of April 1994 at various military or paramilitary camps where a large number of boxes were loaded onto vehicles.  There was some 105 boxes in total.  There was an attack made upon the (unintelligible) of that evidence because it was said that TAW did not know what was inside them; he did not know the contents of the boxes.  

The appellant seems to be submitting that one cannot draw inferences from proven facts, that unless there is direct evidence of every fact, a Trial Chamber must, therefore, lapse into error, and this is how you (unintelligible) the evidence.  This, again, cannot be so, and again we have addressed this matter in our written brief.  

The fact of the matter is this; there had been a meeting where the appellant, Gacumbitsi, had spoken about the need to begin a campaign of violence against the Tutsi.  The witness, TAW, drives around with the appellant to various military camps where a large number of boxes are loaded onto vehicles.  Now, it is true, of course, the witness does not see what's inside the boxes, he does not know the contents, but given those two salient facts, that is, that the appellant, Gacumbitsi, has indicated his belief or his intention that a campaign of violence was to start and that they are visiting military camps and loading boxes onto them, there is no other inference open, other than the boxes contained weapons of some description.  

Again, the learned counsel for the appellant has not demonstrated how the Trial Chamber may have lapsed into error, coming to that conclusion.  Therefore, again, no error has been demonstrated in the Trial Chamber's approach.  This Chamber now has no scope to intervene and overturn (unintelligible).  

The witness, TAW, was also attacked on the basis -- or criticised on the basis, I should say, that he named a number of military gendarme officers that the appellant was said to have spoken to when the weapons were collected.  It was said that there was a document placed in evidence from the ministry of defence, which indicates that those officers could not have been at the relevant camps at the relevant time.  Again, there is no reason to doubt the finding of the Trial Chamber on this point.  
The counsel for the appellant told the Court the relevant exhibit was cited 5 March 1994.  So that's a month before the events in question.  So, firstly, there may well be the case that in the time between the date of that document and the date of the events which we are considering, the offices, of course, did move to the location in question.  

Secondly, of course, it should be noted that the ministry of defence document is merely a hearsay document as such.  

But the important thing is this:  How can that document, now, cast any doubt upon the reliability of TAW's evidence?  The answer is he could not.  There would be no impediment to those offices being in that place at that time.  

Therefore, we submit that there was no error in the approach of the Trial Chamber in the evaluation of the witness, TAW.  

Now, if the Court pleases, there was also an attack upon the testimony of those two witnesses because they gave different dates, as to the time when a person called André was allegedly spoken to by the appellant.  Again, the mere fact that there might be a small discrepancy in dates, in our submission, does not show why the witnesses cannot be accepted.  

The fact of the matter is, as I submitted earlier, you are talking about witnesses giving evidence of matters some years later.  There was no reason to suspect that the witnesses would have had any reason to make a contemporaneous record of any of those dates.  The fact that there may be a four date discrepancy between the two witnesses about, essentially, the same matter cannot damage the credibility or liability of either witness.  If anything, if you do have two witnesses giving evidence about essentially the same fact, then you have the appellant speaking to a person named André and asking him to stop the flow of refugees across the river, the fact that those witnesses gave, mutually support each other.

The next body of criticism, as we understood the submissions made by counsel for the appellant, was this:  There was a general attack upon the reliability of the three Prosecution witnesses, who observed the appellant at the parish, over the three-day period between 15 and 17 April, that is the period in which some -- well, a large number of refugees were killed, possibly some thousands of them were killed.  
Again, it is unclear, in our respectful submission, of what the complaint of the appellant is.  As we submitted earlier, the mere fact that you have three persons who were part of a large crowd, and there was evidence there were many thousands of people at the parish, perhaps over 20,000, who obviously were seeing and hearing things from different vantage points, seeing and recalling things some years later in court, and seeing and hearing things which happened in a dynamic not a static situation, where there is movement, where there is talk, were there are acts of violence occurring.  It is hardly surprising there would be any differences in what they recall what they give in evidence.  But the important thing is this, that all three witnesses place the appellant, Gacumbitsi, at the parish.  It is the case that, of course, some of them don't see him all three days, but that's by the by; that there was indication that Gacumbitsi arrived.  That there was no significant violence occurring until Gacumbitsi arrives.  And when Gacumbitsi arrives, there was a signal given and the violence begins in earnest.  So, again, our submissions which we flesh out and try to (unintelligible) there was no material discrepancy which gives rise to any reason as to doubt the veracity of any of those witnesses in question.  

Now, they are, essentially, the factual matters, as I understood them, which were raised by the appellant in his oral argument today.  With regard to alleged errors of law in the approach of the 
Trial Chamber, the position of the respondent, Prosecutor, of course, is that the Trial Chamber did not commit any errors in law at all, as we set out in our written brief.  The approach of the Trial Chamber was typically orthodox and typically correct that the elements of the various crimes (unintelligible) and so forth was correctly set out, that the evidence which supports those counts was cogent and was correctly used by the Trial Chamber to find the appellant guilty.  

Firstly, it was said by the counsel for the appellant today that there was any error, as I understood it, in the Trial Chamber's evaluation of the so-called alibi, that is learned counsel referred to two paragraphs in the Trial Chamber judgement, paragraphs 81 and 131, where the witness gave -- I beg 
Your Honours' pardon -- the appellant, Gacumbitsi, gave evidence that he was at home in April during the times of the attacks.  

Firstly, it must be said that the only witness -- the only evidence relied upon by the Defence was that of the appellant himself.  

Secondly, it must be said that the Trial Chamber only decided guilt in the light of being persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the testimony of the Prosecution witnesses.  So it must informally follow that the Trial Chamber rejected the evidence of the appellant when he said that he was not present at the scene.  The Trial Chamber found on the evidence of a number of other witnesses going right back to witnesses TBH and TAW where he showed that there was that plan put in motion by the appellant, that the appellant, in fact, was at the relevant massacre scenes at the 
relevant time.  

So, the submission of the counsel for the appellant that there was not a proper consideration of the alibi, so the alibi is without foundation.  

It was also suggested by counsel for the appellant today that there was -- and I am paraphrasing what he said -- that there was a suggestion that there was not a proper evaluation of the Defence witnesses, mainly NG23 and ZHZ.  This submission made by counsel for the appellant is without any substance.  The Trial Chamber freely evaluated the evidence of both witnesses and we set out those reasons in our written brief, but the Trial Chamber, of course, is best placed to judge the credibility of witnesses.  

There were proper reasons for them not to accept the testimony of these two people.  Firstly, of course, there was the case that they had accepted beyond a reasonable doubt the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses in question.  Secondly, the evidence of NG2 had an air of (unintelligible) about it.  He had given evidence that he was at the site for some six hours, that he joined in the looting but he did not join in the attack as such.  He did not take part in the killings.  The Trial Chamber would have been within its rights to consider that to be impossible.  He was, as I said, was found, for a number of reasons to be an unsatisfactory witness.  He was found to be not a responsible, credible witness under cross-examination.  So, there was nothing raised by the appellant today which shows by either witness was not properly considered.  

The Trial Chamber, as we submit, was best placed to assess the credibility of witnesses, they had proper reasons for not being impressed by the evidence either of those two witnesses.  They had proper reasons for not acting on their evidence, insofar as to exculpate the appellant's investigation 
BC (phonetic).  

So, our submission is simply this, that with regard to evaluation of evidence, there has been no error demonstrated in the approach of the Trial Chamber, in fact, quite the contrary.  The Trial Chamber (unintelligible) the evidence of all relevant witnesses, including Defence witnesses that was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the Prosecution case.  They were not (unintelligible) any doubt which was raised by anything the Defence said.  They found the Defence witnesses lacked credibility.  

Dealing with some other matters raised by the appellant, it was submitted today, and it was also submitted by the appellant in his written brief, that mens rea cannot be established by drawing inferences, that is, by not looking at surrounding facts.  Again, there was no authority cited by the appellant why that is said.  We, in our written brief, addressed this at length.  It would be a matter which would be repugnant to any sort of common sense or proper factual analysis to think that mens rea, that is the state of the person's mind, cannot be proved by surrounding external circumstances.  It is simply a matter of one says, "I am going to do something," if one commits acts doing those things; it is (unintelligible) that they must have had the specific intent to do those matters.  So we, again, said that submission must be (unintelligible) filed.  

There was also an attack launched by counsel for the appellant upon the strength or the adequacy of the indictment presented against the appellant at trial.  This matter does not appear to be addressed in the appellants written brief, but it was submitted, as I understand it, that because the Prosecution had not proved or established beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the person's named or all of the persons named in paragraph 12 that that paragraph was, therefore, somehow, defective and the Prosecution counts of genocide and extermination must inevitably fail.  Again, there was no authority cited for that other thing, Semanza's appeal case, paragraph 45, as we heard it, which does not, on our reading, have anything to do with the issue.  

The paragraph in question said that many Tutsi were killed amongst whom were a number of named persons.  In our submission the proper instruction of that paragraph is this, those named persons are not an element of the prime, they're merely a particular raised by the Prosecution.  Not being an element, it is not necessary for the Prosecution to prove the identity of those particular people.  Now, to take the logical extreme of that, with a case that many thousands of people were killed at one massacre site, and it's safe for that conclusion to be drawn here, and, in fact, we urge that upon the Court.  If that was the case, tracking the appellant's argument to its logical conclusion, it would be incumbent upon the Prosecution to prove the identity of every person killed in the massacre.  That cannot be correct.  The Prosecution was required to prove the appellant was criminally responsible for the killing of a large number of Tutsis at that place, at that time.  That is what the Prosecution did.  

The appellant's argument must inevitably fail.  

If the Court pleases, there was also a submission made -- and I say this with the greatest respect to the learned counsel for the appellant -- it was not advanced in any detail, but it was submitted that the crimes of genocide and extermination would not stand based upon the same facts.  And there was no, as I understood it, no argument really placed before the Court as to why this is to say (sic).  Again, there was no authority advanced for that proposition and, again, there is no reason why charges should not stand on the same basis of facts.  There is a (unintelligible) element in each count.  

Mr. President, there are the Prosecution's submissions we wish to make with regard to the counts of genocide and extermination and crimes against humanity, subject to any assistance we may give to the Court on those grounds.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, then we hear your colleague.
MR. WESTON:
Yes, Mr. President, would it be convenient for the Court for me to address you on the ground of sentence now, or would you prefer to hear that at the end?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
At the end.
MR. WESTON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  My colleague, Mr. Mugwanya, will brief you now on the ground of rape as a crime against humanity.
MR. MUGWANYA:
May it please Your Honours, I'll be addressing the appeal for conviction for rape as crimes against humanity.  From the oral submissions of learned counsel, he raised up, I could say, general complaint, one of them, it seems, that the witnesses called by the Prosecutor lacked credibility.  I'll address that in a moment.  But going through his written brief, he also complains about three main issues.  One, he asserts that the Prosecutor failed to prove that Gacumbitsi instigated the rape.  He complains that Witness THU gave evidence about Gacumbitsi instigating through a megaphone.  To him, a megaphone distorted the voice of the Accused, therefore there was no proof that Gacumbitsi instigated the rape.  

The second complaint from the written material is that the Prosecutor failed to prove adequately a nexus between the instigation and the resulting rape.  

And then thirdly, he complains about the fact that the rapes were not part of widespread or specific attacks, against Tutsi civilians, that the Prosecutor failed to prove that. 

Your Honour, I'll address those four complaints in turn.  I'll begin with the one which appellant raised in submissions -- oral submissions concerning the absence of credibility of witnesses.  

Your Honour, it is established jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber that it is up to the Trial Chamber or -- Trial Chamber is well-positioned to assess -- to hear witnesses, to assess their credibility, because they have the opportunity to see the witnesses and that the Appeals Chamber would not have intervened unless an applicant can demonstrate that the Trial Chamber reached conclusions which are wholly unreasonable.  And this is set out in the case of Fedabeechie (phonetic) 793, Musema (unintelligible) 18 and other cases.  

So before an Appeal Chamber can intervene in a closed chamber system of witnesses an applicant must demonstrate the Trial Chamber reached a conclusion that was wholly unreasonable.  

Your Honours, learned counsel has not made a demonstration in this regard and, as I will demonstrate in a moment, the Trial Chamber considered evidence of witnesses called carefully, taking into account all the circumstances including a number of things, the fact that apart from Gacumbitsi instigating rape, he was a leader of massacres; he took part in massacres at other scenes.  So the Trial Chamber was careful when it was looking at every witness in this case, and it hasn't been shown that the conclusions the Trial Chamber reached were wholly unreasonable, as required by jurisprudence I've just cited.  

Your Honour, I'll now go to the second complaint, namely that the Prosecutor failed to adduce evidence or didn't prove that Gacumbitsi instigated rapes.  The Prosecutor relied on the evidence of 
Witness THU, again, a witness whom my learned counsel has tried to impugn.  Of course he has not demonstrated how that witness is not credible.  Your Honours, Witness THU gave evidence that on or about the 15th of April Gacumbitsi was going around to several communes in a couple of vehicles and from the vehicles people there were using megaphones, instigating Hutus to rape Tutsi women.  

Witness THU never testified he saw the Accused, as such, but she states in her evidence, and the 
Trial Chamber found this to have been established, that she recognised the voice of Gacumbitsi.  

Your Honour, looking at the total evidence, that conclusion that the witness recognised that voice was very reasonable, given, especially, THU's prior knowledge of the appellant, Your Honour.  THU's knowledge of the appellant is extensive, and I wonder whether it is possible -- but I would want to refer to some closed session material, further materials that my friend was objecting to appellant's counsel was going into the details because this was given in closed session, and if it may please 
Your Lordships, I will go on if I may bear with you maybe five minutes of closed session where I can give the details of how Witness THU knew the appellant for quite a long time.  I wonder whether that is possible, a closed session, very briefly, if that is possible.  Otherwise, I can provide the transcripts, as well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you proposing to identify any protected witnesses?  
MR. MUGWANYA:
It may do, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, then, we'll have a closed session.

MR. MUGWANYA: 
Again, in line with the question of witness assessment, Your Honours, the jurisprudence of the Tribunal has -- I mean, has established that in assessing witness credibility, the Trial Chamber can look at -- or is enjoined to look at all the evidence and the circumstances holistically.  As the Appeals Chamber has enjoined, Trial Chambers don't look at evidence in isolation, or (unintelligible) evidence in isolation.  And it has enjoined Trial Chambers to look at evidence holistically.  And this is contained in the Musema appeal judgement, paragraph 134.  In this case the Trial Chamber, in assessing the witnesses, it looked at the total of the evidence and the circumstances.  

As I mentioned earlier, apart from Gacumbitsi going around instigating rapes on the 17th of April, he was involved as a leader in crimes in Rusumo commune.  So, the Trial Chamber was entitled, in assessing the witness credibility, also to take this into account.  So, it wasn't that Gacumbitsi only instigated rapes on a given day, but he was involved on another occasions, and as a leader, in a similar criminality.  So the Trial Chamber was only reasonable to conclude that, given all these circumstances, given all the evidence examined holistically, Witness THU was a credible witness; she recognised Gacumbitsi's voice on that particular day.  

Your Honours, I will now turn to the third complaint, namely, that the Prosecutor failed to demonstrate that Gacumbitsi's instigation and the rapes were connected.  That there was no nexus between the two, the instigations and the rapes.  

Your Honours, it is established jurisprudence that for any mode of participation under Article 61, whether instigation or ordering, it is not required that the Prosecutor demonstrates that the crimes wouldn't have happened without the Accused's conduct.  What is required, that the Prosecutor demonstrates that the Accused's conduct substantially contributed to the crimes.  And this is established in a number of cases, a line of cases, including Kayishema, paragraph 1.9 to 8, Blaskic, paragraph 41 to 42, and Kordic, paragraph 32.  

So what is required that the Prosecutor demonstrates that an Accused's conduct -- in this case the instigation -- substantially contributed to the crimes; in this case, the rapes.  

Your Honours, the evidence on the record, as found by the Trial Chamber, showed, among other things, that following Gacumbitsi's instigation of rapes on 17th April, Witness THU and seven other women and girls were raped immediately.  Besides that, these rapes took place within the same locality, that is Nyarubuye secteur, where Gacumbitsi instigated the rapes.  

Your Honours, Gacumbitsi instigated the rapes not in private.  Gacumbitsi took a megaphone, in daylight, and directly instigated rapes.  It's only reasonable -- only reasonable -- that, looking at the immediacy of the rapes in the same location, more or less within the same timeframe, the same day -- or the same timeframe, that Gacumbitsi's instigation must have substantially contributed to the rapes.  

Your Honours, it is also established jurisprudence of this Trial Chamber -- of this Appeals Chamber that an accused committing a crime, or an accused participating in a crime -- for instance, by instigation -- if he does so with the likelihood -- I mean, with the knowledge that the crimes would be committed -- I repeat this.  If an accused participated in a crime with a knowledge of a substantial likelihood that crimes would be perpetrated, that accused will be assumed to have accepted the crimes.  Your Honours, this is well established in a number of cases, including Kordic, Appeals Chamber decision, paragraph 32, and Blaskic, Appeals Chamber, paragraph 31 to 32.  

In the instant case, the Accused chose the most effective means of communication; direct, unambiguous instigation of rapes, and rapes took place in the vicinity, in the location, and in the timeframe.  So it must be assumed, at a minimum, that he accepted the crimes.  Because he must have known -- he must have known -- that by doing what he did, there was a substantial likelihood that rapes would be perpetrated in Rusumo.  More so given his status in Rusumo.  He was the bourgmestre, he was the highest authority in the commune.  Everybody respected him, as the Trial Chamber found.  So his instigation, the manner in which he perpetrated it, was such that rapes would occur, and they did occur.  So, he must be taken to have accepted the rapes.  

Your Honour, I will now address the last complaint which the appellant raised.  Namely, that as far as he was concerned, these rapes were not part of widespread or systematic attacks in Rusumo.  

Your Honour, before even I go into the evidence, the appellant does not demonstrate -- they do not even endeavour to explain why these rapes were not part of the widespread attacks in Rusumo commune, or in Rwanda in general.  But, beyond that -- beyond that -- he doesn't address what he means, or what he conceives of attacks being part of widespread attacks.  

Your Honours, the Appeals Chamber jurisprudence of this Tribunal has established clearly that the notion "being part of attacks" does not mean that the crimes in question must have taken place amidst the main attack.  Not at all.  And Kunarac -- I don't know whether I'm pronouncing it correctly, Kunarac -- Appeals Chamber judgement, paragraph 100, explains clearly.  Being part of attacks, or being part of the whole attack, doesn't mean that the attacks, or the rapes in question, took place amidst the broad attack.  Your Honour, it is sufficient -- it is sufficient -- if those attacks are sufficiently, or adequately, connected to the broader attack.  In fact, Kunarac explains that even in situations where an attack can take place before or after the broad attack.  What needs to be shown is that the attack in question, like in this case the rape, was sufficiently connected to the main attack.  

Your Honours, the evidence adduced during trial, and which the Trial Chamber found unanimously to have been credible, is that there were attacks in Rusumo commune.  Not only the rapes -- I will emphasise this.  The attacks in the form of rapes were a part of other attacks of different forms, including killings.  Because this doesn't require that this -- the attack in which the Accused participated must be the same as the broad attack.  Attack is a broader -- attack is a broad notion.  It includes acts of violence in different forms.  

So, the rapes in question were not merely isolated here.  They were not random acts removed from the broad attacks in Rusumo.  Not at all.  the evidence patently demonstrated that, apart from the rapes that occurred in Nyarubuye secteur, which the Accused -- which the Accused instigated, there were other attacks in the commune.  It is also important to note that Gacumbitsi was not only involved in instigating the rapes, he was also involved in these other broad attacks, including one of the most atrocious attacks on Nyarubuye parish which occurred on about 17 April.  He was the leader of this attack in which so many people were killed.  

So, overall -- overall -- it cannot be submitted, as my learned friend has submitted, that it was not shown that the rapes of the Tutsi remain in which -- in which the Accused instigated were isolated instances, far removed from the broad attacks.  Not at all.  The evidence clearly shows that the rapes, as a form of attack, was part and parcel of other attacks in other forms, including killings.  And the Accused was principally involved in these other attacks.  So, there's no way he can assert that the rapes were apart, or removed, from these other attacks.  To the contrary, they were part and parcel of those attacks.  

Your Honour, if you may allow me, I will briefly address other complaints which the appellant raised in this appeal brief, in relation to other witnesses:  TAC, TAP, and TAO.  

In his returning brief, which runs from paragraphs 326 to 372, he makes several attacks.  I must say, unsubstantiated attacks against several witnesses.  

Among others, he talks about Witness TAP.  Gacumbitsi claims that the witness did not testify on the date indicated by the Prosecutor, and therefore she could have been coached.  This appears in paragraph 336 of Gacumbitsi's brief.  Your Honour, these kind of assertions, unsubstantiated assertions, cannot hold water before an Appeals Chamber.  Neither can they hold any weight before the Appeals Chamber.  If an applicant, or an Accused, wants to talk about coaching witnesses -- which is wrong, okay, which is a crime -- he should prove -- he should adduce cogent evidence, other than merely making a general or sweeping statement that because the witness didn't come on the named day, he must have been coached.  That is unacceptable.  

Your Honours, in paragraph 339 of his brief, he asserts that the witness claimed that, as she was being raped, the rapist told her that the rapist's father had appreciated the witness.  Something, I must say, a little bit ambiguous.  It's not clear what relevance it is to a crime against humanity -- rape -- if a rapist had some motives, whatever they are, in the course of raping.  See, material on (unintelligible) jurisprudence that motives, or external objectives of crimes, are not defences to crimes.  This is established clearly in several cases, including Tadic, and the Niyitigeka appeal judgement.  So whether the rapist explained why she (sic) raped in that way is immaterial.  

What is important is a demonstration that the rapist raped following an instigation by the Accused, an instigation which substantially contributed to the rape.  And Your Honour, I will demonstrate, in relation to our appeal, regarding the rapes testified to by Witness TAP, another witness, as with TAO and TAS, it was established that where, following Gacumbitsi's instigation, or because of Gacumbitsi's instigation, many women were raped, including TAP.  

Your Honour, in relation to Witness TAS, again the appellant makes several assertions, including that the witness didn't hear the Accused incite anyone to rape Tutsis.  That's Witness TAS.  Your Honour, it's immaterial if a victim has not heard about an accused instigating.  What matters, as we show -- as we demonstrated, is that the perpetrators had -- or, that the perpetrators raped because the Accused instigated them to rape.  So it's immaterial whether the victims didn't hear.  So, whether or not TAS didn't hear the Accused instigate is immaterial.  What is material is that those who raped Witness TAS -- or those who raped Witness TAS did so following Gacumbitsi's instigation, or that Gacumbitsi's instigation substantially contributed to their raping Witness TAS.  

Furthermore, again in relation to Witness TAS, the Accused claims that -- that's paragraph 348 of his brief -- 348 of his brief -- that those who raped TAS, or (unintelligible) Witness TAS was Gacumbitsi's cousin.  Again, it is immaterial who raped this witness, as long as, as I said, it can be shown that the one who raped, whether it's a cousin of Gacumbitsi or not, did so following Gacumbitsi's instigation.  So the relationship of the rapist is grossly immaterial.  

Again, in relation to paragraph -- to Witness TAS, that's paragraph 349, Gacumbitsi claims that Witness TAS exaggerated -- or that there was an exaggeration of Gacumbitsi's participation.  It was a blatant scheme against -- there was a blatant scheme against the Accused.  Again, this is (unintelligible) without any supporting material, and therefore I pray that the Appeals Chamber ignore -- dismisses such an assertion -- asserted claims.  
Finally, again, because it is a general -- these are general allegations, and there is quite a number, they are not supported at all.  In relation to Witness TAO, the appellant claims that TAO testified about the rape of his wife to further, or to advance the Prosecutor's case.  It's not clear what he means by -- I mean, by a witness testifying to advance the Prosecutor's case.  It's not clear to me.  I think witnesses are called to give evidence for a party.  As long as they testify honestly, there's no question (sic) why their testifying for a particular party should be put into question.  

In relation to the same witness, the appellant claims that the witness wouldn't have forgotten the dates -- or the date when his wife was raped; this must be wrong, this must be speculation.  Your Honours, I think the Trial Chamber and Appeals Chamber are aware that you should take into account the passage of time.  Such specific details as the date when the instance took place, specific date, are material, no question.  But then we should -- the Chambers take into account the passage of time.  So, a witness cannot be held to be unreliable because he has forgotten that date when a certain crime was committed.  

In this case the witness gave an estimation, very reasonable, he explained how the conseiller first raped the witness (sic) for some days, and then the day -- the fateful day when the witness' wife was actually killed.  So, the witness gave an account which was reasonable, and it's not demonstrated by appellant that Witness THU was unreasonable, was not credible, and they shouldn't be believed.  

I'm going to wind up, Your Honours.  The Prosecution's case is this:  Regarding the rapes, especially the rapes to which Witness THU testified -- because the other rapes are subject to another ground of appeal by us -- Your Honour, the Trial Chamber reached a number of conclusions, the evidence before which was assessed carefully.  The Trial Chamber took into account pertinent considerations, especially regarding Witness THU's prior knowledge of the appellant, or -- it took into account this prior knowledge to find that she heard Gacumbitsi instigate rapes.  It also took into account the context of the examination.  It examined the total of the evidence, as opposed to looking at the instigation in isolation, and it found that Gacumbitsi instigated the rapes.  

Apparently the Trial Chamber, also applying the law, it found that the rapes to which Gacumbitsi -- which Gacumbitsi instigated followed, or resulted from, his instigation.  Although, as we shall submit in our ground of appeal, what we require is a demonstration that the rapes -- that the Accused's instigation contributed substantially to the rapes.  Not a cause-effect relationship.  But with regards to Witness THU, after even a heightened threshold, cause-effect (unintelligible) was demonstrated.  The law is an accused instigates, and crimes are committed, because of -- I mean, his contribution, or his participation, contributes substantially to the crimes.  That was demonstrated by the evidence adduced by THU.  
And finally, regarding the rapes being part of widespread attacks, Your Honour, the evidence of the record is sufficient; that these rapes were not merely isolated incidents, they were part and parcel, widespread or systematic attacks, in the commune and in Rwanda in general, attacks in which the Accused was principally involved.  He led the attacks, so he cannot plead that these rapes were separate, or were far removed from these attacks.  

Unless I have -- I may be of any help, Your Honours, I rest my submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, thank you, Doctor.  

We will resume at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning with the address by the Prosecution.  

Meanwhile, may I make one little modification to the timetable which we have supplied you with.  If you have before you the scheduling order which we made on 8 December, there appears an item tomorrow, reading thus:  "10:15 a.m. to 10:45 a.m., personal address by Sylvestre Gacumbitsi -- optional."  The view has prevailed for us that it would be more convenient, and more in keeping with justice and fairness, for that item to be transferred to the bottom of appeal of the Prosecution.  So, it's at the end of the Prosecution -- Prosecution's submissions at 6 p.m. tomorrow we will hear from Gacumbitsi, if he has anything to say.  
MR. WESTON: 
Yes, certainly.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
