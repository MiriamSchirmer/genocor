MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  We will continue with the testimony of the Accused.  We were still dealing with the examination-in-chief of the Accused as a witness. 

Mr. Kouengoua, please proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, members of the Court.  

Madam President, I do not know whether this applies only to me, but I have a feeling that there are some problems with my headset.  Perhaps this is only my case. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, there is some background noise.  Can the technicians solve the problem? 

Mr. Kouengoua, could you tell us how much time -- how much time you need to conclude your examination-in-chief? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
About 50 minutes, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Try to finish as soon as possible.  If you can take less than 50 minutes, we will be happy with that.  Thank you. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, last Friday, we were on the date of the 14th.  On that occasion, you said you asked your tenants to take appropriate steps to protect themselves, and that in that -- to that end, many of them left, but that a certain Marie went to her younger sister, called Beatrice; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.  Beatrice was not the elder sister to Marie, she was, rather, the younger sister to Marie.  She had a building where she did her small business, and her elder sister met her at Nyakarambi.
Q.	Can you tell the Court what happened to -- can you tell the Court what became of Marie, Marie who was renting your building?
A.	On that day I went to tell them that I was in a difficult situation, that I was wanted for sheltering or giving shelter to the Tutsi and that other Tutsi had taken shelter in my house from Rukira and Birenga.  

After having explained to them the situation, they effectively left.  They fled towards Tanzania.  A certain Maria did not go together with other persons.  She decided to join her younger sister, Beatrice, in the house which she was renting and where she did her trading.  That house belonged to a certain Jonathan Kananura, who was the manager of the Rusumo People's Bank, the Banque Populaire du Rusumo  She met her sister in that house or she joined her sister in that house and, at night, criminals came and killed the two women. 
Q.	And the members of the population, were they killed in your house?
A.	No.  The people who were killed were killed at Kananura, Jonathan's house, and that house was rented by Beatrice.
Q.	Now, Witness, you, on Friday, you also testified that on the 14th, that you were hiding.  What did you do on the 15th?
A.	I had told the sous-préfet of Kirehe that the situation was bad and that I was wanted by people who wanted to kill me, in particular, people who said that -- people who said that their brothers were concerned.  So I told the sous-préfet that I could be killed at any time and that he and the préfet should do everything to ensure the security of the authorities.  

After saying that, I went into hiding in my house.  So, on Friday, I was still in the place where I was hiding. 
Q.	And on the 16th, were you still hiding?
A.	Yes, I was still hiding because of fright.  As you know, any human being in such a situation would be afraid.  But subsequently, on Saturday, the 16th, I received bad news from Nyarubuye.  People had taken refuge in Nyarubuye from various localities of the Kibungo préfecture:  in the Rukira commune, Kigarama commune, Birenga, Kabarondo commune, and from elsewhere.  These persons took refuge in Nyarubuye.  Indeed, I knew that people had taken refuge there, but I thought that the number of such persons was small.  Criminals launched an attack at Nyarubuye and killed them.  

Very early in the morning, a certain Neza came to give me news of the situation and told me that the persons who had taken refuge at Nyarubuye had been attacked by people who were on vehicles -- who came in vehicles, and that among the assailants there were soldiers, that the assailants killed the refugees and left.  The refugees were killed in the afternoon and the attackers left after their crime.  They came from the Rukira commune.  They were led by gendarmes from Mulundi in Rukira commune.  

The gendarmes requisitioned people whom they took to the Nyarubuye parish, and they killed refugees.  Neza informed me of these acts.  He came from Birembo.  Birembo is located between Rukira and Rusumo, at the crossroad of -- at the junction of the road going to Rusumo and another road going to Nasho and Panga.  

After having been informed of that situation, I was greatly saddened.  For about two minutes, I could not speak.  I was in hiding; there was nothing I could do.  So I told the emissary to go and report the acts to the sous-préfet.  I asked him to tell the sous-préfet to come and see me because the sous-préfet had a vehicle, but I did not have a vehicle.  So Mr. Neza went to report these acts to the sous-préfet.  He told the sous-préfet that the situation was very bad at Nyarubuye.  

The sous-préfet came to fetch me from my house.  We went to his house to see what we could do in the face of this situation which had cost the lives of people at the Nyarubuye church. We asked ourselves what we could do, because we were very sad.  So I told the sous-préfet that, to me, the situation was very critical because I told him, as you know, that I was painted as an accomplice of the Inkotanyi.  I told him that whenever I am seen or wherever I go, people are looking for me.  I also told him that he, too, was being considered as an accomplice of the Inkotanyi.  

I immediately asked the sous-préfet to send, on the spot, the police brigadier, who was playing the role of officier du police judiciare, to see what he could do.  We didn't have enough fuel.  Thus, we went to see a trader called Azarias, so that that trader could give us a vehicle, a vehicle to transport the policemen.  We had to pay for the fuel he would give us later on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you could speak more slowly, and please kindly spell the names that you are citing. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness named Kanamura, K A-N-A-M-U-R-A; Nyakarambi, 
	N-Y-A-K-A-R-A-M-B-I; Kirehe, K-I-R-E-H-E; Cyasa, C-Y-A-S-A; Rukira, R-U-K-I-R-A; Kigarama, 
	K-I-G-A-R-A-M-A; Birenga, B-I-R-E-N-G-A, Kabarondo, K-A-B-A-R-O-N-D-O, Neza, N-E-Z-A.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, did the tradesman put the -- or make the vehicle available to the sous-préfet, as was suggested to him?
A.	Yes.  He gave him the vehicle and the said vehicle was placed at the disposal of the police brigadier.
Q.	What did you do thereafter?
A.	After that, I returned home while waiting for the report, because we had asked the police brigadier to go and find out about the situation and to report to me on the situation as he would find it.  So I returned home; I returned to my house and waited for the return of the brigadier and the policemen who had accompanied him to Nyarubuye.
Q.	What is the distance between the Nyarubuye parish and your residence?
A.	There is a distance of about 30 kilometres between the parish and my house.
Q.	On the 17th of April, did you come out of your hiding place?
A.	Since I did not hear anything from the sous-préfet, I was waiting for him to tell me of the recommendations that they had made so that I could come out of my hiding place.  My fear was founded because I remembered my colleagues who had been killed in the same manner, and being a human being, I was indeed afraid.  I waited for -- to hear from the sous-préfet with regard to the recommendations that had been taken with regard to our safety.
Q.	When you talk of your colleagues, are you referring to bourgmestres?
A.	Yes, I'm referring to bourgmestres.  I'll give you an example.  The bourgmestre of Kinigi commune in Ruhengeri préfecture was killed on the 8th of April.  While he was trying to repel the assailants who had attacked his commune, the assailants killed him; he died.  With this case in mind, I thought I could suffer the same fate.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Interpreter, could you help us to spell the proper nouns that have just been mentioned? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kinige, K-I-N-I-G-E; Ruhengeri, R-U-H-E-N-G-E-R-I.  R-U-H-E-N-G-E-R-I, Ruhengeri. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, the policemen that you dispatched on the 16th to the Nyarubuye parish, did they report to you on their activities, on what they did?
A.	They returned in the evening.  The brigadier gave me the report and told me that the people indeed had been killed at the parish.  I asked him what the situation was.  I asked him if there were many victims, because I knew that there were very few people at the parish.  And he replied to me, saying that it was not a great number of people.  He estimated the number of people in the church and the premises of the church at about 800 -- or, rather, between 800 and 1,000 people.  That was his estimate.
Q.	He estimated the victims between 800 and 1,000?
A.	Yes, that is what he told me.  In any case, that was the estimate he gave me.  He told me that the people who were in the church and others who were within the church premises or the parish premises were between 800 and 1,000 people. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When did you finally come out of the place where you were hiding?
A.	In spite of the people who had been killed in Rusumo commune in general, it was noticed that there was security as compared to other areas.  Moreover, the people who had come to seek refuge at Nyarubuye were running away from insecurity.  There were people who had come from Byumba, Kibungo, people who were running away from the Inkotanyis who were killing people.  Moreover, the préfet of Kibungo had also taken refuge at Rusumo.  
On his arrival, he wanted to know where I was.  He was told that Gacumbitsi was afraid because the persons whom he had arrested and detained, the members of their families threatened to kill him and accused him of being an accomplice of the Inkotanyi, so he sent to me policemen from various communes.  They came to fetch me from my house so that I go and talk with the préfet. 

Apart from the préfet who took refuge in Rusumo, there were other bourgmestres, so I went to see the préfet.  And, in fact, he gave me comfort.  He told me, "Look, there are many refugees.  Moreover, we also have come here to seek refuge.  It is not necessary for you to continue hiding."  So he gave me some comfort, the préfet of Kibungo.
Q.	What was his name, that préfet of Kibuye?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for Prosecution, do you have an objection?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, before we proceed to the next question from counsel, maybe if you could advise the witness to answer the questions that have been posed.  In American jurisprudence I would have applied for his answers to be struck off as unresponsive.  He goes on about matters that haven't been raised, and it becomes very hard for all the parties to follow his evidence.  It lends itself to better presentation if he just answers what he's been asked. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, I think you should be more precise; in other words, answer only the question put to you, because you tend to elaborate a little bit too much.  Try to answer the questions put to you more precisely. 

	Mr. Kouengoua, proceed.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	On what date, Mr. Gacumbitsi, do you put the arrival of the préfet in your commune?  When did the préfet -- when do you think the préfet arrived at your commune?
A.	Counsel, you asked me the question about his name, you wanted to know his name.  I did not answer that question.
Q.	I am bound by the time.  What do you want me to do?  The Prosecutor stands up.  Answer as you can.  I am bound by time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have been interrupted only once.  
Mr. Gacumbitsi, can you give the name of the préfet of Kibuye whom you mentioned earlier on? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
The préfet who took refuge in Rusumo is called Anaclet Rudakubana, 
	R-U-D-A-K-U-B-A-N-A.  As regards the date when he took refuge in Rusumo, this was about the 20th.  Yes, it was about the 20th.  He arrived in Rusumo around the 20th. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, from that time did the préfet try to organise the administrative life of Rusumo? 
A.	As soon as the préfet arrived in Kibungo, he held a short meeting which was attended by the 
	sous-préfet, myself, and the other authorities who had sought refuge there, to find ways and means of organising the situation in the commune, because it had been noticed that several hundred refugees had come to the commune.  So they had to find ways and means of taking care of those refugees, providing for the security of Rusumo commune, ensuring their safety.  So he instructed us to try and provide for the security of those refugees and the security of the commune. 
Q.	Witness, to your knowledge -- to the best of your knowledge -- how many meetings were held from the time when the préfet arrived in Rusumo commune?
A.	The préfet's visit was very brief; it lasted only a few days.  When he wanted to talk to the authorities who had sought refuge in Rusumo commune, he had to contact us.  I believe he held about two meetings only.
Q.	Can you tell us approximately the date of those two meetings -- the dates of those two meetings?
A.	One of the meetings was held on the 27th of April, 1994.  Another meeting was held on the 28th of April, in the morning, 28th of April, 1994.
Q.	Witness, in April 1994, were you accustomed to writing down the lists of activities which you are relating to the Chamber in some document?
A.	I did not write down everything, but I took note of certain activities in a diary, but it was not all the activities I engaged in.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have received a document entitled, "Diary of the Prosecutor with regard to disclosure of documents".  I would like the Prosecutor to present this document to the witness to ascertain whether it is indeed the diary the witness is referring to.  I have other documents as well that I'd like the Prosecutor to present to the witness.
MR. KAREGYESA:
(Previous translation continued) ... before distributing that document so that I can be heard.  Your Honours, I ask that the registry hold on the distribution of the document until the Prosecution is heard.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, give the document to the Prosecutor. 
Do you know the document, Prosecutor? 

MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour, I'm asking that the registry hold on to the document until after I have made my submission.  I'm objecting to its distribution, and I want to advance reasons.  Your Honour --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will proceed with your objection, counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the Prosecution objects to counsel referring in any way to this diary and seeking to introduce it in evidence on the ground that this diary amounts to a prior consistent statement.  It is a document prepared and written by the Accused, and cannot go to prove -- to the proof of anything he has said in this Chamber.  I liken this document, Your Honours, to a witness statement taken by investigators, and submit that a witness cannot rely on his or her prior statement to establish the truth of his testimony under oath.  The adverse party may, however, Your Honours, rely on such document to impeach the author of the document.  

In this case we submit that this amounts to a prior consistent statement, and I know of no jurisdiction where such a document is admissible.  And we submit, therefore, Your Honours, that counsel should be barred from proceeding in the manner he's trying to do.  Most obliged. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, do you have any objection?  Proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, there is no objection.  The Prosecutor has not objected to it.  We wanted him to present the document to the witness.  It's only when you tried to -- that he objected.  He has absolutely nothing to say.  This document is one of the documents on the list of documents disclosed to me in 2003 and it is a document which I disclosed to the registry.  

The witness has testified on the events he engaged in, in April 1994.  And I did request that the Prosecutor should hand over the original of this diary.  I would like to be respectful and assume that the French interpreter is not translating properly.  He tried to invoke American jurisprudence.  What is it all about?  I say no, Prosecutor, I believe we shouldn't exaggerate this jurisdiction.  Your manner of proceeding, Prosecutor, only leads to loss of time.  

This document has notes written by the Prosecutor, and the Prosecutor disclosed it to us, and when we want to tender it, you say it is not in line with jurisprudence of this Chamber.  If this were the case, why did you disclose it? 

Madam President, we are relying on Article 89 in tendering this document -- Rule 89(C) of the Rules and we are relying on this jurisprudence, and only the Chamber can tell us whether we are acting properly or not. 

Now, this is very serious, Madam President, and many people deplore this.  The allegations mentioned in this diary referred to in 1994, Mr. Gacumbitsi is trying to re-state those events, and the Prosecutor is referring to statements taken by investigators, when were those statements taken.  Now the Chamber can consider that the Accused is a victim of the -- of false accusations made by the Prosecutor.  The Prosecutor knows full well that that's the situation.  That the Prosecutor should rise to his feet and say that this document which was seized from Gacumbitsi at the time when he was arrested, and this is the case, and he's saying that this is a witness statement -- this is not the case.  

We respectfully request the Chamber to admit this document as a Defence exhibit.  And, 
Madam President, let us bear in mind the time which we have spent on this.  We are trying to meet the deadline given to us by the Chamber, the 50 minutes you gave us. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Mr. Prosecutor, was this diary seized from the Accused by the investigators of the ICTR or some other lawful authority? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
It was seized by the Tanzanian police authorities and handed over to the Office of the Prosecutor at the time that the Accused was arrested, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
And when was it seized? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
At the time when the Accused was arrested in Western Tanzania, Your Honours, two years ago.  The arrest, Your Honours, was conducted by Tanzanian police, who subsequently arrested -- searched the Accused's house and retrieved this diary, in addition to other articles of clothing from his house, and then these were turned over to the Prosecutor.  And in returning seizures or seized items to the Accused, a transcription of the diary was given to the Accused.  The Office of the Prosecutor retains the original. 
JUDGE REDDY:
And this was disclosed as part of Prosecution disclosure to the Defence? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
In stricto sentio, Your Honours, yes, but also restitution of seized items. 
JUDGE REDDY:
And what is -- we, of course, haven't seen what's in the diary.  Is this -- are the contents of this diary exculpatory in any way? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Not to my knowledge, Your Honours.  In fact, we submit that they aren't.
JUDGE REDDY:
Are they incriminatory? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I wouldn't want to go there.  It's a determination we haven't made. 
JUDGE REDDY:
But, as far as I'm aware, it would not be unusual to tender into evidence any article seized from an Accused person at the time of his arrest as part of the Prosecution case, would it? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
In the event that the Prosecutor, Your Honours, didn't tender this diary into evidence, we submit that the Defence cannot rely on it, as it seeks to do, to reinforce what this witness has said on oath, and that is why I likened it to a statement written by the Accused, and now he is relying on a prior consistent statement to corroborate what he's told this Chamber. 
JUDGE REDDY:
But a diary is a contemporaneous record, made at the time of the occurrence of an event.  In that sense it is not a prior statement.
MR. KAREGYESA:
In stricto sentio, Your Honours, a diary is supposed to be a contemporaneous record, but we submit that in this case it isn't; it's a reconstruction of events that was made -- or entries made ex post facto and not contemporaneous at all, and that in this reconstruction the Accused is basically trying to rely 
-- to bolster his evidence on entries made long after the fact. 
JUDGE REDDY:
How do we determine that the entries which were made are not contemporaneous but that they were made afterwards?  I'm just asking you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Well, if we must go there, Your Honours, it will come from the adverse party. 
JUDGE REDDY:
That is you, presumably.
MR. KAREGYESA:
If we decide to go down that road, Your Honours.  But what we are saying is that counsel cannot rely.  Where, for example, the Accused has not sought to rely on this document to refresh his memory, he's given a detailed account of his whereabouts, of what use now is his diary? 
JUDGE REDDY:
The weight of that diary is another issue; I agree with you.  It could even be likened to a self-serving statement.
MR. KAREGYESA:
That's why I'm calling it a prior consistent statement, Your Honour. 

JUDGE REDDY:
But I'm not so sure about its admissibility.  And for myself, do you have any authorities, either within the jurisprudence of this Tribunal or its sister Tribunal?  Are you able to cite any cases to us or, indeed, common law cases which say that diaries seized in these circumstances are not admissible in evidence? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour, I was relying on a journal of common law principles regarding prior consistent statements. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Well, I'm not sure I'm persuaded that a diary is a prior consistent statement, but unless of course there are authorities on this, and for myself, I really -- I think one would really need to look at these cases to make a ruling.  Subject to what my colleagues think, we may need some time to consider this; I don't know.  But I'll leave this to the President.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Your Honours. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Kouengoua. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I believe this document is one of the rare documents that not only Chamber III but justice, in general, can find.  We have the usual diary which is printed and we use to jot down various events. 

In 1994, when the Accused wrote things on this agenda, on this diary, there wasn't any war, there were no conflicts.  When Gacumbitsi was arrested, he was teaching in a class.  Somebody called him to the door, "I want to talk to you."  From the door he was taken to the police station, and from there found himself in Arusha.  And it was subsequently that his house was searched and the usual seizures were made, as they usually do when they want to recover evidence after a crime. 

Madam President, three years following his arrest, ten years later in relation to the date on which the agenda -- the diary was bought, what is he being accused of, Madam President?  Did he know that he would be brought before this Chamber?  Did he know that the president was going to be assassinated on the 6th of April 1994?  Gacumbitsi knew nothing about that. 

I want to tender this document, and if the Prosecutor is acting in good faith, he would have -- he wouldn't have tried to tender it behind his back.  He doesn't say that it's something he's told -- we should ask the question:  Why is he saying all this?  And it is precisely because Gacumbitsi was arrested and evidence was sought subsequently.  And what is in the indictment doesn't tie in with what is in the diary.  

Why keep the diary of somebody else?  It has no juridical value.  This is the evidence, 
Madam President.  I believe this document should be admitted without any further requirements.  It is one of the most neutral documents and which sheds light on the truth because what the Accused is referring to occurred nine years ago.  He jotted down this nine years ago, and he never imagined at the time that there would be a criminal tribunal.  Nobody imagined when he was writing this diary that there would be disturbances in Rwanda, and that is why I want to tender this document, because it is a proper document which should be properly admitted, and the Chamber should admit it without any further requirements.  

I pray the Chamber most respectfully to admit -- to grant my request, which is well founded. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

The Chamber allows Counsel Kouengoua to proceed with the examination of the witness on the basis of the document which has been presented to us.  So you may hand out the document to the parties. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  

Madam President, the tendering of this document is in line with Rule 69 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, which requires that the Prosecutor should disclose to the Defence all the documents required for the trial. 

Prosecutor, could you please therefore hand over the diary of the Accused, the original? 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, you have received a copy of the diary, haven't you?
A.	Yes, I have it before me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What did you say, Counsel?  We authorised you to distribute the document you have.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President, that is what I have done.  I was asking the witness whether he has received said document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe Judge Reddy has a question to put to you. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Mr. Kouengoua, the Prosecution may have disclosed that document to you, but it is you that is producing it into evidence, not the Prosecution.  You can't ask the Prosecutor to produce it.  It's just not done.  It's your document.  All he has done is disclosed it.  He says he's got it, and he's given you a copy, and now this is part of your case.  The document goes in as your evidence, not the Prosecution's evidence.  So you should produce it.  If you want to, that is. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, you have looked through the document.  Is it the photocopy of your diary which dates back to 1994?
A.	I have not had sufficient time to go through this document.  This document is typed, whereas my diary was handwritten.  I believe it is my right to obtain the original of my diary.  I've already obtained some of the personal effects that were arrested -- seized, and the diary is one of the personal belongings that I have not yet received.  If you want me to ascertain the authenticity of this document, I would need to have the original diary. 
(Pages 1 to 12 by Karen Holm-Porter)





















1530H
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, in light of the fact that the Prosecutor confiscated the original, I would suggest that we should tender photocopies, isn't it? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the Prosecutor has in Court the original of the diary, which has been kept in the vault of our evidence unit, and I now hand it over to the registry. 
JUDGE REDDY:
We now have the original.  Do you want to produce this?  Are you producing this as evidence? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Your Honours, I have given the documents which I intend to tender in evidence, and it is the document with some notes written by the Prosecutor.  I believe, if we had had the original, we would have tendered it in the diary, which was in Rwanda -- Kinyarwanda.  We want to tender this document as asked now, and that is what we have distributed to the Chamber, to the Prosecutor and to the witness.  We want the Prosecutor to hand over the original to us because it belongs to the -- our client, but for now we want to tender this document as our exhibit, because this exhibit has the advantage of having been translated by the Prosecutor.  It will assist the Chamber.  We could have gone to look for somebody to translate it.  Since it's already been translated, we would pray the Chamber to accept this translated version. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the Office of the Prosecutor had the diary transcribed and translated into English and French from Kinyarwanda, and it was my understanding that the witness could neither confirm nor deny the contents of the document shown to him, and that is why we have produced the original. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, but since you now have a transcription of what's in this diary, shouldn't both be exhibited? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Precisely, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, because I notice that a lot of pages are torn off from this diary, and it may go to the issue of credibility of this document.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Precisely, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President? 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You want to tender this transcription, translation, supplied by the Prosecution?  Is that the only exhibit you wish to tender? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, that's where we were. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, because now the Prosecutor has provided the original diary of the Accused, as requested by the Accused, and we want to know whether you are tendering both documents or merely the first transcript. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
We are merely tendering the transcript because, as the -- the Judge mentioned the original with pages torn out of it, but we have never seen it, so we don't want to waste any more time.  We merely wish to tender this typed document.  All we asked the Prosecutor to do was to return his property to the Accused.  It is the transcript that we are tendering, and everyone should understand that, that the Prosecution is a pillar of the Tribunal, and we have entirely confidence in him that this is a true and faithful transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  But the Prosecution might wish themselves to tender the diary as an exhibit. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I don't know at what time -- at which point the Prosecutor will tender it.  He had the opportunity to tender it.  He must have realised it wasn't favourable to his case and decided to hang on to it.  And in any case, as the document is in his hands, he can tender it.  And the Judge has noticed that pages have been torn out.  We are not trying to prevent anyone from tendering anything, but we must follow due procedure.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  But we wish to attract your attention to that point. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you wish to say something? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, if counsel doesn't want to tender the original, we are happy to have it back. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Listen, wait, we are going to solve all those problems, but what we need to do now is to move forward.  Have you any questions to put in respect of this document? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Well, I had, Madam, but now that the original has arrived, we see no difficulty at all in tendering -- no difficulty at all in tendering both documents. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So, for the time being, you are tendering both documents? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
It is certain that I have tendered the photocopies, and for the first time the Prosecution is tendering the original, in which Judge Reddy tells us pages have been torn out.  If he insists on that, he can tender the document, but what we are tendering in respect of Article 68 is the photocopy of the transcript, translation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Pray proceed with your question. 

The Accused -- you have something to say, Mr. Gacumbitsi?  You're gesturing at me for sometime now.  You wish to say something?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, before the witness speaks, my exhibit has not been numbered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, for the time being, we haven't given a number to your document.  We are asking you to ask your questions on the document, and afterwards we will number it.  That is why I said "pray proceed with your line of questioning" in respect of this document.  You have not, as far as I know, yet questioned the Accused thereon.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
But I have all the dates, madam, other dates that were disclosed to me by the Prosecutor and which appear here and which are the ones mentioned in the diary. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But Mr. Gacumbitsi said he wanted the original, to be able to say whether the document that you're tendering is, in fact, a true reflection of the agenda.  Now, if you allow, I think the Accused wants to say something and we must hear him. 

Yes, Mr. Gacumbitsi?  You wanted to say something? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Thank you, Madam President.  I wished to obtain the original of my diary in order to be able to compare it to this other typed document.  I have not yet held the diary in my hands.  As for giving it back to the Prosecution, that is impossible.  Perhaps the document should be tendered at the same time as the photocopied -- typed document, but I wanted it to be shown to me so that I could compare both documents.  The Prosecution runs the risk of holding a piece of paper on which it can ask me questions, and that is what concerns me.  So I would like you to give it back to me, to return to me everything they have, and then I will no longer be anxious on that score. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, will you hand the diary to the Accused so that he might tell us that it is, in fact, his? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Yes.  This is most definitely mine.  This is my diary.  The content is divided into two phases:  what happened in Rwanda before we fled; and inasmuch as the inhabitants of Rusumo left on the 28th of April, then there is part of the diary concerning our sojourn at the refugee camp.  And I think that that information has nothing to do with this trial.  As I see it, there is no problem. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you noted that pages are missing in this diary? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Yes.  Certain pages are missing.  It is possible that it was I who tore them out, but the missing pages are not missing from the part concerning the month of April, which is the subject of the indictment.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Gacumbitsi. 

Counsel Kouengoua, are you tendering both documents as exhibits? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, most definitely, madam. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So D. 09 for the diary.  We put D. 09(A) and (B)?  Very well.  The documents are tendered and filed as documents D. 09(A) and D. 09(B).
MR. KAREGYESA:
Maybe Your Honour should include the English transcription because there are two transcriptions, one in English, one in French, so that the English one becomes (C), 09(C).
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the documents tendered by the Defence are D. 09(A) and (B).  I have not seen the English so I cannot tender it.  So I don't know whether it will be Prosecution exhibit or a Defence exhibit.  I merely tendered the Prosecution's transcript, translation, in French, and the original, but I really think we should press on, madam. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  
(Exhibit No. D. 09(A) and (B) admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Pray continue. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, on Friday, when you were naming your friends, you mentioned a certain Kanyogote.  Is he still with you?  Do you know where he is at the present time? 
A.	Kanyogote, Alphonse, who was my friend, is deceased.  I subsequently learned that.
Q.	Witness, before today's hearing, has anyone asked you any questions in respect of the events at Nyarubuye, in particular, and Rusumo, in general? 
A.	I did not understand your question, Counsel.  Please repeat it. 
Q.	(No translation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel please repeat the question?  It was not - it did not entirely translate.
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Personally, I left Rwanda in the first half of May, but everyone else who left in March, refugees and Rusumo commune inhabitants, left on the 28th of April.  But I stayed and left the country in the first half of May, or let's say in the first ten days of May. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	My question was:  When you left Rwanda, between that time in early May and your time -- and the moment at which you appeared here before the Tribunal, did anybody ask you any questions in respect of the events at Nyarubuye, in general, and in Rusumo - Nyarubuye, in particular, and Rusumo commune, in general?  That was my question. 
A.	Ah, fine, I understand.  After I fled, I remember a journalist, a white journalist, working for the BBC, interviewed me regarding the events at Nyarubuye.  He found me where food was being distributed to the refugees, and we had a chat. 
Q.	And what was the subject of your discussion, Witness? 
A.	He came asking to see me, found me where that -- at that place, and asked me questions about Nyarubuye.  He wanted to know how the Tutsi that were killed at Nyarubuye parish had died.  I told him that I was not present at the time of that massacre.  I subsequently learned that evil-doers from our commune had come and had found them there and killed them, but I told him that personally I had not witnessed the killings.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, in 1994, did you know the name of the military commander at Kibungo? 
A.	Yes, I knew it.  The commander at Kibungo camp was Colonel Nkuriye Kubona.  Nkuriye Kubona, I will spell that for you:  N-K-U-N-E --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could we have that again, please? 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	At the same time, did you know one Ndekezi? 
A.	In April, you mean? 
Q.	No. 
A.	In April, I knew no Ndekezi who lived at Rusumo.
Q.	Did you know any gentleman called Ndekezi in the month of April?  And if so, who was it? 
A.	Before 1994, I think in 1991, one Major Ndekezi came to Rusumo, heading a contingent, and the contingent spent some time there before withdrawing.  The Rwandan armed forces came to Rusumo immediately after the RPF attack, to ensure security in the border area, the frontier area.  Ndekezi was the commander of that detachment, and that is how I got to know him.
Q.	And what happened to him in 1994? 
A.	Yes.  I know what happened to him.  Ndekezi was active in the context of the UNAMIR in 1994.
Q.	Witness, where does your family live now? 
A.	My family is in Rwanda, my entire family.
Q.	And what are their relations with their neighbours? 
A.	I have learnt that my family is living in good neighbourliness with our neighbours in Kavuzo cellule, where I used to live.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, thank you very much.  Thank you for your kind attention. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, you may proceed with cross-examination of the witness, the Accused. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Can I just be excused for one minute from the Chamber before I start my cross? 
JUDGE REDDY:
Before you go, are you likely to finish today? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes, thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, wait.  Sorry.  Anyhow, Counsel Mbattang is there, so pray proceed with cross-examination.  I think Counsel Kouengoua is not here but Counsel Mbattang is present. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, it's correct you were a teacher for approximately 20 years between 1963 and 1983, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  It is correct.
Q.	And this 20 years was spent in the Rusumo commune, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And for the eight years between 1975 and 1983, you were the chairman of the Banque populaire in Rusumo?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And this would have been the only bank in Rusumo between 1975 and 1983, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And for the 11 years, 1983 to 1991, you were also -- sorry, the eight years between -- the 11 years between 1983 and 1994, you were the bourgmestre? 
A.	Yes, I was a bourgmestre.
Q.	And between 1983 and 1991, you also doubled as the chairman of the MRND in Rusumo commune? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  Inasmuch as the law allowed it, that was the case.
Q.	So you will agree with me, Witness, that you were chief executive of the commune, which was a corporation sole, during your tenure as bourgmestre? 
A.	Can you repeat the question, please, Counsel? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness says he hasn't clearly understood your question.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	I was just saying, Witness, that you were the chief executive of the commune during your tenure as bourgmestre, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  That goes without saying.  I was the bourgmestre; therefore, I was the chief executive of the commune.
Q.	And you had been appointed by presidential decree in August 1983, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	So between 1983 and 1991, you were both the political head and the administrative head of Rusumo commune?
A.	Yes.  Until 1991, that was the situation.
Q.	And in that capacity, as both the political and administrative head of the commune, you regularly visited the various secteurs in your commune?   
A.	Yes.  I had to know what the situation was in the various secteurs of the commune, and therefore I had to hold meetings in the secteurs.  Therefore, it goes without saying that I had to act in that manner.
Q.	And it's also true, Witness, that during your tenure, between 1983 and 1994, Rusumo commune achieved remarkable growth and development? 
A.	The commune did all that was within its powers.  To say that the commune attained a remarkable level of development, I cannot assert that, but I know that there were development projects that were undertaken at the communal level.
Q.	Now, Witness, in your regular visits to the secteurs, where you addressed the population, during the 11 years as bourgmestre, you were a well-known figure, weren't you? 
A.	Well, a bourgmestre in his commune is somebody who is well known.
Q.	In fact, you were very popular, weren't you? 
A.	Yes, until 1991.  At the time of the single party, there was cohesion; there were no disturbances.  I could hold meetings with the local population, talk to them about development projects.  People would come from various préfectures of the country, and I would try to build cohesion among all the various groups of the population.  And this worked very well until 1991.
Q.	And it would also be true, Witness, that even though -- even subsequent to 1991, you were generally popular amongst the Tutsi inhabitants of your commune, isn't it? 
A.	I have always been loved by the Tutsi.  The Tutsi were my friends.  They have never hated me.
Q.	And the fact is they never hated you; they loved and trusted you, isn't it, Witness? 
A.	Yes, yes.  What you're saying is true.  It is true what you're saying.
Q.	And they had no reason to fear you, Witness, isn't it? 
A.	Normally, a leader should not be feared by those he -- those under his authority.  People under a leader's authority must come to the leader to present to him their problems, and the leader, in his turn, must solve those problems.  Therefore, if a leader is feared by members of the local population, he can not properly do his work.
Q.	And it's for that reason, Witness, that your friend Alphonse Kanyogote sought refuge at your residence on the evening of the 14th of April 1994, isn't it? 
A.	Kanyogote never took refuge in my house.  If he had taken refuge in my house, that would have pleased me, because he was a friend, a great friend indeed.  Nevertheless, Kanyogote never took refuge in the house of Gacumbitsi, the bourgmestre.
Q.	In fact, he took refuge at your house, Witness, and you betrayed his trust, didn't you? 
A.	I will repeat what I said.  Kanyogote never took refuge in my house.  Until April, Kanyogote was my close friend.  Moreover, I am the godfather of his son.  We trusted one another.  Kanyogote never set his foot in my house in the month of April.
Q.	But it's true, Witness, that you handed him over to killers who butchered him a few metres from your house on the evening of 14th of April 1994?
A.	No.  Not at all.  He was never in my house.  How could I have handed over to -- handed him over to assailants who killed him since he was never in my house and moreover he was my friend?  Besides, I have many friends who found refuge in my house.  They were not affected in any way.  How could I have delivered or handed him over to the assailants?  If he had come to my house, I would have even given him shelter in my room, but he never came to my house.
Q.	Well, Witness, as bourgmestre, you had under you communal employees, didn't you? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And your communal employees included a dozen or so communal policemen, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And the policemen were directly under the communal brigadier, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  The communal policemen received instructions from the communal brigadier, with respect to their duties.
Q.	And the communal brigadier had a deputy, didn't he? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you do know one Kazoba, Witness, who was a policeman at the Rusumo commune, don't you? 
A.	Kazoba was not on the register of the communal policemen of Rusumo.
Q.	When you say he was not on the communal register, are you saying he was a policeman and not on the register or there was no policeman by the name of Kazoba?
A.	Well, as you know, when the policemen are paid, their names are written in a register.
Q.	So is it your evidence, Witness --
A.	I know many people by the name of Kazoba.
Q.	 -- there was no Kazoba gainfully employed as a policeman at Rusumo commune?  Is that your evidence?  During the period April 1994? 
A.	Are you referring to a surname or a nickname?  Because sometimes policemen have people refer to them by their nickname. 
Q.	Witness, my question hasn't been answered.  During the month of April 1994, was there a policeman attached to Rusumo commune by the name of Kazoba?  Yes or no. 
A.	No.
Q.	And, Witness, who was the deputy brigadier of the Rusumo communal police in April 1994? 
A.	The deputy communal brigadier was called Mwesigwa, Placide.
Q.	And he was also known as Kazoba, wasn't he? 
A.	I did not pay any attention to nicknames.  I called him by his name, Mwesigwa.  I have never called him by his nickname. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, Counsel, if that name could be spelt, please, for the record? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Kazoba is spelt K-A-Z-O-B-A.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I mean the name of the deputy communal brigadier.
MR. KAREGYESA:
I would ask the Kinyarwanda booth to assist us with that spelling, please. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mwesigwa, M-W-E-S-I-G-W-A.  Kazoba, K-A-Z-O-B-A. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, the last question wasn't answered.  Were you aware that Mwesigwa's alias was Kazoba? 
A.	Do you think that a bourgmestre would know nicknames?  I had communal policemen.  I called them by their real names.  I did not pay any attention to their nicknames.  That did not concern me.
Q.	And it would also be true, Witness, that there was a policeman called Jonathan Berakumenyo, isn't it?
A.	Yes.  That's true. 
Q.	And you also had a policeman by the name of Ruhinduka, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And it's true that the three policemen I have just mentioned were regularly in your company during the entire month of April 1994, isn't it? 
A.	No. 
Q.	In fact, it's true, isn't it, Witness, that Jonathan Berakumenyo and Ruhinduka were responsible, as your bodyguards, both at work and guarding your home at night? 
A.	I have answered in the negative.  Berakumenyo has never been my bodyguard.  Ruhinduka had never been my bodyguard either.  The tasks they performed were assigned to them by the brigadier.  The brigadier would assign work to them, but I would say that they had never been my bodyguards.
Q.	And it's true, Witness, that during the month of April 1994, you had communal policemen guarding your residence, isn't it? 
A.	They used to come to my house and would leave.  I kept them in my house for two days, but normally, I did not have policemen to guard my residence.
Q.	And that would be true, Witness, because you possessed a Lee-Enfield rifle, didn't you? 
A.	Are you referring to a rifle?  You mean a rifle that I own or a rifle owned by the commune?  I would like clarifications on this point, Counsel for the Prosecution, please. 
Q.	Witness, you kept a Lee-Enfield rifle at your residence prior to and during the month of April 1994, didn't you? 
A.	Can you look towards me, Counsel for the Prosecution?  I, Gacumbitsi, bourgmestre, I do not know how to use a firearm.  You can even carry out investigations.  No one would tell you that I know how to operate a firearm.  How, therefore, could I keep a firearm in my residence, given that I do not know how to use one? 
Q.	In fact, Witness, you were taught by Jonathan Berakumenyo on how to use the gun and even to clean it, isn't it?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I would like the Bench to ask the Prosecutor to review his line of questioning, for the simple reason that the person who is appearing today before you has another status.  He is a witness.  Perhaps since he did not question him as an Accused, the Prosecutor would like to make up for what he did not do.  Unfortunately, this is not the forum.  The Prosecutor had the opportunity to hear people whose names are mentioned.  In fact, he didn't call them as witnesses, and at the last moment he failed to call them.  It is not for Gacumbitsi to answer on behalf of those witnesses who failed to appear.  In particular, a certain Berakumenyo, who apparently said certain things, things which I refrain from mentioning here before the Court.  But all I'm saying is that the Bench should remind the Prosecutor that Gacumbitsi is appearing here before you as a witness.  The Prosecutor had the opportunity to question him as an Accused.  Now he's questioning him as a witness.  This is not -- the Bench is hearing the matter now, and the Prosecutor is asking questions to the witness and not to the Accused. 

That's what I wanted to say, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, do you want to respond to what Mr. Kouengoua, the Defence counsel, has said? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I'm not quite sure I understood what he said, but I'll proceed with another line of questioning, Your Honours. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, in your testimony in chief on Friday and today, you made reference to Cyasa, am I correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And --
A.	Yes.
Q.	And Cyasa's actual names are Habimana, Emmanuel, isn't it? 
A.	I know him by the name Cyasa.  Otherwise, I do not know any other names he may have.
Q.	Now, as a prominent member of the MRND in Rusumo commune in 1994, you would have known that Cyasa was the préfectural president of the MRND Interahamwe in the whole of Kibungo préfecture, wouldn't you? 
A.	Counsel, I'm going to explain to you the following:  Since you are using the term Interahamwe, I will tell you that there were no Interahamwe in my residence.  That is point number 1.  

Secondly, I have never known Cyasa as someone with whom we shared everything.  I was able to know Cyasa here in prison.  I carried out investigations and I was informed that Cyasa came from the Mugesera commune and that he was a member of the MDR party, but that later on, he changed parties; he became a member of the MRND party.  I was told that he had young men under his orders, in the Kibungo préfecture, but I did not know him as such.  Perhaps he knew me as -- in my capacity as bourgmestre, but we never shared a drink.  That is how I know him.  I wouldn't say that I know Cyasa as I know other persons.  I wouldn't say that I know him very well.
Q.	Now, Witness, you still have not answered the question.  Please try and be brief.  Were you aware then, in April 1994, that Cyasa was the president of the MRND Interahamwe in Kibungo préfecture? 
A.	I heard people talk about that.
Q.	And it's also true, Witness, isn't it, that prior to that, prior to 1990, Cyasa was a soldier stationed in the detachment in Rusumo, isn't it? 
A.	No, no.  I don't know anything about that. 
Q.	In fact, he was a regular visitor to your house, and you shared alcoholic beverages?
A.	What are you talking about?  In fact, I'm surprised.  I never shared a drink with Cyasa.  I did not know Cyasa.  It is here in prison that I knew him, when I asked questions concerning him.  Otherwise, I do not know anything about the allegations that you are making. 
Q.	So is it now your evidence that, in April 1994, you did not know of the existence of Cyasa but that you came to learn about Cyasa while you were in the UNDF?  
A.	I know, for example, that -- that you are a Prosecutor, but I do not know you very well.  To know someone is to know one's -- that person's behaviour, their residence, in fact, in such a manner as to be able to clearly explain or talk about the personality of that person you claim to know.  But you could know someone's name -- you know, for example, that the person is called Antoine -- without nevertheless being able to talk about the personality of that person.  I knew Cyasa by name but I could not, for example, talk about his behaviour.  I could not say what type of person he was. 
Q.	Let's establish what you knew about Cyasa.  One, it's correct that you knew that there was a person called Cyasa, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, what more did you know about him (microphone not activated) 1994? 
A.	I knew the name of Cyasa.  I knew that he was at the head of a group of Interahamwe at the Kibungo préfecture.  That's all I knew.  I also knew that at some point in time he was a soldier.
(Pages 13 to 24 by Mark Porter)

















	1630H
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	And did you know whether he was a good man or bad man in April 1994?
A.	Now you are referring to the point I mentioned a while ago, precisely that on the 13th he sent assailants to destroy my residence, because Cyasa was an extremist. Everyone knew that he was a bad guy.  He sent a group of assailants to destroy my house in Rusumo, under the pretext that I was sheltering Tutsis in my house.  I knew him in that capacity.  I knew that he was a very bad guy.
Q.	In fact, to use your words on Friday, and I quote: "A very, very wicked extremist who had a group of Interahamwes working or operating under his authority."
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	Now, in April 1994, Witness, you were aware, weren't you, that the MRND Interahamwe were an armed militia, weren't you?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you know that they were a dangerous lot?
A.	We knew that the Interahamwe were based in Kigali, and that they had well-known leaders there.  These were provisional leaders.  There were no other Interahamwe organs in the other communes.  They were based in Kigali.  In Rusumo commune, for instance, there were no Interahamwe.  I only knew about the Interahamwe who were resident in Kigali town.
Q.	So are you now saying there were no Interahamwe in Kibongo, Witness, that they were only in Kigali town?
A.	That is what people were saying; however, to my knowledge, there was no organised group of Interahamwe in Rusumo commune.  However, people were saying that there was a group of Interahamwe in Kibongo led by Cyasa.
Q.	And it's true, Witness, isn't it, that Rusumo had MRND Interahamwe in April 1994?
A.	No.
Q.	Witness, when did you learn of the death of the bourgmestre of Kinigi commune in Ruhengeri préfecture?
A.	I learnt about it over the radio.
Q.	I'm asking when, on what date did you learn of that incident?
A.	The radio broadcast that information on the 8th or the 9th.  On the 8th in the evening, or the 9th, somewhere around those two dates.
Q.	And according to you, he had been killed by assailants?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And for that reason, Witness, you purport to have gone into hiding?
A.	It is human to be afraid.  Besides, he was not the only bourgmestre who was killed, there were others.  For instance, the bourgmestre of Kiosa commune was killed; a bourgmestre of the Gitarama commune was also killed.  He was not the only bourgmestre who was killed, others were killed as well.  Further more, you yourself, Prosecutor, would have been afraid.  If someone threatened you with death, I don't think you would stay where you are.  You would -- I don't think you would abandon yourself to your -- to the evil human doers.  You yourself are human and you would be afraid.
Q.	So it is your evidence, Witness, that Cyasa's Interahamwe were evil-doers?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Witness, approximately six weeks after the massacre at Nyarubuye parish on the 15th of April 1994, you were interviewed in Benaco camp by a BBC journalist, Fergal Keane, weren't you?
A.	Yes, that is true.  It was in May -- no, it was rather in the month of June.
Q.	In fact, it was on or about the 30th of May 1994, wasn't it?
A.	No, it was in the month of June.  I do not quite recall the exact date, but it was not in the month of May.
Q.	Didn't you record it in your diary, Witness?
A.	No, I did not record it in my diary.
Q.	So it would be correct to suggest that you cannot recall dates unless you record them in your diary?
A.	I beg your pardon?  Could you please repeat the question, Counsel?  I didn't quite grasp your question.
Q.	It would be correct to suggest that, Witness, you cannot recall dates offhand unless you record events in your diary, isn't it?
A.	Listen, you may remember dates that are not recorded in your diary.  Many journalists were visiting the camp and asking questions on the events that had occurred in Rwanda, and we explained to them how the events and the war unfolded.  That journalist came within that framework and he put very specific questions to me regarding the events in Nyarubuye, but I did not record the date of that interview in my diary.
Q.	Well, I'm putting it to you, Witness, that it was on the 30th of May 1994.
A.	That is your version of the events, but I know that it was not on that date.
Q.	Now --
A.	What is important to note is that he came to the camp and he spoke to me.
Q.	Now, Witness, as a seasoned bureaucrat or civil servant, you would have been a meticulous keeper of records, wouldn't you?
A.	But I did not do that.  You can record an event in a diary and forget others, but if you want to visit someone in the evening, would you record it in it a diary?  It depends on the events in question.  It is not all events that one has to record in a diary.
Q.	So you would agree with me, Witness, that in such circumstances you'd only record significant events, not any ordinary event, isn't it?
A.	No, no.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
(Not interpreted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Kouengoua. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The Prosecutor is making suggestions and making remarks thereon.  What he should do is to put questions to the witness and not make comments and try to establish events  -- the link between the events and what he recorded.  I don't think this is the kind of questioning we should expect of the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

What do you have to say, Counsel for the Prosecution? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
It takes no learning, Your Honours, at least in this jurisdiction, that in cross-examination I'm entitle, it's within my remit, to put suggestions to the witness in circumstances where the last suggestion I put to him actually arose from his answer to my last question.  So I think counsel's objection is misplaced and should be overruled.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, please proceed.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Madam President. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, it's true, isn't it, that in a diary you would ordinarily record significant events?
A.	You may record important events, but you may also forget to do so, but -- while bearing in mind that such events occurred.  I don't think that there is anything wrong in that.
Q.	Now, I will take you back to your interview with Fergal Keane in Benaco camp.  Now, it's true, isn't it, that this interview was recorded by video camera onto a video tape; isn't it?
A.	Yes, yes.  We spoke with one another.  There were cameras that were shooting the interview.
Q.	And it's true he asked you, amongst other things, about the Nyarubuye massacre; didn't he?
A.	Yes, he asked questions regarding that event.
Q.	And he also asked you about your whereabouts on the 12th of April 1994, didn't he?
A.	No, he did not put that question to me.
Q.	Witness, is it your evidence that Fergal Keane did not ask you about your whereabouts on the 12th of April 1994?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
What date?  I haven't quite understood your question, Prosecutor.  Could you please kindly repeat?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Kouengoua. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Fergal Keane was the first Prosecution witness.  He testified before this Chamber on the 28th  -- 2nd June 2003.  He should have put those questions to the -- that witness.  I don't think in this trial Gacumbitsi should answer the questions which should have been put to that witness.  We should ask questions that are relevant.  We examined Fergal during four days.  I don't think it is for the witness who is in the dock to answer those questions.  This line of questioning is not appropriate, 
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, what do you have to say to that objection?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, we submit that it's entirely within our remit.  The subject interview is to be found on Prosecution Exhibit No. 7, a copy of which was disclosed to the Defence and tendered through the evidence of Fergal Keane.  And in circumstances where the witness can recall and confirm the interview, it's within my remit to question him about what transpired in that interview.  Most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection overruled.  Proceed, Prosecutor. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Madam President. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, it's a simple question.  Do you recall Fergal Keane asking you about your whereabouts on the 12th of April 1994?
A.	I do not very well remember.  Besides, the document you disclosed to the Defence is not in my possession.  I do not recall having been asked that question.  I remember that he asked questions regarding events in Nyarubuye, and I explained to him that I didn't go to Nyarubuye at the time that refugees from Nyarubuye -- in Nyarubuye were being killed.  Besides, I asked him to ask those questions to the refugees who were in Nyarubuye camp.  Besides, they were there and they were eating, but Fergal Keane did not want to ask them those questions.  I asked him to put those questions to them, but he didn't do so and he left.
Q.	Do you recall telling Mr. Keane that the killings in Rusumo started on the -- on April the 28th 1994 when the RPF arrived?
A.	The RPF arrived on the 28th through Rukira commune, and they were killing people.  They came in through Gatore secteur.  They killed people indiscriminately and they first of all went to Nasho, to Panga, where they killed people.  So they started killing people at that time, but we were dealing with bandits who were killing people prior to the arrival of the RPF.
Q.	Witness, if you could just try and restrict yourself to your interview with Fergal Keane at Benaco camp because these are the questions I'm asking you.  And I will just repeat my last question because it wasn't answered.  Do you recall, in answer to Fergal's question about the start of the killings, telling him that the killings began on April the 28th, 1994 subsequent to the arrival of RPF forces in Rusumo?
A.	The RPF arrived, killing people indiscriminately, and it was on the 28th.  But I told you that before then, they had killed people in the north of the commune of Rusumo, notably in the Panga.  When they came they forced us to flee, and they killed people indiscriminately.
Q.	I advise you once again, Witness, to stick to the question asked and this is about your interview with Fergal Keane.  Now, do you recall telling this Chamber this afternoon that the Nyarubuye massacre occurred on the 15th of April 1994?  And you recall telling this Chamber --
A.	I said that.
Q.	And you recall telling this Chamber this afternoon that you received a report from the communal brigadier on the evening of 16th April 1994, isn't it?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Objection, Madam President.  It is not -- what we are hearing now is not what we got from the French interpreter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the Accused has said yes to that.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
If what the Accused is receiving is not what we are receiving, Madam President, the Prosecutor said that it was communal brigadier who informed him, isn't it?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, could you please answer the question?  Could you answer the question put to you by the Prosecutor?  You started answering it, it seems, the question that was put to you.  Would you like that question to be repeated? 
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Yes, it is better, it is better that that question be repeated.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, could you please repeat your question.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Madam President.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, do you recall telling this Chamber, earlier on, that on the evening of the 16th of April 1994 you received a report from the communal brigadier subsequent to an inquiry about what transpired at Nyarubuye parish the day before?
A.	Yes.  If we are referring to the morning of that -- to that Saturday morning, I said that I received a report on the events of the day before.  I also remember saying that the sous-préfet sent investigator to Nyarubuye and it was on his return from Nyarubuye that that investigator gave me a report.
Q.	And you agree with me that that investigator was also the communal brigadier, isn't it?
A.	Yes, absolutely.  He was the one who went to investigate the situation.
Q.	And he told you that approximately 800 to 1,000 refugees had been killed at Nyarubuye parish, didn't he?
A.	Yes, those were the estimates he gave.
Q.	And he also told you that according to his investigation, the assailants included soldiers and gendarmes from the Mulindi gendarmerie post; didn't he?
A.	He was not the one who told me.  It was rather the person who came to inform me about events on Saturday morning who told me so.  That person made reference to soldiers.  He was saying that there were soldiers among the attackers, and it was later that I heard that gendarmes from Mulindi, and more specifically from Rukira commune, had also taken part in that massacre.
Q.	So, let's get it straight, Witness.  On the morning of Saturday the 16th of April 1994, you receive a  report from Neza that the attackers included soldiers and gendarmes from Mulindi, who forced the population to go with them to commit the killings; didn't you?
A.	No.  What he said was that amongst the attackers there were soldiers.  Those were his words.  He did not mix up all those groups.  It was subsequently that the findings of the investigations showed that it was the gendarmes who had forcefully taken members of the population -- abducted members of the population and led them away to take part in the killings.
Q.	But it's true, Witness, isn't it, that in your testimony this afternoon you attribute this information about the gendarmes as coming --  or you attribute it as information coming from Neza on the morning of the 16th of April 1994?
A.	Yes, that's it.  I don't know exactly what words I used, if I spoke of military or gendarmes but, in any case, they were all mixed together, military, gendarmes and local inhabitants.  Neza spoke to me of militaire, but it was on the basis of the investigation that we knew that it was gendarme.  You can countercheck, crosscheck what I have said but, in any case, what I meant to speak of was the military.
Q.	So we are talking of two forces here, the military and the gendarmerie, aren't we?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And it's your evidence, isn't it, that you received this information from Neza on the morning of 16th of April 1994?
A.	Yes.  But in truth, it was gendarmes from Mulindi.  There was no other detachment.  There was no military detachment in Mulindi.  What he meant to tell me was that it was gendarmes but he did not know how to distinguish them.  It was not military, it was the gendarmes because they were the only one who had an encampment at Mulindi in Rukira commune.
Q.	And what information, Witness, did you receive from the communal brigadier who investigated the matter other than the 800 to 1,000 people dead?
A.	He said that, according to his investigations, gendarmes had taken part in the massacres.  You see, that's somewhat more precise.
Q.	Now, in addition to the gendarmes, it's true, Witness, that there were also Cyasa's Interahamwe in that attack, isn't it?
A.	I don't know.  I don't know anything about that.  I heard that there were civilians and gendarme.  Not being present, I can't tell you with any degree of precision who were the others who had participated in that massacre.
Q.	Witness, I'm asking you about the investigation report filed with you, the bourgmestre, by your own brigadier.  Now, we've established that your brigadier told you that gendarmes from Mulindi post participated in the attack; you have also mentioned civilians.  Is that all the information you received from your brigadier?
A.	Yes, that's all.  That's all he told me.
Q.	And did your brigadier inform you how these 800 to 1,000 people had been killed?
A.	He took testimony from the people he met, and according to that testimony, the victims were killed by grenade and gunfire.  He did not give any -- supply any further information.
Q.	Now, the death of 1,000 people in your commune, Witness, would have been a very significant event, wouldn't it?
A.	Yes, it saddened me greatly.  I was shocked.  People who had come to seek refuge, knowing that Rusumo was a safe place, they were chased, hunted down and killed.  It was tragic, you see; yes, yes, it was tragic.
Q.	And despite this tragedy, Witness, there is no entry in your diary either for the 15th when the massacre took place, or the 16th, when you received an investigator's report, is there?
A.	No, I did not make an entry regarding that.
Q.	Now, Witness, I will take you back to your interview with Fergal Keane.  

It's true, Witness, isn't it, that you told Fergal Keane that the Interahamwe were good people and did not go about killing people?
A.	In general, when we spoke of Interahamwe in Kigali and elsewhere, those Interahamwe were not set up, organised to kill.  It was comparable to a political party.  It would help me a lot if I had the transcript of that interview.  I only saw a film of the interview.  I'm not sure any longer what I said.  In fact, I wrote to that man.  I wrote to the director, asking them how Fergal could have made a film when he arrived in Rwanda after interviewing me and not paying due regard to the advise I gave him.  I was not given a copy of the film. I was saddened to see that he mixed me up with the killers.  I really couldn't be among the killers.
Q.	Witness, do you recall in your interview with Fergal Keane saying at least the Interahamwe in your place, meaning Rusumo commune, would not go about killing people?
A.	Listen, youth, youth, youth that prepared demonstrations, that organised rallies, were not killers.  The killers are easy to distinguish.  They are armed, whereas youth groups in the commune only were preparing demonstrations, political rallies, but not indulging massacres.  And I understand that you confuse Rusumo youth with Kigali youth.  We had youth monitors in the commune.  The monitor followed the associations closely, the games, sports, all youth activities.  I don't know if you are trying thereby to compare the youth of our commune to the youth of Kigali.
Q.	Witness, I made no reference to Kigali.  And if you could try and listen to the question and be brief.  Do you recall, when pressed for an answer by Fergal Keane, responding, and I quote: "It's the youth who organise themselves for animation and other things like that, but not to kill"?  Do you recall saying that, Witness?
A.	Okay, I said it as regards the incadrement of the youth.  I was speaking of mixed youth; Hutu and Tutsi, and who had someone in charge.  It wasn't in the context of the war that I was speaking.
Q.	Now, first of all, Witness, it's true, isn't it, that the Interahamwe were the militia of the MRND party to which you belonged?
A.	In Rusumo?  In Rusumo, no, that was not the case.
Q.	And it could also be true, Witness, that Fergal Keane's questioning was about the massacre in Nyarubuye parish, isn't it?
A.	I explained to Fergal Keane what I knew, but that had nothing to do with the Nyarubuye massacre.  It was an item apart on the subject of the youth.  It was a sub-question, in brackets, let's say trying to lead me to the events at the parish, and I didn't want to speak about the event at the parish because I wasn't there.
Q.	In fact, Witness, you didn't even remember the date of the Nyarubuye parish massacre when asked by Fergal Keane, did you?
A.	Why?  When he came he had a date in mind, but I knew on what date the events had occurred.
Q.	Witness, what date did your interviewer Fergal Keane have in mind?
A.	The one that you are putting forward.
Q.	Witness, I'm not putting forward any date, I'm asking you.  You have suggested to this Chamber that Fergal Keane came with a date in mind.  I'm asking you to tell us what date did Fergal Keane have in mind.
A.	No, I couldn't read his mind.  I knew one date.  I don't know what date he had in mind.  He asked me questions and I answered them.
Q.	Do you recall telling Fergal Keane, and I quote: "I have not confirmed the date, the date.  What I know is that there were deaths.  There were people who came from neighbouring communes, they killed; that I heard.  But the date I do not remember.  The date I do not remember"?
A.	I don't recall what I said any longer verbatim.  I can't remember.
Q.	I will take you to the date of the 12th, Witness.  Do you recall telling Fergal Keane that you did not know your whereabouts on the 12th of April 1994?
A.	I stated before the Chamber where I was on the 12th.  I said that I had gone to Gatore where 
wrong-doers, evil-doers, had killed Nkurinzinza's family.
Q.	Witness, forget what you've told this Court, I'm taking you back to your interview with Fergal Keane.  Do you recall telling him that you didn't remember where you were on the 12th of April 1994?
A.	Listen, I really do not remember.  We spoke of many things.  The matter which interested him was Nyarubuye.  He came asserting that it was I who had killed the people at Nyarubuye, which I refused to accept.  The rest of it is just talk.
Q.	Witness, I will take you back to your diary.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Kouengoua. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the counsel for the Prosecution has asked a series of questions on documents that he obtained from Fergal Keane.  The Trial Chamber -- this was never disclosed to the Trial Chamber nor the Defence, nor the witness.  And this is what I have been criticising; where did he get his material?  Nothing was disclosed to me.  And he said -- he said, "Let me take you to the 12th.  You say that on the 12th" -- this is a great sadness and embarrassment for me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, do you wish to respond to the Defence objection? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I repeat once again, the interview is contained in Prosecution Exhibit No. 7.  We invited counsel to inspect.  He didn't inspect and we went one step further and disclosed the tapes to counsel, and he actually watched the tapes with his client in this Chamber, I believe, on the 28th of July this year, when we commenced trial.  So I'm surprised that counsel should be on record making such misrepresentations.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, if it's the cassette that we are referring to, there was no sound before the session.  I don't know if anybody heard anything or saw anything, it was silent throughout the hearing.  So if that's what you are referring to, I'm very sorry you presented and that's what we saw, but I don't remember anything about the 12th.  I'm very sorry.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, counsel was given the complete set of videotapes, which included sound.  During the Prosecutor's evidence of Fergal Keane, the Prosecutor opted not to play any sound, but the sound is on both the tapes availed to counsel and the Prosecution exhibits in the custody of the registry.  And may I add, that during the break, when counsel was reviewing the material in this Chamber on the 28th of July this year, there was sound being played.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Your Honours.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q. Witness, I will take you to your diary -
MR. KAREGYESA:
And if the registry could hand me the original.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, can you please turn to page 11 of the transcripts you have, French transcripts.  Do you have page 11, Witness?  Page 11 on the bottom right-hand corner of the exhibit?  Now, you agree with me, Witness, that on the top of that page there is an entry for security meeting in Kibongo for the 8th of April 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And the rest of the entry relates to what was purportedly agreed at that security meeting in Kibongo?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, Witness, is it common for you to make double entries in the same diary about the same incident?
A.	It's possible.  It wouldn't surprise me.
Q.	Was it your practice, Witness?
A.	It depends.  It depends on the use to which one puts one's diary.  You can just use a page to write stuff without mentioning the date.  It can happen.
Q.	Now, in circumstances where you have mentioned a date and made entries against that date, would you replicate that information in another part of the diary?
A.	Well, you might decide to copy the information more tidily.  You can be in a hurry and scribble something down and later recopy it more tidily on your page.  That can happen -- that happens.
Q.	Okay, let's go to page 34, Witness.  Now, you agree with me, Witness, that on that page the first entry is the assassination of the president on the 6th of April 1994, isn't it?  And the second entry --
A.	Yes, it is mentioned.
Q.	And the second entry is the Friday 8th April meeting of the Kibongo security committee, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And on this page you replicate what appears on page 11, don't you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Let's go to page 13, Witness.  Page 13 is an entry for 11th April 1994, Nyamugali; isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, turn to page 35, Witness.  Are you on page 35?
A.	I don't have that page.  Perhaps it's the page before because in the booth's copy it's mixed up.  I see page 34 and the next page is 36. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It was perhaps presented in the wrong order.  Please look, Witness, what you have after page 33.
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Oh, yes, yes, yes, thank you.  I have it.  Very well, I have got the right place now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Prosecution, please proceed.
(Pages 25 to 35 by Gifty C. Harding)






























	1730H
BY MR. KAREGYESA :
Q.	Now, you agree with me, Witness, that on page 35, you reconstruct the events of Nyamugali secteur in an entry for 9th of April 1994, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, the date of the 9th is followed by an entry on the 11th.  The date of 11th April is followed by a different entry.  These are two different entries. 
Q.	You will agree with me, Witness, that there is no entry of 11th of April, is there, on that page? 
A.	No, there is an entry against the date of the 11th of April. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I think the dates are there, in the French copy we have.  

Prosecutor, let us end with this.  You promised to end this evening.  For some time now, you have been turning around certain things which do not deserve attention, which are irrelevant.  After the interview of the journalist, these crimes -- Madam President, we should stop.  The Prosecutor has no further questions and we can understand that.

Registry, can you please collect the original which the Chamber gave to you to preserve because it is still in the possession of the Prosecutor, I don't know why, and he is referring us to page 35. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence counsel, allow the Prosecutor to continue because you are making us waste more time when you interrupt the Prosecutor.  Let us see what he has to say in connection with the 11th of April, but it would appear that 11th of April is also on this page. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I am most obliged, Your Honours.  It just didn't appear on the English transcription.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	And you will agree with me, Witness, that overleaf, on page 36, or starting at the bottom of page 35, you have an entry about the attack on Nkurunzinza's house. 
A.	Are you talking about the residence of Nkurunzinza?  Yes, I have found the passage. 
Q.	Now, I will take you back, Witness, to page 14.  Do you agree with me that it contains an entry, once again, or for the third time, for Wednesday the 6th, the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Yes, I can see that entry. 
Q.	And it also contains an undated entry regarding the meeting of the préfectural security council committee? 
A.	Yes, indeed, there is no date against that entry. 
Q.	And these same entries are reproduced at page 34; isn't it, Witness? 
A.	Yes, but where is the problem? 
Q.	I will take you now, Witness, to page 15.  You will agree with me that there is an entry for the 12th of April 1994, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now turn to page 36, Witness.  Sorry page 37.  There is an entry on page 37 corresponding to an entry on page 15, isn't it?
A.	Very well. 
Q.	And, you do agree with me, Witness, that in all these entries, no mention is made of the purported release of the criminals you allegedly arrested in Nyamugali and in Gatore? 
A.	As you can see under the date of the 12th, I am talking about people killed in the Musaza secteur.  This flows or follows from the information which I obtained from the conseiller, who informed me or who gave me the information on the 12th.  He talked to me about this problem. 
Q.	Witness, will you please answer the question?  You are answering something that I haven't asked you.  My question is simple and straightforward.  Is there any entry of the purported forceful release of the criminals you purportedly arrested and detained from Nyamugali and Gatore?
A.	Yes, I was going to get to that point.  I have not mentioned that. 
Q.	In the diary where any entry is, it is this --
A.	 (No interpretation)
Q.	Very well, let's move on, Witness.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Can we have a translation of what he has just said?
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
No, I have not written it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, I think you've said something, perhaps the interpreter did not hear it.  Can you repeat what you said?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The witness said that he did not mention or he did not make that entry in his diary. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you. 

The interpreter, please can you repeat, because the witness did not hear what was said?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the interpreter remembers having said everything unless -- if the Prosecutor wants to repeat the question.  I think that would be better if the question can be repeated. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, please can you repeat the question? 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, the question which you just answered needs to be reposed and reanswered for the record.  And can you tell Their Lordships whether there is an entry in your diary about the purported forceful release of the criminals you allegedly arrested in Nyamugali and Gatore?  Yes or no? 
A.	I have not entered that in my diary, but they were forcibly released. 
Q.	So, would it be correct to suggest, Witness, that their forceful release was not a significant event? 
A.	I have said that it was an important incident because I asked the sous préfet what it was all about and he gave me explanations.  Of course, it was an important event. 
Q.	Now, it is true, isn't it, Witness, that you didn't record it because you released these criminals.  They were never forcefully released by other criminals as you allege? 
A.	I would dare you to carry out an investigation; do whatever you please.  In the final analysis, you would find out that I was not the one who released them. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you have told Their Lordships that you conducted an investigation on the 13th April 1994 and established that Cyasa, who you called a very very wicked man, had sent Interahamwes to Nyakarambi and that you feared you would be harmed by those Interahamwes? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you purport to have gone into hiding?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you purport to have gone into hiding as a result of those threats, isn't it, Witness? 
A.	That is correct.  That group was not alone, there were other persons in the commune who wanted to kill me. 
Q.	And any attempt on the chief executive of the commune, Witness, would be a very very significant event, wouldn't it? 
A.	Well, when you are told, "We will kill you", how can you take that lightly?  I am telling you that at that time, there were refugees from Byumba, where the war had started, who told me not to take that lightly.  They told me they could kill me; they told me that I could be killed, that I could be murdered in my own house, and I explained to them the situation.  They understood me.  Those persons are still alive.  They are in Rwanda up to date. 
Q.	Now, you will agree with me, Witness, that nowhere in your diary is an entry made on the purported threats to your life? 
A.	I am saying that that is not mentioned but that would not have prevented that crime from being committed.  
Q.	So, Witness, you agree with me that the three significant events are not recorded in your diary, isn't it? 
A.	Well, if they are not recorded, then they are not recorded, that's it.
Q.	Did you tell this Court earlier on that you fled to Tanzania in the middle of May 1994? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  That is the time when I fled. 
Q.	Your flight would be a significant event worthy of recording, wouldn't it, Witness? 
A.	I was miserable.  Why didn't I flee with the others?  Why didn't I flee after the others?  If you want to ask me about this, I will be ready to tell you.  Moreover, some witnesses talked about this.
Q.	Witness, you will agree with me that at page 21, sorry, page 22 of the diary, against an entry for the 28th of April 1994, you say, and I quote:  "That we fled to Tanzania, that Inkotanyi had arrived at Rusumo-Gatore, isn't it?
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Page 22. 
A.	Yes.  Yes, that is what is mentioned.  It is the most important date when thousands of refugees who were in Rusumo, as well as the inhabitants of Rusumo itself, fled passing by the Rusumo bridge.  I was the one who had to intervene with the customs authorities, to ask them to allow them to pass.  

Later on, I had to flee myself.  If you want to know more about this, you could ask me questions in that regard.  I would be willing to tell you the circumstances under which I fled. 
Q.	So, Witness, is it your evidence that you never fled to Tanzania on the 28th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	So it is correct to suggest, Witness, that this is a false entry in your diary, isn't it? 
A.	What is not correct?  Everything is correct. 
Q.	You have told this Chamber that you did not flee to Tanzania on the 28th of April 1994, yet your diary has an entry that you fled on the 28th of April 1994.  

Now, which of the two propositions is correct?  Did you flee on the 28th of April 1994, as is indicated in your diary, or did you flee subsequent to the 28th of April 1994, as you would wish this Chamber to believe? 
A.	I do not know whether it is a word "we" which causes the confusion because it is said that it is at that time that we fled towards Tanzania.  The Inkotanyi had arrived in Rusumo in Gatore.  So I do not know whether it is the word "we" which is confusing you.  I used the word "we" to refer to all these people, all refugees, all the inhabitants of Rusumo.  It is this word "we" which perhaps is confusing you, but I was not talking about myself.
MR. KAREGYESA:
May it please Your Honours.  Can we have an indication of how long this Chamber will be sitting?  I pose this question right now because we intend to play for the record the interview between Fergal Keane, our first Prosecution witness and the Accused, recorded in Benaco camp on the 30th of May 1994, to continue this cross-examination, and it runs for just about 20 minutes, maybe 27. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President --

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence counsel. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the Prosecutor's suggestion is a delicate one, because if the Chamber grants that request, I believe the Prosecutor will go to the extent of even drawing conclusions in this room.  That is not a normal procedure.  He asks questions to the witness, when he returns he can make a comparison with his tape and then he can write to you.  How can we -- why should we be held back here when the Chamber told everyone that the proceedings are coming to an end today.  That being the case, in what forum will the cassette be viewed?  Do you want to oppose one witness against another one, or does the Prosecutor want to confuse the witness?  I don't think it is appropriate to say that a cassette will be viewed, a cassette of a witness who had been here to compare it with the testimony of another witness.  I do not think this is proper.  It is even unthinkable.  

All I am telling the Prosecutor is that, if you forgot, you can come back to the transcripts of the last hearing.  

The Chamber decided that the Gacumbitsi case had to come to an end on the 24th of November 2003.  If this is a tactic for him to extend these proceedings, then I think it is once more inappropriate.  I thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Defence counsel.  

Yes, counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, it is not a tactic to delay this trial any further.  We are not of that disposition.  

I am informed, however, Your Honours, that tomorrow is not a public holiday as was initially anticipated.  And I don't think I have more than 45 minutes remaining.  If we play the interview for 20 minutes, I will probably have 20 minutes of questioning, and that would be it. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Mr. Prosecutor, I find it a little surprising that you never produced a diary as part of your case.  You objected vigorously when the Defence wanted to introduce it, and yet you have spent so much time cross-examining this witness on the diary.  There are many of the -- much of that cross-examination, really, are matters of comment once the diary is put into evidence.  We have spent a good 40 minutes on that.  If that piece of evidence was so relevant, I would have expected to see it as part of the Prosecution case. 

MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, it wasn't relevant to the Prosecution case.  But in the event that this Chamber allowed this diary in, we were obliged, initially we contested, and we were overruled.  This document was admitted onto the record, and we had to bring it to the attention of the Chamber.  We had to bring to the attention of the Chamber matters that are merely beyond comment or submission, the double entries and non-entries of key events.  

The submission arising out of that evidence is different.  We shall make comment during submissions, but we had to place on record certain things arising from this document that was admitted.  

Indeed, as you rightly know it, it wasn't relevant to the Prosecution case.  The Prosecution for that reason didn't rely on this diary for its case, and least did we expect it to be admitted onto the record. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, please.  I think there is a procedure for calling before your Court the same witness twice.  PK has already been called.  If the Prosecutor wants him to come back to explain the cassette, he can do so, but he cannot say that he will project the cassette of PK so as to confront another witness with that cassette.  I do not think this is a normal procedure.  I do not expect the Bench to tolerate that.  

But now, if he wants to call that witness again, that is his absolute right, there is another procedure to be followed, but the present procedure followed by the Prosecutor is not the one to be followed.   Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Mr. Gacumbitsi, do you want to say something?  I saw you raise your hand.  Do you want to say something, Mr. Gacumbitsi?  Do you have a problem?
THE ACCUSED GACUMBITSI:
Thank you, Madam President.  The Prosecutor wants to dwell on my diary list.  He is talking about double entries, but I explained that I was trying to tidy up some information, to correctly write some information.  I was in a refugee camp when I did this, and I realised that this causes a problem before this Court.  

Here we are talking about omissions of important events, double entries.  Do you really think that I was preparing to appear before a court when I was doing this, at the time when I was not even indicted, when I was not an accused?  I think this is pure injustice.  An attempt to dwell on this is injustice.  What is mentioned is mentioned, and it is true I should not be asked why I entered this or that event once or twice.  Where is the evil regarding - moreover, what I did not mention took place. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thought you needed something.  We could stop there.

Well, we shall stop at this juncture, in view of the fact that tomorrow is not a public holiday.  We are tired now and we can no longer continue because the Judges have been sitting all day, and we can resume hearings tomorrow at 2:30 pm.  

Of course, the Prosecutor will have to abide by the timing he has proposed, that is no more than 50 minutes after which the Defence will proceed to re-examination, but we cannot go beyond this point.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the Defence thanks the Chamber for this precision.  But for the first time, excuse me, Madam President, I find this unfair.  I have done everything.  It is not normal, the Chamber told me:  "It is out of question, Counsel, we have to end on the 24th".   

Excuse me, Madam President, I am trying to be cautious, but I want to point out, Madam President, that at this point, with all the respect I have for the Chamber, we are penalised because the Chamber took a decision and said that whatever happens, we will end on the 24th, on Monday.  I proposed that I would reduce my examination to two hours but I was told, we have to end on Monday the 24th.  

And, Madam President, if we are saying that we cannot end this hearing today, I want to say, with all respect, that it is unfair and I am not mincing my words.  I have done my best to have us end on Wednesday but nobody accepted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We said that the public holiday could be on Monday or Tuesday, and that we will do everything to end today, and that is what we have done.  

You would recall, Counsel Kouengoua, that yesterday you continued examination-in-chief up to 
4:15 (sic) and we are not -- you are saying we have given more time to the Prosecutor, that is not the case.  We are going to sit tomorrow since it is not a public holiday, bearing in mind the information we have just received, because we had initially thought that it would be a public holiday, that is all.  

And if it is a public holiday, as you know, on Wednesday, we are beginning another trial, and that is why we thought we should do everything to end today.  Unfortunately, we have just realised that the Prosecutor has not ended his cross-examination and we are obliged to sit tomorrow.  This is not something we are very happy about, but we are obliged to do that.  

Very well.  We are adjourning now and we will resume tomorrow at 2:30, hoping that it wouldn't be a public holiday.  
(Court adjourned at 1806H)
