P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:	
The proceedings are called to order.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 

Mr. Ndengejeho, good afternoon.  We would like to remind you that you are still on your solemn declaration because you made a solemn declaration yesterday.  We gave you the documents you wanted, and today we would like to know whether you are ready to answer the questions that the parties and the Bench would put to you. 
THE WITNESS:
I've received a document which was given to me yesterday at about 4 p.m., and if you would allow me, I would like to read to you a short note I have prepared on this as a reply.  I also have the luck of having some copies, and I would also like to give you my answer written down, if you so permit. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You cannot reply to a decision that we have handed down.  If you -- all we want to know today is whether you are ready to testify or not.  That is the only question we have put to you, but you do not have to make comments on the decisions that we have made. 
THE WITNESS:
I am not making comments on your decision.  I know that very well, but the decision that I have taken has a basis, and I wanted to share with you that basis.  I am not calling into question your decision, because I do not have the right to do so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, let's agree.  You do not have the possibility today of telling us, "Well, this is what I think of your decision," and so on and so forth.  That is what I want to tell you, because if an appeal has to be made against that decision, certain persons can make that appeal, but as far as you are concerned, all that you can tell us today, and that is what I told you earlier on, is whether or not you are ready to give testimony before this Court after having read the decision that we have made. 
THE WITNESS:
This is precisely what is contained in the document I have prepared.  It is an answer to your question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well; answer, but I will stop you if you make comments on the decision.  That is what I'm telling you. 
THE WITNESS:
Can I give you the note I have prepared? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Presiding Judge nods in approval.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ndengejeho, we have taken due note of your note, and what we gather is that you are asking for more time to consult a few more persons before giving us your answer.  We regret to tell you that we cannot grant you more time.  We had already given you time so that today you should tell us whether or not you intend to testify.  Unfortunately, the Court's time is very precious, and we cannot allow ourselves to give you a further 24 hours.  At present, I will address Mr. Kouengoua to have his opinion.  

You, yourself, have seen the note prepared by Mr. Ndengejeho.  What do you have to say?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
On what?  On the note? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your witness is still asking for 24 hours, but we are saying we cannot give him the 24 hours; we are compelled to continue. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I was here yesterday.  The questions that the witness has addressed to the Bench, if he has put questions to the Bench, they are for the Bench.  I am waiting for something else from the Bench.  What he has answered, I do not know what to think of it.  That is what I told you yesterday.  It is to the Bench that he has put his question.  I have my request to put to the Bench concerning the Defence of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have taken due note of that.  We are in an adversarial system; it is your witness.  It is normal that we have your feelings.  

Now I will turn to the Prosecutor.  Prosecutor, do you have any comments to make concerning this note that has been given to you, or not?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour, I'm extremely embarrassed by the note because it's in a language I do not comprehend beyond mere pleasantries.  But I find this procedure extremely odd, to say the least.  The witness is here as a witness of the Defence.  Now, he's either ready to testify or not.  I'm most obliged. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Prosecutor.  

I wanted the parties to make -- express their views, and that is why I gave each of you the floor, so that -- so as to make sure that the adversarial system is respected.  

Mr. Ndengejeho, you have heard both parties speak.  Are you ready to testify as the Trial Chamber stated in its decision? 

THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, if I acted in precipitation, I will be rendering a misservice, both to the Trial Chamber and to the Accused.  Since we met yesterday, only 17 hours have elapsed, and I think this amount of time was not enough for me to make a statement in a context for which I did not prepare myself.  So, if you prefer that the few hours that are still remaining are not essential, then I decline the offer, and it is for you to make a ruling.  So, in any case, I do not want to act in precipitation.  I have to consult people, and I believe that is my right.  In short, I do not want to act in a hurry, in a rush, in precipitation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that you do not intend to testify before this Chamber.  We take due note of that.  We are going to ask the representative of the unit in charge of witness protection to tell us what happened regarding the time when you had to arrive here, because yesterday you put to us a question concerning your time of arrival.  

The representative of the witnesses' protection unit, can you tell us what happened at your level?  Thank you. 
MS. BECKY:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  On 6 November this year, my colleague of the witnesses' protection section centre by electronic message mentioned to Professor Ndengejeho to make sure of his availability for the purpose of him coming here to give testimony before the Court.  For this reason, my colleague expressed the wish that he, Professor Ndengejeho, should confirm his availability.  

On the 7th of November, the section once more, by telephone, contacted Professor Ndengejeho, who informed the section that he will not be present from the 12th to the 17th of November in his country of residence and that, consequently, he will not be in a position to undertake a trip to Arusha before 21 November, the reason being that from 18 November, his students had to defend their theses.  

We, in this regard, prepared a note or a memo.  On that same 7 November, Professor Ndengejeho contacted our section to tell us that he has reviewed his timetable and that he confirms that he will be absent from his country of residence from 10 to 12 November and that he could undertake a journey to Arusha on the 18th of November, that he was going to be absent from the 12th to the 17th from his country of residence. Our section immediately took the necessary steps in order to obtain the itinerary of his trip and to propose same to Professor Ndengejeho.  Thus, we proposed to him two routes.  Following the discussion that he had with my colleague, Professor Ndengejeho preferred to take the following itinerary or route.  So he had to leave his country of residence at 8:50 in the morning to be in Dar es Salaam at 7 p.m., and the following day to leave Dar es Salaam at 8:30 so as to be at Arusha airport at 9:45 a.m.

As soon as the decision of the Trial Chamber concerning Professor Ndengejeho was delivered on 11 November 2003, our section was served with a copy of that decision, and it is that decision that enabled us to relaunch the travel arrangements, to make the necessary arrangements so that Professor Ndengejeho received his travel ticket as soon as possible.  It is proper to note that we still had only three working days, namely, the 12th, the 13th and the 14th of November, and the 14th of November was a Friday. 

Consequently, the travel company, which is in Arusha but which has a parent company in Nairobi, immediately sent a ticket by DHL to the address that Professor Ndengejeho gave us, without nevertheless giving us a copy of that air ticket.  Therefore, the air ticket was sent by DHL on 17th November.  

On Monday, we called Professor Ndengejeho as soon as he had returned from his conference, to have confirmation from him that he had effectively received the air ticket, the air ticket which had been sent to him by DHL.  Initially, he informed my colleague of the fact that he had not received the DHL-sent ticket.  But I personally called his office, and the office informed me that the DHL parcel had been delivered.  My colleague contacted him once again, that he should contact his office so as to collect the DHL parcel which contained his air ticket.  He did that. 

Following that, he had to undertake his journey, start his journey, on 18 November, in the morning, at 8:50 as envisaged.  At about nine o'clock, 9:30 a.m., my colleague informed me that Professor Ndengejeho missed his plane and that, consequently, it was necessary to take other steps in order to make him take the next flight.  This is what we did at our level in Arusha, and this is what enabled Professor Ndengejeho to take the flight of eleven o'clock. 

Mr. Ndengejeho arrived in Dar es Salaam on that same day.  We were not able to contact him, first of all, to have confirmation that indeed he had taken the flight from his country of residence, and consequently to confirm that he was on the flight, headed for Arusha.  What we did was to contact once more the travel agency used by the Tribunal to make sure of the hour when he was going to arrive.  The hour we were given was 9:45 a.m., that he was going to arrive in Arusha at 9:45 a.m.  

We sent our colleagues to the Arusha airport so as to pick up Professor Ndengejeho.  To our great surprise, he was not on the flight, and this is what led us to inform the Defence team that Professor Ndengejeho was not on the flight, therefore, that he had not arrived at 9:45 a.m.

Consequently, we contacted the travel agency once more, which told us that he was certainly going to be on the second flight and that, under the circumstances, they could not give us all the details because it was necessary for people to start boarding the plane for them to have the final version of the passenger list.  

Thus, yesterday, at about 1:30 -- or, rather, 12:30 in the afternoon, we had the information that Professor Ndengejeho's name was on the passenger list.  And if I'm not mistaken, at 25 past 1:00, my colleagues received him at the airport.  He informed us that he did not have his baggage with him, that he was not able to collect his baggage from the flight coming from Johannesburg.  So, this is what we have to say concerning the travel of Mr. Ndengejeho.  

This morning, my colleagues returned to the airport to make sure that they collected Professor Ndengejeho's baggage, and they did so.  The baggage was given to us.  He mentioned that his bag had been damaged and that, consequently, it would be necessary for the Tribunal to replace that damaged bag.  But we took alternative measures because we do not have any budgetary provision to replace damaged bags.  What we did was, we asked our colleague to go to the company, to inform the airline that it was their responsibility to replace the travel bag which had been damaged.  The processes on the airline would make sure that they replaced the damaged bag of Professor Ndengejeho.  

Between these two acts, yesterday in the afternoon, after Professor Ndengejeho received -- was received within the premises of the Tribunal for the purpose of his giving testimony, in the evening our section, or, at least, a representative of our section, went to the hotel where Professor Ndengejeho is lodged.  This was at my request.  The purpose of this was to serve -- or, rather, give a copy of the report.  The reason for this is simple.  The reason is that Professor Ndengejeho yesterday was not in possession of his baggage.  The section therefore was of the view that it was necessary for him to be able to take cognizance of his report.  

This report which we gave to Professor Ndengejeho, we obtained it from the coordinator of Trial Chamber III.  It is a report which is in English -- which is in English.  Before giving the report, I made sure that I contacted Mr. Kouengoua to inform him of our intention, the intention of our section, to go and serve that report on Professor Ndengejeho.  But Mr. Kouengoua did not object to what we intended to do.  

My colleague therefore went to the hotel where Professor Ndengejeho was lodged, to serve on him the report.  Professor Ndengejeho took the report, just opened the envelope, and felt that the report was not his report and that, consequently, he would not take it -- he would not accept the report. 
Moreover, he asked my colleague to kindly sign a note to the effect that the report in question was not the proper report and that he, Professor Ndengejeho, refused to take the report.  My colleague did that, but in that note my colleague added that our section was only facilitating the Tribunal's work; it was not our responsibility to decide whether or not it is compulsory for him to take cognizance of the report served on him.  

While my colleague was still with Professor Ndengejeho, I suppose at about 9 p.m. yesterday, I chatted with Professor Ndengejeho, and during that conversation, Professor Ndengejeho made me understand that it was not his wish to take possession of that report, and I told him that we're simply facilitating the work of the Tribunal and that, consequently, we take proper note of his refusal, we take due note of his refusal to collect the report and that henceforth I would give instructions to my colleague to return to her home. 

Madam President, Your Honours, I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, madam, for all those explanations.  

Do you have something to say, Professor Ndengejeho? 
THE WITNESS:
Of course, Madam President, I have something to say.  First of all, I believe Sylvie is making a confusion about certain hours and facts.  I have here, Madam President, Your Honours -- with your leave, you can look at the reservation that was made on the 12th of November.  What Sylvie is saying, it is they who did it, it is her service who did this reservation.  I even have the original of the reservation, and the ticket is here.  You can refer to it.  I have never heard anyone talk about nine o'clock.  The document is here if you want to have a look at it.  It shows you the reservations made by the Tribunal, and that reservation stipulates that on the 19th I had to leave Dar es Salaam at 12:30 in the afternoon and to arrive here at 25 minutes past 1:00.  I am not the one who wrote the document. 

Now, there is some slight confusion regarding the hours and the dates.  It happens that on the 17th I arrived at Windhoek, and before leaving I had requested that documents be transferred to my office because -- that they should be transferred to my office by DHL.  

I arrived at Windhoek at about eleven o'clock in my office and realised that there was no document concerning the air ticket, nor the visa.  Therefore, it is for this reason that I phoned the Tribunal, telling them that I do not have any document.  After that, I went to rest.  It had been five days that I had been facing a difficult task which consisted of attending a conference in South Africa.  I went to rest, and at about three o'clock, I was awoken by a telephone call, a telephone call from -- a telephone call from Mrs. Becky's colleague, telling me that documents had been sent to my office in the afternoon.  Indeed, I went to my office and realised that the secretary had received the documents, but nevertheless there was no visa, and I was told that documents relating to the visa were sent by scanned message but a scanned message up to the 18th.  

At 9:30, when I was leaving the office, I did not receive the message.  I asked the colleague of 
Mrs. Becky to send the message to me by fax.  The fax arrived after 4:30.  I have it, I can prove that.  

Now, the following day, I brought the fax to the airport.  I was told that there was doubt as to the authenticity of the fax.  They helped me for some time, so much so that I missed my flight, but I decided to take the next flight so that from South Africa I would not have any other changes to make. 

So, Madam President, with regard to this document, I believe this document is proof, and this was sent by Tribunal, and it is indicated 1:25 on that document.  I would like to point out, Madam President, Your Honours, with regard to such sabotage -- because I didn't know that they had tried to look for me.  It's one of her colleagues who went to the airport and found out that my bag had been cut in the middle, and it is that colleague who observed this, and he -- and she asked that the company should pay for the bag.  

I am very, very surprised to hear that I asked the Tribunal to reimburse the cost of the bag.  I believe the person who went to the airport is here and can confirm that I did not ask the Tribunal to reimburse money.  All I asked was that the person should go to the travel agency and find out whether they could give me another appropriate bag, because I couldn't use that to travel with.  As regards the value, I said it wasn't important, and I said I was even ready to pay 25 or 30 dollars in losses because I had to travel soon.  That is what I wanted to say. 

The last thing is that somebody came to the hotel at 10:30 p.m., somebody I didn't know, and this person gave me a document of about -- of less than a hundred pages, and the person said it was a translation of my report.  And I said, "How can a document that was 220 pages long be reduced to less than a hundred pages?  Was it a miracle?"  And that is why I told this man, "It can't be my document."  The pages I read show that it wasn't my document.  So I said, "In any case, give me the document; I'll read through it.  If I find that it is authentic, I will sign tomorrow.  But if I find it is another trap that has been set for me, I will return the document to you."  And that is what happened yesterday, at 10:30.  

You can understand that somebody who had just arrived, who was tired, could not have the presence of mind to read through the hundred or so pages, and that is what happened. 
But, with your permission, Madam President, I would like to hand over this document to you so that you can go through it.  It is an original, and you'll find that it is -- what I'm saying is true.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, you can give the document, Mr. Ndengejeho.  You realise that we asked you to go and read the document early enough, to rest and read the document.  At the moment, I believe this matter is closed.  You can hand over the document you are showing to us to the registry, and we shall look at it and see what we can make of it. 

Counsel Kouengoua, do you have anything to add regarding what your witness has said?  I believe your witness has been clear enough, and the Chamber as well.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I am very surprised and in a fix, and I would like the Chamber to place things in context.  

Madam President, I am aware of the decisions of the 11th of November and the 17th of November.  The only thing I would like to know has to do with the dialogue between the witness and Madam President.  I would like to know whether it is the expert witness who is refusing to testify or the factual witness.  This is the point I would like the Chamber to clarify, Madam President, because I do not quite understand what the situation is.  Please, could you kindly clarify that matter? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think it is up to Mr. Ndengejeho to give you such clarifications, and he has just told us that he is not in a position to answer those questions. 

Mr. Ndengejeho, are you ready to answer that question? 
THE WITNESS:
Personally, I believe what I said is clear.  I came here as an expert witness.  I heard yesterday, at about 4:30, that I was no longer recognised as an expert witness, and I was informed that I would eventually testify as a factual witness.  And bearing in mind a note that was given to me, I requested time to consult certain people who are involved in this case and who would be in a position to allow me to testify as a factual witness. 

With all the time that was given to me and which were after office hours, I was not in a position to consult everyone.  I would have loved to consult at least one person before testifying -- at least nine people before testifying.  I only managed to consult four people.  Two of these people are dead.  I would have loved to have a few more hours, even if that were to bring us to 9 a.m. tomorrow morning, and that would give me time to decide whether to testify or not.  The decision not to testify -- the decision that I'm not ready to testify is not mine.  I came here to testify.  I would like you to note that the person who was supposed to come and testify effectively appeared before you and -- as I did before I testified, and I'm not the one who has refused to testify; it is Madam President who is stating that I am not ready to testify.  That decision is not mine.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would rectify what you said: That is not what the Chamber said.  We said we are not ready to hear your testimony as an expert witness but as a factual witness.  We have given you sufficient time.  We even gave you more time than you had asked for to consider your decision whether or not to testify.  And now you are requesting more time, and we suppose, therefore, that you are not willing to testify before this Chamber, and we take note of this, Mr. Ndengejeho.  We thank you. 

We thank you, Mr. Ndengejeho.  You may now withdraw. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you. 
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, where do we go from here?  What would you propose now?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  In view of what has just happened, unfortunately, Madam President, I am obliged to file a few oral motions to this august Chamber as part of the continuation of the trial. Madam President, Your Honours, I had filed for the Chamber's consideration, after disclosure to the Prosecutor, the list of evidential documents and the list of my witnesses and expert witnesses.  

Amongst those expert witnesses, Madam President, there were two forensic experts and an expert witness.  The expert witness was Pascal Ndengejeho.  Madam President, when I disclosed this list following the commencement of Gacumbitsi's trial on the 28th of July, my Defence strategy was built around that arrangement.  

Today, Madam President, following your decision, and in view of what Mr. Ndengejeho has just told the Chamber and the conclusions that have been drawn by the Chamber, I note simply, and I would request the Chamber to note as well, that Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre's Defence does not have any expert witnesses, whereas it had proposed an expert witness. 

Madam President, the Prosecutor, during the tendering of his Prosecution evidence from the 26th of July -- 28th of July to the 26th of August, and the Defence, in its Defence strategy, had envisaged challenging the evidence presented by the Prosecutor and we had intended to use these experts. 

Today, Madam President, the Defence finds itself in an unbalanced situation.  That is why I would request the Chamber, pursuant to Rules 20, paragraphs (1), (2) and (4) of the Statute -- that is Article 20 of the Statute and Rules 73(A) and 73 ter of the Rules and regulations of the Chamber, that the Defence of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi should be authorised to call another expert witness in order to -- for purposes of equality of arms.  I believe, Madam President, that in so doing you would have rendered fair and balanced justice and the rights of the Defence would have been safeguarded.  Because as I stated in one of my preceding motions, the Judge holds the balance between the two parties.  Indeed, you are the balance between the two parties, and when there is an imbalance, you have to rectify it to uphold justice. 

Expert witness Alison Des Forges testified on the 26th and the 28th of August 2003 before your Chamber.  Who is the Defence's expert witness, Madam President?  He is not there, and this is a clear handicap, and I believe this is clear to the Chamber as well.  And that is why I would request, pursuant to the legal provisions I've just stated, that is, the Articles of the Statute and Rules 73(A) and 73 ter of the Rules, to allow the Defence to call an expert witness for equality of arms.  In so doing, Madam President, I believe it would be fair justice.  

This is the motion I wanted to file before you now.  I thank you for your attention. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 (No interpretation)
MR. KAREGYESA:
(Microphone not activated)
JUDGE REDDY:
I'm sorry, learned Prosecutor, we didn't hear what you said.  I'm sorry.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, all I said was that we oppose the application and leave the matter entirely at your discretion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber finds that the balance that the Defence has just spoken of, the balance between the parties, is not mathematical, because you had two forensic experts and the Prosecutor had one, and if we go by the number of witnesses, you called 20; the Prosecutor called less.  We consider that it is the duty of the parties to choose their experts.  You chose your expert, and this choice -- and it is unfortunately your expert witness who refused to testify.  

Even though we did not recognise him as an expert witness, we believe that -- by taking note of -- taking notice of your witness's refusal to testify before this Chamber, we had not in any way disrupted the balance between both parties, and for this reason, we deny your motion, Counsel Kouengoua.  

We would now like to know whether the Accused will testify before this Chamber or not, since certain measures have to be taken in this regard as well.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
As a witness, Madam President?  Of course the Accused will appear as a witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is not a matter of necessity.  It is whether or not you want him to appear.  It is his right.  But in some cases, accused persons do not testify as witnesses, and that is why I ask you the question whether the Accused wants to testify as a witness, and we will take the necessary measures in that regard.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The necessity is ours.  It is with regard to the Defence.  The Accused will testify as a witness, 
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, then, we -- can we hear him now?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Your Honour, it is not feasible at present.  I would very much wish -- unless you -- unless somebody has a better opinion than mine, I would suggest that he should be heard on Monday.  The Chamber expressed the wish that we should complete his testimony by the 26th, and I believe we'll have enough time, and it is my wish that he should be heard on Monday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to know for how long you intend to examine him in-chief.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, it would be better for me to consult with my co-counsel.

Madam President, I would request to consult the Accused for a short while, with your permission.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may do so.  We are waiting for you.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Lordships, for your patience.  I think that the examination-in-chief might take three hours, maximum; three hours maximum.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you say three hours?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, three hours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we will do as follows.  We will sit tomorrow, because after the examination-in-chief, there will be cross-examination, and it is quite possible that the Judges might have questions to put to the defendant, and we only have Monday afternoon, because we're not sure that we can sit on Tuesday, which might be a public holiday.  We were told that Tuesday or Wednesday will be a public holiday, because there is an Islamic holiday which is observed at the United Nations.  So that is an additional difficulty.  So we are ready, for our part, to sit tomorrow, so we can sit tomorrow and Monday afternoon.  In that way, we'll be sure to get through what we have to do in time.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I thought that the Trial Chamber told me that we had to finish on the 26th.  I thought that's what I had heard.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that is what we told you, but at present I am telling you that the 25th might be a public holiday -- the 26th might be a public holiday, and then how do you expect us to go about things?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No, that is not possible, Madam President.  If the 25th is a public holiday, we finish on the 26th.  If the 26th is a public holiday, we will finish on the 25th. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Let me look at the calendar.

We don't have a calendar here.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
 Monday is the 24th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, that's what I'm telling you.  Tuesday is the 25th, which is the lunar feast.  So either the 25th or the 26th, depending on the phase of the moon, the observation of the moon.  So we were told initially that the 27th would be the public holiday, but Ramadan started earlier this year, so the end of Ramadan could be the 25th or the 26th, so we have to finish on the 24th.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No.  Please, Madam, if Tuesday is a public holiday, that means that the examination-in-chief would take place on the Monday, and then the cross-examination could be held on Wednesday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But I told you the 26th, Wednesday, is not possible because we're starting another trial.  You're not following.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, under such conditions, if Tuesday you are not available, which might be the case for Muslims, but then let's at least sit on Monday from 1430 to 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. so Tuesday everybody can rest.  And that wouldn't be an exception, because in other Trial Chambers they also work late in the evening.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We're very sorry, but in any case you've had quite enough time to prepare the defendant.  We might even have told you we want to hear him immediately.  We're leaving you until tomorrow.  We, ourselves, are giving up a day, but everybody has to put their oar in because we have to finish on the Tuesday at the latest.  I'm very sorry, Tuesday is the time by which we must finish.  I'm sorry, but we've lost too much time.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam, with all due respect, I have in no way benefited from this time available because of all that has been going on.  If really we had finished on the 31st of October, as we planned, I would not be asking for a single minute or a single hour.  Please -- and my programme provided for two expert witnesses on Monday, the 17th.  That was the programme I had submitted, and that was the way the programme was established.  

Please, madam, in the documents that we have in writing and that were given to us by the Trial Chamber, the trial was to end on the 30th of November.  When you get information like that, you organise yourself accordingly.  Now I find myself faced with a decision because I'm asking for tomorrow because I can't go to UNDF on Sunday or Saturday, and then Monday we can finish.  I think I'm conscious of the situation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm very sorry, but if you're going to take three hours for examination-in-chief, the Prosecution has the right to cross-examine also and the Judges have their questions to put.  Why do you keep us here until nine o'clock at night on Monday if we can work tomorrow?  It is much more logical than what you're telling us.  I'm very sorry.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, what I think I would rather do to satisfy the requirements of the Trial Chamber is to shorten the examination of my client.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can shorten, yes.  If you tell us that one hour is enough, then perhaps we could try to do everything on Monday.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I think it might be better.  Fine.  For us, for the Defence, it is desirable that we start on Monday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you need -- you'll take one hour to examine the defendant?  Because this must be a commitment.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Well, madam, if the Accused appears as a Defence witness and we only take one hour, who would have the rest of the time?  It is up to me to have the most of the time.

Your Honours are, of course, free to seek any clarification, but for once, the Defence should be favoured.  If I take only one hour out of three, the Prosecution might take up the two and a half remaining hours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But this is bargaining. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No, it's not bargaining.  I could do it in perhaps two and a half, but I would like it to be on Monday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, I'm sorry, you cannot ask that of us.  I told you, we are available to sit tomorrow, to leave you enough time.  Now, if you want to reduce the duration of the examination -- reduce the duration of the examination-in-chief of your witness, you can reduce it, but not to two and a half hours.  That doesn't solve the problem.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, I think we can start tomorrow as suggested, but then I am not limited to three hours for the examination-in-chief of my client.  I prefer that we rectify that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall see tomorrow how long the examination-in-chief can last.  We start tomorrow at nine o'clock.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
You mean tomorrow morning?  Tomorrow morning, Madam President?  No, no, not tomorrow morning, not at all.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, but I didn't -- I wasn't aware that my colleagues were sitting tomorrow morning, but they are.  So we shall begin tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.  I thought we would have much more time, the whole of tomorrow, but it will be tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.

Learned Prosecutor, any objections?
MR. KAREGYESA:
No, no observations, Your Honours.  We shall abide by the decision of this Chamber.  Much obliged.
JUDGE REDDY:
It gives you more time to prepare, Mr. Kouengoua, 2:30 instead of 9:15 or nine o'clock. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will now adjourn until tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.
	(Court adjourned at 1545H)
