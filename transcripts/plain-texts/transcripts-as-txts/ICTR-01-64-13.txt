MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Chamber is now in session.  Good morning everyone, good morning, Witness.  We wish to remind you that you are still under oath, and Counsel Kouengoua for the Defence, will pursue 
cross-examination.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours; good morning, the Prosecution; the registry, the interpreters and the court stenographers, good morning.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness TBH, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Witness TBH, yesterday --
MR. KOUNGOUA:
Madam President, excuse me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We continue the cross-examination in closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 17] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)



















1036H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.

I turn to the Prosecution.  You had asked us yesterday for -- you had requested leave to withdraw from the list, the last Prosecution witness, TBJ.  Are you sticking to that request?  Could you just tell us the reason why, so that we can rapidly take a decision and perhaps go on to hearing the expert witness Alison Des Forges?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Your Honours; good morning.  Prosecutor reiterates her request for leave to withdraw Witness TBG from the list of witnesses.  The Prosecutor, having met with the witness, decides -- or has taken decision that it is unnecessary to lead the evidence of this witness for the Prosecutor.  As indicated by my learned colleague, Ms. Mobberley, yesterday afternoon, as we normally do, we offer the said witness to the Defence if they so wish.  I am most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution, for having reminded us of what was stated yesterday.  The Defence had stated they had no comment in respect of the withdrawal of this witness.  That's what you said yesterday, no?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The Defence had stated yesterday that in the present state of affairs they had no objection to the withdrawal of TBJ.  Equally, yesterday Counsel for the Prosecution -- I want to use the conditional tense because, in fact, with the permission of the Bench, I had stepped out, but when I returned the Bench reminded me that the expert witness was due normally to appear today and the Counsel for the Prosecution had declared his intention not to examine.  Now, I don't know whether counsel for the Prosecution has revised or reviewed its position.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If I correctly understood Counsel for the Prosecution, he didn't mention the last matter.  For the time being, we are discussing Witness TBJ and I was saying that you had no objections.  Is that indeed correct?  We first wish to settle the question -- the issue of Witness TBJ and then we will come to the matter of expert witness, Alison Des Forges.

Very well.  The Trial Chamber allows Counsel for the Prosecution to withdraw Witness TBJ from the list.  And now we give the floor to Counsel for the Prosecution regarding expert witness, Alison Des Forges.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.  We are ready to call Alison Des Forges into the Chamber; however, there are just two housekeeping matters I just wish to draw your attention to.  We are not asking for an immediate decision, but we just want to draw your attention to scheduling matters, as it were.

Your Honours, the timetable issued by the registry concerning this and other cases before the various Chambers puts the Defence case for Gacumbitsi for the 6th of October 2003, and for purposes of planning to ensure the smooth conduct of the Defence case, Your Honours, there are two issues that merit your urgent attention.  The first, Your Honours, is the outstanding witness protection motion which will, amongst other things, set the disclosure time lines for the particulars of Defence witnesses.  So that is issue No. 1.  We are just drawing it to your attention.

The second, Your Honours, is the pre-Defence conference in terms of Rule 73ter.  It's important that these two matters be disposed of in fairly short order because of the limited time between now and 6th of October; it's a space of only five weeks.  And we are aware that Your Lordships are -- will be busy and engaged before other Chambers in different trials.  We would, therefore, request that as soon as we close the case for the Prosecution this week, Your Honours, you issue a scheduling order setting, one, a date for a motion for acquittal, if any, under Rule 98 and, contingent upon any decision arising therefrom, a date for the pre-Defence conference.

You will note, Your Honours, that Rule 73ter, pre-Defence conference, involves a number of things with which counsel has to avail the Prosecutor, of course with the direction of the Chamber.  And given the limited time between the close of the Prosecution case and the opening of the Defence case on the 6th of October, the earlier these matters are sorted out, the better.

Now, as I intimated when I started this morning, we don't -- we are not asking for a decision now.  We are ready to call for Alison Des Forges to be ushered into the Chamber.  These are matters you can deliberate upon between and amongst yourselves once we have taken the adjournment.  I am most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  I must say that, as regards the Defence motion for witness protection, we have rendered a decision.  I signed it yesterday.  As regards the other matters, indeed, we know that time presses, but we should like to hear the Defence position on the date proposed on the calendar, which is the 6th of October, in order to give the answer required to all those issues which concern us too -- which preoccupy us.
MR. KAREGYESA:
This is a matter that we can do once we have closed the Prosecution case after Madam Des Forges testifies.  I just wished, this morning, to raise the issues, but I'm not asking for any decision now.  We can exchange views with counsel for the Defence and with Your Honours after we close the prosecution case.  Most obliged.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's the way I understood it also. 

Judge Reddy, please, sir.
JUDGE REDDY:
I am just wondering if, please, you can assist me.  Is there any intention to file an application under Rule 98 or is that academic?  Tell me so for the Defence.  Are you intending to invoke Rule 98 or can we go straight to the pre-Defence conference and deal with --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I am much obliged, Your Lordship.  I have taken the floor -- I was going to take the floor to thank the counsel for the Prosecution for anticipating, but this question also adds -- the Defence felt it would not be proper to disturb the Trial Chamber and we should finish with hearing the Prosecution witnesses before raising -- requesting certain issues by the counsel for the Prosecution.

In addition, Madam President, Your Lordships, since I have the opportunity, it would be good if the Trial Chamber could organise a conference, even an informal one, Thursday or Friday so as to settle a number of problems raised by Counsel for the Prosecution and take the opportunity, equally, to answer Your Lordship's question.
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you.  We shall tell you if we can hold the pre-Defence conference on Thursday or Friday.

Counsel for the Prosecution, you have something to add?
MR. KAREGYESA:
It relates to the witness, Your Honours, before she is led into the Chamber.  First, Your Honours, Alison Des Forges appears before Your Honours under the terms of your decision dated 1st August 2003, in which you admitted onto the record the transcript of her testimony in the Akeyesu case, Case No. ICTR-96-4-T, so we need not belabour anything other than complying with your order and offering her for cross-examination by the Defence.  We just wish to note, Your Honours, that her evidence goes to proof of the context in which the crimes alleged were committed in Rwanda in 1994 and, as such, does not specifically address the culpable acts with which the Accused is charged in this trial.

The second point is: since Your Honours have already admitted the transcript and the exhibits onto the record, it may be appropriate that the transcript filed with the registry be marked and given a Prosecution exhibit number, and then the witness can be led into the Chamber, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
Is the transcript in a hard copy or is it -- 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, it's an electronic copy, and it's only the charts and maps that are in hard copy.  Now, it is the CD-ROM that he filed with our application on the 24th of June this year which is in the possession of the registry that we wish to be marked.  That is a certified copy of the trial record, Your Honours, in Akeyesu.  That's all we have to say in that regard, Your Honours.

We have -- Your Honours, for the purpose of this hearing, we have the transcript on our computer, and if questions arise out of anything purported to have been said, if counsel refers to a page, we shall display it on the screen so that everybody in the Chamber is on the same footing.
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, that was what was bothering me; how do we follow.
MR. KAREGYESA:
So maybe if we advise counsel that if he makes any reference to the prior testimony of Alison Des Forges, he should refer to the date, page number and line, and then we will assist the Chamber by displaying on the screen the referred portion.  Most obliged, Your Honours.  And with that, Professor Des Forges is waiting in the witness room.  If the courtroom officers usher her in to take her oath.  Most obliged.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  Do you have comments on what has just been said?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, indeed, Madam President.  Already with the first point, counsel for the Prosecutor did not confirm what they said yesterday; namely, that they would not be speaking today with regard to Alison Des Forges.  I don't think the Prosecutor addressed this concern.  Yesterday they said that the ball was essentially in the court of the Defence.  We of the Defence -- or, rather, that they of the Prosecution would not ask Alison Des Forges further questions.  That is the first point.

The second point, Madam President, Your Honours, is that what the Prosecution has just clarified seems to be quite delicate -- or sensitive.  The documents of the CD-ROM in the Akayesu trials have been admitted and, according to the Prosecution, it is only on most of what will take place here will be based.  Mr. President (sic), I don't know why this restriction.  If the Prosecutor wanted to talk of any particular things, he could circumscribe them.  We are talking of a cross-examination.  So on the basis of what I have read, it may -- we may go on to other questions.  I cannot be limited to Akayesu's transcripts, whereas, we are in the Gacumbitsi trial.  Unless I did not understand the Prosecutor, my understanding is that the Prosecutor would like the Defence -- be limited, so to speak, to the transcripts in the Akayesu trial.
MR. KAREGYESA:
With your leave, I will just reply to that, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Kouengoua.  I did not understand that the Prosecutor could say in a clearer manner what he understands by what he told us earlier on.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, it is clear that counsel did not properly comprehend what I said.  We stand by the fact that we are not going to lead the evidence of Alison Des Forges in-chief; we are offering her for cross-examination by the Defence. That is No. 1.  No. 2, nowhere did we suggest that we are restricting counsel to the evidence of Alison Des Forges based on her transcript in Akayesu.  She's well published.  She has testified in other trials; but we are saying is that with regard to the evidence you have admitted onto record, if counsel makes any reference, we shall oblige and display it on the screens.  He is free to cite, you know, prior testimony from the Media trial, from the Military trial, from any other trial or from her books, but the onus will be upon him, if he wants to use her publications or her prior testimony in other cases, to produce that particular document on which he seeks to rely.  And I note, Your Honours, that it's coming to the mid-morning break, so we may wish to take the break now, or call her in, have her take the oath and then take the adjournment.  Most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the Prosecutor.  I think the matter is quite clear now for the Defence.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I heard the Prosecutor at the beginning referring to the case of the judgement.  This is what the French interpreter translated.  The Prosecutor asked for -- made reference to the judgement in the Akeyesu -- made reference to the Akayesu judgement.  I do not know what is meant by that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
These documents, having been accepted, I think the Prosecutor asked us to assign a number to the documents that have been admitted.  And that is why I wonder whether there was not a misinterpretation.  The documents that were disclosed and accepted by your ruling are transcripts.  They are transcripts; in other words, all that was said at the hearings of the 11th, 12th, 14th, 23 May, and so on, 1997, but not the judgement.  But in the French translation which I heard, the Prosecutor was requesting that the Akayesu judgement be assigned a number, and that is what I did not understand.

MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I never referred to a judgement.  It is the CD-ROM which was filed with our application, which application has been granted by this Chamber.  Nowhere did I refer to "judgement".

JUDGE REDDY:
You made a very generous concession that the Defence is at liberty to cross-examine this expert witness on any subject they like, but I think that concession has to be subject to Rule 90; is it not?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour, it is not any subject they like.  But Alison Des Forges has testified in other trials before this Chamber on similar matters.  She is also widely published on matters relevant to these proceedings.  Now, what I'm saying is that we have not relied on that, but in the event that the Defence strays into that area, it will be upon them to put to her any documents on which they rely.
JUDGE REDDY:
We will see how we go.
MR. KAREGYESA:
And, of course, within the terms of Rule 90, Your Honours, the Chamber is obliged to control the manner of the cross-examination and extent.  I am most obliged, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you for all the clarifications.  We are now going to take a break.  And we will resume in 15 minutes.  When we resume the expert witness, Alison Des Forges, will be called in.  I thank you. 

The proceedings are adjourned.
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1120H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Good morning, Ms. Alison Des Forges.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, you have the floor.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President, for identifying the witness.  If she could take the oath.
(Declaration made by Witness Alison Des Forges in English)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Ms. Des Forges.

Prosecutor?
ALISON DES FORGES,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Could you please give the Chamber your full names?
A.	I am Alison Des Forges.
Q.	And it's correct, Witness, that you testified in the trial of the Prosecutor against Jean Paul Akeyesu as an expert witness in the months of February and May 1997; isn't it, Witness?
A.	That is correct.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the witness has identified herself, and the Prosecutor offers her to the Defence for cross-examination under the terms of the 92bis(D) order of this Chamber dated the 1st of August 2003.  I am most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Prosecutor.

Mr. Kouengoua, are you the one who will cross-examine this witness?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Your Honour, Madam President.  I thank you, Your Honours.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Good morning, Dr. Alison Des Forges.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I have no doubt that you are used to this court.  The information I gleaned here and there -- from the Prosecutor, from the Bench, from my colleagues -- shows that you are one of the most representative persons of the ICTR.  As for my part, this is the first time -- if I am mistaken, you correct me -- I think this is the first time that you are coming here and you are handed over to somebody with whom you have not had any prior discussion.  Is that correct, Dr. Des Forges?
A.	It is the first time that I have given testimony under Rule 92bis -- that is, without a direct examination -- but it is not the first time that I have been engaged in interrogation by someone whom I do not know.
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  Dr. Des Forges, have you often given testimony in a case before this court regarding a matter in which you had not made any prior contacts?
A.	I don't exactly understand the meaning of the question.  I have testified previously, but always on the basis of my own research, as I do in this trial as well.
Q.	I was not yet talking about research.  My question was very simple so that you should correct me.  It the first time that you are testifying in a case without having filed a prior report in the case before -- or the case at Bar?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You would understand that, since I have been trying to ask you questions, since there is no written document from you concerning the case of my client, I'm trying to see from what end I should tackle the conversation with you, and like what many of my colleagues -- or, in conformity with what my colleagues told me, can you start the conversation on my behalf, even if I have to ask for clarifications from you?  Can you initiate the discussions, even if I have to ask for clarifications?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Your Honours, that is an inappropriate way of proceeding in cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  Counsel, you accepted to cross-examine the witness.  You have documents that have been tendered; namely, the witness's testimony in the Akayesu trial.  The witness, indeed, has written a lot on the events, the events of Rwanda in 1994, in particular.  I therefore think that you have a basis on which you can put questions to the witness.  It is difficult for the witness to start giving a testimony without knowing exactly what is expected of her.  She has so much to say on genocide.  Therefore, perhaps you have to guide the witness by putting questions to her.  What do you think, Ms. Des Forges?
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, it is correct that I came prepared to answer questions rather than to pose them.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	I thank you, Dr. Des Forges, but the guide given by the presiding judge is correct; namely, that you have written, you have published, you have given conferences, you have done a lot of things from an intellectual standpoint.  Now, I have only a few questions -- to ask you questions.  Do you think that if I started with 1994, we will -- perhaps we will not finish before December 2003, and this is why -- knowing why you are here today, I thought because my other colleagues had questioned you on the report that you had prepared in relation to their cases -- in my own case, I do not know whether this is deliberate or inadvertent, there is no report, and that is why I asked that, knowing why you came here, can you tell me what is in the -- what is relevant to the case of my client?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I have two matters to raise; the first; I'm invoking the provisions of Rule 90(F), and I quote:  "The Trial Chamber shall exercise control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to, (i) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth; and (ii) Avoid needless consumption of time."
If you could kindly rein in counsel, Your Honours.

The second point, Your Honours, is that prior to the adjournment I had asked that the transcript be marked with an exhibit number.  If that could be done before counsel proceeds with his cross-examination.  I'm most obliged, Your Honours.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I would like to draw the kind attention of the Trial Chamber to the fact that we are in the presence of an expert witness.  We are not in the presence of a witness of fact -- or a factual witness.  The expert witness appearing before the Court today is of international repute.  The witness has all that is necessary to assume responsibility for what she is saying and what she will say.  If at any moment she thought that the questions put to her by the Defence were irrelevant, she would have told you whether she intended to or not -- he has not even had the opportunity to respond, and I think by interrupting the Defence counsel and also the expert witness, the Prosecutor is unnecessarily wasting the Court's time.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Expert Witness, Dr. Alison Des Forges, I put the question to you: why have you come here?  That is the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to begin by giving the transcript -- we would like to give an exhibit number to the Akayesu transcript.  Registry, could you please assist us as to which is the number that should be given to the CD-ROM?  What number, please?
MR. JUMA:
Your Honours, the next Prosecution exhibit number is P15.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So this CD-ROM shall be tendered and marked as Exhibit P15. 
(Exhibit No. P15 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to ask Mrs. Des Forges if she wishes to respond to the question that has been put to her by Defence counsel.
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I came in the interests of justice, to put at the disposition of the Tribunal whatever knowledge I have that is relevant in this particular case concerning Mr. Gacumbitsi and the Rwandan genocide.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We would like to thank you, Ms. Des Forges.

Counsel, you have received the answer to your question.  We would like to remind you if that you wish to put questions to the witness, you may do so, but you don't have to.  So, if you have questions to put to the expert witness, the expert witness is at your disposal to answer your questions.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Expert Witness, were you told why you have come to testify here today?
A.	I understood that my testimony from the Akayesu trial would be submitted to the Court and that I would be asked to respond to questions from the Defence relevant to that testimony.
Q.	Dr. Alison, the person who gave you this information, was this the same -- did this person tell you that you should not write a report, or is there any other particular reason as to why you did not write a report?
A.	In the past when I have been asked to testify as an expert witness the Prosecution has requested me to prepare a report for submission in advance of my testimony.  In this case, since I was not to be presenting direct testimony but, rather, relying upon testimony already presented to the Court, I was not asked to prepare a report.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, were you given any data or any information with respect to the case for which you have come to testify today?
A.	I was given the name of the Accused and a copy of the indictment and the pretrial brief.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, in the previous trials you wrote a report.  Did you ever think that by not writing a report for this present case this might cause a prejudice to the rights of the Defence?
A.	I would have assumed that such a question would have been considered and decided by the Judges of the Court and at the time they adopted Rule 92bis they had decided that such a procedure would not, in fact, impinge upon the rights of the Accused.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, you have just informed us that you were given a copy of the indictment of the person who was being judged today.  Did you look at the date when this indictment was drafted?
A.	I did not pay particular attention to the date, no.
Q.	Do you have it with you, Dr. Des Forges?
A.	I read the document.
Q.	I wanted to know whether you have your copy of the indictment here with you in the courtroom.
A.	No.
Q.	Dr. Alison, if you please, I would like to -- I have a copy of the indictment that bears the date of June 2001.  Do you believe my assertion?
A.	I have no reason not to believe you.
Q.	In that case, Dr. Des Forges, I would like to ask the registry to go from just a belief to move towards the realm of accuracy.  Was the date accurate, Dr. Des Forges?
A.	It is.
Q.	I was informed that you testified in the Akayesu trial for the first on the 11th of February 1997; is that correct?
A.	It is.
Q.	I'm sorry, Dr. Des Forges, you are not appearing here as a lawyer or as a jurist, but you are here as an expert witness, but your great experience before this Tribunal leads me to put the following question to you.  You are testifying for the first time on the 11th of February 1997 and you have an indictment that you received from the Prosecutor that is dated 2001 and, more specifically, June 2001.  Do you believe, Dr. Des Forges, that the things that happened in 1997 are current events now in 2001?  Are they still appropriate to 2001?
A.	To prepare for this testimony I re-read the transcript of my 1997 testimony.  I must say that I find it completely relevant even to today so that I see no difficulty in applying it to a case where the indictment dates to 2001.  History changes as we learn more, but it doesn't change that fast.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I'm not sure I understood of what doesn't change.  Is it history, or are the facts the ones that don't change?
A.	History -- that is, the reporting of facts, based upon facts -- does not alter rapidly if the history is well done to begin with.  Inevitably, a historian learns more over time if he or she continues to be interested in the subject.  But if the original work was solid, then the changes are modifications of detail in most cases rather than a complete change in interpretation.  Because the role of the expert witness is to provide a description of the historical context in order to situate the acts alleged to have occurred, that historical context is as relevant now as it was in 1997.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, since 1997, since the moment in time when you wrote your report for the Akayesu trial, have you received or found new information that might complete or add to the information that you presented in 1997?
A.	I have learned more details that have allowed me to appreciate some of the nuances, but my understanding of the general picture has not been significantly changed, and the amount of new information has not been that enormous.
Q.	Doctor, did you ever think that my client could benefit from the information, from the new evidence that you were able to collect after your testimony in Akayesu?
A.	Maître, if there are such elements, I am happy to put them at the disposition of the Court and am ready to do so under your questioning.
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  So, you see, I am now in an extremely difficult position.  I am upset because you have not written a report for my case and now you are asking me to cross-examine you about what you know.  I don't know -- the Prosecutor told you not to write a report for my case, and you have stated this.  Does your professional expertise lead you to say that this is a normal way of proceeding?
A.	I did not state that the Prosecutor did not ask me to prepare a report.  It was my assumption that, operating under the procedure of Rule 92bis, a report would not be required.  I do not recall having discussed the question at all with the Prosecutor's office.
As for the new information since 1997, that information is also a matter of public record and has been presented to this Court in my testimony in other cases.  To the best of my immediate recollection, most of that new information has to do with questions of military organisation, and conflicts within the army and, hence, would not be directly relevant to your client.
Q.	Doctor, I have thought of the proverb that no one should ignore the law.  Is this what you meant when you said, "The new information that I gathered, I have tendered it or mentioned it already"?  Is this what you are referring to, Dr. Des Forges, when you said that?  If that is not what you were thinking of, how do you feel that I can know the new information that you might have available?
A.	Perhaps we could begin with the old elements, those that were included in the 1997 testimony.
Q.	In that case, if we should begin with this, I should like to beg for your indulgence.  Do you believe it is relevant to my case?
A.	I do indeed, because the description of the planning and organisation and development of the genocide is relevant in this case.
Q.	When you are referring to organisation, Dr. Des Forges, did you also refer to the organisation of the administrative structure or of the organisation of any structure?
A.	I speak of organisation in general.  Because the administrative structure of the government was put to service in executing the genocide, it is of course relevant.  Political organisations, military organisations, militia organisations and the interaction among all of these is, of course, relevant.
Q.	So based on the information that you have provided, this was all done in 1997; is that correct?
A.	The period we are speaking of is essentially 1990 to 1994.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, if I'm not mistaken, you are a specialist of Rwanda.  Don't you believe that to speak of Rwanda from a sociological, political or administrative perspective, it would be desirable to go a bit further back in time?  Haven't you considered this?
A.	Indeed, as a historian, I am completely convinced of that; however, it is true that the bulk of the Akayesu testimony deals with that more recent period.  I am quite prepared to discuss the early history of Rwanda if those are the questions you wish to pose.
Q.	I would like to thank you.  I do not wish to put any questions to you.  I would just like to understand.  I think that the best way to understand is to begin with the source and then move on towards the ocean, and as the source I would like to ask you to please speak to us about Rwanda at a time that we did not -- that we have no knowledge of.
A.	May I ask for a little more precision?  What period are you speaking of?
Q.	In view of the fact that I am not a historian and I did not specifically study Rwanda, I would not like to put myself in your place.  But if you could please speak to us of the first groups of population that came to Rwanda.
A.	Rwanda is situated in a central location on the African continent, one which has historically up until the last few decades benefited from ample rainfall and up until perhaps a century ago benefited also from very rich soil, in part, the result of volcanic activity in the region.  Because of this and because of its healthy climate, the region became one of the most densely populated on the continent.

The people who settled there came from various points of origin and this -- these various points of origin have been much discussed.  The best academic interpretation of early Rwandan history is that people who came from many points came in relatively small numbers over a very long period of time and that, once arriving in the area that is today known as Rwanda and under the pressure of state development, they became organised into the population classifications which we now know as Hutu, Tutsi and Twa.

Early interpretation of history -- that is, early twentieth century attempts to interpret history -- overlain by later propaganda created a false image of fixed blocks of people; that is, a clearly defined group of Twa who were supposedly the first residents, a second group Hutu who came later as a single people and settled, and then a third group of Tutsi who came also as a single block at still a later stage and conquered the Hutu.

But, in fact, this description of history is not accurate because the cohesion of people into those three groups has been a more recent phenomenon and at the time of the arrival of the original inhabitants the categories that we now use had no relevance.  Instead, there were people who had different lifestyles, different means of supporting themselves; that is to say, some were hunters and gatherers; some were primarily pastoralists; and some were primarily raisers of food crops, although they also owned cattle and sheep and goats.  But the clear demarcation into ethnic groups and the sense of identity as being members of those groups was a much more recent development.

We can say that the consciousness of a division between Twa and the other two groups -- that is, Hutu and Tutsi, as we call them today -- perhaps dated to 400 or 500 years ago, but that clear demarcation into Hutu and Tutsi with a sense of the political relevance of those categories is a late nineteenth and twentieth century phenomenon.  That is, the words existed in the vocabulary, "Hutu" and "Tutsi", but they applied to individuals, not groups.

Far more relevant in people's lives was the concept of clan or lineage group.  It was known by the term "Ukoko", which can be translated genus, kind, species.  That term has now become the term that means ethnic group, the very same word.  But a century ago people understood it to mean lineage group and not ethnic group.  Within each lineage group were people whom we would today classify as Hutu, Tutsi and Twa 

Over time society was reorganised into the kinds of classifications that we see today.  This accompanied the growth of an expansionary state, and it was as the state grew in power and sophistication that society also was reorganised.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  When you speak of the groups Twa, Hutu, Tutsi, you said the following -- you spoke of conquering the Hutu.  Did I correctly understand you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And then after that you said the classification is 200 to 500 years old.  Did you correctly understand you?
A.	I said that the sense of division between Twa and the other two groups could date back as far as 400 or 500 years but that division as we know it today, as was relevant in the genocide between Hutu and Tutsi, is a much more recent phenomenon.  With the state -- with the development of the state there was the growth of an elite.  The elite believed itself superior, as all elites inevitably do, but the elite was not a Tutsi elite as we think of it today until sometime towards the end of the nineteenth or twentieth century in the sense of being an exclusive monoethnic group.  The state of Rwanda encompassed areas that were ruled by Hutu -- in some cases small states, in some cases large lineage groupings -- and the heads of pockets of autonomy were treated with great respect by the Tutsi ruler.

The Tutsi ruler depended upon military chiefs, Abatware, whom we would today call Hutu if we were to look at their genealogy, and that was true particularly at the end of the nineteenth century when there were very violent conflicts among Tutsi in the elite, and they relied upon Hutu as their closest supports in their conflicts with one another.  So that, in the state system as it existed when the colonial period began, people whom we classify now as Hutu were not necessarily in a clearly subordinate role.  This reorganisation of Tutsi into an exclusive ethnically defined elite and the organisation of Hutu into an exclusively subordinate category of population was a twentieth century phenomenon.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  What interested me in the passage referred to was the word "conquer".  I should merely like the historian that you are -- when you speak of conquests, who do you mean by that?  Was it the conquest we have been taught in history books, or is it that of primitive peoples -- the primitive peoples that inhabited Africa in those days?
A.	From the eighteenth century on, the military organisation of the Rwandan state was quite sophisticated.  I don't suppose that the Court has the time to go into the details of the military organisation, although it is something that I enjoy discussing.  But, in any case, these sophisticated military organisations were sufficient to protect Rwanda from outside attack and to allow the state to expand and to conquer, in any ordinary sense of the word, to conquer and defeat neighbouring peoples.  But what is relevant here is that those neighbouring peoples were sometimes Tutsi and sometimes Hutu and sometimes a mixed population.  At the same time the Rwandan state and its military force was also a mixed group in that it encompassed Tutsi as well as Hutu.  So that, conflict existed; wars were fought; the state expanded, but it was not a simple picture of Tutsi conquering Hutu.  There were, in fact, some cases in the reign of Rwabugiri at the end of nineteenth century, who was known as the greatest conqueror, supposedly, of the Rwandan monarchs.  There were a number of cases where Rwabugiri was defeated by Hutu peoples.
Q.	Doctor, you spoke of three groups: Twa, Hutu, Tutsi; but now you are speaking of monarchy.  Before the arrival of the Tutsi, was there a monarchy among the Hutu?
A.	The question cannot be answered because there was no time when the Tutsi arrived.  The Tutsi arrived simultaneously with the Hutu in some cases.  People moved in and out of this region until 1910 when the colonial boundary was fixed.  There are cases of Tutsi groups arriving in 1909.  There are cases of Hutu groups arriving in 1909.  Similarly, there are very ancient movements of both Hutu and Tutsi.  So there is no way to say, simply, the Tutsi arrived and brought the monarchy, or the Tutsi arrived and found a monarchy here.  What we can say is that states were organised in Rwanda as early as the fourth or fifth century AD, based largely upon extensive ironworking and extraction of iron, rather than upon cattle or agriculture exclusively.

By the arrival of Europeans there were a number of states in existence.  The larger states had rulers whom we would today call Tutsi, but there were smaller states in existence simultaneously ruled by people whom we would call Hutu.  Whether it was the Hutu that was the model for the Tutsi, or vice versa, would be difficult to know.  What is most likely is that political structures represented a synthesis of elements drawn from both cultures.

If you look for example from the royal rituals that gave the spiritual force to the Rwandan monarchy, you will find that more of those rituals have to do with agriculture and ironworking than with cattle raising, and yet cattle raising was supposedly the domain which mattered most to Tutsi.  But the kingship as a kingship reflected agricultural and ironworking origins.  And the most sacred symbol of the Rwandan king was not the drum, as was usually thought, but the iron hammer, which the king slept on every night, and this iron hammer was the symbol of the ironworking skills which had been fundamental to the early prosperity of states in this region.
Q.	Madam, you told me that the Tutsi and Hutu practically arrived at the same time.  I cannot argue with you.  I haven't done any history.  I am a mere lawyer.  I am merely trying to understand, so forgive me.  But not having your report, I have tried to read here and there, and I happened upon an article; I don't know if you have also read it.  It's called, "At the origin of the Bahutu problem in Ruanda", and Rwanda was written in those days R-U-A-N-D-A.  The author is Stanislas Bushayija.  I will spell it out for understanding: B-U-S-H-A-Y-A-J-A -- Y-I-J-A.  This was published in the Nouvelle Revue No. 12 in December 1958.  And the author states the following: "Many centuries ago, the Tutsi came to plant his tent at the borders of Rwanda.  The Muhutu who was in the country had not thought of chasing him away.  The nomad had not arrived as a conqueror, arms in hand, nor as a coloniser of a primitive and underdeveloped country.  He was a pastoralist searching for pastorage (sic) for his cattle, prepared to make all necessary concessions to be allowed to let his cattle graze on Hutu land".
Now, you said that the Tutsi came there and conquered the Hutu.  Now, first of all, the terminology "Bahutu" -- no, I'm sorry, "Mututu and Muhutu".  From what you know, did they exist?
A.	I would have to say that your summary of my previous statement is not exact, to begin with.  But to deal with your final question, I did state not too long ago that the terms have existed for a long time, but what is new in the nineteenth and twentieth century is the political relevance of those terms; that is to say, the importance of groups of people feeling, themselves, to be either Hutu or Tutsi, a sense of identification that has enormous political significance over time.

The terms existed previously.  The earliest mention I know of is in a seventeenth century poem in which a phrase says, "I will not drink beer with that Muhutu; he is the Muhutu of so-and-so", which would suggest the meaning is, he is the servant of so-and-so; he is a follower of the subordinate of so-and-so and below me because I am a person of the elite.

THE WITNESS:
But at that time there was not a group of people who saw themselves as "Hutu".  People saw themselves as members of clan groups, of which there were 18.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Madam, I was referring your kind attention to what the author of the article said.  You had said -- you used the word "conquer", and he said, the author of the article said, Tutsi does not come as a conquerer.  So you as a technician, as an expert, I should like to have your impression.  He said the Tutsi did not come as a conqueror, and you have stated that the Tutsi conquered the Hutu.
A.	Maître, I said the contrary.  I said exactly the opposite of what you have just stated.  But in order to make myself clear, groups of people arrived, relatively small groups; let us say groups of hundreds of people, certainly not tens of thousands.  They settled the country.  One was not in the process of conquering the other at that point.  Those who cleared the land first were acknowledged to have the rights to that land.  Ordinarily they had made some arrangements with Twa hunters who also had rights on the land.  In areas where agriculturalists had cleared the land and pastoralists arrived later, they ordinarily settled in intersecting zones, because the pastoral land and the agricultural land were often -- the land best suited to agriculture and the land best suited to pasture were often not the same lands.  Where they were the same lands, you had battles.

In some cases people we would call Hutu won those battles; in some cases people we would call Tutsi won those battles.  It was very complicated, but there was not a time when a single enormous wave of Tutsi swept in and conquered the Hutu.  Is that clear now?
Q.	Thank you, Madam.  Madam, if those groups of Tutsi did not conquer the Hutu, wasn't it a problem of relative strength?  That as one of the groups was humanly more numerous than the other and it would be suicidal to attack them, was that not the case?
A.	It would be helpful if you could take yourself outside of the framework of the late 20th century divisions.  I believe you are suggesting that because the Tutsi, as we know them today, constituted perhaps 10 to 15 per cent of the population, it would have been suicidal for them to attack the Hutu.  But what I am telling you is that those divisions were not relevant, and that the conflicts which took place were between Banyiginya and Abega, or Basinga, other groups which were fighting to control land and which were not necessarily thinking of themselves as Hutu or Tutsi, so that the question of the relative numbers of population would have had no importance.  

There was no political unit in which people would have measured themselves as being such and such a percentage of the population.  They would have looked at the people on the neighbouring hill, and if their family group or their nucleus of military power was greater than the people on the hill next door, and they wanted to occupy that hill, of course, they would have been in a stronger position to try to win that hill.  But it is not a general situation of percentage of population that is relevant at this time. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam.  According to your sources, what made it possible to distinguish between Hutu, Tutsi and Twa at that time?  Was it a hereditary criterion?  Was it a question of appearance?  Was it an administrative question?  Was it a political matter, since you have spoken to us of the organisation at the time?  What made it possible to distinguish the three groups?
A.	Are we still talking of the 17th and 18th century and before, or do you mean since the 19th century?
Q.	Madam, I meant the period you indicated that the Twa were the first, the Hutu second and Tutsi third.  I should like you now to explain to the Trial Chamber -- or did all three arrive at the same time?  If that is your hypothesis, I should merely like you to explain to myself and perhaps to the Trial Chamber what made it possible to distinguish these three groups.
A.	In the early period, the relevant distinctions were based on lineage and had nothing to do with those three terms.  The importance of the distinction of those three terms was a post-19th century -- late 19th century and early 20th century phenomenon.  It had to do with the growth of the state. 
Q.	We shall come back to that, Madam, but let us stay at that time.  The Muhutu, the Mututsi, the Mutwa, you confirmed that, and if I understood correctly, at the time if you said "Muhutu" it meant servant, if you said "Mututsi" it meant élite chef; is that correct, Madam?
A.	To the extent that we are able to understand those terms in the early period, it appears that Muhutu meant a servant or a follower of someone, and a Mututsi meant someone who was rich, someone who was wealthy. 
Q.	Under those conditions, what did Mutwa mean?
A.	You will remember that I indicated the distinction between Twa and the other two groups was an older distinction, and the Twa, who were scorned generally by the other two groups, were understood to be people who lived in the forest from hunting and gathering and were not generally regarded as acceptable marriage partners or colleagues in other social situations.

Indeed, if we can understand it in that sense, the dividing line which once existed between Twa and the other two groups, as they became known, in the course of the late 19th and early 20th century, was replicated a second time.  So that what had been a two-part division, Twa on one side and groups now known as Hutu and Tutsi on the other side, eventually, under the pressure of state organisation and colonialism, became a three-part division between Twa, and then the Hutu and the Tutsi moving apart into separate status. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam.  If I take your last answer as an introduction, I am given to understand that it is with the arrival of the colonisers, the colonialists, that there began to be problems between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  Can I claim that, Madam?
A.	The divisions between the ruling elite and the ordinary people increased as the state became more demanding.  That was a late 19th and early 20th century phenomenon, which was vastly accelerated by the imposition of colonial rule, so that we are speaking here of social processes that are difficult to date with any exactitude.

What we can say is that the divisions between elite and ordinary people were becoming increasingly important at the end of the 19th century, that these were speeded up by the imposition of colonial rule, and that at the same time the elite and the mass of people were increasingly identified in ethnic terms. 
Q.	Madam, according to the explanations you are giving us, you have just used the words "ethnic group".  Is that new terminology in relation to the preceding period on which you have provided us with information?
A.	It is a term which seems to me relevant for the late 19th and 20th century and not relevant for the period before then.  Let me just give as a small example two groups of pastoralist cattle-raising people who were relatively wealthy, one was called the Hema, and they lived in what is now the northern-eastern part of Rwanda in what is called Mutura.  Another group, known as the Bagogwe, lived in the north-western part of Rwanda.  In the course of the 19th century, both the Hema and the Bagogwe resisted the expansion of the state.  They were what we would call today Tutsi, but they were hostile to the Tutsi state, because the state wanted to tax and appropriate part of their cattle.  

In the course of the 20th century, and particularly in the last two decades of the 20th century, the Bagogwe, in particular, became attacked.  They were attacked by the government as if they were Tutsi, with the massacre of the Bagogwe particularly in 1991, and this has forced them into the mould of being Tutsi, even though 10 years before that time both Tutsi from the central part of the state and the Bagogwe themselves would not have seen themselves as necessarily part of the same category.  

But now, as the result of political changes and growing identification of the Bagogwe as Tutsi, they have become more or less assimilated.  That is something which we have seen in a very short historical period, and that gives us a sense of how ethnic groups are formed. 
Q.	Madam, when you speak of the period preceding colonisation, what are you relying on, please?
A.	There is a body of historical research done by academic historians in Rwanda, in North America and in Europe. 
Q.	In that in-depth research, were you able to detect a difference between the groups you have just mentioned, Hema, Bagogwe, Tutsi?  Did you detect any differences?
A.	Some of these academic works do, indeed, speak of these groups, yes. 
Q.	And what is that difference, Dr. Des Forges?
A.	The difference can be understood in political terms.  These were marginal groups in the sense that they lived on the periphery of the state and resisted its control, but they were cattle-raising groups.  I point this out not to complicate your questioning, but simply to try to illustrate that these terms, Hutu and Tutsi, need to be used with a certain level of subtlety. 
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges, but I never had the nuances or subtleties, and it is only you who could tell me what to do so as to draw a distinction.  From the beginning I told you I did not do history.  I'm only a lawyer, I did not do research.  So what are these subtleties?  I hope I can believe what you are telling me, and that is why we are here.

Dr. Des Forges, we were dealing with the arrival of the colonialists.  What did they do with respect to the Hutu, the Tutsi and Twa?  A moment ago you said before the colonialists arrived there was no problem, the distinction was Hutu-Tutsi against the Twa.  With the arrival of the colonialists the division changed.  Can you explain to the Court how, and what the change that occurred was?
A.	Both the Germans and the Belgians wanted to rule at the least cost and greatest possible profit.  They were pleased to find an existing political system, which they then sought to use for their own purposes.  Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.  Sometimes the Rwandan authorities instead exploited the colonial presence for its own interests, often without the colonialists being aware.

The people who came from Europe came with racist ideas that caused them to seriously underestimate the sophistication of the system in front of them and to seriously underestimate the political skill of the Rwandans with whom they dealt.  The Germans had a very small number of administrators, at one point seven, I believe, civilian administrators, and allowed the Rwandan political system to function without many changes.  The Belgians had a somewhat larger number of administrators, but still in the vicinity of perhaps 100.  They sought to tidy up the system in Rwanda.  They believed that they were continuing to use the system they had found in place and were simply making a few small changes to make it easier to control.  But, in fact, the changes they introduced had long-term consequences, particularly for relationships between the elite, which became known as Tutsi, and the majority of people, who became known as Hutu.

The pre-existing system had involved a number of competing authorities under the king.  The king used these various rival subordinates under his control in order to maximise his own power, but at the same time the multiplicity of authorities gave the ordinary people opportunity to seek protection from various important patrons.  This led to the establishment of the system known as ubuhake, or clientage.  The Europeans eliminated the multiplicity of authorities and created a simple Cartesian kind of outline of the administration, where you had the king, and then you had a chief, and then you had a subchief, and that was it.  The simplification of the system meant that ordinary people had fewer opportunities for redress if they felt they were being oppressed.  At the same time, the colonial authority made it impossible for people to move around.

Simply moving to another area had been a usual way of escaping excessive demands from a superior.  People would move to a new part of the forest, clear new land and then be more or less masters of their own fate, or they would flee into another area and become temporary labourers.  In general, the colonial administration made this impossible, so that the little guy was pinned down in a way that had never happened before and had fewer opportunities to seek help from powerful people in the system.

To compensate for this the Europeans created a system of courts which were supposed to protect ordinary people and to protect their rights, but because the judges in the court system were of the same ruling elite, most of the judgements went against the poor plaintiffs.

At the same time as making these changes in the system, the Belgians applied a criteria of ethnicity for admission to schools and for administrative posts.  They did this not to divide and rule, as many colonial rulers did; I think they did it as a simple reflex of their own racism.  When they arrived in Rwanda and they saw a political structure with a king who was Tutsi, they believed that the Tutsi were more like themselves in the physical -- in the characteristic physical type of Tutsi; they look more like Europeans, and so this suited the European concept.  They believed, "These people are more like us, hence they must be superior to those others", and they then decided that Tutsi would be the sole rulers in Rwanda.  Because secondary education was meant to prepare young men for service in the administration, places in secondary education were also reserved for Tutsi.  It became complicated, because up until that time the categories were very fluid and depended on genealogy.  In order to simplify the situation so that administrators would not have to each time determine whether a candidate for a place in school or a candidate for an administrative post was in fact Tutsi, they decided to impose a system of population registration which would decide the issue once and for all, and put it into writing.  So in the 1930s they established a system of population registration and required Rwandans to carry identity cards indicating whether they were Hutu, Tutsi or Twa.

So you have several changes happening in a very brief period of time.  You have a change in administrative structure that makes it more possible to exercise direct and repressive control on ordinary people, and you have the reservation -- the exclusive monopoly of power delivered into the hands of Tutsi.  So that Hutu who had had positions of power -- for example, the ruler of Bushiru, a small state in the north-west which was the homeland of President Habyarimana, the ruler of Bushiru was eliminated, and his territory was taken over by a Tutsi chief.  So that the pockets of autonomy and the leeway in the system were removed in order to create what was a much simpler structure.

The Tutsi who received this monopoly of power used it to increase their control.  One objective of the Europeans was to make it possible to demand accountability from chiefs and subchiefs for certain infrastructure projects which they wanted to see done -- the building of roads, the planting of cotton, the planting of certain food crops -- and the chiefs and subchiefs used these new regulations to impose additional burdens, for their own profit, that the Europeans often were unaware of.
So it was in that context that Tutsi rule became identified as Tutsi rule.  It expanded geographically, it extended downward far more intensively, and the consciousness of Tutsi as a privileged people became far more important, and conversely, the sense of Hutu as an oppressed people also grew proportionately stronger. 
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges, for this masterly discourse.  Don't you think it would be easier to attribute -- well, Germans were in Cameroon, in Toga, I believe, also in Namibia, but would it not experience the same situation there?  Don't you think it's an easy way out to repeat all that happened to the colonialists?
A.	You are right, and I thought I had said that the Tutsi, the ruling elite, were extremely skilful in making use of the European presence to increase their own power, and in fact the sentences I just said were a demonstration of that, how the Tutsi used the imposition of colonial burdens to extend their own hold on power and their own wealth.  So it was certainly not a one-way situation.  The Tutsi were not helpless pawns of the colonialists, they were an extremely skilful political elite that knew how to exploit the situation to their own benefit. 
Q.	When you were speaking earlier on you talked of the ID card on which it was mentioned Tutsi, Hutu and so on.  To what period do you date that phenomenon?
A.	It was at the beginning of the 1930s.
Q.	And at the beginning of the 1930s, was it the Rwandans directing or leading Rwanda, or was it another group of people who were leading Rwanda?
A.	It was the Belgians at the time.  They were leading Rwanda through.
Q.	According to you, before the arrival of the Belgians, did Rwandans have ID cards?
A.	No. 
Q.	Is it the Belgians who decided to call the various people Hutu or Tutsi, or was it the Rwandans who asked Belgians to call them as such, Hutu or Tutsi?
A.	The colonial administration imposed the system of population registration.  It was up to each individual to declare his own ethnic group. 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, your personal understanding of this phenomenon, is it based on your knowledge, your present knowledge, or do you start from this to come to the present history of Rwanda?
A.	I beg your pardon?  I didn't understand the question. 
Q.	The question, Dr. Des Forges, is the following:  your views with regard to the issue of ID cards, or your position, is it based or does it start from 1994, or before 1994 you had already identified the fact that these ethnic groups were mentioned on ID cards?
A.	If your question is did I realise that identity cards included ethnic classification before 1994 and if I saw that as a troublesome situation, the answer is yes.  And in 1991 I was asked to do a study of the situation, the political situation in Rwanda, and at that time I pointed out the existence of ethnic classifications on identity cards as a serious problem in the political system, and I counselled donor nations to give no assistance to the Rwandan government until that ethnic identification was removed from identity documents. 
Q.	And what were your reasons at that time?  Why did you ask for what you asked for?
A.	The existence of ethnic classifications permitted discrimination against a group of people on the basis of their birth in violation of human rights standards. 
Q.	I am convinced that we will come back to this issue later on.  Do you think that in Rwanda people moved about with their ID cards always ready to show them?
A.	Rwandans were obliged to carry their card -- their identity cards with them.  I suppose it was more usual to keep them in the pocket rather than on any other part of their anatomy.

If you are asking was it possible to identify people as members of an ethnic group on the basis of their physical characteristics, there are indeed differences in the stereotypes of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, but an individual can often be mistaken if he is judged or she is judged on the basis of those characteristics.  This is in part because the population has had significant intermarriage over time, and it is in part because persons took the identity of their fathers and, in cases of mixed marriage, might look like their mothers.  So you could have someone who looked Tutsi and who was legally Hutu, or vice versa.  And, in fact, a significant number of people were killed in the genocide either because people at barriers did not believe what was written on their identity cards, thought they had been falsified because they looked like they were Tutsi; conversely, there are other people who were able to save themselves because they looked Hutu, even though legally they were Tutsi. 
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  Therefore, at some point in time one could recognise from the physical characteristics various people.  If you came across a Tutsi or a Hutu or a Twa, you could distinguish them.  Why do you speak very little of the Twas in your explanations, how the Twas were distinguished?
A.	I said that there are stereotypical images of these three groups, but I also said that it is quite possible to be mistaken about a person's ethnic identity if one judges solely by his appearance.  So it is wrong to say that meeting Hutu, Tutsi or Twa on the street you will know immediately by looking at them what group they are members of.

I speak relatively little of the Twa, because I recognise that the time in this courtroom is precious, and I am attempting to be as concise as I can be.  The Twa represent a very small part of the Rwandan population, and that has been the case for the last century, so that I endeavour simply to save the time of the Court by not in every case mentioning all three groups. 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, if you do not mention the Twas under the pretext that the Court's time is precious, are you not creating the same phenomenon like the others, that is the Belgians and Germans; in other words, eliminating in your mind a group which is still existing?
A.	I have not eliminated them from my thinking, as I hope you have not, and if you have some specific questions about the Twa I would be happy to answer them -- questions that are relevant to this case, that is. 
Q.	Thank you.  The coup d'état of Ruchunsu, does it lead you -- does it bring an explanation to mind?  R-U-C-H-U-N-S-U, that is the spelling of Ruchunsu.
A.	The coup d'état of Ruchunsu was the conquest of power by one group of the Abega lineage to the disadvantage of the Abanyiginya lineage.  Both contending groups were Tutsi, the Abega customarily providing the queen mother to the king, the Abanyiginya customarily providing the king himself.  In this case, the queen mother, whose name was Kanjogera, K-A-N-J-O-G-E-R-A, and her two brothers, Kabare, K-A-B-A-R-E, and Ruhinankiko, R-U-H-I-N -- R-U-H-I-N-A-N-K-I-K-O, killed the legitimate ruler and installed on the throne Kanjogera's son, Musinga.  Subsequently, the Abega killed a substantial number of the Abanyiginya nobility and more or less maintained control through much of the colonial period.

Eventually Musinga took his revenge, and the Abanyiginya resurfaced but never regained the same pre-eminence that they had had before Ruchunsu.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I think this should be the last question before the break.  I cannot see the clock very well.  When you talk of a coup d'état, does that mean a conquering power?
A.	Yes.  It was a military takeover involving the assassination of the legitimate ruler.  It was perhaps, I should say, significant as one example of Tutsi killing Tutsi for power, an early -- late 19th century example of the bitterness and rivalries which existed within the ruling elite. 
Q.	I thank you.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours.  I think it is time for the break.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We thank you, Dr. Des Forges.

We are now going to take our lunch break, and we will resume at 2:30 p.m. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
(Court recessed from 1258H to 1431H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session.  Good afternoon, Ms. Des Forges.  I would like to remind you that you are still under oath.  Counsel Kouengoua from the Defence will continue his cross-examination. 

Counsel Kouengoua.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you give us an idea of how long you anticipate your cross-examination will last?  Do you still have many questions that you wish to put to the witness? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I do not wish to put many questions to the witness, but I objectively believe, to ensure that every single aspect of my client is taken into consideration, I believe that I should be able to complete by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

I have had 2600 pages of materials that I have had to review.  This is what I have always stated.  She testified during four months; I am just asking for four hours.  I don't believe that is unreasonable Madam President.  If she had given me even a sliver of a report, I could have used a report as a foundation and completed my cross-examination in a day, but I don't have anything here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to ask you to go to the essential matters.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President, I shall try to do so.  I thank you, Madam President, for your kindness.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Dr. Des Forges.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	I hope you were not forced to curtail your usual afternoon rest, but in any case there was nothing I could do about that.  I would like to thank you for your understanding.

When we parted right before lunch I believe that we were speaking about colonial times.  I think this is what we were discussing when the time came for the lunch break.  In order to follow -- to comply with the Trial Chamber's recommendations, I would like to take into consideration the fact that time is precious.

And you mentioned this, this morning, I would like to ask you to please speak to us about the events that occurred in 1959, '60 and '63.  I believe that it will be possible, don't you, Dr. Des Forges?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, one, it is a compounded question; two, that is not a matter of cross-examination, it is just open-ended.  Counsel should be more specific on what he intends to elicit from this witness.  

Now, if counsel contests any of the opinions advanced by this witness, he should do so, rather than actually leading her examination-in-chief.  This is cross-examination, Your Honours.  And maybe I should add -- in fact, I had stood up before Madam President made her observation.

Your Honours have given counsel sufficient leeway this morning, one and three-quarter hours this morning.  Now, one of the grounds upon which the Prosecutor moved this Chamber for this mode of proceeding under 92bis(D) was to benefit from judicial economies.  If we proceed in the manner we are doing now, we would be losing the judicial economies anticipated by Rule 92bis.  So counsel should be more specific and should cross-examine the witness.  If he contests the opinions advanced by the witness in prior testimony, he should do so; go straight to the matters in issue.  

I am most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, counsel for the Prosecution.  

Yes, Counsel Kouengoua. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any comments with respect to what the Prosecutor has just said with respect to matters raised in the testimony of the witness, and more specifically with the testimony made in Akayesu trial?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, under the control of the Trial Chamber, I did not receive the expert report the witness gave in the Akayesu trial.  I did not receive a copy of this expert -- of this reporter.  

You have deprived me of this report, and the witness has just said that you did not ask her to prepare another report.  Well, the only thing that I have are the transcripts of the hearings, Madam President, and I am a bit astounded that counsel for the Prosecution should raise the report made by the expert witness with respect to Akayesu.  If I had received this report, then my cross-examination with the witness would have begun with the report.

I wrote -- I never received the report.  The only thing I received was the transcript of the hearing, which is a combination of what was said by the President, by the Judges, by counsel, by the witness.  This represents 1600 pages, transcribed by the court reporters.  And in the transcripts that I received as two volumes, I believe the two volumes are here, and there is mention of the history of Rwanda.  There is a discussion between the representative of the Prosecutor and the Dr. Alison Des Forges, the conversation between the late Laity Kama, but I did not receive a copy of this report.  I initially thought that it wasn't done on purpose, but I am surprised that the Prosecutor should raise this matter at this stage of the proceedings.  It is embarrassing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have heard what you had to say, Counsel.  Please proceed with your examination, but as we have said, please try and go to what is essential and to matters that will be able to serve your client's case.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President.  This is exactly what I am seeking.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Dr. Alison, this morning you stated before the Trial Chamber that this was the first time that you were coming to testify without having written a report; is that correct?
A.	I believe that I prepared a very brief report, perhaps ten pages, in the Akayesu case.  At that point, procedures were not clearly established for the Tribunal, and I may even have done that report after the testimony.  I'm not at all sure.  In any case, I do recollect having prepared more extensive reports for more recent trials. 
Q.	During the Akayesu trial with the Defence counsel, did you go over all aspects of the Rwandan problem?
A.	We have dealt with many issues.
Q.	Thank you, Dr. Des Forges, but I am just asking you at the present time if you could please speak to us about what happened in 1959.
A.	The --
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, what happened in 1959 is too open-ended, and this is where counsel should be specific.  What happened in 1959?  Somebody was born or somebody died.  Counsel should be more specific about what he wants to elicit from this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think we are going to have to be a bit more tolerant; otherwise, we are not going to be able to move forward.

Dr. Des Forges, 1959, is this date significant in any way for you?  And if you could please tell us, and try and be very, very brief. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  After a colonial period in which the Belgians supported the power of the Tutsi elite, without reserve, in the 1950s they began to see the need to enlarge the share of Hutu in the administration and the political system.  They introduced several political reforms, and the Hutu intelligentsia, particularly that educated by the church, became more active politically and began to demand an increasing share of political power. 

The Belgians -- the concessions made under Belgian administration in the end were not sufficient to satisfy Hutu demands, and at the same time, they were too large for some Tutsi, who became frightened at the potential loss of power.  The result was a polarisation and the coalescence of a group of Hutu political activists, who arranged for the overthrow, who led the overthrow of the monarchy, and established a republic.  The ruler, after some months, fled the country, and along with him, several tens of thousands of people associated with him, most of them, but not all of them, Tutsi. 

This initial period, let us say from 1959 to 1961, or about 1961, had involved some killings, but not massive killings.  That is to say, the revolution itself, the establishment of the republic, was not the occasion for widespread killings on an ethnic basis.  The persons targeted were power holders who were indeed Tutsi, but they were targeted because they were power holders and not because they were Tutsi.  Hutu associated with them in subordinate roles were also targeted.  

From the early 1960s through 1967, groups of Tutsi outside of Rwanda organised militarily to attempt to return into the country.  It was this period of military activity which led to widespread killings of Tutsi, notably the massacre of some 10,000 in the préfecture of Gikongoro in December 1963 and January 1964.  It was in the interests of Hutu power holders -- apparently they saw it that way -- to incite killings of Tutsi at that time.  It allowed them to broaden their base of power by killing and driving away ordinary Tutsi, large numbers of ordinary residents, as opposed to the power holders.  Those local Hutu government officials obtained control of their land and could then redistribute this land among Hutu, which allowed them to increase their own personal following and base of power. 

It is notable that at this time the reason given for inciting killings and other attacks on Tutsi was that they were supposedly assisting Tutsi from outside the country who were engaged in military incursions.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, you have stated that at the time there was incitement, and you mentioned a name Gikongoro, and you stated that 10,000 people were murdered in Gikongoro.  At that specific time, did what you call genocide take place?
A.	I have not myself done the in-depth studies that would be necessary to adequately describe these killings, but based on what I know at this time I would not call them genocide, although it is clear that the definition of the target was gradually broadening from those people who were power holders, or former power holders, to take on a wider ethnic definition.  But even if that is true, and even if the target is chosen on ethnic grounds, that does not, as I understand it, qualify for genocide.

In addition to the ethnic targeting, there must be the intention of elimination, and, as I know the information from that period, that was not an element of the 1963-64 killings.  

One way to establish this is to look at the possibility for flight.  The borders were not closed.  Tutsi were attacked with the intention to kill or to drive away, and large numbers of people did flee.  In contrast to that, in 1994 one of the earlier actions of the authorities was to close the frontiers, to close the borders, to attempt to impede the flight of Tutsi, whether very locally or in leaving the country, and this to me demonstrates a clear intention to fix them in a place where they could then be eliminated.
JUDGE REDDY:
May I just ask you a question?  This might be the  --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, please, the microphone.
JUDGE REDDY:
May I just ask you a question, and this might be the best time to do it.

After the president died on the 7th of April, early in the morning there was a bulletin, obviously broadcast at the request or orders of the government, asking people not to leave their homes.  How do you see that?  Was that a ploy to ensure that the intended victims would be found in their homes, or was that a wider security measure?  How do you view that in the context of the investigations that you carried out? 
THE WITNESS:
It is certainly reasonable to understand that as a general security measure, and were it not for the rest of the context of events, one would be tempted to conclude that it was simply a general measure of order.  But given that killings were already taking place on the basis of lists which were residential lists, given that squads were being sent to find people in their homes, and given that Radio RTLM eventually would even broadcast other places where people might be frequently found in addition to their homes, it seems to me that we must understand this as a measure which, for the general part of the population, would be a security measure, but for those persons targeted, which would be not just Tutsi but also Hutu leaders of the political opposition, it was meant as a means to make them easier to kill. 

In that connection, I would remark that in the early hours of April 7th, the members of the MRND and others closely associated with the presidential circle were, in fact, evacuated from their homes, did leave their homes, and were taken to a place of safety in a military camp.  Others in the same neighbourhood who were of the political opposition were not allowed to leave their homes and were killed later that day.

So there, I think, would be one example that would support the conclusion that this was a double -- a measure with a double intention, but certainly one of its intentions being to pin the victims down.
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, thank you very much.

MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, you have testified that in the year previous, that you did not conduct in-depth studies about the previous period to be able to speak of genocide, and the information that you have available to you today does not allow you to say that it was genocide.  As I am here to try and understand, I would like you to explain to me does -- is it the number that characterises genocide or is it something else?  You said that 10,000 people were murdered in genocide, but I thought that you felt that this was insignificant in comparison to what happened subsequently.
A.	I attempt to stay as close as possible to the legal definition of the term "genocide".  It is a word which is used far too casually in many contexts, simply to indicate a large number of victims. 

I use the term in its legal sense, to involve attacks on people of a specific ethnic, religious, racial group with the intention of eliminating them.  And as I specified when speaking of 1963 and early '64, because I see no attempt to prevent the flight of people -- in other words, Tutsi were allowed to escape -- that seems to me one indicator that this was not genocide.  And I would remark also in that connection the very specific reference in a speech inciting to genocide given in November of 1992 by Léon Mugesera, vice-president of the MRND party, in which he said specifically, "We made a mistake in the 1960s by allowing them to escape.  This time no one must escape".  And this theme was picked up during the genocide when even babies, infants and young children were killed, with the phrase often being used to explain this, that "Even Paul Kagame or Fred Rwigema was once a child", these references being to RPF military leaders who had, in fact, been able to escape the country in the 1960s.  And the obvious meaning being, "You must eliminate even babies and children, because they could grow up to return". 
Q.	You told us that in 1960, 1959, these were targeted killings, but in this current trial I had someone who came to testify here and said that they came back to Rwanda in 1968, and they came back to Rwanda with their family, and these were ordinary people.  This person did not have anything specific to be targeted, so how can you explain that peasants fled at the time?  If they hadn't fled, wouldn't they have been killed?
A.	I did say that the people targeted in the early 1960s were targeted primarily because they were power holders or associated with power holders.  Some of those associated with power holders included Hutu and Twa, who were their household servants or in other ways affiliated with them.  These people also fled the country, and I myself knew a number who were refugees in Tanzania in those early years, who were Hutu and Twa. 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, the fact of blocking the borders or preventing people to go out into the -- going out into the streets, could this be considered a criteria for genocide?
A.	Obstructions to flight, if taken in conjunction with attacks meant to kill or otherwise permanently damage the people of a given group, seems to me a convincing demonstration of genocide. 
Q.	In 1959 and 1960, could you tell us a little bit more about incitement at the time?
A.	As I understand it, central government officials, particularly ministers, returned to their home regions of origin to incite people to attack Tutsi on the grounds that these Tutsi had in some way facilitated military attacks, incursions, by Tutsi refugees from outside the country.  I have not attempted at this point to study the content of their speeches or exactly what form the incitement took. 
Q.	Did you do any research, Dr. Des Forges, in the period that followed 1964?
A.	The research which I did from 1964 until 1990 all had to do with the early 20th century or before, going back to the 16th century.  I was not at that point working on contemporary affairs. 
Q.	Is that period covered by your research at present, Madam?
A.	At this point, I'm rather busy with the current situation. 
Q.	When you speak of the current situation, could you let me know what the current period is?
A.	From 1990 to the present.
Q.	And from 1990, which is the landmark date you have put forward, madam, what is special about 1990?
A.	It was the beginning of the war, which formed the context in which this genocide took place.  I have studied not just the war but the internal political developments as well, which went hand in hand with the military actions to provide the setting in which genocide was organised. 
Q.	In 1990, what war are you referring to?  Who were the belligerents in the war of 1990, madam?
A.	The parties were the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Rwandan government. 
Q.	At that time, could the historian that you are see any premonitions or rudimentary elements of genocide?
A.	With the beginning of the war, a group of political actors close to President Habyarimana, and at times involving President Habyarimana, chose to aggravate ethnic tensions, ethnic divisions, as a way of solidifying their own power, which at that point was diminishing.  They made the choice of using the RPF invasion as a reason for scapegoating or targeting Tutsi civilians who lived inside Rwanda and accusing them of being accomplices or ibyitso of the RPF.

This initial choice, followed by many other choices, led eventually to the genocide, but it did not necessarily have to lead to the genocide.  This was not an inevitable result.  The first decision was followed by many other decisions, and at any point, even until very shortly before April 6th, the genocide could have been averted. 
Q.	What happened on the 6th of April, madam?
A.	On the night of April 6th, the aeroplane carrying President Habyarimana and the president of Burundi was shot down as it approached Kanombe airport.  This event, this attack, was the catalyst which then led to renewed conflict and to the genocide.  It provided the opportunity for what was in effect a coup d'état by a group of militant radical Hutu politicians identified with the position of Hutu Power, who took control initially of a substantial part of the military forces, subsequently of the administration, and who, with the assistance of leaders of political parties, militia and the radio, both public and private, were able to carry out a genocide that killed at least half a million people, most of them Tutsi, targeted for their ethnicity. 
Q.	Thank you, madam, but it is the first time that I have heard that the president's assassins were identified.  I asked you what happened on the 6th of April 1994, and you said a group of Hutu radicals shot down the president's plane and thereby killed the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi?
A.	No, I didn't say that.  Perhaps there was a problem with the interpretation. 
Q.	In that case, please forgive me, but this date of the 6th of April, could you please repeat  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, we have all heard the answer.  She did not say that it was a group of extremist Hutu that shot down the plane.  No one heard that in this room.  Now go on, and please don't come back on that.  Ask other questions that might perhaps inform you better. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Did you say that on the 6th of April there was something like a coup d'état?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	Please, madam, were you so far able by your research to identify the authors of the coup d'état?
A.	There are a number of people whom we have identified as the likely authors of that coup d'état, yes. 
Q.	Do you know them?  Could this also enrich our store of knowledge, if you could name them now, please, madam?
A.	Those persons would be the military officers and perhaps any civilians associated with them who assassinated the legitimate political authorities, including the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and various members of her government, the president of the supreme court, and the candidates for the presidency of the assembly, all of whom would have been able, had they been left alive, to carry forward a legitimate government that would not have been involved in genocide.

By the assassination of these political leaders, most of whom were Hutu, this group of military officers and their associated civilians were able to install a government of their own choosing, which then preceded to carry out the genocide. 
Q.	Madam, the members of that group, has it been possible to identify them?
A.	There are a number of people accused of being the leaders of these actions, and they are under indictment, many of them, and some of them are currently being tried before this Tribunal. 
Q.	Who started the war, madam, in 1994?
A.	In 1994 there was a ceasefire in existence, a ceasefire which was broken by the military attack of various forces of the Rwandan army on the headquarters of the CND, the Conseil national de development, in which was housed soldiers of the RPF.  Those soldiers came out of the CND and engaged in combat against Rwandan army forces.  As best I have been able to determine, the initiators of military action in the circumstance were the Rwandan army forces.

	1515H
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	With your permission, Madam, we are in April 1994.  Could we just come back to 1993?  Were there Rwandan army attacks in 1993? 
A.	At the beginning of 1993 there was a ceasefire in effect which was broken on February the 8th by an attack by the RPF forces moving south towards the capital of Kigali.  This was responded to by fire from the Rwandan Armed Forces and until sometime in March, I believe the 13th of March, there continued to be exchange of fire between the two forces.  

After that time there was a new ceasefire and eventually the Arusha Accords signed in August, which ended the war officially.
Q.	Madam, why do you say "officially"?  Were there any other attacks by the RPF after the signature?
A.	The peace treaty was meant to be definitive but, in fact, there were forces on both sides which did not accept this as a final settlement and there were preparations for renewed combat on both sides.  Whether both simultaneously engaged in such preparations or whether one side began preparations and this was known to the other that subsequently began preparations, I do not know, but both sides engaged in preparations for further military activity.
Q.	In 1992, were there attacks, madam?
A.	In 1992 there were indeed a number of military actions throughout the year.  I'm afraid I don't have the details at my command to give you the exact dates but there was indeed military activity off and on during that year.
Q.	Is it possible to say, roughly speaking, that all those attacks were by the RPF?
A.	It was at that point a guerilla war, which involved, as far as I know, military activity initiated by both sides at different points in time.
Q.	Hence, Madam, the Arusha Accords which required a ceasefire -- called for a ceasefire, did they lead to any reconciliation into any final peace?
A.	As I said previously, this was taken to be a peace treaty that settled the war and ended it completely.
Q.	By ending the war, did it require what one might call democratic actions by both parties?
A.	(Previous translation continued)...  spelling out political arrangements for the transition, guarantees of human rights, the improvements in the judicial system, but it is perhaps best to think of the agreement as a three-part agreement rather than as a two-party agreement.  It is true that there were only two belligerents; that is, the RPF and the Rwandan government, but at the time of the signature of the accords the Rwandan government was divided between supporters of Habyarimana and opponents of Habyarimana, and the political arrangements reflected in the treaty were three-part, tripartite, rather than a simple two-part arrangement.  It was, in effect, a three-legged stool that was created.  

Events throughout the rest of 1993, together with the already existing divisions, led to a realignment of forces within Rwanda so that by the end of the year it had, in fact, become a two-part or bipolar situation and that was largely determined by ethnicity.  So it was the passage from a three-part arrangement, which was expected to be stable, to a two-part arrangement based on ethnic hostilities that set the scene for the genocide. 
Q.	Madam, the conflicts to which you allude, were they due to the fact that some Rwandans wanted to return to Rwanda and others did not oppose their entrance into -- on national territory, that they should enter the national territory?
A.	The conflict which I was referring to in my last answer was considerably later.  It was the conflict of 1993 in which political forces realigned to become a bipolar Hutu/Tutsi opposition.  The question of return of refugees from the outside was not a major issue at this time.
Q.	Nonetheless, Madam, when the various parties went to Arusha -- or, I don't know, Gbadolite -- all these people didn't live in Rwanda?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Were the Tanzanian or Arusha agreements, as you call them, were on an ethnic -- was there an ethnic problem at that time?
A.	Certainly, there were ethnic elements to the conflict at that point, but as I pointed out, there were serious divisions among the Hutu which permitted the creation of a three-part arrangement:  one part being Habyarimana and his supporters, one part being people inside the government and inside the country who opposed Habyarimana, some of whom were Hutu and some of whom were Tutsi, and the third group being the RPF and its supporters, many of whom -- most of whom were Tutsi.  In the course of 1993, that middle group essentially divided and realigned itself with one or the other of the two ends of the spectrum, and it was this polarisation which created the possibility for a genocide.

Had the third force remained solid, those radicals around Habyarimana would never have had the strength to carry out a genocide on the scale that we saw in 1994.  Their own political power was limited to certain regions and it was only by attracting to their side those other Hutu who had been opposed to Habyarimana personally, that they were able to get the sufficient number to mobilise the population to attempt to exterminate the Tutsi.
Q.	Madam, I still don't know very well -- sometimes you talk about Hutu and Tutsi and sometimes you talk about the RPF.  Was the RPF exclusively Tutsi?
A.	I have just specified, not three or four minutes ago, that it was a force that was mainly Tutsi. 
Q.	Right.  Now, when the president's plane was shot down in the evening of the 6th, on the 7th, in the morning, RPF elements that were based at the CND, I think, brought out the heavy artillery and started shooting at the Presidential Guard and a certain -- put local inhabitants around there.  Not being a historian, is my version of the facts incorrect, madam?
A.	No.
Q.	In that case, Madam, can you help me and tell me what happened on the 7th, in the morning, or before getting that -- was the RPF housed at the CND in Kigali?
A.	Six hundred soldiers of the RPF were at the CND on the date specified, and as I said perhaps 15 minutes ago, the sequence of events was that Rwandan Army Forces attacked the CND and the RPF forces came out and engaged them in battle in the late afternoon.  I believe they left the building in the early afternoon, took up their positions around the perimeter of the building and actually opened fire in the late afternoon sometime in the vicinity of 4 p.m.
Q.	At that time, Madam, on the 7th of April, where were you?
A.	In the United States, but I was following the events by telephone beginning within 10 minutes of the downing of the airplane, when I was called by a human rights colleague to whom I spoke every 30 minutes throughout the night until her home was invaded by militia and soldiers.  I subsequently was in contact with other persons in Kigali on a daily basis throughout this period.
Q.	At what -- on what date did you arrive in Kigali, madam?
A.	In 1994, after the genocide? 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	I arrived in Kigali in August 1994.
Q.	Four or five months after the events that you followed by telephone; is that correct, madam?
A.	It is.
Q.	Did you find the people you'd been talking to over the phone in August 1994?
A.	Thirty-six of them were dead, but a number of others were alive.
Q.	Is the month of April in Rwanda in the rainy season?
A.	It was.
Q.	As it's a matter of tropical rainfall, is it sometimes accompanied by tornadoes, madam?
A.	In the sense of heavy rainstorms, yes.  I don't know exactly if that would be exactly translated as "tornado" in English.  If it were, I think not, but if it means heavy rainstorms, yes, and wind storms, yes.
Q.	I meant thunder.  I said thunder, if the interpreter can help me there.
A.	Yes.
Q.	And according to you, doctor, can you tell the difference over the telephone between a cannon shot and a bolt of thunder?
A.	Yes.
Q.	As I have children that I'll be going to see soon and who are at school, can you tell me what is the recipe that allows you to distinguish between a gunshot and a thunder bolt on the telephone?
A.	 (Previous translation continued)... in the proximity of the person holding the telephone is considerably shorter and sharper than the noise of thunder.
Q.	Doctor, we are on the telephone.  Dr. Des Forges, we are on the telephone.  I say we are on the telephone.  Is that a perception -- is it distinguishable by non-initiates as we are?
A.	Perhaps you have the good fortune of not being an initiate of gunfire.  I have heard a considerable amount in my time. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  If we recorded cannon fire and then played it back to you over the telephone, how would you distinguish it?
A.	As I explained, the distinction between small arms fire, if you understand small arms, that would be a Kalashnikov, a machine gun, a pistol, as opposed to a mortar.  Small arms fire would be quite easily distinguishable from thunder.  Heavy arms fire would be more difficult to distinguish.
Q.	Are the sources of history certain?
A.	In my experience, there is little in life that is sure. 
Q.	I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand.  I was talking of the sources of history.
A.	Historical sources need to be treated with skepticism and care.  A professional who is experienced in doing history always pays attention to obtaining the best possible data, but within that parameter there is little in life that is 100 per cent sure.  We all work with the best possible approximation of truths.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, during your studies and research, did you hear anyone talk about Colonel Marchal?
A.	I have, and I have met him several times.
Q.	Did you know or did he tell you that he appeared before the military prosecutor of his country?
A.	He did not tell me that but I am aware of it.
Q.	And before the prosecutor he alleged that it was RPF soldiers who attacked and who were opposed to a peacekeeping force, so to speak.  What do you think of that?
A.	Could you repeat the exact words, please, including the date and the place? 
Q.	Madam, I am sorry, because the time that I'm allowed does not enable me -- well, if I have to do research, I have the information in my documents but it may take me more time to find the exact words.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness nevertheless has to know what you are talking about, so you should give all the necessary information. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I have given information.  She said she knew the person. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you did not tell her the exact document from which you retrieved that information.  Perhaps you should read the passage out to the witness or give the document to the witness so that she should be able to make a determination thereon.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I'm going do look for the documents, Madam President, while I continue. 

Registry, please. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the Prosecutor just has some reservations about this document.  It doesn't appear to have been downloaded from any authentic website and we cannot at this stage establish its provenance.  Maybe I should leave the witness also to have a look at it.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I think that was the best thing to do, Prosecutor.
THE WITNESS:
This document is not from the hearings of the military court in Belgium but is, rather, a speech given by Luc at a meeting in France last April the 4th, 2003.  It's a five-page document and I have not read it except the highlighted passages, but I do not see in any of these passages the phrase or the words to which Defence counsel has referred that is having to do with an RPF attack on an inter-position force.  I don't see those words in here.  Perhaps they are in here in a part that is not highlighted.  If so, perhaps we could save time if counsel would indicate to me exactly where they are. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you.  

Madam President, I just gave this document for purposes of reference.  It is not a Defence exhibit.  At the appropriate time I will tender the document, the transcript of the hearing of Colonel Marchal by the military court.  Having said this -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you therefore withdrawing the question that you put to the witness? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No.  I was asked to state the origin of what I just said, and the first document which refers to that is what I gave out.  Therefore, if the question has not been understood by Dr. Alison, I can withdraw the question.  I have other questions to ask and that's not the only question I have.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You can continue.  You have withdrawn your question. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, you know at least the position occupied by that colonel at the time in Kigali.  Can you explain that position to the Trial Chamber?
A.	He was the commanding officer of the UNAMIR; that is to say, United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda, the UNAMIR force for the district of Kigali and, in effect, the second in command to General Dallaire.
Q.	Madam, what was the function and role of UNAMIR at that time in Kigali, or Rwanda as a whole?
A.	As specified by its mandate, the UNAMIR force was to assist in the implementation of the Arusha Accords, to enforce the disarmament provisions in that accord having to do with the city of Kigali and to facilitate various other technical aspects of military demobilisation. 
Q.	Madam, since you know the colonel in question, in April 1994, was he still -- in April 1994 -- I'm sorry, in April 1994, was he still in Kigali?
A.	He was in Kigali in April 1994.
Q.	And you arrived in August.  Do you think that what he saw and what he reported on -- how should I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Withdraw your question because the document you've provided does not enable you to put such questions to the witness.  You yourself acknowledged that.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I was not in fact thinking of that question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Registry, can you retrieve the document, please? 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Dr. Alison, we were talking of the events of 1994 and you were stating that you followed the events over the phone and other means.  When you went to the ground, did you carry out any personal verifications which enabled you to assert a number of facts today?
A.	I did.  For example, I visited the site at Nyarubuye and witnessed there the bodies of persons who had been killed.  I visited a number of other locations, Nyamata, Cyahinda church, and other places, Murambi Technical School, and even alongside the roads, was able to witness evidence of extensive killing of civilians.
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, were all these sites visited after August '94?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Can you tell the Court who was the leader of Rwanda in August '94?
A.	At that point there was a government of national unity which had been installed on July 17th, 1994.
Q.	Who was the president of that government?
A.	It was a coalition government in which the RPF played the dominant role.
Q.	In August 1994 was the Rwandan government of 1994 still in Rwanda or were -- had they already been driven away by the RPF?
A.	The former government of Rwanda was no longer inside Rwanda.
Q.	When you talk of coalition government, who were the members of the coalition; which are the parties that came to a agreement to govern?
A.	It was a government comprising a coalition of the RPF, the MDR, the PSD, the PL, and I believe the PDC still at that point. 
Q.	I did not follow you clearly.  Was the MRND a member of that government?
A.	It was not.
Q.	Therefore, in August you arrived when the MRND, which had run the country up to a certain period, had left.  You went to the various sites that you named and you discovered bodies.  To your knowledge and perhaps to edify us, can you tell the Court who the persons who were killed were, the persons whose bodies you saw?
A.	In the sites which I visited, except for two, the victims were apparently Tutsi, and according to the testimony of survivors, Tutsi and Hutu who had been allied with them.  

In two of the sites the victims were largely Hutu, although I believe in one case there was one Tutsi killed, and the -- according to the testimonies, the killers in all except two of those sites, that is, the first groups I mentioned, were predominantly Tutsi.  The assailants were militia, members of the Rwandan Armed Forces and citizens directed by their political authorities. 

In the other two of the sites which I mentioned, according to the testimony of survivors and other witnesses, the assailants were members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  I will now respectfully ask you to give us the names of the sites with respect to these four areas -- or, rather, the identification of the two sites where the majority of those killed were Hutu. 
A.	One site was Mukingi commune, not far from the parish of Gitarama, and the other site, I'm sorry I would have to consult my book to be absolutely sure, but it was a parish also in Gitarama, north of Mukingi commune but south of the Kigali préfecture border.  I'm sorry, the name has escaped me at the moment.  I would have to look at it, but it was also in Gitarama.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, for the two sites that -- whose victims were mainly Tutsi, where were they located?
A.	The sites where the victims were predominantly Tutsi were far more than two and I visited those sites throughout the country in the préfecture of Tumba, in the préfecture of Kibungo, in Kigali-rural, Kigali city, Gitarama, Butare, Gikongoro, Cyangugu, Kibuye, Gisenyi.  I do not recall having visited any such site in Ruhengeri, although I later learned of the existence of some. 
Q.	Madam, in the month of August, were these bodies in a state in which they could easily be identified?
A.	In some cases, yes.  It depended on the circumstances of exposure to the elements and particularly to the presence of packs of dogs because, in many cases, dogs had torn the bodies apart so that they could not be easily identified.
Q.	Did any particular area attract your attention during your visit?
A.	I went first to places where I had friends.  That would have been in parts of Kigali and Butare and Kibungo.
Q.	Talking about Kibungo, what did you discover in that préfecture?
A.	In Kibungo I saw areas of considerable desolation, fields which were not cultivated, houses which were empty, destroyed or partly destroyed, and in some places, a significant number of bodies.
Q.	Did you have any explanations regarding that situation?
A.	My work was to collect information, and I did that.
Q.	One of the witnesses testified before this Court that the RPF was at Kibungo préfecture on 28th of April 1994, and you arrived at the préfecture in August.  It is one of the sites regarding which you testify that apparently the bodies were essentially those of the Tutsi -- were mainly those of the Tutsi.  Do you think that these persons may have been killed by RPF elements or troops?
A.	No.
Q.	In your opinion, who killed them?
A.	Members of the Rwandan Armed Forces, militia members and members of the general population, often under the leadership of political or civilian authorities and often in combination with soldiers, police, communal police, former soldiers and militiamen.
Q.	According to the findings of your research, do you think that a body that is exposed, a lifeless body that is exposed, may continue having the same kind of flesh from August -- rather, from April to August?
A.	Indeed.  It depends, as I said, upon the elements, but I do have photographs of some bodies that were killed perhaps not in April but certainly in May and June, where there was considerable flesh upon the bones still when I photographed them in August.
Q.	Madam, at that time, according to your sources, who was held responsible for those bodies, the bodies that still had flesh on them?
A.	It depended on the location.  As I explained, according to witnesses and survivors, in two of those locations the assailants were soldiers of the RPF, and in other locations the assailants were members of the Rwandan Armed Forces, militia members, members of the population, often under the direction of civilian and military authorities.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to tell Mrs. Des Forges, if you want to take a short break, please indicate that to us. 
THE WITNESS:
So far, so good.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, since I did not quite well know where I was going to, I fell on a document, a summary of a report drawn up by the UN commission for refugees, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  This document is in English, but not in French.  It is dated 10 October 1994, and in this report it seems to be said -- it is in English; I speak only French -- that the RPF allegedly killed people in Kibungo préfecture in the months of May, June, July and August.  Are you aware of such a document,
Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	Dated the 10th of October, you say? 
Q.	Yes, 10 October.  It was presented before the commission on 10 October 1994.  Perhaps it's better that you have the document.  It is in English and my English is not such as I would want to speak.  It is not good enough for the Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 (Not interpreted)
THE WITNESS:
Maître, I had not previously seen this particular document but it's extremely interesting.  It appears to me to be based upon what is generally called the "Gersony report", a document which is said officially not to exist, and this is the fullest transcription on paper that I have seen of what I believe to be the contents of that report.  I have seen that report only in note form, that is, in the notes of an oral presentation, but this appears to conform to my recollection of those notes.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Doctor, in view of the fact that you were a member of many of the United Nations commissions -- at least this is correct -- can we claim before the Trial Chamber that this document is not a forgery?
A.	I have not in fact ever been a member of a United Nations commission.  I work only for non-governmental organizations.  But given my recollection of the notes I have seen, I would say this appears indeed to be an authentic document, based upon what is generally called the "Gersony report".
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I would like this document to be tendered as an exhibit.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you have just heard the application that has been made by the Defence.  Do you have any objections to raise? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, Counsel hasn't led foundation.  I am at a loss as to what use he intends to put the said document.  In short, I object until a sufficient foundation is laid. 
JUDGE REDDY:
This is not a document that was disclosed by the Prosecution to the Defence, is it?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Not at all, Your Honours, but it would appear to have been disclosed by the Defence of Accused Nahimana in the Media case on the 19th of June 2003, which is long after the close of the Prosecution case.  In any event, it's not a document originating from the Office of the Prosecution.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have heard the objection that has been raised by Counsel for the Prosecution.  Could you please respond and tell us as well, if it's not a secret, where you have obtained this document from?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The submissions made by the Prosecutor do not seem relevant to me, which is why I did not immediately stand up to respond.  The document, I believe the Prosecutor has not forgotten, but this refers to sites that are mentioned in my indictment and in the case and they deal with people who died, with bodies the expert witness allegedly saw in August as she was travelling through the area and that she recorded.  These are the same bodies that were produced in the courtroom on a videotape.  This is all part of the same site, and the expert witness has just said, to her knowledge, this document is an authentic report, Madam President.  This is a document from the High Commission for Refugees of the United Nations.  It is not a confidential document and I did not obtain it in any secret manner.  It is just a document that clearly states that with respect to the accusations and some of the affirmations made -- the allegations made against my client and in this Trial Chamber, that above and beyond there were murders, killings, in May, June, July, August, September 1994.  This is what the document refers to, Madam President, and I have never stated that the Prosecutor was the one who disclosed the document to me.  I never said that here in this courtroom. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Counsel, could you please enlighten us a little more?  What is the relevance of this document?  Why should we admit it?  What does it help to prove or disprove?  Could you just give us some idea because you can't just blindly throw a document at us and expect it to be admitted in evidence.  You must demonstrate some relevance.  Could you tell us, please, what the relevance of this particular document is? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  When we began this trial we were shown images of bodies.  This was the first part of the trial.  We saw piles of bodies, and the person who allegedly found these bodies, if you will recall, could not even say exactly when they had gone to that specific site.  In any case, with respect to the Prosecutor, these bodies were being blamed on the Accused and various other persons.  

Now, the expert witness has just told the Trial Chamber that she went to those places in August and that she saw bodies there.  And Defence counsel asked her if there were freshly killed bodies, and she said, "They were bodies that still had flesh on them, and I recorded them."  

And in the document I showed the expert witness, Your Honour, it is mentioned where massacres and killings were committed by RPF soldiers and that is what appears in this document, because on the date the expert witness went to the region, the RPF had already been in the area since April, and so these bodies could not have been those that they were trying to blame on my client, and this is the content of the document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
With your leave, I believe that Witness Alison Des Forges would like to say something at this stage of the proceedings.  
Yes, expert witness.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President, a point of clarification.  If this document is as I suppose based upon the Gersony report, it would deal with areas other than the area referred to by Defence counsel; that is to say it does not deal with Nyarabuye church, which I believe was the site of the photographs that you have already seen, the videos you have already seen, and the site that I myself visited. 

The killings that are referred to here took place generally in other areas and the witnesses were interviewed, many of them outside of the country.  But the notes that I saw, which I believe were the foundation for this document, did not indicate in any case that the data was drawn from Nyarabuye church.  So I would -- regardless of its relevance, and it may be relevant in your judgment, I would simply wish you not to make the decision based upon the idea that this has to do with the bodies at Nyarabuye church because I certainly believe that is not correct.
	(Pages 56 to 66 by Karen Holm) 























	1615H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I was just going to ask you if the site or sites you are referring to, correspond to the site that is mentioned in this document?  Perhaps you could clarify this for us.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, absolutely, Madam President.  The document -  Dr. Des Forges, I don't know if you can turn to page 46, this is handwritten, there is mention of bodies in Rusumo, bodies in the Kagera River, and if the Trial Chamber remembers, these are bodies -- or, photographs that were shown to us here in the courtroom.  These were bodies that were floating in the river; I suppose two bodies on Tafuma (phonetics).  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the title of the document is "Kibungo prefecture" that she mentioned earlier, and mentioned two other locations as well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Des Forges.
THE WITNESS:
I believe Defence counsel is correct in referring to the bodies in the river.  As I recall the information from UNHCR, the original information dates from May 17th, 1994, having to do with the appearance of bodies in the river.  This occasioned comments by UNHCR agents, because it was several weeks after the arrival of the RPF in the area.  But I believe a distinction must be very clearly drawn between the presence of those bodies which were moving down the river and observed by the UNHCR, and the bodies at Nyarubuye.  They were clearly from a different period, and there were also other indicators of difference, for example, in the sites of the genocidal killing that I have visited, it is extremely rare to see a victim tied up.  

And to the best of my recollection, at Nyarubuye, there was not a single person tied up or indications, either in the position of the bones, of the corpses or through the remnants of pieces of rope, as any indication of tying of the victim.  Whereas the bodies cited in the river after the month of May, often had their arms bound behind their back.  And at one of the two sites that I investigated, where RPF killings were alleged to have happened, the persons who buried those bodies told me they all had their arms tied behind their backs.  So I believe there are ways to distinguish, and it is extremely important to do so for the interest of justice and to separate the layers of events so that it is clearly established where responsibility lies.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Dr. Des Forges.  

Madam President, as I am cross-examining the witness, at the same time, I would like to refer Alison Des Forges to page 32649, and it says, "Nyarubuye" clearly at the top and this is the site that you visited.   This is contained in this document.
THE WITNESS:
Could you repeat the page again?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	It's handwritten, at the top of the page 32689, it's written in bold characters at the top of the page, 32689.  These are handwritten numbers, "Rusumo commune, Nyarubuye, RPF".  Can you see those words at the top of the document?
A.	It is true that the word appears, but it would be well to have the translation before commenting on it.  As I read it in English, and perhaps Defence counsel can listen to the French translation, "At Rusumo commune, secteurs, Nyamugari, Gisenyi, Nyarubuye, the RPF comes at 5 o'clock, waiting for villagers to open their doors.  The villagers were caught and taken away to the river by trucks.  No one has returned.  Refugees of the area have seen people being tied together and thrown into the river.  It seems as if guns are only used if somebody tries to escape.  At the crossing point, Kinjongo, refugees have to pay a 100 Rwandan francs per bag of commodity, and so-on and so-forth, has to do with the cost of transporting them across the river".  This, however, has nothing to do with Nyarubuye church.  It says, "People were taken from Nyarubuye secteur towards the river and did not return".  Whether there were or were not killed, whether they were or were not thrown in the river, we do not know.  The testimony from the refugees is that people were tied together and thrown in the river, but those were not the people whose bodies were in the courtyard at Nyarubuye church. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Judge Egorov would like to put a question to the witness. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
You have mentioned that this document didn't exist as official one.  What did you mean?
THE WITNESS:
In late July 1994, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees commissioned a study to determine why refugees had fled from Rwanda and how they could most easily and quickly be brought home.  Three persons executed this study for the UNHCR, Mr. Robert Gersony, G-E-R-S-O-N-Y, his wife whose name I don't know, I presume perhaps Ms. Gersony, but perhaps she has another professional name and Mr. Tony Jackson.  They carried out a study for some six weeks interviewing people inside and outside Rwanda.  

Mr. Gersony began the study with a very high estimation of the RPF army, which he believed to be the best in Africa.  That is to say, he began written out prejudice against the RPF.  His task was not to document RPF abuses, but simply to find out how to bring the refugees home.  After six weeks of study, he and the rest of his team concluded that RPF killings of civilians were, in fact, an important reason why refugees had fled.  He presented this information orally in Rwanda, in Kigali, to members of the Rwandan government and various members of the United Nations.  

To the best of my recollection, the United Nations reacted very strongly.  Mr. Kofi Annan, who was then in Addis Ababa on route to Somalia, was sent to Rwanda to deal with this.  It was regarded as such a serious allegation.  United States government representative who had been in Kigali and gone on to Bujumbura were sent back to Kigali to examine these allegations.  Mr. Gersony made a subsequent oral presentation, I believe, in Geneva, and the notes which I have seen come from one or the other of those oral presentations, the information was regarded as potentially extremely damaging, both to the United Nations and to the Rwandan government, and Mr. Gersony was directed not to write a report and not to ever speak of the results of his work, as were the other members of his commission.  

As far as I know, he has followed this rule.  There was a very short summary, I believe, in the order of three pages, and another in the order of perhaps seven pages that were written at the request of the Special Rapporteur, I believe.  In any case, the Special Rapporteur at some point had possession of a short document, but another point, I know and I have published in my book, a letter which he directed to the UNHCR asking for a copy of the Gersony report, and the response to him from the UNHCR, saying "There is no Gersony report".  Underline.  That is why I was somewhat surprised to see that there was, in fact, a somewhat lenghtier document which does present what I recall as being the conclusions of Mr. Gersony and his colleagues. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you very much.
JUDGE REDDY:
Now, you are satisfied that the document before you is the Gersony report.  Would that be correct?
THE WITNESS:
I am satisfied that this is based upon the notes of Gersony and his colleagues, who actually wrote the report, and whether something has been added to it, I do not know because the notes that I saw were quite sketchy, but I believe it is the essence of this.
JUDGE REDDY:
I would just like to ask the Learned Counsel for the Prosecution, it would seem to me that this document is admissible, but what weight to be attached to it is another issue on which I think we should hear the parties, and what we do with it at the end of the day is another matter.  But, in view of the evidence of this witness, I don't see how we can exclude this evidence -- this particular document altogether.  That's my view at this stage, but I am open to persuasions to the contrary.
MR. KAREGYESA:
While I differ to Your Lordship's wisdom, the Prosecutor has a problem, one, with the authenticity of this document and the allegation made therein.  

As far as we are concerned, it is clear from the expert witness that there is no Gersony report.  So the document before the witness is therefore doubtful provenance.  Now, the mere fact that she -- the witness is able to say some of the allegations made therein, she heard before or seen them in rough notes before, does in no way authenticate that document.  As far as we are concerned, it could have been written by anyone.  It could be from newspapers.  I mean, there are allegations abound the streets.  And is this Chamber, Your Honours, going to admit onto the record all manner of documents?
JUDGE REDDY:
No, this is not an all manner of documents.  This is a document which has received some support from this witness.  It resembles what is called, "The Gersony Report", or at least features of it.  So there is some connection and the witness is able to testify to that effect.  But do you feel comfortable excluding this altogether and exposing the Tribunal and perhaps yourself to the criticism that here was a piece of evidence which was relevant, perhaps marginally relevant and which might be favourable to the Defence, was excluded?  Because our task is to admit all relevant evidence, and what weight we attach to that evidence is another matter.  That's how I would view this particular document.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, there are two issues here.  First of all, there is no Gersony report, so -- and the witness has qualified her identification of the contents of this document.  She doesn't know if something could have been, something could have been deleted.  So, it is the authenticity and provenance of this document is in doubt.  

Now, if counsel through his Defence case, can establish the authenticity of this document, the veracity of the contents, that's a different question.  But this is not the proper witness, Your Honour, through whom such a document would be tendered.  

And finally, Your Honours, I still can't establish the basis for seeking admission onto the record.  This witness has mentioned the places she visited and she referred to death, in two sites in Gitarama allegedly caused by the soldiers of the RPF, and then she goes to mention Tutsi victims in about eight communes which she visited.  Now, on what basis does counsel seek the admission of this document onto the record vis-a-vis the witness's testimony? 
JUDGE REDDY:
Well, because she says, this resembles parts of the Gersony report that she has had.  That's presumably the basis.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Parts of a report does not exist.
JUDGE REDDY:
She goes further, she says, "Well, this sounds like the Gersony Report". 

MR. KAREGYESA:
But she also said, Your Honours, there is no Gersony report, but maybe to save time, the document could be marked for identification and counsel through his Defence witnesses can establish authenticity, we could handle it at that stage.  Most obliged, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
At this stage, it really goes in as a piece of paper.  It doesn't carry any other weight.  It will have to be explained.  It's authenticity will have to be tested, it will be open to criticisms and comments, et cetera, et cetera, and maybe even positive evidence from the Defence before we can seriously look at it, but it seems to me that it's a piece of paper at this stage, it should really go in. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
We have no objection, Your Honours, to having it marked for identification.  

Most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document, we don't know where it comes from.  On the last page, it states that it is the Defence in Nahimana that produced this document.  To who?  We don't know.  We are going to do one thing.  We are going to give a provisional marking -- provisional number, and if later you can establish the authenticity of the document, we will then admit it as evidence, but for the time being, we cannot admit it.  We can give it a provisional number and later on, if you provide us the necessary facts to establish, both its authenticity and its contents, because it's in English, you yourself you don't -- you've admitted you don't read English, you don't know what's in it, and nor do I.  So we will give this document a number and later you will have to provide us with the facts, as requested of you if you want it to be admitted as evidence.  So, DO4 provisionally, D04 provisionally.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
And as the Bench has the document in hand, I should like to draw your attention to what is said at the stub of the document.  It is an ICTR document.  It had been admitted by ICTR.  I think she missed that.  Counsel for Prosecution missed that, but in the end he said he was not -- he did not object.  Of course, he could not object, because it's a Tribunal document.  That was the small comment I wanted to make.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have taken our decision.  You are at liberty to subsequently provide the additional information we have requested.  It is true that there is written here, ICTR Archives, but I would remind you that on the last page, it stipulates that it was a document provided by the Defence in Nahimana.  Now, we need a bit more information for the record before we can admit this document.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Very well, Madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may now continue.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, at this stage if counsel could oblige and avail us copies of the said document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The document will be copied and we will all have copies.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Madam, forgive me, I thought we were only two here, but there has been some interferences.  I think we were talking about August 1994; was it not - is it not?
A.	Have you a question for me?
Q.	No, I am saying, Madam, before this interlude or interruption, we were talking of your trip to Rwanda in August 1994.
A.	We were, in fact, discussing that, but I don't recall there being any question outstanding.  So I am asking for another question.
Q.	Yes, Madam, I am going to ask the question.  Madam, the Trial Chamber has provisionally given this document a number.  That means that it might be admitted or not, but what is interesting is your comments on the document.  My question is: If I were to say that the crimes or murders committed by the RPF; what would you answer?
A.	There were killings of civilians committed by certain soldiers of the RPF, I assume you are speaking of the period April 1994 to July 1994, but later in 1994 as well, that appears to be war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Q.	Can I, in response to your answer, say that your point of view has evolve on
	 this subject?
A.	It is often said that my position and that of Human Right Watch has changed on this issue, but I can assure you that our first letter to the Rwandan Patriotic Front concerning allegations of such crimes is dated May the 11th 1994, and that I wrote a report published in 1994, detailing the evidence from my investigation at the two sites I have discussed this afternoon in Gitarama where such crimes were committed by soldiers of the RPF.  In that connection, I believe my position has been clear from the beginning, there is, of course, no equivalence in crime between genocide and war crimes and crimes against humanity, but there is equivalence in the rights of victims to justice regardless of the crime committed.
Q.	Madam, at the hearing of the 22nd of May 1997 in the Prosecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu, you stated the following, in answer to Akayesu's Defence counsel's question, page 77, hearing of 22nd of May, you said, "There have been charges made by certain diplomats of the Rwandan government and certain groups supported by the Rwandan government, accusations that the RPF slaughtered up to an enormous number of people.  I heard a figure of 40,000 and one even perhaps a 100,000 of Hutu at the time of the attack."  Page 78, "We made a special effort to investigate those accusations and we have never found any proof thereof, and I would tell you that we investigated not only RPF zone, but also in the government controlled areas in the displaced persons camp, where the Hutu had fled from the RPF advance, and we never found any details or facts that would make it possible to say that the RPF had killed or massacred".  This is what you stated and this is April 1997 in Akayesu, what is your version today, Madam?
A.	If I recall correctly, I was speaking in that passage of accusations made in February 1993, concerning supposed massive killings of 40,000 or perhaps even 100,000 people during the RPF advance that began on February the 8th.  My position on that is unchanged.  We have never found any evidence whatsoever to substantiate such accusations.  It is extremely important in questions of this gravity to be precise about place and date in order to assure that those responsible are brought to justice.

MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, madam.  Except that one of the Judges of the Bench, Judge Aspegren, after the answer you have just given, and the answer I read out, asked the following question: "Madam, what do you mean by "we" -- what do you mean by "we had tried to fight?" And you answered:  "When I speak of 'us' it depends on when."  And the Judge continues: "And now, one minute ago, I was speaking of the International Investigation Commission, sponsored by Human Rights -- the International Federation of Human Rights --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, he is going too fast.  I am sorry, I missed all that, it was much too fast.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, if you could oblige, if counsel gave us the page and lines, we can display the pages that he is reading on the screens for the benefit of everyone in this courtroom.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Page 79, lines 7 and 8.
THE WITNESS:
I would say that the second passage you have read in which I specify that the "we" in my declaration was the International Commission of Inquiry, that substantiates my answer to your question, because that commission existed and investigated in the early months of 1993.  It had nothing to do with the months of 1994.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Thank you, madam.  In 1994, was it the commission who went into the field or did you go alone, personally?
A.	At that time I was working alone in my capacity as researcher for Human Rights Watch.
Q.	I am sorry, madam, are you speaking of August l994?
A.	I was working and accompanied by other professionals at that time, but I was serving as a researcher for Human Rights Watch.
Q.	Madam, in August l994, you went --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I think that we -- we were told that we show page 79 on the screen, so we don't know what is happening.  Is there a problem with the technicians?  Is there a problem in the technicians' booth?
MR. KAREGYESA:
It would appear they have a problem.  There it is now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, I think the problem is solved. 

MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Sorry about the microphone.

Could counsel for the Prosecution help us to have projected page 87, as he appears to be on good terms with the technicians.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat, please?  I think there was a problem with the English.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
After page 79, madam, I was asking if the technician could show us page 87.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that the page just projected now?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, absolutely.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	You said the following in answer to the Defence counsel's question: "We found that the people apparently guilty of those violations were not sanctioned.  We did not find the proof of massacres as such, as they had been reported by RPF adversaries".
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The last sentence should be: "We have found no proof of massacres such as has been described by adversaries of the RPF".
THE WITNESS:
So, what is the question, Counsel?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I wanted to ask Dr. Des Forges whether that answer is that of a neutral researcher or a partisan researcher, because you speak of RPF adversaries.
THE WITNESS:
It is not sufficient -- the passage displayed is not sufficient for me to see to what the question the response referred.  I will have to see several pages, and I am afraid I have great difficulty reading this from the screen, but I would be surprised, since I saw the start of the next paragraph refers to tens of thousands of Tutsis killed in Butare, I wonder exactly what this passage is referring to, and I really cannot tell you on the basis of the sentences you read to me.  I would have to see the context.

Do you have the document there on paper?  Even in French would be fine.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Absolutely.  The question that was put to you is on page 85.  
A.	Again, this exchange refers exactly to the same period; that is to say, it refers to the work done by the international commission, from having -- dealing with killings up to and through 1993.  It is not relevant for 1994.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  But the answer was given in 1997.
A.	If you are attempting to give a sincere and honest reading to a document, you must take an entire passage into consideration and not extract a sentence or two in an attempt to make your point.  If I am being questioned about 1993, regardless of whether it is 1997 or 2003, my response, obviously, has to do with 1993.
Q.	Maybe your answer concerns 1993, but that is not the point at issue.  You said, "I have never - I never had any proof of massacres by the RPF", and in the same document you testified before the Tribunal -- this document was provided to me by the Prosecutor.
A.	That is out of order.  I really refuse to be treated as an idiot.  I am sorry, but this simply incorrect.  You are distorting the meaning of the passage completely.  I was asked to comment on allegations in 1993 of massive killings, and my answer refers to that event.  I said:  "We did not find evidence of massive killings in 1993."  There is nothing partisan about it.
Q.	Madam, I am sorry if I offended you.  I am merely cross-examining you, and the Trial Chamber knows that I was not there in 1997, nor was my client, and therefore I am cross-examining you on what I read.  And if I misread, then forgive me, because it is those who told me to read this paragraph for your attention.  I am only reading literally what I have under my eyes, and in order to justify why you did not have proof of the massacres by the RPF, you went on, on page 88, by saying --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please continue slowly, and I point out to you that the witness said that she was speaking of events in 1993, and not events in l994.  I think she made that quite clear before.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I am not dating these events as far is I am concerned.  I am merely reading the answers given on the 22nd of May 1997 before the ICTR Trial Chamber.  I did not give my dates.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So ask your question clearly, then, for the witness to be able to follow you.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, it looks from my angle, it looks as though it is 17:00 hours, 5:00 p.m.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is indeed 5 p.m., not only from you angle.  So I think you have finished with these series of questions and we can, therefore, adjourn now until tomorrow morning.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And as you told us, you will have finished, at the latest, by 10:00 a.m.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam, as you had not given a decision, I said at about 10:00 a.m., and I would beg the Bench to take account in the interruptions and delays in the time allotted me for cross-examination by counsel for the Prosecution.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  Thank you.  The hearing stands adjourned until tomorrow morning.
(Court adjourned at 1700H)
