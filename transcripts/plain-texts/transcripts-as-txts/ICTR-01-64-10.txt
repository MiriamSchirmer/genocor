MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing is now under way.  

Counsel Kouengoua, are you ready to continue your cross-examination?  

Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are still under oath, and Counsel Kouengoua will continue the cross-examination.

Good morning, Madam President, Your Lordships, the Counsel for the Prosecution, the court stenographers and the interpreters.

Q.	Good morning, Witness TAW.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, forgive me, the questions you want to put, we remind you that this witness -- as regards this witness, we have allowed to be heard in closed session.  Therefore, we'll continue in closed session.

1053H
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I have two applications to make this morning.  The first application, the Prosecutor is seeking leave of the Chamber to drop Witness TAF from its list -- its witness list.  Witness TAF was on the list for this week and ought to have appeared today.  So that is the first application we are making, at least to have her removed from the list so that we can dispense with the attendance.  Now, that would leave us, Your Honours with Witness TAE, who was listed to testify this week.

Now, I am reliably informed, Your Honours, that Witness TAE is currently traumatised by her recollection of the events.  She is not in a position to appear before Your Lordships today.  And in light of this information I have, Your Honours, I am applying for an adjournment until tomorrow morning, hoping that the witness will have recovered.  So our application, Your Honours, is that, rather than compel her to appear today when she is not in the proper frame of mind, if you oblige, allow us to lead her evidence and complete it tomorrow morning.  She is a short witness, it shouldn't take an hour to dispose of her evidence tomorrow morning, if she able to do so.  I am most obliged, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Counsel Kouengoua, would you like to make a comment?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I believe that it was either yesterday morning, or the day  before yesterday, I made a comment and spoke about the traumatism which Witnesses TAF and TAE have had to bear.  Trauma can happen, but I would never request -- ask enough - speak  enough about Witness TAP, who was traumatised, hospitalised and who still came to testify and gave evidence.  That caused enough problems.  Madam President, I would have liked them to tell the Trial Chamber whether the witness is traumatised as a result of the events occurring in 1994, or is traumatised because she has to come and testify before the Trial Chamber.  These are Prosecution witnesses.  My comments only apply to the presence before the bar.  All the incidents have already taken place.  However, Madam President, in order to avoid having to speak on several occasions, the Prosecutor stated -- gave us documents in Kinyarwanda on Monday and promised us that we would receive translations yesterday morning.  We did not receive them and I would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Trial Chamber that these were confessions of Witness TBK, for which he was examined and 
cross-examined, I would like the Trial Chamber to ask the Prosecutor if he is going to give us the said documents, because both the Defence and the Bench received only the Kinyarwanda version, and the witness told the Trial Chamber, in his confessions, that he had given the names of those with whom he had participated including - particularly, the Accused.  I don't know if we can have this confession now.  If that is not the case, Madam President, because this witness will not come back to testify before the Trial Chamber, he is not here, he is in Rwanda, and I would respectfully request that the Trial Chamber keep the Kinyarwanda version, which was written in the witness's hand, as being a Prosecution exhibit, because he didn't ask that the document be tendered.  He just asked the Trial Chamber to wait for the English and French versions.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Mr. Prosecutor, please.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Two points, Your Honour  -- Your Honours.  The first relates to Witness TAE, and I just wish to bring it to the attention of Your Lordships that the witness is traumatised by having to recollect very painful events that she lived through nine years ago in 1994, events that she had put behind her in order to try and lead her life.  This process involves having such a victim - survivor, recounting minute details, memories she had tried to put behind her, and it does cause some distress.  It ought to be brought to your attention, Your Honours, that this Tribunal, unlike the sister Tribunal in the Hague, does not have psychotherapists or counsellors to help us cope with symptoms by having such witnesses who have to recollect painful memories.  So it is counsel, who are not trained therapists, who are trying to cope.  I hope you bear with the Prosecutor in this regard.

Now, concerning the Kinyarwanda documents, Your Honours, nowhere on the record did I promise that I would have them translated.  In fact, I am on record asking Your Honours to direct registry to have them translated urgently for the benefit of this Chamber, and I am not aware whether indeed registry took this upon themselves.  The Prosecutor does not have translation facilities, Your Honours.  We try, with limited physical and human resources, to extend courtesies, but they should not be taken for granted.   Now, since the Accused's language is Kinyarwanda, maybe he could help his counsel in that regard if the registry has not translated these documents.

We did our best to disclose them as soon as we got them.  The function of translating documents is the function of the registry, and I am on record asking this Trial Chamber to direct registry to have them urgently translated.  I am not aware whether the registry has done so.

Most obliged, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
Counsel, but these documents were not used at all of cross-examination; am I right?  They were not used at all.
MR. KAREGYESA:
They weren't used at all, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
Not even mentioned.  So it is really academic now, isn't it?  Unless there is an application to recall.
MR. KAREGYESA:
And we did indicate on the occasion, Your Honours, that we would concede to such an application if counsel felt there was need to recall these witnesses to re-cross-examine them on the basis of those statements.  We couldn't use those statements as Prosecution exhibits because these are prior consistency.  If the Defence thinks otherwise, they are at liberty to seek -- to have them called before they are recalled to Rwanda.  Most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is correct, we had not admitted the documents, the documents were in Kinyarwanda, and we did not feel it was necessary to admit the documents, and we did not give the order to the registry to translate those documents at the present time.  It is up to the parties to determine whether they would like to tender the documents.  It is up to you, the Prosecutor, you, Counsel, to tell us whether you need the document, and if the document should be translated, because if that is the case, then I will ask the registry, if they are present -- I will ask the registry to translate the document, or if the party who is tendering the document should ask for its translation.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Madam President, the principle, which has been established between the registry and the office of the Prosecutor, is that documents coming from the Office of the Prosecutor, indictments and witness statements are supposed to be translated -- are supposed to be sent to the language section by the Office of the Prosecutor, eventually file the translation version with the registry.  The registry is not supposed to send these documents on behalf of the Office of the Prosecutor for translation.

Thank you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
If I may clarify, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to thank the registry.

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed.  We are listening.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I just wish to clarify that, indeed, in the ordinary course of business, statements recorded by the Office of the Prosecutor or intended - otherwise, intended for use in the trial, ordinarily would have gone for translation years ago.  This arose in the context of an ongoing trial.  The Chamber ordered that if we have come across any documents, we disclose them to the Defence in relation, of course, to a category of witnesses.

We got these documents in the course -- in the middle of the testimony of these witnesses, and we were complying with your order and disclose them.  Now, we didn't intend to use these statements at all, because as far as the Prosecutor is concerned, these are prior consistency statements.  Now, if Defence intends, you know, to use them, Defence can then have them translated.  But because we were in the middle of trial, I just asked Your Honours to direct the registry to have them translated. It's not uncommon, Your Honours, for this Chamber to direct such documents that arise in the course of trial to be urgently translated.  I am most obliged, Your Honours.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Madam President, Your Honours, the registry is fully aware that the Chamber did not direct the registry to have the document translated.  And the fact also that we are in the course of the proceedings does not shift the burden of having these documents being sent to the language section by the Prosecutor onto the registry.  Thank you.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honour, what the Defence is saying -- stating - maintaining, and which is not very contrary to the truth, is that during cross-examination of Witness TBK, even during his examination-in-chief, we asked if he mentioned the name of the Accused and all of those who participated in the crime in his confessions, he recognised publicly here that the document was not tendered because it was in Kinyarwanda, and because we were waiting for the French version.  This is what the witness said.  I said that if we look at the transcript; we can see that this witness -- this document was used here, and, in fact, not only by the witness (sic), but also by the witness so that we put the questions to him.

I wish to apologies to the interpreter for the speed of my delivery.

Yes, Madam President, I was saying that we cross-examine the witness with respect to this document.  The name of the document is "Confession made before the Gacaca committee."  I don't have the documents in my notes available right here to me, but I believe that the Judge even asked him the question about his confession, and put a question to him on that point with respect for the Gacaca from that point, and, Madam President, the document is the basis on which we put the question to the witness, and the basis of answers he gave to us.  And by giving these answers, the witness was trying to tell the Chamber that he mentioned the name of the Accused as the person who was already examined before he even appeared to testify.  So now we cannot say if the
Trial Chamber wishes to use the document; the document was mentioned to the witness, produced by the Prosecutor, and all of the parties used the document.  I, therefore, believe, Madam President, that from this point on the document should be tendered into the record.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the witness has two statements: there is a statement made to the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor, in which he mentions the Accused, and there is the document disclosed in Kinyarwanda.  We have no objection to admit all the documents into evidence.
JUDGE REDDY:
That might be the solution, Defence Counsel, that the statement be translated and be tendered in evidence as part of your exhibits.  And really, there is no need to recall that witness; the statements speak for themselves.  So we can read them and see what is there.  You are happy with that, Counsel?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Your Lordship, I never asked for the witness to be recalled.  I only said that he testified on the basis of that document; his answers were on the basis of that document, and that document is entitled, "Confession made in Rwanda before the Gacaca jurisdiction."  Both the Defence and the Prosecution, even the Judges, asked him questions about it.  So there is no other way for the document to be tendered in evidence.  And, of course, it will be appropriate for it to be translated.
JUDGE REDDY:
The onus of putting the document in evidence was on you, and you didn't do it, and that is part of the problem.  If there is something favourable in a document to your case -- for your defence, then it is up to you to put it in.  Anyway, we now agree that it will be put into evidence, and I think that should end the argument; agreed?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Lordship.  I didn't do it for the simple reason that the document was not in my hands.  I did not have the document.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  The Defence accepts to tender the document.  Have I correctly understood?  It is up to the Defence to tender the document in evidence, and you will arrange with the registry, for the  document to be translated into French and English for it to be admitted.  We cannot accept the Kinyarwanda version.

You have accepted this solution -- proposal made to you by Judge Reddy?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
When you were speaking, Madam, I had problems with my headset.  I should like to clarify my thoughts.  I said that the Defence wishes for the document to be tendered.  Now, we don't have it, and I think that a document tendered in the course of the trial -- it must be done by the registry or any one else who brought the document.  The promise -- I would remind you that a promise was made yesterday.  If we go back to the transcript, I am sure we will see it.  I don't have the document with me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You did not receive the document in Kinyarwanda?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, I have it in Kinyarwanda, but I don't know what to do with it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is what we all have, Counsel.  None of us has the document in English.  That is what I am telling you.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Agreed, Madam President.  In that case, Madam President, I hope that the registry will kindly undertake the translation.  I don't know who is going to translate the document, because when the registry reminded the Prosecutor the process for translation, there was no objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you in a position, Registry, to undertake the translation of this document?
MR. HOMETOWU:
We are very willing to -- at least, under special circumstances, the registry will be very willing to have it translated.  Thank you.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Madam President, and the registry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. KAREGYESA:
It may be appropriate for the documents, i.e. the statement of TBK to the Office of Prosecutor, and his statement before the Rwandan authorities, which is in Kinyarwanda, to be entered on the record now and marked -- the Kinyarwanda  document, of course, will carry the option that it ought to be translated, and a certified translation would subsequently be attached to the exhibit that has been admitted onto the record.  The document ought to be given numbers now and admitted onto the record, marked and numbered, and then translation would be routine which can always follow the fact.  

Much obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, if the parties agree to that, the Bench has no problem.  We can admit it onto the record and number it.  It will be what -- P14?  Counsel for Defence, is it P or D?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I am sorry, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who is tendering this document; the Prosecution or the Defence?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, we did not rely on the document.  You see, there are two documents in issue here, and it is the Defence at that, who are interested in having it placed onto the record, and we submit that these documents, the Kinyarwanda document and the English document, i.e, the statement of TBK to OTP investigators, should bear Defence exhibit numbers and not the Prosecution exhibit numbers.  
Much obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I have well understood.  So I now turn to the Defence.  You are tendering this in evidence of the Defence?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
This document that we have only in Kinyarwanda, absolutely, but not the statement in English -- the confession.  This is the only document I am referring to -- TBK's confession.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Madam President, I had made it clear in response to questions from Judge Reddy, that we would concede to counsel's application on condition that both statements are admitted onto the record.  Now, if he refuses to tender the second statement, then there are justifiable issues and we are ready to bring Witness TBK back for cross-examination and re-examination on both these documents.
JUDGE REDDY:
Counsel, my memory is that you cross-examined on both those documents - or, rather, you 
cross-examined on the statement that was made to the Prosecutor also; did you not?  You 
cross-examined the witness on the statement that he had made to the Prosecutors.  So it would seem to me that it's in your interest, because I think you did point to some minor discrepancies.  It is in your interest, is it not, to have both documents tendered as Defence exhibits instead of prolonging this debate, in fact, quite unnecessary debate, why don't you put both in?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Your Lordship, I am very embarrassed because I have the preliminary investigation in French, which was disclosed to me -- what the witness said to the investigators.  Now, I have another document, which is in Kinyarwanda.  If those are the two documents while the former one is already there, it is already on the record since you have it.  The only document we are talking about now is the Kinyarwanda confession.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But are you prepared to tender it in evidence?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So Counsel Kouengoua, you are tendering the document in Kinyarwanda?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
That is correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document in Kinyarwanda, that is the document you are entering as a Defence exhibit?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, the document in question, Madam, is dated the 23rd November 2000.  It is in Kinyarwanda and concerns the confession made by TBK.  Madam President, I -- you must understand that I said TBK, because we are in open session and I can't mention the name.  I think everybody knows whom we are referring to -- pseudonym TBK, and we are requesting that it be tendered as Exhibit D01.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
DO1?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
DO1, yes, forgive me, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The document is tendered in evidence as Defence exhibit, and numbered D1 or DO1 - it's D1?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President.  Thank you.
(Defence Exhibit No. D01 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we have solved that problem -- sorted out that problem.  Now, we come to the Prosecution's applications, the application to withdraw Witness TAF.  So, there is no objection to that?   So we authorise the Prosecutor to withdraw Witness TAF.  There is also an application to adjourn until tomorrow to hear Witness TAE who is presently -- I think it is a lady, isn't it?  She is presently unwell.  So, we will hear that person tomorrow.  The Prosecution tells us it won't be long, and hopefully we can finish hearing the witnesses we had planned this week tomorrow by late morning.  Very well.  So, Counsel for the Prosecution, you wanted to say something?
MR. KAREGYESA:
I am most obliged, Your Honours.  I just wish to note that the statement made by Witness TBK to investigators of the Office of Prosecutors in May 2003, has not been entered onto the record for Defence, and I am moving the Chamber to admit that document onto the record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Defence.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, I don't know if this is a new application.  In any case, we have not asked for any other document than the one we talked of, should be tendered by us.  And, Madam, I don't believe any one else can tender it in, in the presence of things, if the nature of the document is such as the counsel for the Prosecution has said.  What I have tendered is the confession.  Now, the document referred to now by the Prosecution was disclosed under Rule 66.  So, I don't know why we are now being asked to tender it.  I don't know what it is, as evidence, or as an item of procedure?  But, in any case, I have not applied to enter it.  We do not think the Trial Chamber should allow this application, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour, I did mention that admission of one document will bring justifiable issues, and in order to have this matter disposed of once and for all, if my prayer to have this document admitted into evidence is denied, I apply, in the alternative, to be allowed to bring the witness tomorrow morning for re-examination following the event of admitting a document onto the record in his absence.  I am much obliged, Your Honours.
JUDGE REDDY:
What is the purpose of this -- why do you want it to be exhibited,  because the content of that statement, at least, as far as I am concerned, is not evidence?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Not at all, Your Honours.  Basically, what was happening by admission of the Defence exhibit for the record subsequent to my waiving my right to re-examine, because he has basically opened his 
cross-examination, and I am entitled by reason of opening his cross-examination to re-examine.  Now, I conceded to that document -- I conceded to that document only on condition that both statements of the witness, one to the Rwandan authorities, and one to the OTP, be admitted onto the record, because the witness is not here to clarify on the contents of these documents which counsel has placed in issue.
JUDGE REDDY:
So, is there something in the pretrial statement made to the Prosecutor's Office which will explain the contents of the confession?  That would be the only purpose of putting that statement in.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Yes, Your Honour, there is.  And, in ordinary practice, Your Honour, the witness would have been the best party to do the clarification.  Now, in the absence of the witness, his statement should go onto the record, because the statements are recorded by different authorities, pursuing different inquiries.  The statement admitted on the record in Kinyarwanda relates to the witness' own criminal involvement; it does not relate to any other person.  The statement made to the Office of Prosecutor is in relation to the current indictment against the Accused.  So, what you have is a lopsided view, the thing that happened, if counsel had cross-examined the witness and put propositions to him, based on the  Kinyarwanda statement, but he didn't, understandably, because he didn't have it.  It was produced in court that day, and when I was introducing that statement with others, I said we would be happy if, you know -- to concede to an application to have the witness on record so that they are properly 
cross-examined on these documents.  We acknowledged the late disclosure was for reasons beyond our control.
JUDGE REDDY:
 Yes, well, perhaps the presiding judge -- the status of all these statements, you know, the brief, your brief -- you will have filed all the statements of all the witnesses that you know as part of your brief?

MR. KAREGYESA:
We have, Your Honours, but Your Honours aren't allowed to take into consideration  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, if you could wait for a moment.  We did not have an interpretation of the Judge's question.
JUDGE REDDY:
The question was:  What is the status of all these statements that have been put in by the Prosecution, as part of its brief?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, it is a rather odd and unusual practice arising from the conference here of civil, common law and other jurisdictions.  These statements are not depositions.  They are not sworn statements.  These are statements recorded by investigators, professional investigators, lay investigators, they are a guide to the Prosecutor in leading witness evidence.  Now, my understanding five years ago is that they are disclosed, of course, as a matter of routine to the Defence under 
Rule 66, but a practice evolved to disclose them to the Chamber to enable the Chamber assess whether it was necessary to call all these witnesses or whether the parties could cut the witness list.  They are not meant for the Chamber to use and take into consideration, when the Chamber is deliberating, because they are not properly on record.  They are not evidence; they are not exhibits.  The party wishing to use the statement either reads the entire statement, or a portion on the statement onto the record, or tender it in the ordinary course of impeaching the witness, based on the credit of the witness based on a prior statement.  So, the statement that you have on file, Your Honours, are not evidence, and in the stricter sense they shouldn't be taken into consideration during your deliberations and that is why witnesses come here to testify.  They testify on oath and you can't go beyond what a witness has said.

If I may refer Your Honours to Rule 73(bis) and I quote:  "The Trial Chamber or a Judge may order the Prosecutor to provide the Trial Chamber with copies of written statements of each witness whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify, and this relates to paragraph (D), where the Trial Chamber, or the designated Judge may order the Prosecutor to reduce the number of witnesses if it considers that the number of witnesses are being called to the same facts.  So, it is against this background that the witnesses are availed to the Chamber and for the Chamber to apply their rights to assess whether the Prosecutor ought to call all the witnesses, or whether the Prosecutor should be ordered to cut its list.  But stricter sense is that no evidence ought to be considered, unless it is placed onto the record through the testimony of the witness.

Most obliged.  I hope I have answered your questions, Your Honour.

JUDGE REDDY:
So, presumably, under that Rule, we can say to you, and say to the Defence, that we would like that statement be placed onto the record so that we can weigh up the contention against the content of that statement.  Is that covered by the Rule that you have just read?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Not this Rule, Your Honour, but under Rule 89, you are at liberty to admit it, you know, onto the record -- you know, as an exhibit, so that you can now openly consider it during deliberations on this specific issue.

And, Your Honours, under Rule 98, may order either party to produce additional evidence, it may also summon witnesses and order their attendance.  So if this is read with 89, Your Honours, are at liberty to admit this document onto the record.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I just heard the additional submissions made by Counsel for the Prosecution.  I would like to come back to what he said at the beginning.  At the beginning he said, 
"Madam President, if you dismiss my motion, I will re-examine the witness anew, because the statement was filed in the absence of the witness."  In this regard, the practice here, according to the Prosecution, is:  "that is the practice," according to the Prosecution.  My answer is simply as follow: that documents are tendered with regard to the trial before this Chamber under strict control of the Judges of the Trial Chamber.  The witness is not a judge of the document to be tendered into evidence.  That is one.  Secondly, we have not tendered into evidence any document in the absence of the witness.  The Prosecution brought a document at a time when the witness was there, and he promised to give us the French and English version the following day; that is, yesterday.  Yesterday, he did not mention the document or confession.  This morning he didn't mention it either, and therefore reminded -- brought to the attention of the Trial Chamber at this point in time, the documents -- the confessions and so on, this document is admitted as D01.  The Prosecutor says that he can re-examine the Prosecution witness anew.  I thought that the same Prosecutor had just said that if Defence want to hear him he could call the witness.  But, Madam President, I do not know whether this is the past practice of the last five years; you call the witness, you allow the witness to go and you call the witness again. I think if there is a Defence witness who comes and the Prosecutor wants to 
cross-examine that witness again, that witness can be re-called.  But the Prosecution cannot call the witness; lead the witness in evidence; the witness is cross-examined; re-examined; the witness leaves, and then you say the motion is dismissed; the witness will be called again.  The witness (sic) at Rule 72(C); "If the Trial Chamber or the designated judge is of the opinion that an excessive number of witnesses are being called to prove the same facts, the Prosecutor can be asked to reduce the number of witnesses.  I thought it was at the request of TAE that this Rule could be applied.  The Prosecutor answers the Judge by saying, "The statements are the means of evidence; statements are not the means of evidence, statements are not exhibits on the basis of which a conviction can be made.  Madam President, you cannot, therefore, be asked to admit them.  This is what the Prosecutor said; not me.  This is what the Prosecutor said when he answered the Honourable Judge's question.  So, Rule 89 cited by the Prosecutor -- Rule 89 paragraph C thereof, Rule 89 paragraph C provides as follows:  "A Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value."  This Rule should have been considered by the Defence or the Trial Chamber if it had been cited.  But the Prosecutor in answer to the question of the Honourable Judge said - well, the Judge asked him, "What is the probative value from the preliminary reports that you filed?" The Prosecutor answered that; "They do not have any probative value, they are not evidence, nor evidence upon which a conviction can be made."  I think this answer given by the Judge can be remembered by everyone.  At this point in time the Chamber will agree that the Prosecutor has not adduced any argument for the admission of witness statements which he tendered to support this indictment, and, therefore, the Prosecutor cannot have this admitted as an exhibit.

Madam President, to go even further, we are going towards the last witness for the Prosecution,  What does the Prosecution think of the preliminary report of the other witnesses we hear since the 28th of July?  Is he going to come back to tender them into evidence, if he hasn't tendered them into evidence so far, it is because, in spite of the practice, that is not done; those documents are not tendered into evidence.

I thank you.
JUDGE REDDY:
There are two people in this Court who understand Kinyarwanda, one was the witness who was giving evidence, TKB, and the other was your client.  And those documents were given to you; presumably, you showed them to your client and took instructions on them.  But I was very surprised when you rose to cross-examine TKB, you didn't put a single question to him on that document, and you have now introduced that document into evidence.  So, isn't the Prosecution entitled to clarify the contents of that statement -- of that confession by producing the Prosecutor's statement?  That is what the argument is, on that side, and this predicament is entirely your creation.  If you had used -- you didn't even show the document to the witness while he was giving evidence.  You didn't even get him to identify his signature, absolutely, nothing.  And now you are objecting to them producing their statement.  I find it very strange coming thus from counsel appearing at this level.

MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  My cross-examination, Your Honours, without contradicting what you said, was based on this document.  Not only did I ask for the dates of the confessions, I also asked him if he had given the names of those with whose help he had committed crimes in 1994 in Rwanda.  He answered and said -- in fact, he even mentioned the names of certain persons, which names had to be in his confession, and which names he cited in his confessions.  Your Honour, when these documents arrived, the procedure used by the Prosecutor through the registry was to disclose them to you and give me a copy.  The Prosecutor never gave me the opportunity to examine them.   He simultaneously said that they were in Kinyarwanda and he promised the English and French versions the following day.  Your Honours, do not forget that this witness was not questioned the same day and at the same time.  And I am saying that I questioned him on the basis the -- his confessions.  The answers to my questions are contained in the draft.  I am not the one creating the predicament.  The Prosecutor doesn't object to my tendering these documents into evidence.  What the Prosecutor is requesting the Trial Chamber is that the statements given to the investigators on the 13th and 14th should be tendered into evidence, and that is the bottleneck, that is the problem arising.  Is it the practice that these documents are tendered into evidence as such?  The answer was given by the Prosecutor.  In answering you, the Prosecutor said "this is not" - "these are not exhibits or evidence.  These statements enable the Chamber to be informed on what transpired."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you are just repeating yourself.  We are going to continue -- from all that has been said here, we are going to deliberate on this tomorrow -- rather, tomorrow, we will tell you the ruling of the
Trial Chamber concerning these exhibits.  As I said earlier on, we will not be sitting this afternoon, we will resume proceedings tomorrow, and at 8:45, and at that time you will have the ruling -- the decision of the Trial Chamber.

We thank you all.
(Court adjourned at 1205H)
