         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the registry introduce the matter coming before

         4        the Trial Chamber this morning, please.

         5   MR. KIYEYEU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 

         6        the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed 

         7        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding.  Judge Winston 

         8        Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, 

         9        is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday, the 

        10        18th of September 2002, for the continuation of the 

        11        Defence case, when Defence Counsel, Mr. Hinds, will 

        12        continue the examine-in-chief of Witness JK 27, DW3, in 

        13        the matter of the Prosecutor vs. Juvénal Kajelijeli, 

        14        Case No. ICTR 98-44A-T.  Thank you, Mr. President.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  May we have the appearance of the 

        16        parties, starting with the Prosecution, if we may, 

        17        please, for the record.

        18   MR. FLEMING:  My name is Ken Fleming, senior trial attorney, 

        19        I appear with Ms. Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial attorney.  Thank 

        20        you.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Can we have the appearance of the 

        22        Defence, please?

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Good morning, Your Honour.  Lennox Hinds 

        24        representing the accused Kajelijeli assisted by 

        25        Ms. Juliette Chinaud, assistant, and interpreter, 

        26        Mr. Emilien Dusabe.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, learned counsel.  Witness JK 27,  

        28        the Trial Chamber reminds you of the solemn declaration 

        29        you made yesterday and that you will continue your 

        30        evidence today on that same solemn declaration.

         1   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  His microphone is not linked.

         2        MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  We will repeat.

         3   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  No, he has heard.  He has heard, 

         4        yes, sir.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  Professor Hinds.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, Your Honour.  I think, Your Honour, we 

         7        were in closed session.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, you are right, we were in closed session 

         9        yesterday.  We will go back to closed session to enable 

        10        counsel to raise questions which may have a bearing on 

        11        the identity of the witness.  Registry, can you see that 

        12        is done?

        13   MR. KIYEYEYU:   Yes, My Lord, technically we are ready but we 

        14        are waiting for the evacuation of the general gallery.  

        15        Now we are ready, My Lord.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Your next witness, Mr. Hinds? 

         2   THE WITNESS: Mr. President, can he just shake hands with this 

         3        Kajelijeli?

         4   THE PRESIDENT: You followed -- you can address this to the 

         5        registry and witness protection unit and they may 

         6        arrangements for that, but it cannot be done here in 

         7        court.  It is a procedure.

         8   THE WITNESS: Mr. President, it is that just tomorrow evening 

         9        I will take my flight ******, so I would not have 

        10        the opportunity to follow the procedure in person.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  The registry can see whether that is possible 

        12        to be done immediately after this.  We are going to take 

        13        a break shortly and, Registry, see whether that is 

        14        possible.

        15   MR. KIYEYEU: My Lords, we shall do so, but I think it is good 

        16        to hear from the Prosecutor because apparently it may be 

        17        a problem.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: These are matters which can be arranged.  We 

        19        worked out with the normal procedure that can be 

        20        obtained.

        21   MR. KIYEYEU: We shall do so, My Lord.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  Professor Hinds, your next witness, DW4, who 

        23        will that be?

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: That would be LMR1. Can you excuse the 

        25        witness?

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, can the witness leave, please, and they 

        27        will see what can be done.  Okay.  All right.  Okay, 

        28        Professor Hinds, Learned Counsel?  LMR1, is she here 

        29        now?  

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: LMR1, yes, Your Honour, the procedures we

         1        have used with Victim and Witness Protection is that we 

         2        have two witnesses here at all times, and so, therefore, 

         3        as soon as one is completed we at least have another 

         4        one.  They have told me that is the procedure, and that 

         5        is what we have followed.  So that witness is here 

         6        today, but before we even deal with the witness, there 

         7        is a preliminary matter that I would like the Court to 

         8        be aware of.  And I am making an oral application for an 

         9        order with respect to this particular witness.  As the 

        10        Court is aware, the Prosecutor filed a motion to strike 

        11        out Defence witnesses and the sum and substance of that 

        12        argument was reiterated by Mr. Fleming just before we 

        13        began putting any witnesses on.  

        14        

        15        In our reply to that particular motion, we indicated 

        16        that the Prosecutor had in fact tape recorded three 

        17        witnesses, including LMR1, witness who is now being 

        18        called to the stand.  We requested transcripts; we 

        19        requested a copy, quite frankly, of the tape we thought 

        20        we are entitled to.  It was our witness that they 

        21        tape-recorded.  I wasn't present, quite frankly, when 

        22        this was done; otherwise we would not be here dealing 

        23        with this issue in this way.  But nevertheless, the 

        24        witness was tape recorded.  We did not get a copy of the 

        25        tapes, we didn't get the transcripts.  We requested 

        26        copies and we were refused, in a sense, as we sit here 

        27        today, we did not have a copy of either the tape or the 

        28        transcript of the tape. 

        29        

        30        Now the Prosecutor in the response, in our position to

         1        our reply, and I am quoting now at page 2 of their 

         2        response, paragraph 1:  Prosecutor submits further and 

         3        better particulars as follows.  That the Defence took 

         4        extensive notes of the two alibi witnesses, namely, SMR2 

         5        and LMR1, which took place in Kigali and that the 

         6        Prosecutor does not intend to rely on the interview 

         7        tapes in this case.  We, as we sit here, do not know 

         8        what is on the tapes and we are relying on what is in 

         9        the Prosecutor's statements; that they don't intend to 

        10        rely on the interview tapes in this case.  If they 

        11        intend to do so, we would have to obtain a copy of the 

        12        tapes before putting our witness on.  We would like an 

        13        order with respect to this matter that the Prosecutor 

        14        cannot use taps or any information derived there from 

        15        for purposes of this particular matter.  

        16        

        17        Your Honours, I have got an urgent note that Mr. 

        18        Kajelijeli is seeking leave to go to the toilet and I 

        19        don't want to hold him hostage up here.  Well, I just 

        20        want to bring it to the Court's attention if he could be 

        21        excused.  We specifically waived his appeal.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  He can go, if we are still here, he will come 

        23        back.  He is only going to the toilet?

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, he is running off.  So the application 

        25        we are making is that and I don't know whether the 

        26        Prosecutor intends to use it, and this might be all 

        27        premature but I am dealing with, in essence, an oral 

        28        motion in limine with respect to this matter and it may 

        29        be premature, it may not be-- they may be inclined to do 

        30        it, but I just want to make sure we don't have problem

         1        later on.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Mr. Fleming, do 

         3        you have any submissions on this particular aspect?

         4   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours.  It is premature, and even 

         5        when it arises, then perhaps it can be subject of 

         6        argument, and I deliberately say if it arises:  But 

         7        there is more, there is more.  My learned friend stood 

         8        there and said that they had no idea of what is on the 

         9        tape.  

        10        Professor Bompaka and the interpreter who is sitting at 

        11        the table with him were present at all times during the 

        12        interviews, and indeed they wouldn't allow us to 

        13        interview anybody without the assistance of counsel.  

        14        Their interests have been protected at all times and 

        15        they have extensive notes themselves of the whole 

        16        conversation that occurred.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: Are notes tape recordings? I mean, this is 

        18        the most absurd statement I am hearing.  Somebody taking 

        19        notes and a tape recording, if the tape recording 

        20        exists, fundamentally we should have had it, but aside 

        21        from that, the Prosecutor, in their response papers, 

        22        tell us they don't intend to rely on it.  That is what 

        23        they are saying.  We don't intend to rely on the 

        24        interview tapes in this case.  Now, if Mr. Fleming is 

        25        suggesting that we need to wait until the witness is in 

        26        the witness box until she testifies and then they will 

        27        make a decision and we have arguments on it, I think we 

        28        need to know, and the Defence is entitled to know this 

        29        now, before we put the witness in the box.  If they 

        30        intend to use it, then there is another submission we

         1        are making.  If they don't intend to use it, then this 

         2        is the end of it.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: When there is a formal request on this matter,  

         4        the Trial Chamber will make a ruling on that, and the 

         5        only thing we can say by way of a general comment is, 

         6        ourselves, get to familiarise ourselves with the Rules, 

         7        what are all the requirements at the scope of the Rules 

         8        that we use?  So when the matter arises we will deal 

         9        with it if there is a formal motion.  We will adjourn 

        10        these proceedings to 2:30 in the afternoon.

        11   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, can I raise one issue just before 

        12        you do.  It is a housekeeping matter.  I notice there is 

        13        a couple of minutes there.  Our learned friend's list of 

        14        witnesses was very extensive and it appeared to contain 

        15        witnesses that relate to the war crimes claims.  Now, 

        16        the war crime charges are longer in the indictment.  

        17        What I would like from our learned friends and what the 

        18        Court would like at some stage as well is some 

        19        indication of whether or not the witness list is going 

        20        to be amended accordingly and, if so, we would like to 

        21        know fairly promptly.  I raise it now.  I don't require 

        22        an answer immediately but an answer soon would suit us.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Certainly the issue of some of our intended 

        24        witness would be impacted. In respect to the other 

        25        witnesses, we do not think that the dismissal of the two 

        26        war crimes counts affect them because those are specific  

        27        witnesses who are burdened on particular allegations 

        28        that the Prosector has in fact made their case in chief.

        29   MR. FLEMING: Can we have an amended list soon, Your Honours, 

        30        of the witnesses that he does intend to call?

         2        we can.

         5        proceedings stand adjourned.

         1        1430H

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are resumed. Your next 

         3        witness, Professor Hinds, Learned Counsel for the 

         4        Defence?  We have the name LMR1.  Is that correct?

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is correct, Your Honour.  Before 

         6        calling the witness, Your Honour, as Your Honour 

         7        instructed, we, that is, the Defence, filed an extremely 

         8        urgent motion pursuant to Article 37 (iv).

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Article...

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thirty-seven (iv) of the Directives, and as 

        11        I am speaking now it is being filed with the registry.  

        12        I have given a courtesy copy to the Prosecutor.  We 

        13        don't know how fast the registry would process this 

        14        extremely urgent motion.  The Rules provide that -- the 

        15        Rules provide that the matter would be handled as 

        16        expeditiously as possible.  But it obviously is a matter 

        17        that would impact on this next witness, and we feel that 

        18        it would greatly complicate the situation if the witness 

        19        begins her testimony and then we find that the 

        20        Prosecution intends to use the tapes. 

        21             

        22        Now, I have just been told informally by Mr. Fleming 

        23        that the tapes are unintelligible.  I don't know, and I 

        24        just simply want to find out whether or not the 

        25        Prosecution intends to use it.  If they don't intend to 

        26        use it, the issue is mute.  The rest of our team is just 

        27        coming in, because we spent our lunch hour preparing 

        28        this extremely urgent motion.

        29   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, we can say three things. 

        30             


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                     18 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        One, our learned friends can have the tapes.  It is of 

         2        no consequence to us.  Two, they are unintelligible.  

         3        Three, we are not relying on them for that purpose.  

         4        However, if our learned friend thinks that that is going 

         5        to impact, I am quite happy to skip the next two 

         6        witnesses and we go with his sixth witness immediately.

         7             

         8        This delay and delay and delay is unacceptable.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we have not, since I have been 

        10        here, asked for a single adjournment.  I have been here 

        11        on time, each and every one of our witnesses have been 

        12        on time.  We have been proceeding forthwith. 

        13             

        14        If the Prosecutor does not intend to use the tapes, 

        15        that's the end of it.  We don't need to even deal with 

        16        anything more.  I don't even need to listen to the 

        17        tapes.

        18   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, we said it in the response to the 

        19        motion.  I said it before lunch, I have said it again 

        20        now.  Would my learned friend like me to say it a fourth 

        21        time?

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  What's your position now?

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think that he has made it abundantly 

        24        clear.  There is no caveat, it is not we will wait and 

        25        see.  It is clear and unequivocal, and I am happy.  I'm 

        26        sorry I wasted my lunch hour doing this, but we are now 

        27        going to withdraw our motion that was filed.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Okay so the -- we haven't seen the 

        29        motion, but we take note of the submissions of Counsel 

        30        for the Defence with regard to the motion that they had 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        filed, that they are withdrawing it, after hearing the 

         2        learned Counsel for the Prosecution.

         3             

         4        If we may make a general observation as maybe as a 

         5        matter of general comment, there is a lot of scope for 

         6        both the parties to do a number of things within the 

         7        purview of Rule 66 (B), their duty that arise, or 

         8        enjoined the parties in a number of ways.  But that's 

         9        not an issue now.  So can we have the witness brought 

        10        in, Witness LMR1.

        11   MR. KIYEYEU: I'm sorry, My Lord.  Do I take it to be granted, 

        12        motion? 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: There is no motion; it was withdrawn.

        14   MR. KIYEYEU: That's what I am saying.  But I take it you have 

        15        granted the request to withdraw, because it was not ...

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: If you know the -- we note it has been 

        17        withdrawn.

        18   MR. KIYEYEU: Taken note, My Lord.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: We don't grant a withdrawal.  We note that it 

        20        has been withdrawn.

        21             

        22        You may have to follow it up and inform the registry as 

        23        well, because according to the practice, I don't know 

        24        what directives -- you can inform the registry.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: We will do so at the earliest, but I just 

        26        simply wanted to put it on the record.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: It is noted that is withdrawn.  I think we 

        28        said that after this matter was raised formally. 

        29             

        30        Yes.  Is the witness going to speak in French or ...

         1        which language, Professor Hinds? 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the witness is going to be 

         3        examined by Professor Bompaka and, therefore, he will 

         4        address the Court with respect to this and other issues 

         5        relating to this witness.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Thank you.  Professor Bompaka, is the 

         7        witness going to speak -- you know in which language the 

         8        witness is going to speak, give his testimony?

         9   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  The 

        10        witness will be testifying in Kinyarwanda.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you please swear him -- swear her.

        14        

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Witness LMR1, you have just made a 

        16        solemn declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to 

        17        how your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a 

        18        few essential elements before you begin your testimony.

        19   THE WITNESS: Agreed.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: You will be led in your evidence in chief by 

        21        the Defence, who are seated on this side of the 

        22        Courtroom; thereafter, questions will be put to you by 

        23        the Prosecution, who are seated on this side of the 

        24        Courtroom.  Also the Judges sitting in front of you, may 

        25        put questions to you to clarify your evidence if they 

        26        will have such questions to ask you.  If a question put 

        27        to you is not clear, or you do not understand it, please 

        28        say so, and such a question shall be repeated or 

        29        explained to you.

         1        These are the few essential things we wanted to bring to 

         2        your attention before you begin your evidence.  

         3        Professor Bompaka? 

         4   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Mr. President, Your Honours, Defence 

         5        Counsel for Juvénal Kajelijeli has an oral motion to 

         6        submit before it begins to examine Witness LMR1.

         7   MR. FLEMING: If it's to close the court, Your Honours, I can 

         8        see every reason to close the court.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: What is the oral motion you have in mind, 

        10        Professor Bompaka? 

        11   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Yes.  Defence Counsel for Juvénal 

        12        Kajelijeli would like today's session to be in a closed 

        13        session.  This is a protected witness, and if you wish 

        14        me to explain why this witness is a very special 

        15        witness, I would like to have a closed session so that I 

        16        may answer this question.

        17   MR. FLEMING: We accept that it's appropriate to close the 

        18        court, Your Honours.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: The matter leads to the identity of the 

        20        witness.  Is that correct, Professor? 

        21   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Yes.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: In that case we grant the motion by the 

        23        Defence to have the evidence of this witness heard in
