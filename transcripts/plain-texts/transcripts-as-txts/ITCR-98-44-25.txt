        10                    Good morning, Your Honours, Lennox Hinds 

        11                    representing Mr. Kajelijeli and also 

        12                    Professor Bompaka who is co-counsel and

        17                    Yes, Mr. Fleming?

        18     MR. FLEMING:

        19                    Thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours might 

        20                    well be aware that there are some 

        21                    difficulties with proceeding today.  Those 

        22                    difficulties arise as a result of two 

        23                    things.  First, there are no witnesses here 

        24                    and second, there are ongoing difficulties 

        25                    with the investigations into the alibi and

         1                    witnesses.  

         2                    

         3                    If I may deal with the first issue first.  

         4                    Your Honours may or may not be aware that, 

         5                    IBUKA, one of the organisations which 

         6                    represents the victims and witnesses in this 

         7                    Court, has put an embargo upon witnesses 

         8                    travelling here.  As a result, two witnesses 

         9                    that we wanted to call in this session are 

        10                    not going to be here.  

        11                    

        12                    Your Honours, it becomes an unsatisfactory 

        13                    situation, given that this Court doesn't 

        14                    have the coercive powers that a domestic 

        15                    court would have.  We are aware that there 

        16                    are some things that can be done but those 

        17                    proceedings are so convoluted and difficult, 

        18                    there could be of no assistance in an 

        19                    emergency such as we have here.  

        20                    

        21                    Some steps have been taken and the 

        22                    Registrar, I understand, has written 

        23                    recently to the Minister of Justice, 

        24                    outlining the difficulties and requesting 

        25                    that some action be taken to ensure that the

          KAJELIJELI                                          8 APRIL 2002

         1                    witnesses come.  

         2                    

         3                    So, the problems result from not having the 

         4                    coercive powers and then having a 

         5                    misconception of what is actually happening 

         6                    in this Court, a misconception which is so 

         7                    ingrained is going to be very difficult to 

         8                    remove.  

         9                    

        10                    The second reason why there are no witnesses 

        11                    here, is that, it was hoped that we could 

        12                    have alibi witnesses dealt with in these 

        13                    sittings.  Any evidence that we wanted to 

        14                    call in response to alibi material, we would 

        15                    be able to do it, and we are not able to do 

        16                    that.  

        17                    

        18                    Your Honours, if I can take you back a 

        19                    little in history.  Your Honours will recall 

        20                    that during cross-examination of one of our 

        21                    very early witnesses, when material wasn't 

        22                    being put to that witness as one would do in 

        23                    the common law system, I raised the issue  

        24                    directly as to whether or not there was 

        25                    going to be alibi evidence and the answer

         1                    was "Yes" and no alibi statement had been 

         2                    given to us or notice of alibi had been 

         3                    given to us, because Defence counsel were 

         4                    relying upon the exception in the Rule, 

         5                    namely; that even if they don't give us the 

         6                    material, they won't be excluded from 

         7                    relying upon it.  Now, that gave rise to a 

         8                    ruling by this Honourable Court, for them to 

         9                    provide us with the notice of alibi.  That 

        10                    was done, but no details were given to us of 

        11                    who those witnesses were.  When there was 

        12                    material suggesting who they were, there was 

        13                    no order in place in respect of the witness 

        14                    protection of those witnesses.  So, all of 

        15                    that didn't occur until well into January of 

        16                    this year.  

        17                    

        18                    Now, we hoped as we said, that we could have 

        19                    called any evidence in rebuttal during our 

        20                    case as the rules anticipate.  We were not 

        21                    able to do that because we haven't spoken to 

        22                    all of the alibi witnesses, we have spoken 

        23                    to some, but not all.  

        24                    

        25                    Further, investigations are presently being

         1                    hampered by events that are entirely out of 

         2                    the control, even if this Court -- and that 

         3                    is the eruption of the volcano in Ngoma, and 

         4                    we have been precluded from pursuing some of 

         5                    the witnesses because of the chaos that 

         6                    pursued there.  And, in addition to that, 

         7                    presently, there are further difficulties 

         8                    going into the areas of Ruhengeri and 

         9                    Gisenyi for the same reason.  So, all of our 

        10                    best endeavours have come to naught.  

        11                    

        12                    We notified this Honourable Court on the 

        13                    19th of March, it's here that we wouldn't 

        14                    require all of the time that had been set 

        15                    aside because we then only had two 

        16                    witnesses.  We notified the Court just the 

        17                    other day, that even those witnesses won't 

        18                    be here.  So, we are in a position of not 

        19                    having any evidence to put before this 

        20                    Honourable Court, as of now.  

        21                    

        22                    Your Honours, two things remain to be said.  

        23                    First, we will review the situation in the 

        24                    next 24 or 48 hours, to see whether or not 

        25                    we can do without these two witnesses, and

         1                    we will come back to this Court and either 

         2                    inform the Court that we need those two 

         3                    witnesses or that we close our case.  

         4                    Second, we won't be able to call the alibi 

         5                    witnesses in the course of this case.  What 

         6                    I mean by the alibi witnesses -- I don't 

         7                    mean my learned friend's witnesses, but, 

         8                    rather, those witnesses who would rebut the 

         9                    alibi.  We will ask at the appropriate 

        10                    time because of the circumstances, that we 

        11                    call any evidence in rebuttal at the close 

        12                    of the accused's case.  

        13                    

        14                    Your Honours, we can't take the matter any 

        15                    further than that, but, my learned leader 

        16                    wants to address the Court on some matters 

        17                    as well.

        18     MR. PRESIDENT:

        19                    Thank you, Mr. Fleming.

        20                    

        21                    Yes, Madam Prosecutor.

        22     MS. DEL PONTE:

        23                    Thank you, Mr. President.  It is simply to 

        24                    add on to the points made by my colleague.  

        25                    The two witnesses who are not appearing

         1                    today, were contacted on the 5th of April, 

         2                    that is last time, to try to persuade them 

         3                    to come.  And they said unequivocally, that 

         4                    they did not come because they heard over 

         5                    the radio that the association of survivors 

         6                    had indicated that they should not appear. 

         7                    In other words, they are absolutely ready to 

         8                    appear but they are waiting for it to be 

         9                    said over the radio that witnesses can 

        10                    appear before this Court.  Just to tell you 

        11                    that all had been done on our part, to 

        12                    ensure that these witnesses appear. 

        13                    

        14                    On the letter of the registry, a response 

        15                    had been addressed to the registry and I 

        16                    have a copy of a letter from the Rwandan 

        17                    Minister of Justice dated 5th April and it 

        18                    reached the Tribunal on the 6th of April, 

        19                    and it is stated by the Minister of Justice 

        20                    that, well, his services are absolutely 

        21                    ready to assist our institution -- your 

        22                    institution to resolve the delicate problem 

        23                    that slows down the course of justice and I 

        24                    am quoting: "It would be proper, says the 

        25                    Minister of Justice, for us to reflect

         1                    together as to concrete ways and means to 

         2                    expedite the course of justice".  

         3                    

         4                    In other words, therefore, the Minister of 

         5                    Justice, Mr. President, is asking that we 

         6                    re-establish dialogue, taking into account 

         7                    the positions adopted by each of the parties 

         8                    and the concerns that I have expressed, by 

         9                    those parties.  That is what I have to say 

        10                    with respect to that problem.  

        11                    

        12                    As far as I am concerned, I also would like 

        13                    to say that the appearance of witnesses is 

        14                    crucial here.  We are talking about it today 

        15                    but there would be other trials that are 

        16                    going on and that would be facing the same 

        17                    problem.  

        18                    

        19                    And so, it is important that we monitor 

        20                    closely and deploy our efforts to ensure 

        21                    that these victims and witnesses appear.  

        22                    Obviously, we know that it is incumbent on 

        23                    the Tribunal to protect the witnesses, 

        24                    particularly under Article 21 of the 

        25                    Statute.

         1                    There is also a moral obligation on our 

         2                    part; we are all here to work along those 

         3                    lines.  And, it is my view that if the 

         4                    registry would need our services, our 

         5                    contribution, we would be prepared to 

         6                    discuss with that association.  

         7                    

         8                    Mr. President, that is not the point I 

         9                    wanted to make with respect to the need for 

        10                    witnesses.  It would be -- may be difficult 

        11                    within 24/48 hours to provide an answer.  

        12                    Maybe we might come to a situation where we 

        13                    might close our case, better we still feel 

        14                    that we should maintain our request for 

        15                    cooperation.   Thank you, Mr. President.

        16     MR. PRESIDENT:

        17                    Thank you, learned Madam Prosecutor.

        22                    appreciates the problem faced by the 

        23                    Prosecutor concerning the witnesses, and, 

        24                    we'd just like to offer any assistance that 

        25                    we can to facilitate this matter.  Let me

         1                    just deal seriatim with the comments made by 

         2                    Mr. Fleming.  

         3                    

         4                    Of course, we were not aware until this 

         5                    morning -- at this moment that the 

         6                    Prosecutor was having any problems.  I flew 

         7                    in from New York over the weekend.  I am not 

         8                    sure that I would have done anything 

         9                    different, but, nevertheless, I flew in from 

        10                    New York and spent up to 2 o'clock this 

        11                    morning working on cross-examination 

        12                    questions.  But, be that as it may, I had to 

        13                    do it anyhow.  

        14                    

        15                    The problem with the alibi witnesses, I 

        16                    think that Mr. Fleming is correct, as he 

        17                    traced the history and certainly what was 

        18                    put on the record by us with respect to 

        19                    that.  

        20                    

        21                    The trial began in July and on July 9th, we 

        22                    attended about four days after this trial 

        23                    began, pursuant to the order of this Court, 

        24                    we filed a notice of alibi.  It is true that 

        25                    we set out the parameters as is established

         KAJELIJELI                                          8 APRIL 2002

         1                    by Rule 67(a)(ii) with respect to what is 

         2                    required.  Since the alibi witnesses were 

         3                    protected witnesses, we only gave the 

         4                    pseudonyms.  But, we, of course, recorded 

         5                    with the registrar the identities of these 

         6                    individuals.  

         7                    

         8                    During that time period, we indicated to 

         9                    Mr. Fleming and to the Prosecutor's office 

        10                    that we would not disclose the identity of 

        11                    these witnesses, unless the protections were 

        12                    established in this Court's order of April 

        13                    3rd, 2001.  That did not take place before 

        14                    January or just about the first part of this 

        15                    year.  

        16                    

        17                    Quite frankly, looking at Rule 85 and 

        18                    particularly Rule 85(a) it was our -- we 

        19                    certainly didn't see that the Prosecutor was 

        20                    prejudiced in any way with respect to 

        21                    presenting any rebuttal with respect to our 

        22                    alibi testimony.  I certainly -- this Court 

        23                    felt and we agreed that we should provide a 

        24                    notice of alibi in sufficient time, so that, 

        25                    if the Prosecutor wanted to, on their case

         1                    in-chief, they may do whatever they wanted 

         2                    to do in that regard.  But, certainly, the 

         3                    Rules provide for rebuttal testimony and we 

         4                    understand that Mr. Fleming would be making 

         5                    the necessary application.  But, we could 

         6                    say, from the standpoint of the Defence, 

         7                    that we would not oppose that.  We think 

         8                    they have a right to rebuttal testimony, 

         9                    certainly with respect to this issue and in 

        10                    light of the problems that they are facing 

        11                    at this point.  

        12                    

        13                    The problem of cooperation between the

        15                    this Tribunal, pursuant to the cooperation 

        16                    agreements signed by the United Nations and

        18                    Defence and it is of paramount interest to 

        19                    justice.  

        20                    

        21                    I join with Madam Prosecutor in the 

        22                    application for cooperation.  We cannot have 

        23                    any justice done in this case without 

        24                    adequate cooperation.  What does that mean? 

        25                    Not only cooperation for the Prosecutor and

         1                    we think that there should be cooperation in 

         2                    the individuals, representatives from the 

         3                    government of Rwanda in providing all of 

         4                    assistance, but also more critically, 

         5                    cooperation with respect to the Defence.  

         6                    This Tribunal may be aware, I went to Rwanda 

         7                    within the last ten days.  

         8                    

         9                    I wrote to the Ministry of Justice asking 

        10                    for permission to go into the prisons to see 

        11                    witnesses.  They gave me authorisation to do 

        12                    so, when -- I spent money and time 

        13                    travelling from New York, Nairobi, Kigali 

        14                    and into Ruhengeri.  When I got there, they 

        15                    told me at the last minute in the evening, 

        16                    "Yes, you can go in".  I went in, I spent 

        17                    one hour trying to interview witnesses.  The 

        18                    next morning, I was told: " You no longer 

        19                    have any approval".  

        20                    

        21                    After spending time, money, travelling 

        22                    there, I then ended not being able to 

        23                    interview the witnesses.  At the same time, 

        24                    I requested authorisation to obtain certain 

        25                    documents which is an ongoing concern that

         1                    we have, given the fact that we believe that 

         2                    they are exculpatory information in the -- 

         3                    pre this trial, statements that were made by 

         4                    Prosecution witnesses, who are detained 

         5                    witnesses in Rwanda.  We have had extensive 

         6                    hearings before this Tribunal with respect 

         7                    to those particular matters.  The problem 

         8                    that we have is that the Prosecutor-General 

         9                    in Rwanda has just taken a position that 

        10                    they would not disclose that information.  

        11                    Compounding that problem, this Court is 

        12                    aware that we have witnesses who alleged 

        13                    that they have been intimidated and harassed 

        14                    after we have seen them by the Deputy 

        15                    Prosecutor in Ruhengeri.  All of these 

        16                    issues go to what?  Go to the question of 

        17                    cooperation, so that we can have a common 

        18                    objective which is justice to be done.  

        19                    

        20                    I stand here today, joined with the 

        21                    Prosecutor, because it is a serious problem 

        22                    and we anticipate even more problems for the 

        23                    Defence, because I have made four trips, 

        24                    probably more than any Defence lawyer to 

        25                    Rwanda and we have a number of witnesses who

         1                    are there.  There will be different types of 

         2                    problems, I anticipate, unless we have 

         3                    cooperation.  The cooperation that we are 

         4                    concerned about is that people are not 

         5                    intimidated and able to come here freely and 

         6                    say what they have to say, tell the truth, 

         7                    be subject to cross-examination and let this 

         8                    Court make a decision.  

         9                    

        10                    We must -- we must be able to have the kind 

        11                    of cooperation so that justice is done and I 

        12                    sympathise with the Prosecution's problems 

        13                    today, because I know, on my shoulders, it 

        14                    would be ten times tomorrow, and so, it is a 

        15                    problem.  I don't know how we solve it and I 

        16                    agree, that, given a sovereign state, there 

        17                    are no coercive powers that this Tribunal 

        18                    has.  But, the issue transcends just this 

        19                    case, there are other cases and there must 

        20                    be an understanding by even these NGOs that 

        21                    they cannot hold justice hostage, that there 

        22                    must be an agreement whether they like the 

        23                    decisions by this Tribunal or not, they 

        24                    cannot intimidate the Court, they cannot 

        25                    intimidate the process and they cannot

         2                    this clear that this process has to go

         7                    see that we are going to have.  We stand 

         8                    ready to assist in any way that we can, in 

         9                    this endeavour with respect to moving the

        13     

        14                    Do you have any comment, Mr. Fleming, on 

        15                    this matter?  Madam Prosecutor?

        16     MS. DEL PONTE:

        17                    Yes, Mr. President, I have listened with a 

        18                    lot of attention to my colleague of the 

        19                    Defence, and I fully agree with him on the 

        20                    fact that he has to have access to Defence 

        21                    witnesses.  

        22                    

        23                    Now, specifically with respect to access to 

        24                    the files of witnesses, witnesses who are 

        25                    accused before the Rwandan Courts and for

         1                    whom investigations are going on, I had 

         2                    raised this matter with Prosecutor Gahima 

         3                    and it would appear that indiscriminate 

         4                    access to files is not allowed.  This is -- 

         5                    we have to live with this because in 

         6                    national systems, ongoing investigations 

         7                    prohibit a third party from having 

         8                    indiscriminate access to files.  

         9                    

        10                    What can be done, Mr. President, is for the 

        11                    Defence to clearly indicate what it would 

        12                    like to have as documents that would be 

        13                    useful to them, you know -- specific 

        14                    requests like minutes or witness statements 

        15                    or if they are aware of any other 

        16                    documentation, but then they have to be 

        17                    specific and I could personally insist with 

        18                    the Prosecutor Gahima a sort of rogatoire 

        19                    commission, requiring assistance, mandatory 

        20                    assistance from the Prosecutor or the State 

        21                    Prosecutor.  

        22                    

        23                    Now, regarding these witnesses, a lot of 

        24                    them are in detention.  They haven't yet 

        25                    come before the courts.  I can understand

         1                    that Defence counsel faces a lot of 

         2                    difficulties when he goes to Rwanda.  I can 

         3                    understand that because I personally faced a 

         4                    lot of difficulties at a certain period, and 

         5                    I don't understand, maybe I should put the 

         6                    question to you, sir.  Wouldn't it be some 

         7                    solution, for instance, to ask that these 

         8                    witnesses be transferred to Arusha so that 

         9                    the Defence would have free access without 

        10                    any interference by anyone to create an 

        11                    impediment to such access?

        12                    

        13                    I am aware, Mr. President, that this is a 

        14                    matter that may be or may not be possible in 

        15                    technical terms, but, it is aimed at 

        16                    ensuring that the Defence have free access 

        17                    to these witnesses.  I would be ready to get 

        18                    in touch with our contact, the Rwandan 

        19                    authorities and it would therefore not be 

        20                    necessary for the Defence to embark on a 

        21                    trip to Rwanda, you know -- so that if they 

        22                    come here, for instance, they would have 

        23                    access to these witnesses.  That is a 

        24                    possible suggestion that I have, that is 

        25                    with respect to alibi and alibi evidence.  I

         8     PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9                    Thank you, Your Honour.  I appreciate the 

        10                    proposals made by Madam Prosecutor and we 

        11                    will take them up with our client to see 

        12                    whether or not there can be some joint 

        13                    cooperation in that regard, because it may 

        14                    solve that part of the problem.

        18                    request that we made concerning documents, 

        19                    that is the document request, so that she 

        20                    may be able to look at the specificity of 

        21                    the request that we made, because I agree 

        22                    with her, that we should not be talking 

        23                    about wholesale looking through any files.  

        24                    But we specifically requested documents 

        25                    relating to particular witnesses and not

         1                    just all documents, we were specific with 

         2                    respect to confessions that were made, 

         3                    statements that were made by those witnesses 

         4                    and those of witnesses who appeared here, to 

         5                    testify for the Prosecution.  And, we 

         6                    believe, that we are entitled to that 

         7                    information and the information was fairly 

         8                    specific.  And, we would even be prepared if 

         9                    there are any security concerns raised by 

        10                    the Rwandan authorities that they need to 

        11                    redact some information or that some 

        12                    information -- they do not want us to have, 

        13                    but the Court may, in fact, look at it in 

        14                    camera, we have no problem with that either.  

        15                    

        16                    If we can work these things out, but, just 

        17                    simply not to provide the document, forces 

        18                    us at some point in time to move for a 

        19                    motion to strike the testimony of all those 

        20                    witnesses, because, right now, what we have 

        21                    is part of their testimony and not all of 

        22                    it.  

        23                    

        24                    So, if we can find some way of sorting out 

        25                    these problems, again, in the spirit of

         1                    cooperation, we stand willing and able to 

         2                    participate.  Thank you.

         3     MR. PRESIDENT:

         4                    Thank you, Professor Hinds.

         5     

         6                    We would like to thank the Prosecution and 

         7                    indeed, the Defence for the comments that 

         8                    have been made in the course of this 

         9                    session.  We would like to make the 

        10                    following observations.  

        11                    

        12                    The first one with regard to the case of -- 

        13                    to the issue of alibi, the Prosecution and 

        14                    the Defence, Professor Hinds has clearly 

        15                    indicated what possible course of action 

        16                    that could be taken.  We will wait to see 

        17                    how things shape up in the course of the 

        18                    remaining part of this trial.  That is the 

        19                    most that we can say on that particular 

        20                    issue.  

        21                    

        22                    With regard to the issue of the witnesses 

        23                    who are linked up to this particular 

        24                    session, we take note of the observation as 

        25                    put across by the Prosecution and, indeed,

         1                    the observation made by the Defence on this 

         2                    particular question.  

         3                    

         4                    We would like to observe first, that, 

         5                    indeed, in the course of collective work and 

         6                    collective responsibility to do justice in 

         7                    matters before this Tribunal, and, indeed, 

         8                    for the course of international criminal 

         9                    justice, the cooperation and the assistance 

        10                    of states in whole is of utmost importance 

        11                    and necessary and that, of course, would 

        12                    include the Rwandan state. 

        13                     

        14                    So, we will urge that all that needs to be 

        15                    done, to facilitate and to enhance the 

        16                    cooperation of states in this regard, should 

        17                    be done and all efforts should be undertaken 

        18                    to see that it is done, and, in that regard, 

        19                    we would appreciate any action that is being 

        20                    taken by the registry, as well as in this 

        21                    particular aspect, by the Prosecution on 

        22                    their side, to ensure that these particular 

        23                    witnesses are able to come and testify 

        24                    before the Tribunal.

         1                    We will say no more on this matter at this 

         2                    particular stage, and the Trial Chamber is 

         3                    willing and thus grant a requested time by 

         4                    the Prosecution as indicated by Mr. Fleming, 

         5                    to deal with this issue in the next 20 or 48 

         6                    hours.  We will wait to be appraised of what 

         7                    happens.  

         8                    

         9                    If there is further time required, we will 

        10                    see what needs to be done, because it is an 

        11                    extremely important matter, it can't just be 

        12                    left like that.

        13                    

        14                    Thirdly, the Trial Chamber appreciates 

        15                    tremendously the thought that has been put 

        16                    across by the Prosecution, Madam Prosecutor 

        17                    herself and, indeed, as reacted on by the 

        18                    Defence, Professor Hinds, with regard as to 

        19                    what could be done to deal with some of the 

        20                    issues that have been outstanding and keep 

        21                    cropping up here and there, in the course of 

        22                    the proceedings before this particular 

        23                    Trial Chamber, and, indeed, before the 

        24                    Tribunal as a whole.

         1                    So, I hope they will be crystalised.  It 

         2                    would interest to see how they develop on 

         3                    the ground and see how they can be 

         4                    ventilated before the Trial Chamber.  

         5                    

         6                    We seriously take note of those observations 

         7                    with the appreciation and we hope they will 

         8                    be followed up.  

         9                    

        10                    So, that being the case, the proceedings as 

        11                    far as today end here and we wait to be 

        12                    appraised of the developments with regard to 

        13                    the two witnesses in the course of the time.  

        14                    

        15                    Mr. Fleming, should we come back here on 

        16                    Wednesday, would that be sufficient time? 

        17                    We'd like to see how things are developing 

        18                    on the ground with regard to the witnesses.

        19     MR. FLEMING:

        20                    Your Honours, there might be some 

        21                    difficulties with that.  The Prosecutor has 

        22                    suggested to me that I was somewhat 

        23                    optimistic in my time frame. 

        24     MR. PRESIDENT:

        25                    All right.  How long?

         1     MR. FLEMING:

         2                    She did it very kindly.

         3     MR. PRESIDENT:

         4                    How long?  I know, perhaps -- how much time?

         5     MR. FLEMING:

         6                    I realise that we have to bring the issues 

         7                    to a conclusion.

         8     

         9                    Your Honour, we may be able to inform the 

        10                    Court as to whether or not we need these 

        11                    witnesses quickly, and that would bring that 

        12                    issue to a head. 

        13     MR. PRESIDENT:

        14                    When do you plan to do that?  

        15     MR. FLEMING:

        16                    We can do that within the 24 hours.

        17     MR. PRESIDENT:

        18                    Then, I think we will keep Wednesday for all 

        19                    possible information.

        20     MR. FLEMING:

        21                    Thank you, Your Honours.  There is one 

        22                    associated issue.  Your Honours might recall 

        23                    that Professor Hinds has requested that -- 

        24                    at least posed the possibility that some of 

        25                    the witnesses would be recalled, that is

         1                    tied into the problem of receiving 

         2                    documentation from Rwanda.  Those witnesses 

         3                    are still here and have been here for a long 

         4                    time.  So, I will raise that issue with 

         5                    Professor Hinds as well and see if we can 

         6                    resolve that.  Thank you.
