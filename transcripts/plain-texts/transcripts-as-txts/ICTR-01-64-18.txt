MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session. 
(Not interpreted)
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good morning to the Office of the Prosecutor.  Good morning to the interpreters.  Good morning to the registry.  Good morning to the court reporters.  Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  This morning we only have one witness available.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And what is the name of the witness?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
It seems that there's a technical problem and the French court reporter could not hear what was being said.  Looks like the problem has now been resolved.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I was asking you what witness will be testifying this morning.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The answer is ZIZ.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You complained yesterday that one of your witnesses was ill and that some of your witnesses had disappeared.  The representative of the witnesses support section is here.  Would you be so kind as to tell us what the situation is with respect to the witness who is ill and the witnesses that have disappeared.
MS. BECKY:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  During yesterday's hearing, the hearing of 7th October 2002, the Defence of Mr. Gacumbitsi informed the Trial Chamber that some witnesses, Defence witnesses, had disappeared.  The Witnesses and Support Section would like to request that the word "disappeared" be modified and use more specifically that these people have been repatriated on a voluntary basis.  Based on the list of witnesses that Mr. Gacumbitsi gave to our section on the 9th of September 2003 the registry of this Tribunal officially informed the UNHCR in Tanzania to request its assistance.  In this correspondence the registry gave the names and addresses of persons living in a refugee camp in Tanzania.  On the 6th of October a staff member was sent on mission to the field and was able to locate three of those witnesses that he should -- was intended to bring to Arusha.  The fourth witness has temporarily absented himself from his camp and we were not able to contact this person.  And the three other persons were put back to the country of origin.  According to the Defence, the witness who had temporarily moved was no longer part of the final list of witnesses as of the 14th of September 2003.  And we only received this information on the 6th of October 2003.  Therefore, as a follow-up of the contact established with the office of the UNHCR in Dar es Salaam, as well as with the UNHCR office on the ground, this section has the honour of informing you of the following points. 

The three Defence witnesses that we are discussing here had been informed of the investigator's intention to call this person to come and testify in the Gacumbitsi trial.  And when they met with this person, the investigator took photographs according to the administrative procedure that is usually followed.  Nevertheless and subsequently, the three witnesses told the UNHCR that they were going to accept voluntary repatriation organised by the UNHCR at the request of the Tanzanian government by voluntarily signing the forms for voluntary repatriation. 

It is important to highlight that on the 2nd of September 2003, the Tanzanian government decided to repatriate the remaining Rwandan refugees to their country of origin, with the exception of those persons who had already obtained the refugee status under UNHCR protective status. 

So in cooperation with Tanzanian authorities, the UNHCR was able to finalise the practical modalities of the repatriation of these persons and their repatriation was implemented. 

UNHCR in Tanzania also informed that they did indeed receive the correspondence dated 9 September from the ICTR sent by the registrar of a result of the communication on that same day from the Defence team of the final list of Defence witnesses.  At our section's request the UNHCR in Tanzania was willing to give us the name of the préfecture and communes from which these three persons came and so we immediately forwarded this information to the Defence team, and it was now their responsibility to locate the witnesses and to confirm that these witnesses were willing to come and testify for the Defence in Arusha, and this before our section could undertake any measures to bring these persons to Arusha to testify for the Defence.  So, in view of the fact that three witnesses were not immediately available this section did everything possible in order to move forward the travel dates of three other witnesses who were scheduled to come and testify in two weeks' time, so that these witnesses could be available for next week's session.  

Therefore, may the Trial Chamber please take note of the fact that eight witnesses shall be available next week and the rest of the factual witnesses, which are six factual witnesses, they will come in the appropriate time and can be heard during the third week. 

I wish to thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to thank you for this information that you have just given us and which is very useful. You may now leave.
MS. BECKY:
Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to add that with respect to the witness who is ill and whose pseudonym is ZHZ, the witness support section decided this morning to take this witness back to the hospital in order to receive an expert opinion from the physician as to whether or not this witness will be available to testify this morning or not, and the section shall inform the Trial Chamber as soon as we have this information.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Counsel Kouengoua, you now have all the appropriate information with respect to the witnesses and your three witnesses.  Attempts are being made to locate them in order to bring them here.  You have heard what the representative of the WVSS has just stated.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I have heard the information provided by the section representative. 

I received this information yesterday after the hearing, and the only thing that causes some difficulty to the Defence is that the communes that are mentioned are communes from which these persons come.  These are not the communes to which these persons have moved to.  Nevertheless, as of yesterday we notified the section because of the advice and we received a mission letter and we sent our investigator on the ground for him to attempt to locate or obtain information about these persons, but I would like to say, Madam President, that it is very difficult for the Defence.  These persons provided their photograph and their identity and their statements, and this information has been with the Tribunal for at least three weeks, and these persons that we cannot find, their statements are in the hands of those persons who deal with these matters.  So how is it that persons that know that they have to come, who have signed documents and were willing to come, how can they have voluntarily left without leaving a forwarding address?  It is voluntary because this is what UNHCR has said, but the only thing that we can do is take note of the fact that these persons are not available and that we cannot find them.  But we have dispatched an investigator on the ground to see if they can find these persons, and we hope that they will be able to locate these persons.  And this is all we would like to add, Madam President.  But at the present time, while we await for the section to provide us with additional information, Witness ZIZ is ready to be heard this morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We shall -- we have taken note of what the representative of the witness support section has told us, and we hope to have information about the witness who is ill later today, to find out whether we can hear this witness today or tomorrow.  We thank you.  

Please bring in Witness ZIZ.
Good morning, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and we speak to you or shall speak to you using the pseudonym ZIZ.  You will make a solemn declaration, and after that the Defence shall ask questions.  The Prosecutor shall lead you in cross-examination, and you may be re-examined by the Defence.  And the Judges may ask you some questions as well. 

The registry will now assist you with your solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness ZIZ in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the witness and the registry. 

Counsel, you may proceed with your examination-in-chief.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS ZIZ,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:

BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Protected Witness --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I would move, Madam President, that the first part of my examination-in-chief be held in closed session for the protection of the witness.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
I have no objection, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We would like to thank the Prosecutor.

We regret to inform the public that we shall now sit in closed session in order to ensure the protection of the witness.

(Pages 1 to 4 by R. Lear)


0918H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session. 

Counsel, you may proceed with examination-in-chief of the witness.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam.  Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness ZIZ?
A.	Thank you.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, we are now in open session.  Pray be careful.  If there's any question that may lead to your identity being revealed you may point it out to Madam President and the Honourable Judges or not answer. 

When did you hear of the president's death and where were you?
A.	I was at home on the 7th.  It was my custom to listen to the radio to follow the news, and as soon as I turned -- switched the radio on, I heard sad music, and just afterwards they announced that his aeroplane had been shot down when he was on the point of landing at Kanombe airport.  And when I heard that the aeroplane had been shot down, I was at home in Rukira commune.
Q.	And what was your reaction to that news?
A.	There was nothing to be done.  I was sad.  I did not do anything, but I was very sad.
Q.	Did the people in your commune, inhabitants of your commune, react in any other way than you did?
A.	On the 7th we followed the national authorities instructions which forbade several people gathering.  All the people that I met also showed their sadness, but the matter was not particularly discussed on that day.
Q.	And how did you hear of the authorities orders?
A.	I just told you that there was announcement over the radio asking the people to stay home and forbidding large gatherings, gatherings of several people.
Q.	And what happened on the 8th?  Because there you've told us about the 7th.  Now what happened on the 8th?
A.	On the 8th we saw small groups of people passing, heading for the parish carrying some baggage.  The people I could speak with told me that they had been attacked at their homes and they were seeking refuge, that they had been attacked by bandits.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, you said before that you lived in Rukira commune; is that correct?
A.	(By order of the Court this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal)
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness ZIZ, you have not listened carefully.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I think the witness has divulged information that should not so be divulged in open session.  I should like it to be struck from the record.  He went further than required by my question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We shall strike from the Court record any information given by the witness in respect of his place of residence.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	On the 8th you saw people passing by with their baggage, and when you spoke with some of them they told you they had been attacked and they were heading for the trading centre.  And on the 9th?
A.	I remember, in the morning a communal vehicle arrived carrying people, and it was said that those people had been arrested while looting homes of inhabitants in a place called Ruriba.  Those people came from Birenga commune, which is adjacent.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, when you speak of a communal vehicle, which commune are you referring to?
A.	I am speaking of my commune where I resided, Rukira commune.  The communal policemen were responsible for ensuring public safety.
Q.	And Witness ZIZ, just a few moments ago you said, "I met a group of people carrying their belongings heading for the parish."  Which parish was that?
A.	You just said I met those people.  I did not meet them.  Those people were passing by where I lived, my residence, and some of them told me that there was insecurity and they were heading for the parish.  I don't know whether if I stated the name of the parish might affect my protected status.  If that is not the case, I can tell you what the name of the parish is.  It was Rukira parish.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, and what happened on the 10th?  Do you remember what happened on the 10th?
A.	I remember that on the 10th, it was a Sunday, I remember.  There was no mass at the parish.  Everybody stayed home.  People, neighbours would greet each other but avoid gathering.  We tried to reassure each other while awaiting to see how matters would ensue.
Q.	And after the 10th, was there anything, in particular, in the following days?
A.	On the 11th, in the morning, a parish employee, in fact a gardener, a parish gardener, came to my house and told me that the parish priest had sent him asking me to ignore what had happened and come to work, because my services were required.  So I went to the parish.
Q.	And when you went to the parish, what did you do?
A.	As I have just told you, this gardener had been sent to me.  The gardener went to see other people, assistant bricklayers or other bricklayers that I supervised, and we met at the parish.
Q.	And what sort of work did you accomplish at the parish on that day?
A.	I told you we were building buildings.
Q.	And after that day, what happened at your location, Witness ZIZ?
A.	It didn't take long.  I remember even on that day at ten o'clock I saw the parish priest at the work site.  He took one of the young people working there and asked him to accompany him, and they left.  I thought they were going to buy certain supplies, cement in particular, but a few -- a short while later, about one hour later, I heard noise from the trading centre, which wasn't far from there, a lot of whistling, a lot of noise, and I didn't know what was happening.  But as I lived very near by, I thought perhaps before continuing my work I should go home to see what was going on, and when I get home there was nobody left.  On the way, I walked, all the shops were open, everything was thrown to the ground that was in the forenoon on the very same day.
Q.	And after?
A.	After those incidents, after 10 or 15 minutes, communal policemen came and intervened.  And when they arrived there the perpetrators had already left and gone to Kibaya.  The communal policeman told us that what was happening did not concern us, that we should ensure our own safety and protect each other and inform the communal authorities of any incident that occurred -- that might occur. 
THE INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth, could you please spell the proper noun spoken by the witness, Kibaya.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
K-I-B-A-Y-A , Kibaya,  K-I-B-A-Y-A.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	And the policeman asked you to stay calm, ensure your safety.  What happened subsequent to that, Witness ZIZ?
A.	At that time the people were trying to repair the doors to the shop and pick up the goods that were scattered around.  Subsequently, in the afternoon, a large-scale attack was launched against that locality.  The assailants sang, "We've had enough of the accomplices of Rukira.  We will ourselves accomplish the work that we must do."  That was their song, their chant.
Q.	At that time were you personally attacked, assaulted?
A.	I don't know how to speak to what happened.  It's true that I wasn't (sic) assaulted.  One of the assailants stayed behind when the others withdrew.  In fact, the people whom they had been targeting had managed to escape.  I remember there was someone who came from Birenga who was killed on the spot, but they said that even other people, especially whose home commune it wasn't, should suffer the consequences.  In fact, they were talking about people whose identity they really didn't know.
Q.	Did you stay at your home in your commune until the end of April?
A.	No, I did not stay there.  The next day -- in the following days, I tried to find the means of leaving that place, because there were many criminal acts being committed, so I tried to flee from that place.
Q.	On what date did you flee from there, Witness ZIZ?
A.	I left that place on the 13th, because on the 12th there was a large-scale attack which had killed many people.  The communal office was destroyed.  Many people died there.  So I decided to leave that place and go to seek where my family would be in safety.
Q.	And where did you go and seek safety?
A.	The only thing left for me to do was to go to the neighbouring country.  That is the only place where I could be safe, where I could find safety.  So I left Rusumo commune from the north of Rusumo commune and I crossed at the Zamigera crossing point into Tanzania.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Zamigera is spelled Z-A-M-I-G-E-R-A, Zamigera, Z-A-M-I-G-E-R-A.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness ZIZ, you have just stated that you fled from your commune into Rusumo commune to seek safety, is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  When I contemplated going through Rusumo to go to Tanzania, I knew very well that place.  There is a relative -- I had a relative lived in Nyarubuye.  He was the director  of a new school.  So I tried to get to his house.  I tried to remember where his house was.  I thought he would help me to cross the border into Tanzania.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, you have stated previously that you fled from your home area because of the wide-spread attacks there, to go into the neighbouring commune of Rusumo.  Do you mean that in that commune there were no attacks at that time?
A.	I think that at that time the situation was not as bad as in our home area.  We didn't hear mention of any attacks there.  In fact, several people were fleeing but to Rusumo commune, while attempting to cross into Tanzania.
Q.	And as far as you can remember, on what date did you arrive in Rusumo?
A.	I remember, it was in the forenoon of the 14th.
Q.	And you mentioned someone named Alfred, is that correct?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
He didn't mention anyone called Alfred.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Indeed, Counsel, I do not think that I have heard that name.  We heard mention of the Zamigera crossing point.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No, I think he mentioned the director of a school.  He gave the name of a school director, a friend of a newly established school.  Perhaps the interpreters can help us.  Madam President, can the President help us.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwandan booth says as far as they know no name was mentioned.  The title of the director of the school was mentioned.  The witness says he has not given any name unless you want him to give a name.  He said, "I went to seek refuge with a friend, with a friend who had become the director of a newly established school."
THE WITNESS:
If you wish, I can tell you his name because I know it very well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Not interpreted)
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness ZIZ, you said that you went to a friend who was a director of a newly established school.  What was his name?
A.	His name was Alfred Ndikubwimana.  Ndikubwimana is spelled as follows:  
N-D-I-K-U-B-W-I-M-A-N-A, Ndikubwimana, Alfred.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Did you meet him at home?
A.	When we got to his home we met him there.  He was with his colleagues.  They were with him.  They were living with him, with their househelps.  I was with my wife and the child she had.  We greeted him, and he asked us why we had come.  I told him that the situation was critical.  I told him that he had to prepare his self to welcome even my father, and I told him why I came.  He welcomed us, received us in his home, told us where we would be living and we spent the night in that area.
Q.	For how long did you stay in your friend's home?
A.	Since I had told him about what had happened and of my intention to travel to Tanzania he told me, "As you know, I am new in this area.  However, I will have, of course, somebody but notably the accountant of that commune, who was a native of Nyarubuye in Rusumo commune," and he told me, "I will send word to him and ask him to meet us at the border crossing at an appointed time, so that we can cross the border."  He told me to be patient and that he would see what he could do the next day.
Q.	The next day must have been the 15th, from what you have said.
A.	I told you that the day on which I arrived in Alfred's house was the 14th.  That was when I got to his home.
Q.	The 15th, did he present you to the person who was supposed to lead you to Tanzania or what happened on the 15th?
A.	It was not possible on the 15th.  It is indeed a sad story.  On the 15th when he tried to meet Rukakaze, who could have helped us, the situation suddenly deteriorated such that on that day I could not cross the border into Tanzania.  . 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Rukakaza is spelled R-U-K-A-K-A-Z-A  Rukakaza, R-U-K-A-K-A-Z-A.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	What happened subsequently?
A.	We were in Ndikubwimana's home; we had gone there to have lunch.  As a matter of fact, we were sitting on the veranda, which was opposite the entrance to the compound.  We were waiting for the househelp, who had gone to look for Rukakaza, to come back and tell us what had happened or given us an account of his submission.  At the time I saw a vehicle arrive and there were many people behind that vehicle and others and we told ourselves something unusual was happening, but we waited to see what they were going to tell us.
Q.	And what happened subsequently, following the arrival of that convey of vehicles?
A.	Other vehicles came in the wake of the first convoy.  The distance between both convoys was not very significant.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
A vehicle.  It was counsel who suggested there was more than one vehicle.
THE WITNESS:
I made mention of several vehicles.  The first one was a gendarme vehicle followed by others.  One of the vehicles stopped at the centre, notably at the Nyarutunga health centre.  There were vehicles that stopped at that centre and young people came out of that vehicle and scattered all over the place and went into various houses, and that was when some youngsters arrived in Ndikubwimana's home and started beating us and told us to get on board the vehicle and do the work.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness ZIZ, I am the only person putting the questions to you, apart from the Judges.  No one else has a right to put questions to you, apart from the Judges and myself, so please answer my questions.  

You said earlier that a vehicle full of gendarmes passed and that others followed; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	At that moment, where were you?
A.	I said that I and my colleague were sitting near his house, that is where he was living, but we were sitting on the side opposite the road.
Q.	When the vehicles passed, what happened?
A.	Some of the vehicles passed, and I said that other vehicles followed, and when those vehicles stopped at the health centre close to the road, the people on board the vehicle alighted, and they went to look for various people living in the neighbouring houses, and that was when some of the youngsters came on to the see where we were.
Q.	And what did they ask of you?  What did they do to you when they got to your house?
A.	They were very angry, and they were telling us -- they were asking us, "Why aren't you working like the others?  All of you, get on board the vehicle so that we should work."
Q.	After these instructions, did you immediately get up and follow them?
A.	At that time they beat us, hit us, and pushed us around and ordered us to go towards the road.  There were no discussions with them.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, what was the distance between your house and the road?
A.	Well, it was between 100 and 150 metres.  That was the distance between the house where we were living and the road.
Q.	Those people beat you up and they pushed you around and told you to go to work.  Did you finally leave with them?
A.	They assembled everyone on the road.  We were in the team that had been set up there and were ordered to follow the other cars to Nyarubuye.  Some people were transported on the vehicles while others trekked.  We were still looking for a means to flee, but it was not easy.  We trekked to that area, while others were transported on board the vehicle.
Q.	Did the people who came to ask you to leave and who beat you up, were they armed?
A.	Of course they were armed.  They were carrying machetes, sharp machetes.  They were carrying machetes they called echete, others were carrying clubs and  --others were carrying clubs.  They were wearing shorts that came down to knee level, and they were beating people up.  They were beating people, you know, with joyous abandon.
Q.	You said awhile ago that you tried to flee.  Is that correct?
A.	Given the experience I had with regard to events in my commune of residence, I spoke with Alfred and I realised that the situation was terrible, was terrifying, so we tried to do our best in order not to take part in those acts.  We did our best, but we did not succeed.  We went right up to the parish, particularly to a school called CERAI.  Alfred and myself hid under rocks that were found there, but in vain.  We ended up being flushed out and they told us, "So you are accomplices, you don't want to assist the others."  When we realised that we had been seen, we came out of our hiding and we stayed with the others.
Q.	Where did they take you to do the work?
A.	Well, they were saying that the work had to be done in Nyarubuye parish.  They were saying that there was work to be done in Nyarubuye parish.
Q.	Alfred and yourself arrived in Nyarubuye parish?
A.	I said earlier on that we tried to hide under the rocks that were close to the Serihja centre but we were flushed out and we were beaten up with sticks and forced to join the other group.  I was with Alfred.  I rejoined the group and I did my best to always remain close to Alfred.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, were you yourself armed at that time?
A.	In order to give the impression that I was obeying the instructions of the attackers, I cut off the branch of a tree, just a little stick that could have been used to herd cattle.  As for Alfred, he took a piece of plank and he tried to use it as an arm.  And we went up and joined the other group and we went to Nyarubuye.
Q.	When you got to Nyarubuye -- are you referring to the commune or the parish?
A.	I am referring to the parish.  The commune is known as Rusumo, and the distance -- there is a distance between the parish and the communal office.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, when you got to the parish, did you find people there?
A.	When we got to the parish, we saw people who had gone ahead, and they had circled the parish on instruction from the gendarmes.  It was the person in charge of the gendarmerie battalion was there.  Some people were inside.  There were many people in there.  They were afraid and they were making a lot of noise.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, are you feeling a lot better now?  Do you need to rest a bit?  Do you need a short break, or can we continue?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe the witness is okay.  We can continue.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
We can continue, or we have no problem?
THE WITNESS:
We can continue.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	You arrived at the parish.  The chief of the gendarmerie battalion gave orders and the parish was surrounded or encircled.  As gendarmes, you are referring to those in the convoy which you saw when you were in your friend Alfred's house?
A.	Well, I did not see any other vehicles carrying gendarmes.  It was perhaps those gendarmes or others who had arrived earlier, but in any case there were gendarmes.  The people I saw were gendarmes.  I beg your pardon, I used a French word, but I could not have used any other word.  There were either people who had arrived earlier or gendarmes we had seen on board the vehicle that came and passed in front of Alfred's house.  I cannot specify whether they were the gendarmes we had already seen.
Q.	And, to your knowledge, from where had these gendarmes you had seen hailed?
A.	When the war was particularly intensive in 1990, 1991, at an area known as Mulindi in Rukira, we saw a group of gendarmes in charge of security pass.  As a matter of fact, the gendarmes we saw were coming from that area.
Q.	And when the commander of the gendarmes ordered the gendarmes to surround the parish, what happened?
A.	An order was given.  There was someone there who was very active, someone who I knew very well.  He had been in the army before but he was now a reserve.  His name was Twagirayezu.  When the men were lined up and their positions assigned and they were ordered to prevent anyone who would try to jump over the fence I noticed that this man was very active in the organization of the attackers at that time.  Twagirayezu is spelled as follows:  T-W-A-G-I-R-A-Z -- R-A-Y-E-Z-E - 
T-W-A-G-I-R-A-Y-E-Z-E-U, T-W-A-G-I-R-A-Y-E-Z-U.
Q.	Apart from the gendarmes, were there other people in Nyarubuye instructed to attack the parish?
A.	Now, what did I tell you, Counsel.  I told you that when those gendarmes went on board the vehicles there were other vehicles in back of them, people from Birenga and Rugira and all these people had one single objective, that was to attack the parish and kill all the people who were there.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, you told us earlier on your profession.  Now you are talking of gendarmes.  How did you know that they were gendarmes?
A.	As you know, I don't see anything abnormal in what I said.  I was a mason.  Gendarmes are a unit charged with providing for the security of the people.  They were wearing uniforms that were similar to that of soldiers, the only difference being -- and I don't know how to say it in Kinyarwanda -- as a matter of fact, the only difference was in terms of the berets they were wearing.  The gendarmes had red berets whereas soldiers had black berets.  There were also the paracommandos who had camouflaged hats.  So, you see, I knew the gendarmes all the same.
Q.	You said that the gendarmes launched the attack.  Was it the gendarmes?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Mr. Kouengoua is leading witness and has fully stated the answer he is expecting in his question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection is upheld.  

Counsel, withdraw your question.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness ZIZ, did you see that the parish was attacked?
A.	What I said was that all the people who went on board the vehicle, who had come up from Birenga, Rugira, whose objective was to attack the parish.
Q.	Was the parish attacked?
A.	Yes, the parish was attacked and destroyed.
Q.	Can you explain to the Trial Chamber how the attack took place?
A.	Initially, when the attackers were lined up and shown the positions where they should station themselves in order to prevent those being attacked from escaping, one of the leaders of these groups -- I'm not sure I know his name; I was not able to find out what his name was -- said "Whoever believes he is innocent should step forward."  And a few persons left the parish compound, they were afraid, they were crying and they would throw themselves into the arms of the people they saw, and they would move amongst the attackers who were stationed in front of the parish.  Then he said, "Isn't there anyone else who remains in the group who believes himself to be innocent?"  There was a lot of noise from the inside.  They threw a few stones, spears, and arrows but in vain.  The lieutenant said, "As this is the way you are behaving, all of those who are outside the compound should lie down," and they started throwing grenades and they shot guns.  The doors, windows were broken into.  It was terrible.  I mean, seeing such a scene was extremely difficult.
Q.	When this commander or when this leader asked the people to lie down with their stomachs on the ground and grenades were thrown --

MS. MOBBERLEY:
Counsel is giving evidence that the witness hasn't given.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Well, I think that on this occasion we really need to verify this, because I really think she is really going too far.
THE WITNESS:
This is what I stated.  I said that the lieutenant commander of the gendarmes asked the people to lie on the ground on their stomach and asked their group to shoot at them and throw grenades on the inside.  But those who were on the inside tried to throw pebbles and arrows in the direction of the attackers in order to discourage them so they would flee.  So I did say that the people did lie on the ground on their stomachs.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness ZIZ.

The people who were throwing the rocks and the arrows, were they amongst the ones who forced you to go to Nyarubuye?
A.	Those who were throwing stones and arrows were people who were inside the compound and they were shooting them against those who were on the outside to discourage them so that they wouldn't attack them.
(Pages 8 to 17 by R. Lear)


















	1015H
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness ZIZ, according to your story, what was thrown first, the grenades or the spears and arrows?
A.	I don't think you have followed what I have said.  I told you that when the lieutenant had lined up the attackers, those who were in the inside were frightened and they decided to defend themselves using the weapons they had available to them, stones, spears and arrows; and after that the lieutenant said, "Well, if this is the way things are, then everyone needs to lie down on the ground on their stomach and we need to do our work."  And he ordered the gendarmes to shoot at the crowd.  They also had other types of witnesses called stream (phonetic), and they also shot off firearms at those who were on the inside.
Q.	At that specific point in time, were you able to see the people inside?
A.	No, I was outside the compound.  The main difference is that I have been brought there by force, but it was very difficult for me.  It was horrible for me to see what was happening.  People were dying in a horrible fashion.  I don't think that I could say that anyone here has seen someone be torn apart by a grenade.  And I did my utmost to avoid looking at the scene by hiding behind other persons to try and extract myself from this place so -- because I couldn't watch the scene, but I was not able to because I was weak, and I remained there.
Q.	At what time do you think you arrived at Nyarubuye parish?
A.	I think asking me the time at which I arrived, I wasn't carrying -- wearing a watch and I wasn't able to ask anyone what the time was because I was not at peace.  I prayed to God that he would get me out of this place.  But in any case, it was in the afternoon, towards the evening, but I would not be able to tell you the exact time.  And I think that if anyone had been wearing a watch, they would not have had the courage to look at the watch to find out what time it was.
Q.	How long did you remain at the parish?
A.	Who are you referring to, Counsel?  If you are talking about me and other persons from Nyarubuye, we were afraid, because these were terrible scenes, and they were trying to escape, just as I and Alfred were, to go and hide far from that location.  Perhaps you should ask me when I left that location.  But as to know the time, really, I have no idea.  I did not know the time at which those persons left that location, but I was able to leave the location with God's help.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, were there many bodies at the parish?
A.	Are you doing this on purpose, Counsel?  A place where there is a large crowd coming from different places?  Actually, I would say that people had come from throughout Kibuye préfecture, and all these peoples were attacked with grenades and firearms.  You must understand that there were many bodies.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, what did you personally do at the parish?
A.	I was afraid and I was also weak.  There was nothing I could do.  I was injured, and someone from the group who had come from Biringa -- this is someone I knew quite well, this is someone I knew from before -- hit me, struck me at the head with a board, and it is when people were being ordered to load up the property they had, the belongings they had looted, in the vehicles.  At that point I was afraid, and they were forcing me to go, and I was trying to hide behind the people, and this person struck me on the head and I was injured.  And I went in because I wanted to save my life.  And I met persons who were carrying a cooker, and I helped them to carry the cooker.  I pretended to help them to transport the cooker, and when we reached the vehicle near the road -- or at the road, rather, I looked down as if I needed to go and urinate, and then I decided to flee with a group of persons who were attempting to flee, and I went to hide in a bush.
Q.	After hiding in the bush, did you return to the parish?
A.	Do you think it was possible to return to the parish after you managed to escape with your life?  I was able to escape by chance, by sheer luck.  And my friend and other persons from Nyarubuye, each and every one of us was looking for a bush in which to hide, and in this manner, three, four or five persons could hide in the bush.  And, you know, in that region there are many boulders, and it's possible to hide under the boulders in order to be in secure -- in safety, and then continue on your way the following day.
Q.	You said that you were struck in the head with a board.  Were you injured?
A.	If you come close to me you will see that I have a scar on my head, and this scar continues to bother me.  I believe that a bone was fractured.  And I still have the scar on the left side of my head, and sometimes the scar hurts me.
Q.	Up until you assisted the persons to transport the cooker and up until the moment when you fled into the bush, did you or your friends or anyone else see the man who was the bourgmestre of Rusumo commune?  Did you see the bourgmestre at that location on that day?
A.	Are you referring to that specific day?  No, the bourgmestre wasn't there.  I remember that the people of Nyarubuye were asking themselves, "Where is our bourgmestre?  Has he been killed?  Why didn't he come to come and help us?"  Especially as they trusted him, and they thought that perhaps he had died.  So the bourgmestre of Rusumo wasn't there.  
Q.	Witness ZIZ, from Alfred's house, from your friend's house, could you see the commune office?
A.	No.  The distance between Alfred's residence and the commune's office is quite important.  You could not see the commune office from Alfred's house, and you could not hear any sound coming from there because there was an important distance between the two.
Q.	Now, the road that the convoy used and the -- when you were forced to go to Nyarubuye parish, from the Rusumo commune office, can you see the vehicles travelling on that road?
A.	No, that's impossible.  A road was built coming from Kibaya to go to Rukira up all the way to Birembo, and that is the road that the people used to go Nasho Lake.  And when you reached Birembo, you go up towards the parish.  Birembo is at the border between Rusumo commune and Rukira commune.  So if someone was in Nyakarambi, they wouldn't be able to know what was happening at the parish.  It was impossible because there was an important distance between the two.  Birembo is spelt B-I-R-E-M-B-O, Birembo.  Nasho is spent, N-A-S-H-O, Nasho. 
Q.	And Nyakarambi, please? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nyakarambi is spelt N-Y-A-K-A-R-A-M-B-I.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	A few moments ago, in answer to one of my questions, you said that you did not have a watch, and even if you had a watch, a normal man would not have checked his watch, that the circumstances were such that the person would not have had the opportunity to check their watch.  As you did not have a watch and as you do not know what time, but could you tell us after being in -- hiding in the bush, when did you reach your house?
A.	Are you referring to that specific day?  Do you think I could go home?  Because I was really afraid, and people were being pushed out of their houses forcibly.  And on that day, my friend, myself and other neighbours from the surrounding areas, no one went back to their home.  We all spent the night in the bush, and the next day, the next morning, that is when we returned to our respective houses to see if the persons whom we had left there were still alive.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, when did you leave Nyarubuye secteur?
A.	Well, allow me to say that when the sun rose that morning, my friend told me, "I am not going to leave with you, that's not possible, because I have not seen yet my father.  I don't know what has happened to him.  So what I shall do is to make my employee available to you, because there are many other persons coming from neighbouring communes and who were going towards the passage point to go through the border".

So I went down, I left, and along the way I came across other persons, including a man from Kayonza whose name was Paul.  We greeted one another.  He told me about his situation, I told him what had happened to me, and we went to the crossing point, but we were not able to cross the border on that day.  We reached a place called Ruzinga.  It's a small island on which a refugee camp had been set up, and the reason we left that place was because of the mosquitoes that were there.  People were falling ill, catching malaria.  And we continued up to -- over to Tanzania, and this was around the 18th.  But on the 16th, I did not remain in the region.  I did everything I could to go towards the crossing point to cross the border. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
If the Kinyarwanda booth would be so kind as to spell the proper nouns that were stated by the interpreter  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: 
Yes.  Kayonza is spelled K-A-Y-O-N-Z-A.  A first name was mentioned, Paul, P-A-U-L.  Ruzinga is spelled R-U-Z-I-N-G-A.

BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Before you left Nyarubuye secteur, in Rusumo commune, did you meet Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	I have told you that when we were at the parish, the people were asking themselves why Gacumbitsi wasn't there.  Some thought he was dead; others did not understand the situation.  And so, I did not see Gacumbitsi, and this is what I told you, I did not see Gacumbitsi in Nyarubuye.  Moreover, I did not see any police officer, and I couldn't know the difference between policemen and gendarmes, but I did not see any authority of Rusumo commune.  I did not even see a policeman, unless they were wearing civilian clothes.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, when did you cross the border to go into Tanzania?
A.	I have told you that when we were in Ruzinga with other persons, the canoes were trying to bring people across.  And when people were tired, then they would rest.  In order -- my crossing over into Tanzania, it was around the 20th.  I am not sure, but I believe it was either the 20th or the 21st.  That is when I reached Tanzania through the Migera crossing point, which was monitored by a Tanzanian ferryman whose name was Sos (phonetic).  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Migera is spelt M-I-G-E-R-A.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	When you were in Ruzinga, if I am pronouncing the word correctly and if that is what you actually said, when you were in Ruzinga, did you hear that the bourgmestre or the responsable de secteur had given the order to prevent people from crossing over into Tanzania?
A.	No.  I am telling you what I know and what I was a witness to.  All the persons who fled towards Tanzania came through Rusumo commune, and I believe that the conseiller and the bourgmestre did not prevent persons from fleeing and from crossing the border into Tanzania.  So no order was given to prevent people from going into Tanzania.  Moreover, many other persons who were not natives of the commune came through this checkpoint to cross the border. 
Q.	Witness ZIZ, you told us that in the morning of the 16th you decided to go towards Tanzania, and you asked your friend Alfred if he wanted to go together, and he said that he could not leave because he did not know what had happened to his parents.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.  Alfred needed to know what had happened to his parents and to his sisters, and he said, "I cannot leave them behind.  I am going to wait and see if they will join me, and if possible, I shall go to Rukira to collect them so that we can leave together".
Q.	Do you know what happened to Alfred after 1994?  Did you ever see him again?
A.	After crossing the border through the Migera crossing point, I spent a great deal of time trying to see how I could possibly survive.  You know, people who have a profession or trade can try easily to make ends meet.  I was asked to build a wall, a supporting wall to support a house, and so I built the wall.  And a few days later, I was told that a camp had been established in Benaco, and the person for whom I had built the supporting wall paid me, and we went to the Benaco camp with the persons I was with.  And once I reached the Benaco camp I saw my friend's father, and I asked him for news, and I told him that he had helped me a great deal.  And he said, "You can now mourn for him because he is already dead."  And I asked him when he had died and how, and he told me, "The circumstances of his death are unexplainable".  

And when he went to Rukira to see his father, a few days later, around the 17th, 18th and 19th,, the RPF had already moved into the region, and he was appointed bourgmestre of the commune.  And he was asked to gather the people, to restore security and safety to the commune, and he was appointed bourgmestre of the commune, and the criminals were going to be arrested and judged and the others would be declared innocent.  

After that, the old man, Alfred's father -- I don't know if should mention his name or not, but he said that the RPF had killed Alfred's pregnant sister and she was thrown into a latrine.  And when Alfred wanted to find out more about the circumstances in which his sister had died and having mentioned these killings, he was also killed.  And Alfred was killed by RPF soldiers, because he had mentioned his sister's killing and that of many other persons who had been killed.
Q.	And you are telling the Trial Chamber that Alfred's father was the one who told you the news?
A.	Yes, Alfred's father himself was the one who told me.  And our neighbours who fled to Tanzania, they spoke to us - or, gave us news of our neighbours who had been killed.  We would ask, "Where is so and so," and we would be told this person is no longer alive.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, how long did you remain in that camp in Tanzania?
A.	In Benaco?  I remained in Benaco since the camp opened in the middle of May 1994.  I remained there until the refugees were repatriated, and that is when I left the camp.
Q.	Did you leave the camp to go to Rwanda?
A.	No.  I didn't go to Rwanda because of problems of public safety that been reported to me, and events that occurred in my home area and the area where I resided led me to decide to find another place of refuge.  I left Benaco camp and I joined the Burundian refugees, and I was compelled to learn Kirundi by force so I could pass as a Burundian refugee.  And I stayed with those refugees until I again sought refuge in Kenya.  
Q.	Witness ZIZ, apart from being kicked and hit with the stick and hit on the head, were other members of your family victims of the events of 1994?
A.	I don't know to tell you because you wish me to remember very painful events.  Many members of my family were killed.  My eldest brother was killed.  I don't know whether I can say his name.  Also, my sister was killed as well as other members of my family, other near relatives of mine.  And my younger brother is in prison.  I don't how to tell you.  Until today, my younger brother is in prison.  I don't know how to tell you.  What happened in Rwanda and what is happening there today, you understand all that led me to go into exile in another country.
Q.	Witness ZIZ, I came here to defend and the law allows me to ask questions.  I didn't want to wound you; I didn't want to hurt you.  I think we are all working for the Tribunal. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I have no further questions, and I apologise to this witness.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  However, we must point out that you have exceeded considerably the time you yourself had fixed for cross-examining (sic) the witness.  

Now, who is to undertake cross-examination?  Is it Madam Mobberley?  Madam Counsel -- or should we take the brief -- or make a break now and undertake cross-examination afterwards?
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Yes, perhaps if we take the morning adjournment at this stage, and I'll begin the cross-examination after, following the adjournment.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Very well.  We will adjourn for about 15 minutes.
	(Court recessed from 1055H to 1115H)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	The hearing will now resume.  

Madam Mobberley, Counsel Mobberley, you now have the floor for cross-examination.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
	Thank you, Madam President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Mood morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, where was Alfred's house located?
A.	Do you want to know the area or -- the house he lived in did not belong to him.  He leased it, rented it. He lived near the road that goes up to the parish.
Q.	Which cellule is that house in?
A.	I didn't know the name of the cellule, but it was in Nyarubuye secteur, since I was newly arrived in that area.  I had just arrived the evening before.
Q.	Now, Witness, were you familiar with the terrain, with the region in Nyarubuye secteur?
A.	Nyarubuye, it's in an area I didn't know, I was not familiar with.  I went to seek out that gentleman because he had been my neighbour, and he had told me that he lived in Nyarutunga near the dispensary, near the Nyarubuye dispensary.  I found his house by seeking information from the people I came across.  I met someone near the dispensary, and he told me, "Alfred is a friend of mine.  Come with me, I will show you his house, his home".
Q.	And did you indeed find that his home was in Nyarutunga near the dispensary?
A.	It wasn't Rutunga, it's Nyarutunga, Nyarutunga. Yes, indeed, it was Nyarutunga near the dispensary.
Q.	Is there a road between the Nyarutunga market and Nyarubuye parish?
A.	I don't know the market you are referring to.  I told you that I was at the dispensary near Alfred's house, home, near the dispensary.  I don't know the marketplace you've referred to, but there was a road -- there is a road, indeed, that goes by the dispensary and rises up to the parish.
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...the vehicles were travelling along, the vehicles carrying the people who captured you; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes, it was that road.
Q.	Are you able to give the Trial Chamber an estimate of the time it took for you to walk from Alfred's house to the parish?
A.	Please, could you repeat the question?
Q.	Can you estimate the time that it took you to walk from Alfred's house to the parish?
A.	If you're walking at normal walking speed, it can take you from 20 to 30 minutes.  It's not very far.
Q.	Now, you say that you were beaten by your captors.  What were you beaten with?
A.	I think I said that these people who hit me were at the parish.  I was wounded at the parish, injured at the parish.  Those who took us from Alfred were kicking us and hitting us, but I wasn't wounded.  They struck us with sticks and kicked us, but it is not they who injured me -- wounded me at the parish.
Q.	How many people were there in the group that captured you?
A.	I said that a large group of people went into the houses and drove the people out.  The ones who took Alfred and me away, they were only three.  I only saw those three.  Other members of the group went into the neighbours' houses.
Q.	But it's true to say at that point, Witness, that you were resisting your capture, weren't you?
A.	We were ordered to get on our feet and go and work, but it wasn't as easy as that.  They kicked us, hit us with sticks, spit in our faces, calling us cowards, and under such circumstances we were obliged to leave.
Q.	You used the phrase "work" on several occasions.  Can you explain to us what you understood was meant by that phrase?
A.	Before the war -- well, let's say, you know the meaning of the word work, to work.  However, during the war in the Rukira-Nyarubuye fighting, to work meant to help that group to eliminate what that group didn't like, didn't want.  That's what they meant by that word, to work. 
Q.	And what was your understanding of what it was that group didn't like and didn't want?
A.	Well, it was a matter of people who didn't share their ideas, and subsequently it was all made very clear they killed those people who didn't have the same manner of thinking as they did, who didn't have the same ideas as they had.
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...who were Tutsis, weren't they, Witness?
A.	No, not only Tutsi.  There were dead on all sides, Hutu, Tutsi.  When we were very afraid, we could talk with the neighbour and decide to run away, and the two groups ran away.  It wasn't only Tutsis who ran away, we all fled.  When we found a place which was more or less safe we'd rest, wait for the night to pass, the next day to come.  That's the way things were.
Q.	And these people who didn't include (sic) the same ideology included children, didn't they?
A.	Could you repeat the question, please? 
Q.	These people who didn't have the same ideology as the attackers, they included children, didn't they?
A.	Listen, when you're a parent and you have children, small children, you see people getting killed, can you run away and leave a small child at home?  No.  You might be separated for other reasons, but you can't abandon your children and flee alone.  So, the parents fled with their children. 
Q.	But those children were killed, weren't they, in many instances where the parents were considered to be accomplices?
A.	I would say in my experience -- I have no experience in explosives or ballistics, but I think that when you fire into a crowd, the bullets can't distinguish adults from children.  I have no experience in the matter, but I don't think that the bullet chooses its target.
Q.	It is not the bullet that aims and fires the weapon, though, is it, Witness?
A.	Well, to cut a long story short, there is proverb in Kinyarwanda which says that when you hit the mice, you don't hit the one that is pregnant.  If someone wants to kill you and your family, they will not spare the children.
Q.	So, Witness, when you were asked to go and work, you were obviously concerned because you resisted, and you were beaten.  It's correct, isn't it?
A.	In view of what had happened at Rukira, wasn't I entitled to be afraid?  I was concerned.  I was even injured. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter wishes to add that in the preceding answer, the witness had given two Rwandan proverbs.  The first is that when you are killing mice, you don't spare the ones that are pregnant.  And the second proverb was that when you strike a dog, you seek its master.  That was added by the Kinyarwanda booth.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Q.	How many of you were in the group that went from Nyarutunga to Nyarubuye parish?
A.	I said that three people forced me out with Alfred from where we stayed.  We were therefore five people, but we found ourselves in a large group.  Some people walked, others got into vehicles, boarded vehicles, but the group was very large.  So we, the five of us, went to the road.  When we got to the road we found a large group of people, and it was then that we all together went to the parish.
Q.	Now, you've told us that you walked to the parish.  How many people were there in the group you were walking with?
A.	How can I explain?  Have you already seen a group of people demonstrating?  It was similar.  Can you count demonstrators when you are aware that the circumstances did not make it possible for us to stop and count?  I can't give you a figure, but it was a very large group.  We were in a very large group.
Q.	Amongst that large group of people who were walking, how many people were guarding you?
A.	I said that Alfred and myself were abducted by three people.  When we got to the road, we found a larger group.  There were people saying, "You are accomplices.  Go, go."  I was not in a position to know how many people exactly were pushing us, but we were under threat.  People were shouting at us and telling us to leave.
Q.	Now, Witness, these captors are people who were urging that accomplices be killed.  Are you now having us believe that they would simply have put you into a large group and walked you along the road?
MR. KOUENGOUA: 
	Madam President,  objection.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	What is you objection, Counsel?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
There is some confusion with regard to the responses given by the witness.  That is a very speculative question, unless the translation I have is different from what is being put to the witness.  What I understand is that these are questions, the entire questions, it is clear that suggestions are being made to him.  The witness is being led, particularly in this last question.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
	Counsel for the Prosecution, please proceed.
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness, answer the question, please.
A.	Did you ask me whether people were being led in a group along on the road?  If that is the question, yes, indeed.  People were being beaten up, others were avoiding being hit by clubs and batons, and we continued on our journey and we left.
Q.	My question, Witness, was, these captors you say were rounding people up, telling them that they had to "work," to kill accomplices, would you now have us believe that all they did, having named you and others as accomplices, was to put you into a large group of people and walk you along the road?
A.	I don't quite understand your question.
Q.	Witness, you told us that the people who captured you were saying that you were accomplices, and they were saying, "Go, go."  You said, "I didn't know how many people were pushing us.  They were threatening us and told us to leave."  Do you remember just having said that?
A.	Yes, I do remember.
Q.	These are the attackers, the same captors, who told you to go to work, weren't they?
A.	Yes, I also said that.
Q.	And you told us that going to work means killing accomplices, didn't you?
A.	Yes, at the time the term "work" meant to kill.  That term acquired that meaning following the massacres that occurred in Rukira.  That was the first time I understood that particular meaning of the word.  In view of the fact that I knew that meaning, when they asked us to go and work, I understood immediately that it meant to kill the people who had sought refuge in Nyarubuye.
Q.	And you understood that without being told you were going to Nyarubuye.  That's correct, isn't it, Witness?
A.	I had already heard that.  I had already understood that, but I did not have the means to do otherwise.  I was very afraid, and I person (sic) was insignificant.  I saved my life because I was feeling pain.  People had hit me and they had spat on me.  I tried to hide in the crowd in order not be hit, but that does not mean that I agreed with the work which we were being called upon to do.
Q.	Now, Witness, when you walked from Alfred's place to the parish, you told us that you hid on the way.  Where was it that you were hiding?
A.	I said that it was at a professional school that we call CERAI.  Very close to that school were rocks, and you could hide between those rocks.  That is where I hid with Alfred, but it was in vain because we were flushed out and we were even seriously beaten up because of this attempt to flee.
Q.	Those people who beat you were very angry with you, weren't they?
A.	Oh, yes, oh, yes.  They were very angry.  It is not necessary to know a person, but when you see a person, you'll find that he is completely transformed and there is no sign of humanity in the expression on his face.  That is how I can describe those people.
Q.	Now, how were these captors dressed?  What were they wearing?
A.	They were wearing ordinary clothes.  They had folded their trousers up to the knees.  They were wearing either coats or vests, and there were grenades or machetes or clubs dangling on their belts.  When somebody has hitched up his trousers up to the knees or dressed in the manner I just described, you should understand that it is not ordinary clothing.   Those people were frightful, frightening to see.
Q.	So having told you that they thought you were an accomplice and in having later found you running from the group and hiding they beat you, what injuries did you sustain?
A.	I don't know why you keep coming back to this question.  What I said was that I was wounded at the parish.  When we were forcibly asked to lift objects, someone hit me with a plank, which we call technically a madrier.  Of course we were hit, but I wasn't wounded and I didn't bleed.  The wounds I incurred were at the parish, and that is where I bled.  I noticed in the parish that people were carrying cupboards.  I tried to assist them.  All I did was put my hand to the cupboard and we carried the cupboards right to the vehicle. 
Q.	When you were found hiding amongst the stones, what were you beaten with?
A.	I said that they were carrying batons and clubs, and on their belts dangled all these traditional weapons, and they would use the clubs to hit you on the neck to hurt you and to force you to do what they wanted.  They had no pity.  Those people hit you very seriously.  I don't know whether you have ever witnessed such incidents in the past.  

There is an exercise that cattle rearers do.  They sprinkle products on cows to kill lice or ticks.  And when the cattle is reluctant to move in that direction, they are hit with sticks.  It was similar to that.  They were hitting us, and if you tried to flee or to fall out of line, they would -- they could hurl -- they could throw lances at you or kill you with guns, because some of them were armed with guns.
Q.	Witness, I want you to listen carefully to the question that I am asking you: You have told us that you were seriously beaten by these very, very angry people.  I'm asking you, what did they beat you with?  You personally, what did they beat you with?
A.	I notice that you want to dwell on the fact that I was hit, on the fact that I was wounded.  I told you that I was wounded by a blow that I received with a plank.  Before we got to Nyarubuye, we were hit with batons and sticks.  These were the sticks they used to hit me. I was very lucky.  Some of the attackers had cables, and they were using these cables to hit people.  I was lucky that they used only sticks to hit me.
Q.	Now, the vehicles had gone on ahead of the group that was walking, hadn't they?
A.	You perhaps did not properly understand what I said.  There were some vehicles moving ahead of the crowd; there were others following behind.  It was the people who were transported in those vehicles who stayed behind and were hitting people, beating up people in their homes.  I don't know whether before these vehicles came there were others that had passed, but there were vehicles that were following behind and that were conveying the attackers.
Q.	Now, Witness, you said that some of the vehicles went ahead of you, haven't you?
A.	What do you mean?  How come you recall that I said that some vehicles came and headed for the parish while others remained on the spot, and the people who came out of these vehicles went into peoples' homes to look for them?  If you are taking down some notes, you -- I am sure you would have found what -- these details.
Q.	Witness, can you sit forward, please, so that I can see you?  Thank you.  

Witness, how many vehicles did you see in front of the group of people that was walking?
A.	Have you properly understood what I said?  I told you that there were vehicles that had passed well before.  I know the vehicles.  The vehicle leading was owned by the gendarmes. There were others following, and I don't know who owned them.  A short while later, the others went to various houses to rally people.  I don't know the number of vehicles; however, behind us there were vehicles, but I can't tell you the exact number of vehicles there were.
Q.	Now, Witness, what colour was the vehicle you did recognise, the one you said the gendarmes were in?  What colour was the vehicle?
A.	Are you referring to the vehicle that was in front of the others?  It was a pick-up, as far as I can remember.  It was a white pick-up, if my memory serves right.  But as you see, in the prevailing circumstances, remembering the colour of the objects you saw and to remember such details nine or more years later, it's not easy.  You're asking for the colour of the vehicle, whether it was white or yellow.  What I saw was a gendarmerie vehicle moving at top speed, and behind that vehicle were others following.  As regards the colour of the vehicle, I crave your indulgence.  I can't quite remember, but I know it was a pick-up.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you please answer the questions accurately and avoid making comments. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Q.	So apart from the gendarmerie vehicle that you saw leading the other group of vehicles, how many vehicles were there in the group?  So you saw the gendarmerie vehicle and you saw other vehicles following.  How many other vehicles were following?
A.	I explained to you that I didn't have time to count those vehicles.  No one could have counted them.  No one was in a position to know the number of vehicles that went to that area, so I am not in a position to give you the exact number.
Q.	Now, how many people did you see sitting in the cabin of the pick-up, the white pick-up that led the group?
A.	You're asking whether I know the number of people who were in the cabin?  When you -- if you were the one who stood there and you saw a vehicle passing, would you have been able to see the people sitting in the cabin?  What I know is that the pick-ups I know in Rwanda have space only for three people in the cabin, but it was possible that there were people sitting behind.
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, I am obliged to say the same thing to you again.  You are not answering the questions with any precision.  If you are not able to answer the question, please simply say that you are not able to know the number of people sitting in the vehicle, but please try to avoid making comments. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us the length of time that elapsed between when you saw the white pick-up and the time that you started walking towards the parish?
A.	No, the time was not -- it wasn't a long time, but I did not have a watch which would have enabled me to assess the exact duration of the time, so I am not in a position to tell you how many minutes elapsed during that period.
Q.	Now, Witness, if it took you 20 to 30 minutes to walk to the parish, that's common sense, isn't it, that a vehicle would cover that distance on the road -- 
MR KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The counsel for the Prosecution has gone too far.  The witness said that he didn't know the time.  Can we suppose that -- Madam President, the witness has said that he doesn't know -- they give him norms he doesn't understand, and he's asked "can we suppose"?  Can the witness answer such questions that have to do with suppositions, Madam President?  I think you should intervene and clinch this argument.  I think the suppositions go beyond what the witness has said that he saw and heard.
JUDGE REDDY:
Isn't that more a matter of comment?  It must tend to common sense that and to reason that it would take a motor vehicle much less time to travel a distance than to walk, so that's more a matter of comment, isn't it, rather than argument with this witness?  It can be the subject matter of your submissions at the closing.
MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MOBBERLEY: 
Q.	Now, Witness, by the time you arrived at the parish, it's correct, isn't it, that the parish had already been surrounded by attackers?
A.	Didn't I say that the people who had gone first had gone in the direction of the parish and that they were stationed at the parish?  And those of us who arrived after that was similar, the same thing happened. 
Q.	When you were arrived at the parish, the vehicles had arrived before you, hadn't they?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	They were parked, weren't they, when you arrived?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And there was no one sitting in the vehicles, was there?
A.	I didn't look inside the vehicles.
Q.	Now, I am going to ask you this question again because I suspect that the meaning wasn't quite clear when I asked it the first time.  Witness, when you arrived, the attackers had already taken their positions surrounding the parish, hadn't they, the attackers who'd arrived before you?
A.	Didn't I say that people had gone up there well before I did?  And once they reached that place, the persons in charge had told them where to go in order to prevent those in the compound from escaping.  And subsequently, those who arrived joined the group that had preceded us, but there were still leaders who gave orders as to where people should position themselves.
Q.	Now, it's correct that at the front of this group of attackers were people with firearms and grenades, isn't it?
A.	I don't really understand your question.  Could you please repeat your question?
Q.	At the front of the group of attackers were people with firearms and grenades.  That's correct, isn't it?
A.	Didn't I tell you that the gendarmes were armed with firearms, grenades and streams? 
Q.	They were at the front of the group of attackers, weren't they, Witness?
A.	What do you mean in front?  You have said they were in front.  What do you mean by that?
Q.	I asked you if these people were armed with firearms, grenades and stream guns, were in the front, the first line of attack in the group of attackers.  That's correct, isn't it?
A.	Isn't this what I stated?  I believe I have already stated that.
Q.	And the second line of attack involved people with traditional weapons who were willing to be involved in the massacre.  That's correct, too, isn't it, Witness?
A.	Well, I think it would be difficult to line people up in that manner.  You know, if there's a crowd and people are elbowing one another and they are forced into the crowd, I am not sure this will bring us to -- lead us to anything.  I am not sure I can explain this.  There is people that are being pushed and forced to go.  So there was no specific, normal procedure that should be followed.  There is no order to follow.  There is a certain amount of disorder.  And I don't think I can answer your question, unless we were to actually take the time for me to tell you exactly how events followed one another, for me to tell you about the whole sequence of events.
Q.	Witness, how big was this crowd that was elbowing each other?  Was it a small crowd or a very large crowd?
A.	In a few words, I could say that all of those who lived near the road were regrouped, were gathered, with the exception of women and children.  So, all the men, all the young male adults, were requisitioned to participate in this.  And so asking me to make an approximation of the persons, in view that some had even come in vehicles, it would be difficult.  I am sure that if you were in my place or you were in my shoes, you would not be able to give us a number.
Q.	Is that because events were so confusing, Witness?
A.	I have told you that the day before I had seen similar events, and so the fear inside me didn't allow me to observe the events around me, and I could not follow the events in a serene manner in order to tell you the number of vehicles.  I don't know because of my condition, because of my feelings.
Q.	Now, Witness, you were being pushed into this crowd and you were terrified.  That's correct; isn't it?
A.	Yes, that's what I said.
Q.	And amongst people armed with serious weaponry, you were armed with a little stick, weren't you?
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.
Q.	Among the attackers there were people who wanted to be there and be involved in the attack.  You could see them, couldn't you?
A.	I have told you that the people of the locality were surprised with what they saw.  When someone had a machete within hand's reach and they were forced to come, they were rounded up, they took their machete.  But most people just grabbed sticks or branches that were lying around.
Q.	There was a lot of noise, wasn't there, Witness?
A.	You will have to forgive me, but I will try and give you an example.  If you were to go to the market square, do you really think that you can distinguish the individual voices of the sellers and buyers?  There was a lot of noise, and you cannot really make heads or tails of what is going on.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
I have no further questions, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Do you have any questions, the Presiding Judges?  Judge Reddy would like to ask a question.  
JUDGE REDDY:
I have questions I'd like to ask you, but let me assure you that I ask these questions only so that I can understand your evidence better, and they're not calculated to in any way discredit whatever you've told us.  Do you understand that?  

First of all, in the -- at the parish, you said that someone, it doesn't matter who, who was a leader said to the crowd, "Whoever thinks that he is innocent should step aside".  Do you remember that?  Do you remember saying that? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, that is what I stated, yes.
JUDGE REDDY:
As a result, according to you, a few people moved aside.  Is that correct?
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct.
JUDGE REDDY:
Leaving a large majority of the people on the other side, the people that did not move; is that correct?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, that's correct. Some persons preferred to stay where they were.
JUDGE REDDY:
And that would be the majority, is that correct?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, those who -- there were a few who stepped out from the group.  To tell you the truth, the majority remained.  I did not see them, but I could hear the noise they were making.  I could hear the people moving about in the compound.

JUDGE REDDY: 
So the people who moved aside, the minority, were the people who were referred to as the innocent, as you understood it; is that right?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, that is how I understood it.
JUDGE REDDY:
What did you understand by that word "innocent"?  Who were the innocent, as you understood it? 
THE WITNESS: 
To this very day I ponder that question.  Everyone had come to that location because of the insecurity, and so I am not sure what you mean by the word innocent.  Someone who doesn't feel guilty.
JUDGE REDDY: 
What I would like to know from you is, what did you understand when this word was used on that day?  What did it take, as far as you were concerned, to be innocent?  Obviously it must have meant something because a few people who thought they were innocent stepped aside.  What did you understand by those who thought they were innocent?
THE WITNESS: 
I have told you that to this very day I ask myself that question, because you had a group of people who were gathered in one location and those who were innocent should stand up and the others remained sitting down, and this is something that I don't understand and that I cannot understand.
JUDGE REDDY:
And you can't explain, fair enough.  

Now, it was the group, it was the group, the larger group, that was not -- who did not consider them innocent -- themselves innocent were the ones who were butchered, isn't it?  Is that right?
THE WITNESS: 
Those remained (sic) in the compound were killed, but those who left, those who did not feel guilty of anything, came to join the others that seem (sic) on the outside.
(Pages 18 to 33 by Petrus Chijarira)










	1215H
JUDGE REDDY:
All right.  Can I ask you, that those who stepped aside and thought that they were innocent, were the Hutu? 
THE WITNESS:
	Well, you know, if you were not raised with someone and you didn't know this person's life story or if you hadn't known the person and the circumstances, could you really know whether this person was Hutu or Tutsi?  In any case, I cannot determine.  I cannot look at someone and decide when the person is Hutu or Tutsi.  I cannot do this.
JUDGE REDDY:
All right.  Did anyone in a position of leadership, such as the man you described, say to the crowd, "The Hutus should separate, should move out and step aside"?  Did you hear any such thing said?
THE WITNESS:
	I'm sorry, Your Honour, I didn't properly understand your question.  If you would be so kind as to rephrase it in another manner, I would be most grateful.
JUDGE REDDY:
All right.  You told us that you heard someone say, "Whoever thinks that he's innocent should step aside."  You've already agreed with me that you did hear that said, didn't you? 
THE WITNESS:
	That's correct.
JUDGE REDDY:
Now, I am asking you, did you hear anyone say the Hutus in the crowd should move aside or step aside?  Did you hear any such thing said?
THE WITNESS:
	You see, when you follow such words and you have to be called -- you can understand this, but the situations to not calm or serene.  I heard that whoever thinks he is innocent should step away from the group.  This is what I heard.
JUDGE REDDY:
All right, there is one other subject on which I wish to ask you some questions.  

You remember you said that when these criminals -- and you called them criminals -- came up to you and your friend and they said to you, "What are you doing here?  Why are you not working?  You should go to work."  Do you remember that? 
THE WITNESS:
	I said that those persons found us in front of my friend's house.  We were sitting on the porch.  We had our backs to the wall, and they were quite furious.  They told us, "Stand up, cowards.  You are accomplices."  And they were beating us and pushing us in the direction of the road.  I believe that this is what I stated.
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, and you said they wanted you to go to work, didn't you?
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, they said, "Why aren't you helping the others to work?"  This is the question they were asking us.
JUDGE REDDY:
And you also told us that you understood by this expression "to work", to go and kill.  Is that right, that's what you told us? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, because of the events that had taken place in my commune.  I had heard this word pronounced before, and so in my mind it could only have meant to perpetrate atrocities such as that.
JUDGE REDDY:
And you also told us that you understood that you were being asked to kill the accomplices.  Remember that? 
THE WITNESS:
	Now, I was being accused of being an accomplice, just as my friend was.  All those who were not actively following them were accused of being an accomplice.
JUDGE REDDY:
And that included you, because you were not -- you were not following them? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, that is what they had called me.
JUDGE REDDY:
So, who did you think they expected you to go and kill? 
THE WITNESS:
	No, they didn't point at any specific person saying go and tell kill this person.  I cannot tell you as to whether I was asked to kill this or that person.  Some persons had sought refuge in places for their own reasons --
JUDGE REDDY:
Well, you told us that--
THE WITNESS:
	-- but these were persons who felt they were guilty of something.
JUDGE REDDY:
But you told us that, as you understood it, an accomplice was someone who did not share the same ideology as the aggressors, the criminals that you described.  Isn't that right? 
THE WITNESS:
	I believe that is what I stated, Your Honour.

JUDGE REDDY:
And who were these people with whom they didn't share the same ideology, as you understood it? 
THE WITNESS:
	Your Honour, you are asking me to give the name of this or that person, but I could not know what was going on in people's minds.  I told you there was a group of persons who came from the neighbouring commune -- the commune neighbouring Rusumo.  They are the ones in the forefront.  They are the ones who came from Birenga.  They are the ones who perpetrated the atrocities.  Of course, there are others who wanted to assist them in their work, so subsequently, they went all the way up to Nyarubuye to perpetrate the same atrocities.  Therefore, I am not in a position to tell you who it was.  I can tell you only that it was a group of criminals who was participating in criminal activities.
JUDGE REDDY:
So you do not know who it was with whom they did not share the same ideology.  Is that what you are telling us?  Is that your evidence?
THE WITNESS:
	I do not know them.
JUDGE REDDY:
Thank you very much, Witness, for answering my questions. 
THE WITNESS:
	I also thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you told us a moment ago that someone from Birenga was killed immediately.  Can you tell us who was this person and who killed this person? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, that's what I stated.  This incident took place in Rukira, and it was at a time when attackers had launched an attack on Rukira.  They arrived -- this was someone who was originally from Birenga -- and they killed this person in front of the dispensary in Rukira.  It is between the school and the dispensary, actually, that is where the person was killed.  I do not know this person's name and I do not know the name of the person who killed this person.  And people were bragging saying, "What did this person flee (sic)."  Yes, I remember the man, but I don't know his name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Not interpreted)
THE WITNESS:
	I told you that all this took place in the afternoon.  As to how long it lasted -- or, rather, how long I remained there, even if I had a watch, which I didn't have, I would not have really had the heart to look at my watch.  And I therefore cannot know what time it was when I left that location.  I cannot tell you exactly how long I was there.  And so at one point I was able to escape and I went to hide in the bush, but I would not be able to tell you how long I remained there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And it was still daylight when you left the parish, wasn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
	It was the evening.  Yes, it was still daylight, but you could not clearly distinguish something that was 300 metres away, so I would say that it was actually at dusk.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Were you able to determine at that location whether the bodies represented 100 bodies, more than 100 bodies, much more than 100 bodies?  Without giving us an exact figure, perhaps you could give us an approximation.
THE WITNESS:
	There were many bodies because the crowd was quite numerous.  There were bodies scattered in the parking, in the courtyard, in front of the buildings, in front of the presbytery, I was not able to count the bodies, but there were a lot of bodies.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Were there both women, children and men? 
THE WITNESS:
	I have said that the bullets that were fired did not spare anyone.  Those who shot at these persons did not distinguish amongst the crowd.  They would fire their firearms at women, children and men, anyone who was in the crowd or had sought refuge there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You did not answer my question.  I asked you whether there were women and children amongst the bodies. 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I told you that there were corpses of all sorts of people.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you are not in a position even to give an approximate figure, to give us an approximate number.

I don't know whether I have followed correctly, but you told us that the gendarme were wearing red berets and the policemen black berets.  Is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
	No, I think you misunderstood me.  When I spoke of policemen it was in answer to a question that had been put to me.  I was asked how I could distinguish a gendarme.  I said that in Rwanda there was a unit called the gendarme, others were called commandos.  Some wore black berets.  I don't know who they were exactly, but the communal policemen, they wore yellow berets, but the gendarme wore red berets, and the people I saw wore red berets.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are therefore able to distinguish gendarme from a policeman? 
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, quite so.  I know how to distinguish a communal policeman from a gendarme.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you specify at which moment you were wounded on the head, as you stated previously? 
THE WITNESS:
	First of all, I must apologise because I don't know the exact time, but after those events occurred, after the grenades exploded and there had been firing, people were asked to go into the houses and take out the goods that were there, the properties that were there.  That was when I was injured on the head.  I was pushed.  One of the assailants, who was angry, struck me on the head, on the left side with a board of wood -- with a wooden board.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, do you wish to re-examine the witness? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Lordships.  The Defence has no further questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Counsel.  

Witness, you have finished giving your testimony.  We thank you for having come here to testify and we wish you a safe return.
THE WITNESS:
	I equally thank you, Madam President.
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
According to the information in our -- we have, there is no further witnesses here in Arusha apart from the one who is still ill.  Is that correct, Counsel Kouengoua? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, that is the information that the Defence was also given at the brief adjournment.  And yesterday we had expressed the wish in our hope that that witness be in a position to testify today, but what the deputy chief of the section, I think it is, told us makes us a bit unhappy.  Because according to what he said, it might -- the witness might not be in a position to testify tomorrow, either.  

That is the situation, Madam President.  Perhaps we could go and see him to see if he could come tomorrow.  Otherwise, all my calculations are not bearing out.  

I don't know what I can say to the Trial Chamber -- what remains for me to say to the Trial Chamber.  Yesterday I said I hoped he could testify today, and today we were told in the course of the hearing that even tomorrow he might not be able to testify.  That is the information given to me, I have not been able to verify it for myself.  

I am seriously embarrassed that -- the Defence team that I represent is embarrassed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you wish to take the floor? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
No, Your Honours.  We have a fait accompli.  If he is able to appear tomorrow, we'd be ready to proceed.  If he is not we can't do much about it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, do you think you could inform us this afternoon whether your witness can testify tomorrow?  Can you tell us this afternoon or can't you, at least to -- whether the witness can testify tomorrow or if he can't? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
	Madam President, our wish would have been if there was no hearing, it would be Friday, so the witness should testify today or tomorrow.  What I can undertake to do is to telephone the WVSS as soon as we adjourn and then inform you and the Office of the Prosecution.  This is very unfortunate.  From Wednesday to Friday, as -- it's not very agreeable, but what can we do?  We are faced with a fait accompli.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will adjourn and see if it is possible to sit tomorrow, if the witness is in a position to come.  Otherwise, we will have to sit on Friday if the witness is only able to appear on Friday, and it will have to be Friday morning because we can't meet in the afternoon, so we should try to finish on Friday. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam, perhaps if we could just telephone to the Trial Chamber III co-ordinator, the information would be disseminated, because if we have -- I think it would be enough for me to telephone the Trial Chamber co-ordinator.  In that way, everyone would get the information.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can inform the Trial Chamber co-ordinator and also the Prosecutor's office.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Oh, I meant that -- but I meant that especially as far as the Trial Chamber was concerned.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  

We will now adjourn until tomorrow or the day after, according to how things go.  Thank you.
