MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is in session.  Registrar would you please read the cause list.
MR. HOMETOWU:
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andrésia Vaz, presiding, and Judge Sergey Alekseevich Egorov, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 15 October 2003, for a continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, Case Number ICTR-2001-64-T. Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, the registry.  Good day, ladies and gentlemen.  We are going to continue with the Defence case.  There are only two Judges sitting this morning, and this is done pursuant to Rule 15 bis in the absence of our colleague, Judge Reddy.  There are no changes as far as the parties are concerned, both on the Prosecutor's side and the Defence side.  And I'm therefore going to ask Counsel Kouengoua to tell us which witness shall be heard this morning.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good morning, Madam President, good morning, Your Honour.  Good morning to the Office of the Prosecutor and the members of the registry.  Good morning to the interpreters and the court reporters.  

	Before I give the name of the witness the Defence intends to call first this morning, I would like to advise the Honourable Trial Chamber that this witness is the one that we had been waiting for and had to deal with quite serious health problems.  And with his agreement, of course, we thought that perhaps we could hear his testimony this morning.  But Madam President, Your Honour, I would like to ask the Trial Chamber for the following -- I would like to make the following request.  I hope this witness will come to testify, but I think that we should consider his testimony as given on his hospital bed.  Even though I have not been told what exactly he is suffering of, he is still not feeling well now,  and I would respectfully request that all parties take into consideration the health of this witness.  

Moreover, Madam President, the Defence is of the opinion that as Rule 15 bis is still an application, we are considering other hypotheses, at least on the Defence's side, to see how we can find other solutions to this delicate problem that we have had to deal with.  But we shall make our application at the appropriate time.  

	And so, Witness ZHZ shall now be appearing before the Trial Chamber this morning.  I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, we thank you.  Please bring the witness in.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, after Witness ZHZ we shall be hearing witness MG1.  And after that, if there are no changes, we shall hear Witness YEW.  These witnesses were on the list that we had communicated on Friday.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel.  Please bring the witness in.  Please bring Witness ZHZ in.  

Mr. Prosecutor, do you have something to say --
MR. KAREGYESA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor is inquiring whether his application to have these proceedings recorded on video is going to be resolved within this session.  

The second point is that Counsel did not have the courtesy of informing this Chamber of the change in the order of witnesses.  According to the list filed on the 13th of October -- the 10th of October, Witness MG1 was supposed to be followed by Witness YCW.  Counsel has just mentioned that Witness YEW is the one to follow MG1.  If we could have a clarification of that, Your Honours?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As to your first application, we had stated what our opinion was of the matter, and we are still waiting to hear from the Defence, because as we had stated, we need to know whether the appropriate technology is in place so that -- to suggest something that would be agreeable to all parties.  And the Defence, of course, was supposed to agree or not, as these are Defence witnesses are protected witnesses.  

Now, as to your second question, I will turn to Counsel Kouengoua and see if he has any explanations to provide to the Prosecution with respect to the change in the order in which the witnesses shall appear.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The reason for this change is not due to the Defence; we are having to face an exceptional situation.  The witness that is appearing this morning is the one who should have testified almost ten days ago, at the beginning of the trial.  And I think all of the parties, even those who are not concerned -- like the witness support section -- are concerned by the health of this witness.  And the physician, I believe, has raised certain delicate matters, and we have to deal with this.  Do we keep this man with witnesses when, in fact, he should have completed his testimony and then gone to the hospital?  We don't know.  And we have had to face this difficulty, Madam President.  And we felt that we should bring Witness ZHZ as soon as possible.  

Now, as to the second witness, the second witness is the one that we communicated since the 10th of October.  And Madam President, I don't believe that any problem should arise from this because if we were supposed to hear -- as we were supposed to since the 10th -- two or three witnesses per day, that is true, we would not have reached this witness.  But we are just saying, if we put ZHZ instead of MG1, that is because there was this situation.  

However, as far as YCW and YEW, the last letter that the Prosecutor is referring to, it states as follows:  "As far as Witness BK1 -"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Counsel is reading the pseudonyms too fast for the English booth.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
In view of the fact that the above-witnesses have not yet arrived --
MS. MOBBERLEY:
The English booth has indicated that they cannot keep up with the list of pseudonyms that Counsel is reading out.  He will have to read slowly for the English booth.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you are going much too fast for the pseudonyms and the interpreters cannot keep up. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I thought that as the list had been disclosed since the 10th, it would no longer cause any problems.  

With respect to Witnesses NG1, XCW, YEW, UPT, BK1, these are amongst the witnesses listed in the last paragraph of my letter dated 10 October.  And I had stated that this was done with all due reservations -- subject to certain reservations because we had advised the Trial Chamber that we wished to proceed fast -- fastly, but we couldn't.  We weren't sure that we would be able to proceed in this manner, so we had said subject to the availability of the witnesses, and also taking into consideration the fact that when we sent the list, the witnesses had not yet arrived in Arusha.  And this is why the Office of the Prosecutor feels there is a change, when, in fact, there is no change.  

The Trial Chamber is following the logic imposed by the situation.  We have not changed anything.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, can you tell us whether all of the witnesses that you have mentioned were here on Monday, on the 10th of October?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Which witnesses?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The ones you have just read out, YCW, YEW, all of the witnesses that you've mentioned, MG1 and UPT.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
	I'm sorry, I cannot answer that question, Madam President.  What is certain is that when we were writing the letter, I think that there was no one else.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, you don't know whether all of these witnesses had arrived on Monday, and you were not able to verify that they had arrived because -- you know, the question that has been put to you is that you have reversed the rule.   The point isn't the witness.  We understand that ZHZ was ill and is now testifying because he is feeling better.  We all understand that.  But as far as Witness NG1 and YCW, which you have scheduled to testify this morning, you have changed the order, and that is the question that was put to you by the Prosecutor. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No, we did not change the order of NG1.  NG1's order was never changed.  And even if he was, we had said subject to availability of Witness NG1, YCW and YEW, UPT and BK1; we said subject to reservations.  And our letter had two parts.  The first part was our hope and then the second part was, in fact, tempered by reality.  You cannot ask us to be more diligent than we have been.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, in view of the explanations provided by Counsel Kouengoua, may we proceed with the witnesses?
MR. KAREGYESA:
We may proceed with the witness, Your Honours, subject, of course, to my availing Your Lordships of the letter of 10th October given to us by Counsel.  He has referred to Witness BK1.  Witness BK1 does not appear in this letter.  The order is clear from this letter, and it is disruptive, to say the least, when this order is changed without due courtesy of informing us.  I called Counsel at 2:45 on Friday,      10th October, and he said he had delayed in filing this order of appearance because witnesses hadn't arrived.  

Now, he informed me that he had just been informed as of 2:45 on Friday that the witnesses had, indeed, arrived in Arusha as of Friday.  Now, he could have informed us on Monday, a day before yesterday, if he intended to change the order.  

Basically what I am saying, Your Honours, it is disruptive and we may be compelled to seek a short, maybe ten minutes' adjournment so that we, you know, can arrange our documents and prepare for the cross-examination of an unexpected witness.  Most obliged.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, we take note of what the Prosecutor has said.  

	Counsel Kouengoua, I think that you will also understand the problem, because if they prepared to cross-examine one witness and they are given another witness, this can, of course, cause problems in the order of the -- in the work of the Prosecutors.  Therefore, we would like to ask you to disclose the order of appearance of your witnesses and to abide by that.  If there is a change, you must inform everyone in due -- with enough time to allow everyone to deal with this matter.  

	In any case, you may now proceed with Witness ZHZ.  Counsel Mbattang will be leading this witness, I believe.
MS. MBATTANG:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well. 

Good day, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and you shall testify under pseudonym ZHZ.  The Defence is going to examine you, and then the Prosecutor shall cross-examine you, and the Judges shall perhaps seek clarification.  The Defence will also -- or may also, rather, lead a re-examination.  We are aware of the fact that you are in a bit of poor health, and everyone here will do everything possible so as to ensure that we do not infringe on your health.  We will do everything we can to deal with your health.  But, of course, you will have to answer the questions that are put to you.  

You shall now make a solemn declaration, and the registry will assist you to make your solemn declaration.
MR. JUMA:
Witness, could you please stand, raise your right hand and repeat the following words after me. (Declaration made by Witness ZHZ in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness, and the registry. 

Counsel Mbattang, you may now proceed. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honour.  Good morning to the Office of the Prosecutor.  Good morning to the Court Reporters, good morning to the Registry, and good morning to the Interpreters.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, we can hear other interpreters.  Please be careful what you say in the booth because this is coming through the microphone.
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, before I request a closed session, I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to the fact that we thought that we should interview this witness for a three-hour period of time.  In view of his health, we are going to reduce this time, and I'm sure the Trial Chamber will understand.  Having said this, I am going to first of all request a closed session because I am going to put questions to the witness which might lead to the identity of the witness being revealed, and after that I shall move into open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall now move into closed session in order to assure the protection of the witness.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we are now in open session.  Pray proceed.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, in 1994 did you have opportunity to meet Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	Is the question you are asking me concerning the whole year of 1994 or any specific period?
Q.	Without details, please, in 1994?
A.	Yes, I was a responsible.  I was free in my movements in the communes, consequently, I met him.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, can you tell us in what year Mr. Gacumbitsi was appointed bourgmestre?
A.	If my memory serves me right, it must have been in 1983.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said that you were free to move throughout Rusumo commune.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber which part of Rusumo commune -- in which part were there the most Tutsi inhabitants?
A.	I did not undertake a population census, but to my mind, Nyarubuye where I lived had numerous Tutsi inhabitants, as well as Nyabitare and Kankogwa.  I could also mention Musaze.  There is also another place where there were people who had come from Uganda and which had been settled in that part of the present farming section or development.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, to the best of your recollection, can you tell the Trial Chamber when the Tutsi settled in those areas?  I said to the best of your recollection.
A.	After 1983, the Tutsi began to settle in those areas.  They were provisionally settled in those areas as refugees.  With time, after a couple of years, they were given title to lands as full citizens.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, where were you in April 1994?
A.	In April 1994, I was at home.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has already stated, says the Kinyanrwanda booth, it is not a locality.  It is even narrower than that, points out the Kinyarwandan interpreter.
MS. MBATTANG:
Agreed.  The witness said, "I was at home, at my home."
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The microphone is not on.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Where and when did you hear of President Habyarimana's death? 
A.	I learned of President Habyarimana death on Wednesday, the 6th of April 1994, at about -- at about    9 p.m.  There was an announcement on the radio, and I was at home.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, can you tell the Trial Chamber what was your -- what were your political affiliations?
A.	I was one of the (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) members of the liberal party in Rusumo commune.  I was, in fact, (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).

MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, forgive me again.  I perhaps asked a question which could reveal the identity of the witness because he said he was secretary of a political party.  Could we strike that from the record?  I will make an effort, Madam, not to commit that mistake again in the future.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  That item will be struck from the record.  We can say that he was a member of the PL party, the liberal party, but not in what capacity.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, can you tell us which was the majority ethnic group in your political party?  The members of your political party, in the majority, to which ethnic group did they belong?
A.	When I look at the membership of our party in our locality, I would say that the majority were Tutsi, but that does not mean that our Tutsi included only Tutsi, no, but they were numerous in our party.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said before that on the 6th of April 1994 at 9 p.m., you heard an announcement concerning the death of the president.  Can you tell us what was your reaction at the announcement of that sad news?
A.	I had nothing to do.  I was surprised; everybody was surprised.  And just as any other citizen was, I felt a bit lost, but I told myself we -- the country was in a critical situation, we just lost the head of state.  I was awaiting the information as to the day of the president's funeral.  But I had no particular reaction on my own part.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said that you heard the news over the radio.  Which radio station was it?
A.	I heard the news on Radio Rwanda.  Whether it was RTLM or Radio Rwanda, I think that the communique was read on both, but as far as I am concerned I heard it on Radio Rwanda, from Radio Rwanda.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, can you tell us what was the reaction of the population in your locality?
A.	That night we all went to sleep, and in the morning we were lost, confused.  I lived in the trading centre where the people tried to meet to exchange ideas, but everyone was panicked, was         panic-stricken and we expected the worst, because rumours were ripe, according to which the invincible, the Kinani, was killed, people will celebrate his death, but we were asking ourselves as to what to do.  We wondered where we could go because we were very worried and anxious.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, I should like to return to the matter of political parties.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber whether your political party was pro-government or pro-RPF?
A.	I was a member of that party because the MRND had been in power for a long time.  And you must know that when the winds of democracy has blown in any country, then you must absolutely have an opposition.  So as far as I was concerned, I saw that there was a party call.  The liberal party that was born, its devout purpose was the pursuit of liberty, so I thought I could join that party because I thought it could be a forum where I could express my ideas.  Consequently, certain of the PL party's objectives coincided with some of the RPF's objectives.  RPF said there was injustice, oppression, and that is why I said that on certain points, the PL party was on the side of the RPF, in the light of what I just said.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you have told us what your position was in -- within the party. Can you tell us who was the MRND chairman in your commune?
A.	The MRND chairman was a neighbour, an ex -- his name was Edmond Bungingo, spelt B- U -- B-U-N-G-I-N-G-O, Edmond.  He was the chairman of the MRND.
Q.	To your knowledge, Witness ZHZ, when Mr. Gacumbitsi was bourgmestre of Rusumo commune, did he favour any particular political party?
A.	Well, taking a good look at it, I would say that Gacumbitsi didn't belong to any political party.  He was neither president, chairman nor vice-chairman of the MRND.  All I know was that he was bourgmestre,  and when he met any citizen in the commune, he discussed problems concerning the commune.  He knew very well that I was a member of the PL party, but he did not hold it against me.  He did not hold it against me that I didn't belong to the MRND, nor did he hold it against me that I hadn't joined the MRND.  As long as I knew him, his political affiliations were not made public.  

When he had come -- he had been appointed bourgmestre, the MRND was the only political party.  It was customary in other communes on the bourgmestre to be chairman of the MRND, but in our commune it was different.  He had no particular -- he held no particular position either in the MRND or in any other party.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, all that you have just stated before the Trial Chamber, how do you know it?
A.	Listen, I was not -- I was not a child at the time.  I would move freely, and I was at the -- in the upper echelons of the party.  And I was not an illiterate, I was a civil servant, so I knew what was going on in my commune.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, in view of your level of education, as you have pointed out to us, too, can you tell us whether to your knowledge other people from other political parties, holding positions in other political parties, made approaches to Gacumbitsi to join their party?
A.	I never heard mention of it.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Oh, I think he said, "I did hear of it."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is hearsay, Counsel.  He's begun by saying that he "heard mention".  Is it necessary to continue? 
MS. MBATTANG:
He has answered, and on the other side they said it is speculation, wherein the event I will not go on with this line of questioning.  I don't want to be accused of speculation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then you may continue.

MS. MBATTANG:
Thank you, Madam Chairman -- Madam President.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you have stated that on the news of the death of the president you got together in groups to reflect.  What ensued after this reflection in small groups?
A.	As we went on exchanging our ideas, we were wondering about our safety, our well-being and the situation that prevailed in the country.  As I have stated, in our area there were many Tutsi, and there was a problem.  

I would say the killing started in our locality, and we were surprised by those massacres.  Neighbours sent us messages to say, "Have you been informed as to what happened?"  The head of state was killed and you know about it, and in the meantime we see people coming with their belongings.  And when you ask a friend, coming towards you, a question, he would answer, "My house has been set afire"; mostly people from Rukira.  Others would say, "My property has been looted; I don't know where my son has run to."  And we asked them, "Well, how did you come here?"  They answered, "Because we are coming through our secteur, Nyarubuye secteur, because we note that here things are still calm in Nyarubuye parish.  And when these problems of public safety will have been settled, we will go home.  And if the situation gets any worse, since you are close to the border, we will cross into Tanzania.  And we hope that no one will chase us there, hunt us down there." 

	 And we stayed with the refugees until the number of refugees at Nyarubuye parish grew.  About the 9th or the 10th, until the 14th, the number had grown considerably, so a problem arose.  

The inhabitants of -- we the inhabitants of Nyarubuye, we had been warned by the Rukira authorities, and we saw leaflets according to which we were being warned, that we, the inhabitants of Nyarubuye, were giving shelter to people who had killed the head of state.  And the tracts the leaflets, said, "You will see, we will deal with you."  

So on the 14th, the morning of the 14th -- and you know that we were not carrying on with our normal work.  You know, that when one has lost a relative, when someone has died, a member of your family, you stop whatever you are doing until the person has been buried.  So in the meantime, on the 14th, in the morning of the 14th we received a message according to which these people who were warning us would -- were coming for us to explain to them why we had sheltered refugees at Nyarubuye parish; therefore, we took the decision to defend ourselves because in our locality, the populace was united.  So, in the morning we got together, and again, we exchanged ideas, the Hutu and the Tutsi.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are going a bit quickly, please, Witness.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you can take a bit of water in view of your health, and please go slowly because there are the interpreters, there are the court reporters, and we also need to follow what you are saying. 
A.	Thank you.  I wanted to finish quickly.  My concern was to get it over with quickly.  May I continue? 

At the time we were meeting on the 14th, the people who had sent us that message attacked.  They had whistles.  They were carrying weapons; they were carrying machetes, lances, spears and bows.  They came from Birembo, which is opposite from us.  And I told you that they told us that they were coming, and we wanted to be ready since we were united, anyone who could find a weapon, whether it was a machete or a spear, took up his weapon.  And we decided to defend ourselves.  Someone who was with us, who was an ex-soldier, told us, "Let us go and face the assailants."  

And the skirmish took place at Birembo.  They began setting houses afire, and moreover, six people were killed, six of the attackers were killed.  And we also captured two people who were considered to be ringleaders, very well known people who had important -- important positions in the civil services and who were influential members of the political party.  The two people, if I come back, the two people captured, among them there was François Gisagara, who worked for the ministry of public works and was very influential in our region and well known in the MDR party.  We captured him in the company of Antoine Hakizamungu, who had been running -- managing an agricultural cooperative known as Twibumbebahinze.  

So we captured them.  We had requisitioned a vehicle in Nyarubuye parish.  We put them in that vehicle, but they were not beaten, and we took them to Nyarutunga.  So we decided to take them to the authorities so that they could be interrogated, and after having heard what they had to say, we were going to send them to the communal office so that they could be charged or we could also transfer them to the military. 
MS. MBATTANG:
	The name of Gisagara is No. 47 on the list that was handed out.  Hakizamungu Antoine is No. 65 on the list.  Could the Kinyarwanda interpreter spell the name of the cooperative that was given by the witness. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The name of the cooperative was Twibumbebahinze, and it is spelled as follows: T-W-I-B-U-M-B-E-B-A-H-I-N-Z-E, Twibumbebahinze.
MS. MBATTANG:
Thank you, interpreter.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, I interrupted you when you were saying that you took those two people to the Nyarutunga centre to question them.  Could you continue, please?
A.	Thank you, I will continue.  We arrived at that centre, and while we were still surprised and wondering where we would start questioning them, we were told those people were known to be honest and now how are we going to question them.  Shortly thereafter, we saw eight soldiers -- or eight gendarmes arrive.  They were accompanied by youngsters, and these youngsters were among the attackers, and they had managed to flee to go and alert the gendarmes in Mulindi.  

So when we saw the gendarmes arrive, we were very happy, and we told ourselves that the attackers would be punished.  We stayed there, nobody left, and we told ourselves that we were going to report these cases to the gendarmes.  The gendarmes greeted us, and we told ourselves -- we spoke to the gendarmes saying, "It is good that you have arrived as security will be provided for now."  So, as you can see, the members of the population who were present were afraid.  So we told the gendarmes how houses were burnt down and what all of the attackers did.  

And the gendarmes told us, "We have the last words.  We have heard your version.  Remain calm and listen to our own version."  And they told us, "Those of you who have arms should lay them down.  And now we are going to work together.  Don't be afraid.  As you can see, we have arms and we shall provide for your security."  So we laid down our arms and they showed us where to stand.  In the meantime, the eight gendarmes surrounded us and stationed themselves around us, because we were at the market.  

They started putting questions to the people we had arrested.  The man named Gisagara was shouting at the top of his voice and saying he had been tied up.  So they asked him what his name was, and he said, "My name is Gisagara".  They asked him, "Who tied you up?"  And he said, "There is a man known as Vincent Hakizamungu.  I don't know, but could you please untie me.  "The gendarme called Hakizamungu and he answered, and they ordered him to untie this gentleman so that they could question him.  Hikizamungu untied him.  "And since you have untied Gisagara, you can also untie Antoine," which he did.  And they told him, "You have done well to untie these two men, so sit down there and rest a little."  So they had him sit on a stone which was used as a prop for a swing -- a balance, I beg your pardon, which was used for measuring coffee.  

They said, "Don't make the mistake of fleeing.  You know we are soldiers.  None of you should say anything because we are the ones in charge of the situation."  In the meantime, we acceded to their demands because we did not know their plans.  They told Gisagara to point out any other persons in the crowd who were considered as ringleaders.  Gisagara named persons he wanted, and it was observed that he was naming mostly Tutsis.  He named a certain Ruberandinda, another person known as Canisius and several others, because there were many people there. 

One of the soldiers said, "Now we are going to take the decisions, bearing in mind what are you saying, because the people of Nyarubuye had suffered."  They continued saying, "We heard a grenade explosion, but who exploded that grenade," they asked.  They mentioned the name of a certain Rwangriahe, who was a demobilised soldier.  They wanted to know where Rwangriahe was, but Rwangriahe had just fled on board the vehicle we had used to bring those people to that place.  However, Rwangriahe's father was courageous enough to say that even if Rwangriahe is not there -- is not here, "He is my son.  If you like, I could bring him to you."  So they ordered him to sit down near Vincent.  

They prevented us from fleeing because they wanted to implement what we had requested of them, they said.  They asked us what were the wishes we had expressed to them, and we told them that our wish was to punish the criminals.  So we told ourselves, we are going to see how they will punish those criminals.  They asked the people they had asked to sit to say their last prayers, because they said, "Your plans have been accomplished," they said.  

They immediately shot dead Vincent and the old Bahutu. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
They said their plans were aborted, I beg your pardon, not accomplished. 
THE WITNESS:
They said, "You can defend yourselves, you fools," and they started cutting us with machetes and shooting us with spears.  And whoever could flee, did so.  That is how we fled from that area in Nyarutunga.  And while we were fleeing, we were fleeing in all directions, not knowing where we were going.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness, you have given some names --
MS. MBATTANG:
And I would like the Kinyarwanda interpreters to spell those names, since they didn't spell them. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	You mentioned Ruberandinde.
MS. MBATTANG:
Could the interpreter kindly spell that name for us?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Ruberandinde is spelt as R-U-B-E-R-A-N-D-I-N-D-E.
 
MS.  MBATTANG:
He also made mention of Rwangriahe.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rwangriahe is spelt as R-W-A-N-G-R-I-A-H-E. 
MS. MBATTANG:
And Rwangirahe is No. 196 on the list that was handed out. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said a while ago that many refugees arrived in your area following the announcement of the president's death.  Can you tell the Court what was the ethnic group of those refugees? 
A.	In view of the fact that the refugees who came were being pursued and that we had started tracking down Tutsis -- or that they had started tracking down Tutsis in their area, I would say that most of those refugees were Tutsi.  But any Hutu who also feared being subjected to the same fate also fled. (Pages 9 to 16 by Donna M. Lewis) 
























	1000H
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	You said refugees who feared the same fate.  What could have been the reasons for the flight of those Hutus?
A.	The reasons that those Hutus could have advanced -- as you know, at that time there was no ethnic segregation in our area.  There wasn't any.  You could have had Hutu households whereas as you were Tutsi.  You could have been a Tutsi married to a Hutu woman.  Those were the reasons that accounted for the fact that people of different ethnic origins could relate to one another.  If your cousin was pursued, you could follow that person because there was an ethnic -- there was this ethnic mix.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you were saying that after the attackers opened fire, you fled in various directions.  What did you do subsequently?
A.	I fled with old people, old women.  Each person fled in the direction of the area of his choice.  As for me, I fled to an area known as Nyabitare since I had worked in Nyabitare and I had many friends there.  So I told myself that I had to go there because that area was safe and I had many friends there and I could stay with those friends.  I arrived in Nyabitare in the evening and I sought refuge in the home of a friend known as Cyridion Matabaro.  That was in the evening.  I spent the night there.  I related the events that had occurred in my area.  But I believe they had already gotten wind of those events because the inhabitants of those various centres belonged to the same parish, that of Nyarubuye. 

The following day, very early in the morning, as we were no longer working, as I said earlier on, Matabaro and myself, as well as his neighbours and another friend known as Vianney Mutunzi, were in an area called Gasasangutiya near Nyabitare and we were trying to exchange ideas that morning, wondering what would have happened if we were attacked in that area.  Shortly thereafter, youths started arriving from an area known as Cuvette.  They were trickling in and there was also -- there were also some members of the Nyabitare population who were in that area, but those people were wearing banana leaves on their heads.  

When the number of these youngsters increased in the area where we were, they began asking us whether we had identity cards.  And we said yes, we had.  But since I had witnessed what had happened in Nyarubuye, I became afraid since the people had related the events to were also beginning to be afraid.  Without any further delay, they told us, "If that is the case, show us your identity cards."  Those who did not have identity cards began disappearing, one after the other; they fled.  And those who had identity cards could show them.  But as soon as you show them your I.D. card, they seized it.  

They arrested my friend, Matabaro.  They also arrested my friend, Vianney, whereas he had not shown them his identity card.  And they told them, "Come, we want to question you."  They returned the identity cards to the people on whose identity cards was marked "ethnic group Hutu" and they killed the people they took away with them. 

I heard that my friend Vianney was killed.  I heard that he was killed in a banana plantation of Bukambira near the Nyabitare school.  They also killed Cyridion Matabaro, very close to the same banana plantation.  

The war continued raging and the situation was deteriorating.  I didn't know what to do.  I was afraid, and I told myself I left Nyarubuye, whereas the war was raging there and even now, here where I've sought refuge, the situation is no different. 

The leaders of the attackers included a man I knew who was a native of Nyabitare.  I asked him how I could get to Nyabitare because I had problems to sort out there.  He told me, "Do you know that you are a fool?  Look for banana leaves.  Don't tell anybody that you are going there.  Hit the road.  The people you meet on your way won't hurt you because it is common knowledge that anyone wearing banana leaves is a worker."  

So I escaped.  I did what he had asked me to do.  It was at about 11:00 a.m.  I followed the road towards my area, that is, Nyarubuye.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, in view of your health, would you like to take a break or, rather, do you need to take a break? 
A.	Yes, I would, please. 
Q.	How long will you need?
A.	If I could have a 15-minute break, I believe that would be enough. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I'm sorry, but perhaps you could ask the Trial Chamber what their view is.  The witness is speaking fine.  He's even speaking a bit fast.  He seems well.  He has given us no sign of fatigue at this stage, and now you are saying, "If you want to stop, you can."  You know, because at this pace we will never complete.
MS. MBATTANG:
I'm sorry, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think the witness can drink water, can speak at a slower pace, but he seems okay.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, have you understood what the President has said?  Please speak slowly, drink water if you need to, but before you continue with your testimony, I have a few questions that I would like to put to you. 
MS. MBATTANG:
And I would like to ask the interpreter to spell some of the names that he mentioned because, otherwise, the pace we are going, I will not be able to ask you to spell the names.   Matabaro.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Matabaro is spelled M-A-T-A-B-A-R-O.
MS. MBATTANG:
There was another name. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Gasasangutiya, which is spelled G-A-S-A-S-A-N-G-U-T-I-Y-A, Gasasangutiya.
MS. MBATTANG:
And what about the names of some of his friends?  He mentioned the names of friends that were with him in Nyabitare.  Can you repeat those names so that we can spell them out for the record? 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness, you said that in your hiding place you were with some friends, and if I followed you correctly, one of your friends was subsequently killed.  Can you give us the name of those who were with you in your hiding place in Nyabitare?
A.	I mentioned Matabaro, Cyridion.  Matabaro is spelled M-A-T-A-B-A-R-O.  I also said that Vianney Mutunzi was with me.  Mutunzi is spelled M-U-T-U-N-Z-I. 
Q.	Witness ZHZ, did you mention a name of Bukambiri?
MS. MBATTANG:
Mr. Interpreter, please. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Bukambira is spelled B-U-K-A-M-B-I-R-A, Bukambira.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, can you tell the Trial Chamber what the word "work" meant, or "worker"?
A.	In realty, the word "gukora" in Kinyarwanda, G-U-K-O-R-A, means "to work".  It means to do something that could contribute to your own well-being.  But at the time it meant to defend oneself or to struggle against a specific group.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, when they said to go and work or fight against a group, what specific group?
A.	I had already seen what was happening.  They were fighting those who were being persecuted.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Or "hunted down", rather.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Who were those who were being hunted down?
A.	In my opinion, it was the Tutsi and those who shared the same ideas of the Tutsi.  Those were the ones who were being hunted down.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you have described the events that you lived through in Nyarutunga.  Can you tell us what the date was?
A.	I believe it was the 14th.
Q.	And the events that occurred in Nyabitare that you have just described, did they take place on the same date?
A.	No, they took place the day after that, because I had sought refuge in that location and that is where I spent the night.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, after Nyabitare, were you a witness of other events that took place in your locality?
A.	Yes.  When I went home -- I went to my home, rather, to see whether any of my belongings had been looted.  My neighbours were there and the bodies of those who had been killed the day before were there as well.  They had not looted any of my belongings, but the doors were open.  And a little bit later, during the afternoon, many vehicles started to arrive in that area.  The vehicles came from Birembo, which was the locality from which the assailants had come from.  

When they reached the place where we were, they stopped.  They had given instructions to the people so that people would not run when they saw them.  They arrived in vehicles.  Some of them had banana leaves wrapped around their heads, and there were even some who wore military uniforms.  They had red berets.  They told us that they'd heard there was a problem in Nyarubuye.  They said that they'd heard that there was a problem that had not been resolved and that they had come to resolve the problem in Nyarubuye.  They said, "Look at our vehicles; look at the direction we have just come from.  We have come from far and we have come to help you."  But we were actually afraid.  

They told us that any man who was strong enough should follow them and that those who weren't should climb into the vehicles, and that is what happened.  But as I was tired because of the long walk from Nyabitare to my residence, I climbed into one of the vehicles.  We left and the vehicles were driving slowly, and we were told that we were going to see what the situation was like in Nyarubuye.  

When we reached Nyarubuye, we stepped out of the vehicles.  And those who had walked arrived.  There was a big crowd, as if it were a market day. 

In the meantime, whilst we were there, they told us, "People of Nyarubuye, calm down."  Some of the people who had come in the vehicles with the persons whose names I had already mentioned, like Gisagara, who had been tied up the day before, they stepped to one side and they held a short meeting.  But in the meantime, the people who were in the vehicles, the people who were inside the vehicle cabs -- or, rather, I meant to say that those who were inside the buildings of the parish, because the windows were open, when they saw the crowd, they started to shout.  They said, "You have come to kill us."  And some people answered, "No, calm down; nothing will be done to you."  

And after the short meeting, a soldier who was known under the name of lieutenant -- I don't know what his name was, but he spoke, and he said, "Follow closely what is going to happen."  And he spoke to a boy who was there and whose name was Kibwa.  Kibwa is spelled K-I-B-W-A, Kibwa.  So he asked Kibwa to call out for those who were innocent so that the innocent could step out, outside.  So Kibwa went out to the entrance of the parish gate and with other young people, he said, "The innocent should come out."  But people answered from the inside, "We are all innocent.  Kill us, but you shall pay for this."  But some persons came out because they felt they were innocent.  I saw a young priest, for example.  I don't know his name.  I also saw approximately five girls, and they even specifically called out for Louis Ntamazeze, and that is spelt N-T-A-M-A-Z-E-Z-E.  And after that they readied themselves and asked if there were any other innocent persons who had not yet stepped out. 

In the meantime, they had surrounded the location and controlled all exits.  And they had stream mortars affixed -- attached to their rifles, and those near the doors had grenades, and that was the first time that I ever saw such weapons.  

And us -- I mean, we were onlookers; we were almost like onlookers and we were in the back and we were afraid because we didn't know what was going to happen.  And I don't know what the lieutenant said, but I heard him say, "Hey," and the people who were in the front started to shoot out the windows.  The others who were at the entrances were arming their grenades and then lobbing them into the buildings.  

When I heard the first explosions, I did not hesitate.  And even the others who were afraid, just as I was, we slipped away because this was our native area and no one could follow us.  And we returned to the place where they had found us, but I no longer spent the night at home.  I went to a place known as Rutunga and I went to the house of a neighbour who was a friend.  She was an old woman whose name was Kabesime, and her sons were my friends, and they were considered to be some of the brave young men of the area.  I remained there until the day I left Rusumo commune. 

I would sleep there and I would stay at Kabesime's house when I was awake and I would stay there, and I stayed there thinking that no one would attack me there because they were strong young men.  The situation continued like that for some time, and the next day it was as if the firing gun had been launched for the massacres.  We heard that so-and-so was killed, and another person was killed.  And the situation continued in this manner up until the day when the RPF forces arrived in that area, and then we had hope that the RPF would free us.  This was on the 28th, at 6 a.m.  We heard gunshots throughout the locality.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Excuse me, could you indicate the dates when the events you are talking about occurred; the dates, please.  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
I was talking about the day the RPF came to free us.  It was the 28th of April 1994 and it happened at 6 a.m.  

So we heard gunshots, and those who knew the sounds, who could recognise the sounds, said that Kalashnikovs were being used.  Almost each house in Bugarura was surrounded.  In the morning, they didn't fire at people.  And they came and brought us together and led us to the Nyarutunga dispensary.  There were many of us and anyone who had -- and we were all together, Hutu and Tutsi alike.  

They told us, "We have come to save you." We stayed there until 1 p.m., and when they realised there were many persons, the RPF also wanted to start killing the people, and I am amongst those who were able to escape.  

Amongst those who were guarding us there was a young boy who had been my student.  We called him Matwi at school, and that is spelled M-A-T-W-I, Matwi.  But his real name was Butera.  Butera is spelled B-U-T-E-R-A.  He came up to me and told me in a low voice, "In a few moments, the situation might worsen.  If you can, pretend to go to the toilet." And he didn't need to speak to me at length; I immediately understood what he meant.  So I looked to the right and to the left, but no one was watching me or followed me.  As I was moving away, I came across other persons who were slipping away, just as I had, because someone else had given them assistance.  

When I reached a distance of approximately one kilometre away, I heard steady gunfire, and I stopped in a place called Kagabaro, K-A-G-A-B-A-R-O, Kagabaro.  And many other persons were there.  They had all sought refuge there and they had not been captured by the RPF.  

We waited for night to fall.  We took everything we could to cross the Kagera River and go to Tanzania.  So I spent the night of the 28th of April in Tanzania.  I left the papyrus marsh at 3:00 in the morning. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said that you went into a vehicle to go to Nyarubuye parish.  Did you go climb freely into the vehicle or were you forced to go, to climb into the vehicle?
A.	We were no longer free of our movements, regardless of those who walked or those who climbed into the vehicles; we were forced to do so.  And we were asked to proceed in this manner quickly.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said that once you reached Nyarubuye, there was a brief meeting and all exits were closed down and the innocent persons were asked to step out.  What did they mean by the word "innocent"?
A.	Let me give you an explanation -- or let me explain the meaning of the word, because those who used the word had another meaning that they gave to the word, and as I was not a part of that group I cannot give you what their intent was.  I can only give you what the word -- I can only explain to you what the word usually means.  "Umwere" means someone who has not committed any crimes, and that is my understanding of the word umwere.
Q.	You said that you saw some leaders when you reached Nyarubuye.  Who are you referring to?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English interpreter adds "umwere" is spelled U-M-W-E-R-E. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that I saw some of the leaders of the attackers who had attacked us the day before, and amongst them I saw persons who I thought were gendarmes because they were wearing red berets and they were wearing camouflage uniform, and so I thought to myself that there were officials in this place.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, where did the attackers at Nyarubuye parish come from?
A.	Well, in view of the location of our locality and that we had no vehicle in our locality and that the vehicles were coming from the direction of Birembo, which is a region in Rukira commune, and that is where the road coming from Kibungo goes through, and I thought to myself that these persons coming from various communes -- had come from different communes, and I knew the person known as Kibga,(phonetic) and he was in charge of the taxi drivers in Kimuro (phonetic), and so you will have to understand that they came from other regions other than Nyarubuye.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, can you tell the Trial Chamber, once you reached Nyarubuye parish, were any weapons distributed?
A.	Aside from those who had their own weapons, we did not even have the time to talk amongst those who were there in that location.  The people who had prepared the plan had already prepared it and they did not take any time to discuss it with onlookers in Nyarubuye.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said a moment ago that when you arrived, the people inside were making a noise and they were insulting those who had arrived with you, and somebody said "Hey."  That is what you said.
MR. KAREGYESA:
That is an unfair characterisation of the witness's evidence by counsel.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, absolutely, the witness never mentioned insults.
MS. MBATTANG:
I withdrew what I have said, Madam President, and I will rephrase my questions in other words.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said that a lieutenant said "Hey."  At least, this is what I heard.  Was this the gendarmerie lieutenant or was this lieutenant an army officer?
A.	Well, if we take into consideration the colour of his beret, one could say that he was a gendarme. 
Q.	Witness ZHZ, did you see Sylvestre Gacumbitsi at Nyarubuye parish?
A.	No, I did not see Gacumbitsi, and I did not see any other commune official. 
Q.	Witness ZHZ, were the communal police present at the parish on that date?
A.	No, there were no policemen, unless they were hiding somewhere, but I did not see any.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, did you see any incitement in your locality, any incitement to kill, rape, steal or burn down houses of Tutsis or opposition members?
A.	During the whole time I was there, I did not hear anyone incite any other persons to commit such acts.  Those who perpetrated such acts were persons who had arrived with a pre-established plan.  They would steal; they would loot; they would kill people and then return to their locality.  And as evidence of that I can say that I know of no one from our locality who looted a property or killed anyone.  Any property looter was taken away from our locality to other secteurs by these persons.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said a moment ago that priests came out when the innocent were asked to step out.  Do you know where these priests came from?
A.	No, I don't know what parish they came from, but they had come to our parish.  I was told, for example, that the young priest had come with the faithful who had come to seek refuge and had come from Kabarondo, and I was not able to find out his name, place of birth, or where he was from, and I don't know why he was there.  The person I do know well is Louis Ntamazeze, and he is an old priest of our parish.  He had remained in our parish for a long time.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you said that as of the 28th of April 1994, you sought refuge in Tanzania.  Since that date, have you ever returned to Rwanda?
A.	In 1996, when the refuge camps in Tanzania were closed down, I tried to return to my country but I was not able to go all the way to my house because of what I had seen.  I stopped nearby and I let my other family members continue ahead so that I could follow what was going to happen.  

Some time later, all my friends and former neighbours -- I heard that all my former neighbours were killed.  I, therefore, turned back and I sought refuge elsewhere because we had been expulsed from Tanzania.  I, therefore, did not go anywhere else.  But this was for clear and obvious reasons.  It's not because I hated my country, because I still love it to this very day.
Q.	Witness ZHZ, you love your country; you still love your country.  Are you ready to return to Rwanda?
A.	I will not ask you to help me to go home directly today, this very day.  It is true that I have friends in Rwanda.  I have information from Rwanda.  I have lost a number of my relatives.  I have lost my property.  But I still pray to almighty God that public safety should be re-established in Rwanda so that I might return. 
 
What makes me afraid, makes me fearful, is that friends who did no wrong and who were hunted down because they belonged to opposition parties, but who were arrested, who disappeared when they went back home, when they returned to the country.  I don't think I would be exempt, that I could avoid that if I went home.  Nothing would prevent me from suffering the same fate as they had but, in truth, I ask God that security, public safety, be re-established in Rwanda so that I might go home.
MS. MBATTANG:
Thank you.  Madam President, I have finished the examination-in-chief of this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Counsel for the Prosecution.  We are ten minutes short of the adjournment.  Perhaps we should take the break now and then you can undertake cross-examination after the brief adjournment.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Most obliged, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  We will now briefly adjourn, as is our custom, which will also make it possible for the witness to rest.  We shall resume in about 15 minutes. 
	(Court recessed from 1055H to 1120H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Let us now resume.  Counsel for the Prosecution, pray proceed with cross-examination.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, can you please move forward?  Witness, what level of education did you attain before joining your professional occupation?
A.	I did seven years of secondary school and teacher training in two phases.  The first phase I did six years of primary schooling and five years of secondary schooling.  I went to work; I worked for a year, and then I went to undergo three years training, whereupon I became a teacher.
Q.	And it would be correct, Witness, to suggest that you are fluent in the French language?
A.	Yes, quite.
Q.	Now, Witness, in which year did you start your occupation subsequent to graduating?
A.	In 1982.  In 1982.
Q.	And between 1982 and 1994, when you fled Rwanda, were you working in Rusumo commune?
A.	Yes, that is where I worked.
Q.	Now, you mentioned earlier on in your testimony this morning that you were a civil servant.  Am I correct?
A.	Yes.  Whoever worked in our country and who wasn't a farmer was a civil servant, and as I was a teacher, I was considered to be a civil servant.  That's the meaning in which I intended it.
Q.	And it's correct, Witness, that you regularly picked your monthly pay from the commune office; isn't it?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And, in fact, the communal accountant was your friend; isn't it?
A.	It wasn't the communal office that was paying our salary; it was the school inspector, the communal school inspector, who paid our salary on the basis of the lists he was given.
Q.	And the list, Witness, would be the payroll, wouldn't it?
A.	Yes.  In the Rwandan educational system, education system, there were lists of teachers in one or two communes and every month the ministry would send the salaries and they were paid, and they signed the list.  We didn't have accounts at the bank so we were paid in those offices.
Q.	And having received your salary in cash, you'd sign against your name, isn't it, Witness?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now, it's true, Witness, isn't it, that you did have a break in service between 1982 and 1994, when you did not pick or sign for your salary?
A.	Yes, that is true.  When we were students, we weren't paid even if before going to school one had had a job.  Whilst one was studying, one did not receive a salary. 
Q.	Witness, I'm talking of when you were gainfully employed as a civil servant.  There appears a break in the payroll which suggests that for many months you did not pick and sign for your salary.  Am I correct?
A.	You mean the time when I was a civil servant?  I don't see what period you're referring to.  At no time while I was a civil servant did I refuse to accept my salary.  I don't see what period of time you're referring to, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, will you agree with me that there is a gap in excess of 36 months where you did not sign for, nor receive, your salary?
A.	I don't see what period you're referring to, because while I was working as a civil servant, I was paid my salary, but I know that from time to time our records were not kept up to date.  If, for example, for a period you were receiving 15,000 francs a month, at the end of the month you might see that the amount given is 13,000 francs, so one had to chase up the ministry to see what was happening.  I know that that sort of thing occurred.
Q.	And it would also be true, Witness, that a civil servant who was imprisoned would not be paid his salary during the period he or she was in prison?
A.	Yes, that must have been current practice because the civil servant would not be fulfilling his usual functions.
	(Pages 17 to 26 by Karen Holm-Porter)


	1130H
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	And will you agree with me, Witness, that you did serve a prison sentence in Rwanda prior to the genocide? 
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. MBATTANG:
I did not follow what the Prosecutor said, his crime.  I don't know what crime it was.  I did not understand.  I don't know if you understood something about before 1994.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.
MS. MBATTANG:
All right. 
THE WITNESS:
To answer your question, I should say that is not true; that never happened to me.  I don't know who gave you that information but in any event, if we are referring to the period you mentioned and during which I did not receive my salary, I say it isn't true. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	So, Witness, is it your evidence that prior to the genocide you were never imprisoned? 
A.	No, I was never imprisoned. 
Q.	In fact, Witness, isn't it true that you were imprisoned in connection with the murder of your house servant? 
A.	I don't believe I have appeared before this Court to answer that question.  I believe we are straying away from the real motive for my appearance here because these considerations are foreign to the events that occurred in 1994.  

And, I believe, that even if I am appearing before this Court, for security reasons, they are issues and points that we are not allowed to deal with before this Court.  I believe I am here to testify in relation to Gacumbitsi and events that occurred in 1994.  So when I was called to testify, they didn't tell me that I will have to talk about events dealing with my private life. 
Q.	I am sorry if you are aggrieved, Witness, but you are here to answer questions put to you by counsel and these include matters pertaining to your private life. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, I believe we are in an open session and the witness has just said that the statement made by counsel for Prosecution could lead to the identification of his identity.  If the witness is of the state of mind, Madam President, I believe it is the right time for us to move into closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, Counsel.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you intend to continue with this line of questioning?  I ask this because it could indeed lead to the revelation of the witness's identity. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Well, if he continues denying it, definitely it wouldn't, but for the sake of caution we can't pursue it.  We can't pursue it in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution, the private life of this witness does not really interest us.  So if you could round up this line of questioning without this revealing his identity, it would be better to do so.  But if you insist on pursuing this line of questioning and going further, which could lead to the revelation of the witness's identity, we would be obliged to order a closed session.  But we believe the private life of the witness does not particularly interest the Chamber. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.  The Prosecutor submits that a witness's antecedents, particularly where their criminal -- go to the credibility of the witness and are therefore relevant.  I abide by your decision that pursuing this matter, if I must, should be done in closed session so as not to divulge the identity of this witness.  

What I would propose, Your Honours, is that I am going to pursue the criminal antecedents of this witness in a closed session, but so as to not disrupt proceedings, I can move on to other questions now and reserve this line of questioning towards the end of my cross-examination, where we can go into closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well then.  So please proceed to another line of questioning. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, you told this chamber this morning that on the 15th of April 1994 you were in Nyabitare having fled there after the events of Nyarutunga the day before; am I correct? 
A.	That is correct, that is how the events occurred. 
Q.	And it is also your evidence, Witness, that on that morning, that is, the 15th of April 1994, you had occasion to meet Viyane Mutunzi; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, I met him. 
Q.	And would it also be your evidence, Witness, that you did not actually witness the murder of Viyane Mutunzi and others, but you just heard about it? 
A.	No, I did not say that I heard about it.  I said that I witnessed that fact.  He was killed close to a school in a banana plantation owned by a certain Rukanda, that is what I said. 
Q.	Witness, in your evidence this morning you told this Chamber, and I quote: "I heard Viyane was killed in a banana plantation near Nyabitare".

Are you now telling the Chamber that you actually witnessed with your own eyes the killing of Viyane Mutunzi? 
A.	That is correct, because bearing in mind the area where the group was, the group in which I was, it is there that he himself was.  We were led to an area where that person was killed.  We were in an open area and when we were asked to show our identity cards, there came a time when Matabaro and others were killed in an area which was not open, I mean in a secret location. 
Q.	Witness, you still haven't answered my question.  This morning you told Their Lordships that Viyane, Matabaro and others were taken away, led away by youths, and you learned or heard that Viyane was killed in a banana plantation.  Now, my question is, do you maintain that you heard that Viyane was killed in a banana plantation or that you actually witnessed the killing of Viyane Mutunzi? 
A.	Unless we do not understand one another for language reasons, as regards the massacres, I did not say that I participated in his murder, whereas he was killed while I was near him.  As you see, we were in the same group.  A member of the group was taken and led somewhere; other members of the group were led away to another location.  You could hear the sound of someone crying or shouting.  What prevents you from understanding that he was being killed, whereas you weren't there on the spot?  If you say that those people were not killed, you should produce evidence to the effect that those people are still alive.  That person was a friend of mine; I cannot say that he died when he is living, he is alive.  I cannot do that because his death caused a lot of suffering to me. 
Q.	Witness, you still haven't answered the question, but let me simplify it for you.  What was the distance between yourself and Viyane and the killers when they were killing him? 
A.	A short distance.  In any case, it was not more than five metres.  If you knew the geography of that area, we are talking about a banana plantation that was fenced up, and if someone was six metres away from you, you can realise what was happening just from the noise that you heard.  I saw these people leading him into the banana plantation.  They led him somewhere else and I heard him crying out saying, "You are killing me".  And I know the circumstances under which he was killed.  Don't insist on the circumstances in which he died because it caused me a lot of pain.  

Furthermore, if you conducted investigations, you would find out that he was very close to me. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you have told Their Lordships that the distance between you and Viyane and the killers was five to six metres; was there anything obstructing your view, i.e. between you and the killers and Viyane? 
A.	That is what made me say that I witnessed his death.  When he was attacked with traditional weapons, I could see that the assailants led him away to that area.  I knew them, a certain Rukutu -- I knew him, he was a tramp in that area.  It was a banana plantation belonging to Rukambira.  It was a banana plantation that was fenced up, so there was an obstacle preventing me from seeing what was happening.  Besides, I could not prevent them from doing what they were doing because I myself was in trouble. 
Q.	Witness, we would save time if you just listened to the question and answered it as it is put to you.  It was simple and didn't need a narrative.  Was there anything obstructing your view in the five or six metres that separated you and Viyane and his killers?  Yes, was there something obstructing your view, yes or no? 
A.	Yes, there were trees and there were green banana leaves because we are dealing with a banana plantation, so there was some obstruction. 
Q.	And in those five to six metres, approximately how many trees blocked your view, Witness? 
A.	Listen, I did not count the number of banana trees, but it was particularly the green leaves of the banana trees that obstructed my view.  It was indeed the green banana leaves that obstructed my view.  And let me add that I was afraid, and on account of that fear, I could not observe what was happening.  I don't know what you want to know exactly.  Do you want to know what arm was used?  What I know is that he cried out and this caused me a lot of pain.  I told myself that is the end, he is dead.  I didn't see others killed.  Subsequently, I tried to gather information and I indeed got to know that he was indeed dead. 
Q.	So it would be your evidence, Witness, that because of the banana trees and because you were frightened, you actually didn't see the assailants kill Mutunzi? 
A.	Regarding this question, it seems as if you want to assert that that person was not killed.  This, notwithstanding -- I told you that I asked a certain Xavier, since the situation was getting worse, "What should I do?"  He said:  "Cover yourself with banana leaves".  But it was precisely at that time that I heard Mutunzi cry out, and I knew his voice very well.  I could recognise his voice.  He was someone with whom I had had friendship ties.  They led him away to that area and it was in those circumstances that I assert that he was killed. 
Q.	Did you stay around while he was being killed or you fled? 
A.	If you recall the explanation I gave in this regard, you'd realise that the assailants shared out the victims to be killed among themselves.  One was led away to this side, another to another area.  And after I heard the noise, the cries of Mutunzi and Matabaro, I told myself the next person will be me.  Even if my identity card had been returned to me, I wasn't sure that these assailants would come back and kill me in turn.  Those two people had been killed.  Subsequently, someone told me to leave the area.  I told him I was afraid -- someone had told me my house had been looted, so he said, "Try to slip away".  He seemed to be very active, and I told myself I could slip away without fear of being arrested. 
Q.	So by the time you slipped away, Witness, had Mutunzi been killed? 
A.	Indeed, he was already dead.  That is, by the way, one of the reasons -- what I mean is, the cries were one of the reasons that obliged me to leave.  I had seen people being killed in Nyarubuye.  I had seen the circumstances in which they were killed.  If you ask me to tell you what weapon was used, it would be as if you are asking me to say whether I participated in his murder.  I was afraid, I was in pain but I was very sure that when I left -- by the time I left that area he had already been dead, and I can confirm this because his death caused me a lot of pain.  You see someone is led away some five metres away from you, you hear him cry, groan; what conclusion can you draw other than say that he has been killed?
Q.	And, Witness, it is your evidence that he was killed by assailants who included one Rukutu? 
A.	That is correct.  Yes, I saw with my own eyes, this man Rukutu.  I recognised Rukutu among the assailants.  He was moreover one of the most active members of the group and he was frightening us.  He had been brought by four youngsters including Rukutu, and I could recognise him. 
Q.	And is Rukutu the only person you recognised amongst the assailants, Witness? 
A.	As a matter of fact, that was not my native area, I didn't reside in that area.  Furthermore, most of the attackers did not hail from Nyabitare, they were rather people who came from the countryside.  So I could recognise Rukutu because there were assistant drivers I knew, and that is why I could recognise him at the time we are referring to. 
Q.	Now, Witness, the death of Mutunzi, a close friend of yours, must have been a very painful event; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, it was.  His death was a very painful experience to me.  As a matter of fact, I said I had sought refuge in an area I thought was safe, now I found my friends being killed.  I realised that the same thing that had happened in my area was happening in this same place, so I decided to leave and go back to Nyabitare as soon as possible.
Q.	You are aware, Witness, aren't you, that Gacumbitsi is charged, among others, with the death of Mutunzi and Rukomeza in Nyabitare on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  I am not aware of that, and I am testifying in regard to the events which I witnessed, and I witnessed those events.  When I talk about things I heard, it is called speculation.  In short, I don't know whether Gacumbitsi is being charged in connection with Mutunzi's death -- Mutunzi's murder, I am not aware of that.  I also knew Rukomeza but I am not in a position to tell you what the circumstances of his death were.  But since I cannot be forbidden to talk about things I heard, I heard that Rukomeza and his family committed suicide in his home. 
Q.	Witness, you told this Chamber that you aren't aware that Gacumbitsi is charged with the death of Mutunzi.  Do you know any of the charges for which you have come to testify on behalf of Gacumbitsi? 
A.	In reality, I don't know the charges laid against Gacumbitsi.  I don't know any specific charges apart from what I heard over the radio at the time of his arrest.  I heard that he was being accused of raping women and distributing arms in Nyarubuye.  But I don't know the specific charges against him.  Simply as regard my appearance before the Chamber, I am here to say what I know regarding his conduct at the time.  If at the end of the line his guilt is established in relation to any of the charges, that is not my duty to determine such charges, and it is not in my interest to know the charges laid against him. 
Q.	Witness, did you tell Defence investigators about how you witnessed the death of Mutunzi? 
A.	I believe I told investigators about it, and I tell you that all what I am relating to the Chamber was related to the investigators.  I don't know what their working methods are.  They asked me, "What do know about the death of people who died in Nyarubuye?"  I related to them the whole story how I got there and the other areas.  I believe I talked to the investigators about that.  I don't know whether they did not write all this down.  If that is the case, that question should be put to them, why they did not write down what I related to them. 
Q.	Now, Witness, do you recall the date of an interview with Defence investigator Aimable Sungura?
A.	I do not remember the date, but I believe it was in the month of February, February 2003. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please repeat your question, counsel for the Prosecution, we did not understand it?
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, I am repeating this question because the Judges didn't receive the translation.  Do you recall the date when you had an interview with the Defence investigator Aimable Sungura?
A.	I was telling you that I don't remember the date exactly, but I believe it was in February of this year.
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, with your leave.  Yes, I think there might have been a mistake made in the booth. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There seems to have been an error.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I don't -- I didn't note any error in the English language but I can pose the question again so that the record is clear, if you please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the mistake that was made was made in French, not in English, I believe. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
And would you permit me to pose the question again so that the French record is clear, or was the matter clarified by the booth? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe the correction has already been made.  You may proceed. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	So, Witness, it is your evidence that you met Aimable Sungura in February 2003; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, I believe so. 
Q.	In which city was this interview?
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, I believe that if the witness states -- answers this question, he will be revealing information that might lead to his identity being divulged.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you really think by stating that he was in -- for the interview might reveal his identity?  I don't think so.  In any case, we have to strike that word from the record. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	And, Witness, I believe the interview was being conducted in the Kinyarwanda language; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, we were speaking in Kinyarwanda.  But we could have spoken in other languages.  You know in a single conversation, you do not necessarily limit yourself to just one language.  I think that we actually even spoke French when we were together. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And at the end of the interview, Witness, you read through your statement before appending your signature; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, he read my statement back to me and after that I signed it. 
Q.	I'd just like you to have a look at this document; go to page 3 and tell us whether your signature appears there. 
A.	Yes, that is my signature.
Q.	And that is your statement, Witness, isn't it?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, I will read a sentence from that statement and I will ask you questions, and I quote: "The following day I noticed there was also insecurity in Nyabitare, so I returned to my house in the afternoon."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please tell us what page you are reading from, Counsel?  Please identify the paragraph as well. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
It would be the third paragraph on page 3 of the English, and let me locate the French page number, Your Honours.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French booth states that it is on page 2 of the French version, paragraph No. 4.
MR. KAREGYESA:
It is the last sentence of that paragraph, Your Honours. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	So, Witness, would you agree with me that your statement makes no mention of you witnessing the murder of Mutunzi, your close friend? 
A.	I find that a bit surprising, Counsel, because everything that I have stated here since this morning, I don't think that all of that appears in my statement.  The Defence investigator wrote a summary, he asked questions as they wish and therefore I could not answer questions that were not put to me.  What I did state here before the Trial Chamber, I did because you gave me enough time to speak and tell you everything I know.  If you are telling me that this does not appear in the statement, I don't think that I can be blamed for this.  Perhaps you should put your question to the Defence investigator and ask the investigator why he didn't write this or that.  I did not even reread the whole statement because I did not believe that I would have to come and testify in Arusha, and I therefore believe it is not necessary for us to dwell on this matter. 
Q.	Well, Witness, I would like to suggest to you that you actually didn't witness the death of Mutunzi nor did you tell the investigator, and that is why it doesn't appear in your statement. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, I believe that the Prosecutor is just making a comment and that actually the witness is being harassed for the last 30 minutes on this issue, and I believe that he has already answered the Prosecutor's question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we believe as well that that was a comment. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
If it pleases Your Honours, it wasn't a comment but rather a proposition that the Prosecutor is entitled to put to the witness within our limits of cross-examination.  You do realise, Your Honours, that the death of Mutunzi is pleaded in the factual allegations of the indictment where we allege that Gacumbitsi had Mutunzi and Rukomeza killed in Nyabitare near the Catholic centre on the 15th of April 1994.  At no point during cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses did the Defence put it to the Prosecution witnesses that Mutunzi was killed by other people as advanced by this witness.  

The point I am trying to underscore, Your Honours, is that, this is a very important point of Prosecution, it is pleaded in the indictment; it doesn't appear in this witness's statement and comes up for the first time during his testimony.  So, I am entirely within my limit, Your Honours, to suggest this witness did not see the killing of Mutunzi as he alleges and that is why it doesn't appear in his witness statement recorded in February this year.  

Now it is up to the witness to confirm or deny my proposition with a yes or no, and I am ready to move on.  But it is erroneous for counsel to suggest that I am making a comment; I am making a proposition for this witness to confirm or deny.  I am most obliged, Your Honours. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, by your leave.  It has been claimed on the other side of the courtroom that during our cross-examination, at the time when Prosecution witnesses testified, that we did not go over the death of Mutunzi, but the transcripts are there.  We have asked several questions, and I believe that at the time it was said that Gacumbitsi was not the one who killed Mutunzi, because in the indictment it is alleged that Gacumbitsi killed Mutunzi personally.  And I believe, Madam President, that we have also filed a motion pursuant to Rule 98 bis, and we have also discussed this matter at length, and I believe that they are mistaken on the other side of courtroom when they say that we did not go over the death of Mutunzi during our cross-examination.  

I think that my learned friend on the other side of Bench would have liked us to reveal all of our strategy so that they could easily harass witnesses on the stand as they are currently doing. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I don't think that it is a case of harassment, but questions must be put in a manner that allows the witness to answer.  And, yes, we can clarify this point which is very important for the Prosecution.  But we have said that we should refrain from making any comments.  You can ask the witness certain questions about this point, and that we agree.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, by your leave.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please, I believe that Counsel Mbattang has answered.  I think that we can proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
It was about something else.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is this another matter, something that we are not currently dealing with?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone is not on.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I just wanted to clarify.  I was not the one who was cross-examining.  It was on the other side.  I just wanted to provide this new information with the Trial Chamber's permission.  I believe that ever since Monday to be specific, the Office of the Prosecutor is making propositions, he is saying things.  He is saying that there is a text of law that says -- but he didn't cite the jurisprudence.  If that is the case, and it is an important point, I who used to be a cross-examiner, the Prosecutor could have told the Trial Chamber such a Prosecution witness mentioned Mutunzi's name and this is what happened, and he wasn't cross-examined on this matter.  I do not want the Trial Chamber and Defence counsel to have to deal with the trial by ambush.  I mean, how can we say that Mutunzi was -- Mutunzi did not do -- the Defence counsel did not do their duty, but we need to stop cheating.  I was the one who cross-examined -- who examined most of the Defence witnesses.  I thank you, Madam President.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Prosecution witnesses, corrects the interpreter.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, would you like to say something?  
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I am just -- maybe with your leave, I am just advising counsel that Your Honours in a plenary in July this year amended Rule 90G(ii) or you amended Rule 90, and we have in our current Rule 90G(ii), which makes it obligatory for a party to put its case across to the adverse party during cross-examination, and that is the way it is done.  You put propositions to the adverse party's witness; it is a mandatory requirement.  

And with your leave, Your Honours, I will move on.  If I may, however, just refer you to the transcript of 4th August during the evidence of Witness TAC at open session, page 42, lines 25 to 32, regarding limited cross-examination by Counsel Kouengoua of Witness TAC on the death of Mutunzi.  The point we wish to underscore is that at no time was it ever put to that witness that Mutunzi was killed by Rukutu and others.  And this is what this witness purports to have told Defence investigators in February this year, six clear months before the trial began or six clear months before the testimony of Witness TAC.  Under Rule 90G(ii) counsel was obliged to put the proposition to Witness TAC; in the event that he didn't, he cannot now interrupt my cross-examination.  And with your leave, I will proceed with my cross-examination, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed, Counsel, taking into consideration what we have said.  Sorry, proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, it would be correct, wouldn't it, to suggest that you actually left Nyabitare in the afternoon of the 15th of April 1994 heading towards Nyarubuye? 
A.	No, that would not be correct because I did not leave that place in the afternoon.  It was before noon, even though it was close to noon, because the killings had taken place well before around 11:00.  I did not look at my watch, but it must have been around noon. 
Q.	And it is also true, Witness, that you had a bicycle which you rode towards Nyarubuye parish on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	Can you repeat your question, Mr. Prosecutor?  I am not sure I understood what you are asking me about the bicycle.
Q.	We will come back to the bicycle, Witness.  You were a regular visitor at the commune, Witness, weren't you, during the events or during the period prior to the events of 1994, am I correct, as a civil servant? 
A.	Well, in reference to your first question about the bicycle, I am not sure whether you need to have a bicycle to go to the commune.  You have asked me a question about the bicycle and now you are asking me another question about visits to the commune office.  I am sorry I don't follow you.
Q.	Witness, I advised you that I will return to the question concerning the bicycle, so let's leave that for a moment.  And I am suggesting that prior to the events of April 1994, as a civil servant, you were a regular visitor of the bureau communal, at least on a monthly basis; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And you knew the communal policemen?   
A.	Yes, I knew some of them.  I didn't know all members of the communal police but I knew some of them. 
Q.	And, it would be correct that some of the communal policemen also knew you as a civil servant? 
A.	Yes, it is correct. 
Q.	And, in fact, you knew a communal policeman by the name of Jonathan Berakumenyo, didn't you?
A.	Yes, I knew him.  Yes, I believe I knew him. 
Q.	In fact, he was a migrant Mukiga like yourself, wasn't he, Witness?
A.	I am not a migrant Mukiga.  I not a migrant Mukiga.  I am not sure who could have told you that.
Q.	In any event, Witness, your father was a migrant Mukiga into Kibungo, wasn't he?
A.	No, that is not true.  I don't understand what you mean by Mukiga immigrant.  Have you verified this information or it is someone who told you this information?  Perhaps you need to investigate the matter in my native area.  In any case, I am not a Mukiga immigrant.
Q.	Witness, it is true, isn't it, that on the 15th of April 1994, in the early afternoon you rode your bicycle to Nyarubuye parish? 
A.	No, I never did that.  The path I took that day is the one I spoke to you of.  I did not have a bicycle.  Where would I have gotten a bicycle from?
Q.	In fact, Witness, you were not forced onto any vehicle to Nyarubuye parish, you went willingly on your bicycle.
A.	Did I make such a statement here or are you saying that I might have said that the vehicle that I went into Nyarubuye, I was forced into that vehicle like the others?  Now, I didn't own a bicycle, so how could I go there on a bicycle and how can a single person go to one place both in a bicycle and then in a vehicle, especially when the person doesn't own a bicycle in the first place?
Q.	And it is true, isn't it, Witness, that the communal and other vehicles while proceeding to Nyarubuye parish overtook you at a place called Rutunga?
A.	Did you say Rutunga?  But there is no such place in my area.  There is no such place in my area.  They passed me in Nyarutunga which is where I lived near the market place.  But Rutunga, I have never heard of such a locality. 
Q.	In fact, Witness, you mentioned Rutunga this morning and my proposition is that the commune vehicles and other pickups carrying assailants overtook you at a place called Rutunga, and this is before the Nyarutunga market.  
A.	I did not make such a statement.  The vehicles found me in Nyarutunga where I lived; it wasn't before the Nyarutunga market but rather before Nyarubuye.  I don't understand how you could have interpreted my statement in such a manner unless you were to show the statement to me.  It is true that people can make a mistake, but I don't believe that I made such a statement before the 
Trial Chamber.

1230H
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, I'm not saying you made such a statement.  I'm putting the proposition to you. 
A.	That is your understanding of the events, but I have my own understanding of the events.  What I have told you here is what I saw.  I went to -- I was in Nyarubuye, and I'm telling you about the events I saw.  Persons who were eyewitnesses of other events can give another version, but I have given you a version of the events that I saw, and I do not wish to change my testimony in any way.  
Q.	Witness, maybe I'll read from your evidence this morning and ask you a question.  Open quote:  "When I heard the first explosions, I didn't hesitate, and the others slipped away because this was our native area and no one could follow us, and we returned to the place where they found us, but I didn't spend the night at home.  I went to Rutunga, to the house of a neighbour." So it's true, Witness, that Kabesime's house was in Rutunga, isn't it? 
A.	Now I understand your question.  Now, as to the place where Kabesime lived, Kabesime lived in Murutunga , which is a locality which is close to Nyarutunga.  So I didn't spend the night in Nyarutunga but in Rutunga, but this does not mean that on the day after, I would return to Nyarutunga.  Nobody asked me a question about that, to find out if I was able to go close to my house in Nyarutunga.  This does not mean that I remained continuously at Kabesime's house.  It is not really a place that is very far from Nyarutunga.  I could go close to my house in Nyarutunga, but nobody asked me any questions about that.
Q.	Now, Witness, it's true, isn't it, that immediately the -- you heard the explosions, you fled.  This is at the Nyarubuye parish on the 15th April 1994. 
A.	Yes.  I left that place, that's correct.
Q.	And by your own admission this morning, the assailants who were armed with stream guns and other guns and grenades were in front of you, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  Yes, they were in front of me.  You know there was a large crowd before the parish, and we didn't know the layout of that area.  Actually, those of us who were from Nyarubuye were considered to be cowards, curious onlookers, so we did not -- we were not given any orders to attack them, to shoot at them or to use bladed weapons.  These attackers had come prepared, and they had weapons and were in the front.
Q.	In fact, the group of assailants was approximately 2,000 people, and to use your phrase, it was like market day ?
A.	Well, I cannot give you the figure of 2,000.  I could say that there was a large crowd, but I would not be able to say whether or not there were 2,000.  I can only say that they were many, they were numerous.
Q.	And it would also be true, Witness, that you were not carrying any weapon, traditional or otherwise?
A.	In truth, I did not have any weapons, but if they found you, you would leave with your weapon.  People were never asked to take their weapons.  We were standing near our houses.  It was at a time of insecurity and I was carrying a small stick.  It wasn't a spear or a machete, but I was never ordered to take a machete or a firearm.  I was carrying a small stick that wouldn't frighten anyone, and that is how I left, carrying my small stick.
Q.	Now, it's true, Witness, that the entire perimeter of Nyarubuye parish was cordoned off by the assailants?
A.	I did not pay attention to watch the manner in which they surrounded the buildings.  In any case, the persons I spoke of, when the attackers gathered, they surrounded the buildings, and we realised that they positioned themselves at all entrances or exits by which people could leave the parish.  It's true they surrounded the buildings.
Q.	It would also be true, Witness, that curious onlookers like yourself, who were not armed, could not have been anywhere near the front where the gendarmes and other Interahamwe carrying firearms were situated?
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I should perhaps describe Nyarubuye to you.  Perhaps you know the place.  In front of the courtyard facing Nyarubuye, or facing the courtyard in front of Nyarubuye, you could see what's happening there, wherever you are among the crowd.  I was witness of what was going on there.  Wherever I stood didn't matter very much, wherever I was standing in relation to the crowd.
Q.	But, Witness, it's correct, isn't it, that as a curious onlooker without a weapon, you could not have been at the front where the assailants with firearms were positioned?
A.	It is true, we were not standing in rows.  It was a crowd that was looking on, and it must be said we were afraid.  We were fearful.  You're talking as though we were lined up.  I was a bit far from the building, but I could see and hear what was happening.
Q.	But, Witness, this morning you told Their Lordships that you were at the back of the crowd, didn't you? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And it would also be true, Witness, that between the first line of assailants who had firearms and grenades, and where you were -- or maybe let me rephrase the question.  It's true, isn't it, Witness, that the assailants with bladed and other traditional weapons were between you and the first line of assailants who had firearms?
A.	I have not fully understood the question.  Could you repeat it, please? 
Q.	I'm suggesting, Witness, that between you, where you stood at the back of the crowd, and the assailants who had firearms, there was a group of assailants carrying traditional weapons, like machetes, clubs and spears. 
A.	Other people were mixed.  There were some who carried that sort of weapon, the sort of weapon you've referred to, but in truth, I did not have the time to observe them.  The people I could observe were the ones who were in the vanguard, who were giving orders, who seemed to be most active.  They were armed with guns and grenades.  Some had traditional weapons, in particular machetes, bludgeons, spears, but there were few people in that category.  They weren't very numerous.
Q.	And it's true, Witness, that you were able to flee on hearing the first explosions because you were at the back of the crowd, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct.  Yes, I immediately left after hearing the explosions.
Q.	So it would be equally true, Witness, that you actually never witnessed any of the killings in the mayhem that followed the sound of the first explosions. 
A.	In speaking of massacres, that means killing.  One knows what comes out of a cannon or a gun.  People were screaming.  We realised they were dying.  So in such circumstances, how can I not claim to have been a witness to the massacres that occurred at that place? 
Q.	Witness, you may have heard screams and explosions, but you didn't stay long enough to see any people actually being killed. 
A.	When you speak of people being killed, I don't understand what you mean.  Or you mean that seeing someone falling down after having been hit by a bullet?  I don't know.  You see, people are together in a place, and you fire grenades into the group, you hear the exploding grenades.  Do you think that you can perhaps imagine no one is being killed?  I don't say that I helped to carry the bodies, that I saw one or another person fall, but what I'm saying is that when shots were being fired or grenades being thrown, it wasn't water cannon.  These were arms that must have resulted in the deaths of human beings.
Q.	So it would be correct to suggest, Witness, that you yourself never saw any corpses as you fled? 
A.	You mean when and how I fled from Nyarubuye to my residence, to Kabesime, or Nyarubuye in Tanzania?  Which flight are you referring to? 
Q.	The flight from the parish after hearing the explosions.  And it's my suggestion that because you fled immediately, you never saw any corpses. 
A.	Yes.  In truth, from the parish to my place of residence in Nyarutunga, no one was dead yet.  The people who had been the targets of the explosions and the firing were inside the perimeter.  It was only people who returned on the next day, who went to the vicinity of the parish, that saw bodies, corpses.  Otherwise, I did not see any corpses except those I saw at my home place of Nyarutunga.  It's only that day at Nyarubuye people killed.  I hadn't seen people killed before that day, except the people killed at Nyarutunga.  I hadn't seen any other bodies, any other corpses.
Q.	Now, Witness, it's correct, isn't it, that subsequent to this attack on the refugees at Nyarubuye parish, you went into hiding?
A.	Yes.  Well, let's say yes, I went to hide myself somewhere, but I returned to my residence where I was living.  No one was after me, so to speak.  But I went to spend my night there; at least, that was my intention.  So I spent the night where I said, and life went on in the circumstances -- under the circumstances I have described.
Q.	And didn't you tell this Court this morning that you fled and spent the night of the 28th of April in Tanzania? 
A.	That is correct.  Yes, I did state that.  But during the preceding days, that is from the 15th, I wasn't asked any questions about that, so that doesn't mean that I had left Nyarubuye.  I was still in the vicinity of Nyarubuye.  We were very anxious.  They didn't kill us all in one day.  They went on with their attacks.  We would hear that one friend or another had been killed.  We came upon people who were wounded.  That was the sort of life we had in those days, at that time.
Q.	Isn't it actually true, Witness, that you fled and arrived in Tanzania on the 30th of April 1994, rather than the 28th, as you've told Their Lordships?  
A.	I will not change what I said.  It is I who made the trip.  I went to the destination I referred to.  You speak of the date of the 30th.  You mention the 30th.  I know very well I left on the 28th, in the night.  I passed through Nyarubuye and I spent the night that night on Tanzanian soil.  I don't know where you got -- you've drawn the comment you just made from. 
Q.	Witness, isn't that what you told Defence investigators, that it was the 30th, rather than the 28th of April 1994? 
A.	Listen, I did not commit to memory everything I said to the investigator.  In any case, on the 30th, I was still on my way.  I hadn't yet reached the refugee camp.  When you say that I left after the 30th, it is not true, because the 28th is the day I left Nyarubuye, and that very night, I slept in Tanzania, so whoever wrote this statement committed a mistake.  It is true I continued on my way on the 30th, but I'd already left that place. 
Q.	Now, you told Their Lordships this morning that on the 28th April 1994, at around 6 a.m., the RPF rounded up people in your neighbourhood and took them to the Nyarubuye health centre; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	You also told Their Lordships that it was in that process that you were able to escape and flee to Tanzania?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I stated that it was on that day that I fled to Tanzania, but it wasn't in the morning of that day.
Q.	What time did you flee, Witness? 
A.	In the evening.  I don't know the exact time, but in any case, it was after 6 p.m.  That's when I went to Tanzania, at dusk.  In fact, the RPF fighters could have arrested us, or other killers might have stopped us, so we had to wait the night to be able to move so that everyone had gone home and we wouldn't be stopped on our way.
Q.	And at what time did you flee from your captors at the health centre on the 28th of April 1994, Witness?  
A.	It was late in the afternoon, but I did not look at my watch to be in a position to give you the precise time.  It was in the afternoon. 
Q.	And between your escape from your captors in the afternoon and 6 p.m. in the evening when you crossed over into Tanzania, where were you? 
A.	If you remember correctly, I said I left that place, I went on my way, and then I arrived at Kagimerura (phonetic) hill, where several people were sheltering.  Some of them were ready to continue.  They had some essential items with them.  In fact, it wasn't far from Nyarubuye.  We could hear the firing.  We could hear explosions from Nyarubuye.  We could see people running from the hill opposite.  And I was waiting.  I wasn't alone.  There were other people also waiting there.
Q.	So it would be correct to suggest, Witness, that when you fled from your captors, on no occasion did you ever go back to Nyarubuye parish on the 28th of April 1994? 
A.	Absolutely.  I never set foot again in Nyarubuye. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to read the last paragraph of your statement and ask you a question.  And I quote:  "The soldiers continued to pick up people in Nyarubuye secteur, around the parish, and took them there to be killed.  Before killing them, the Hutus were forced to prostrate and eat a piece of flesh from the corpse.  That was how the number of people killed in Nyarubuye parish increased as RPF soldiers hunted down Hutus.  When I saw that, I decided to flee to Tanzania and arrived on 30th April 1994."  Full stop and closed quote. 
A.	 (Answer not interpreted).
Q.	Witness, wait for the question.  Is it true, Witness, you fled and arrived in Tanzania on the 30th of April 1994? 
A.	I have explained that point.  I crossed the border on the 28th, but once in Tanzania -- Tanzania is a vast country.  I think there was a misunderstanding between I and the person who took down my statement.  In fact, the final destination, it was on the 30th.  We were walking, we were in a forest and we hadn't yet reached a place where we could rest as refugees.  There was not yet -- we had not yet reached any centre of assistance.  That's what I meant.
Q.	So is it also the investigator's mistake to state that you saw Hutus forced to prostrate and eat flesh from the corpses?  
A.	According to the questions you've been putting to me, you asked me whether such thing or another occurred.  You told me you were not there at the time of the events.  I tell you when I left the place, but according to what was told to me, you may undertake investigations.  You would find out the same thing.  I don't know whether it's forbidden that I should repeat what was told me, but I was not a witness to that.
Q.	But you told the investigators, Witness, and I quote, "When I saw that."  Are you now saying that you never witnessed it with your own eyes but just heard about it? 
A.	Well, it depends.  It depends on what acts we are talking about.  I spoke of the events I witnessed.  I also spoke of events reported to me by other people.  I was not witness to any scene where someone was forced to eat a corpse, and you yourself, you put -- proposed certain things to me that were reported to you by other people.  Inasmuch as I wasn't there, since I had been there, I met people who had been there, who joined me at the refugee camp, so it is not surprising that I should have mentioned things reported to me by other people.  So when I say, "When I saw that," it doesn't mean only that day.

MR. KAREGYESA:
If it pleases Your Honours, I have two questions for closed session and I'll be through with this witness's evidence.  Just two questions in closed session, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall move into closed session for these two brief questions.

 	(Pages 39 to 44 by Mark Porter)






























1310H
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
The Prosecutor renews his request to have video footage of witnesses, and the last witness, Your Honours, is a clear example of why it is necessary that an absent Judge has the opportunity to view a video recording so that he or she is in the better position to observe the demeanour of a witness while responding to questions in cross-examination.  That's all I have to say, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Counsel Kouengoua, you have something to say? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I don't know whether the Defence is being invited to comment, because on this subject, since the morning, the Trial Chamber is addressing the -- the Prosecution is addressing the Trial Chamber.  We had been talking about it in restricted session, we can go -- we can discuss it in open session, if you want.  We are fully prepared to say what we have to say on the subject. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you tell us briefly what you have to say, Counsel?  The question was raised in open session. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Your Lordship, I think that the answer to the concern expressed by the Prosecutor is on page 3, paragraph E of the decision of the 27th of August, 2003, where the following is stated:  "The Trial Chamber forbids any photograph, any recording, audio or video, or any sketch of protected Defence witnesses at any time, in any place, in the context of their cooperation with the Tribunal or of their testimony before the Trial Chamber, without the permission of the Trial Chamber and the protected witness."  That is the decision the -- handed down by -- my position, Madam President, in respect of what was said in closed session was perhaps to find ways and means to get out of this impasse which concerns all the parties, the Trial Chamber in its entirety.  That is why I said that having thought about it in a closed session, there could be something else than video recordings which -- on the subject of which a decision had been taken.  Perhaps a reduction of the number of people who came here in the context of Rule 15.  That's what I was going to say in closed session, but now we are in open session so that is what we think about it. 

And the Defence in relation to this problem -- and I should like it sincerely to be undertaken in closed session -- because in this Trial Chamber, on several occasions, the Prosecutor does not object when a Judge was absent and could not observe the demeanour of the witness, so the witness that should be seen is the Prosecution witnesses, because that is how the Prosecution's case is made.  But he lets the witnesses go, he did not ask for recording, but when it comes to the Defence -- he did not say anything when he was concerned.  Now it's the Defence's turn, and he is not part of the Defence.  I am based -- I based my point of view on precedent, and I don't think there was any request to review, or there was no appeal against your decision. 

That is point of view of the Defence, and I take the opportunity to draw your kind attention to what we are doing.  We in the Defence have proposed to cooperate with the August Chamber, courtesy and transparency in all we do. 

The question also raised by the Prosecution this morning was to say that if we accept after ZHZ that it was an I or a G or a W or -- then we would have the time to prepare cross-examination.  Madam, I would state before the Bench that we never raised any such problem.  On Tuesday, the 5th of August, 2003, in full hearing, the Prosecutor inverted the order of his witnesses.  Instead of TAK, TAS, TAS and TBC were proposed to us while the hearing was in full session.  We said that it disturbed our -- the order of the Defence, or the preparation of the Defence, but we were ready to go ahead, and the comment was made that it was not in anyone's interest for the trial to last eternally, and we complied at the time, and here again, in order to avoid delays, we presented the witnesses that we had in hand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the parties.  We shall come back to that matter.  We shall now adjourn for lunch and reconvene and pursue the hearing at 3 p.m.  
(Court recessed at 1320H)
(Pages 48 to 49 by Mark Porter)














	(Court resumed at 1500H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are resuming the session.  We shall start by issuing an oral decision.  The Prosecutor referred to the Chamber a matter regarding the video recording of witnesses to enable the absent Judge to watch the demeanour of the witness.  We want to refer the Prosecution to the decision of the 23rd of December 2003 - 2002, in the matter of - so, it's - so it is the decision of the 25thof August 2003, forbidding that the recording of hearing of a witness be done.  That decision forbade the recording of the testimony of a witness.  The Chamber is of the opinion that in view of the current situation, and the matter in issue, pursuant to Rule 15 bis (D), since the replacement of Judge Reddy is not on the agenda and consequently the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber in the matter of the Butare is not relevant.  

However, the decision of the 25th of August 2003, cited by the Defence, and relating to the protection of Defence witnesses, prohibits any video recording or sound recording of witness - of the said witnesses.  However, in the same paragraph cited above, the Chamber states that such recording cannot be done without his or her authorisation, and the permission of the protected witness.  Consequently the Chamber denies in the current matter the Prosecution motion for recording of Defence witnesses who are protected.  

Counsel Kouengoua, with regard to P04 exhibit, do you have any copy of that exhibit, please?  We would like to see it.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, we did not come prepared, so we will crosscheck it later.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can do that and then show it to us subsequently.  We would like to see the decision of the Chamber regarding that exhibit, and we would like to look at it provisionally.  

If there are no other motions from either party, I would like to know, Counsel, who is appearing this afternoon.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I am seeking clarification on the exhibit number you just referred to.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I am sorry, I did not hear the beginning of your sentence, could you please repeat it?
MR. KAREGYESA:
I am seeking clarification from you on the exhibit number you have just mentioned.  That's all I need, the exhibit number.  I didn't get the translation properly.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
With regard to the Exhibit D04, we asked the Defence Counsel whether it is possible to provide us with that exhibit, because we have problems using it because it is illegible.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, it was just clarification, because initially in the English translation we got P04, but now you have clarified that you are referring to D04.  Most obliged.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, we are calling Witness NJ1, and Madam President -- NG1.  Madam President, we would like this witness to testify exclusively in closed session.  We can't do anything without this witness being identified, whatever precautions we take.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Prosecution -- that is actually what I was going to say, that we should move into closed session, thus Counsel Kouengoua can give his reasons and Counsel for the Prosecution can challenge or give his counter - reasons.  So, we will move into closed session for the testimony of -- the entire testimony of that witness.

1615H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, while the witness is being escorted from the box, can you tell us what -- who is your next witness?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
For this afternoon, Madam President -- I am hoping that the time allows -- we have YEW.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please bring in the Witness YEW. 

Witness YEW.  Monsieur YEW.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness.  That is why you have been given the pseudonym YEW.  You will make your solemn declaration shortly and you will then be examined by the Defence and cross-examined by the Prosecution.  The Judges might have some questions to put to you, and the Defence can, if need be, re-examine.

The registry will assist you in making the solemn declaration.
MR. JUMA:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up, raise your right hand and repeat the following words after me. 
(Declaration made by Witness YEW in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the witness and the registry.

Counsel, is it Counsel Kouengoua or -- Counsel Kouengoua.  Very well.  Pray proceed.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.   Most respectfully, I submit that the first part of the examination-in-chief be undertaken in closed session as we are dealing with a protected witness. Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No objections?  We shall move into closed session to ensure the protection of the witness.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.  Counsel, you may continue. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, madam.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness XEW -- YEW, when did you hear of the president's death?
A.	I heard of the president's death on the 7th of April 1994 in the morning.
Q.	Who gave you the news?
A.	I heard the news over the radio.
Q.	And what did you do?
A.	I stayed at home.
Q.	Did you stay at home the whole day?
A.	Yes, I stayed home all day.
Q.	And on the 8th of April what did you do?
A.	On the 8th of April 1994, I also stayed home.
Q.	On what date did you leave your home after the death of the president?
A.	Well, when I saw there wasn't any problem, that we were safe, I was at Nyakarambi, and I was able to leave it on the 9th of April to go and look at my houses and see what state there were.  If there was security thereabouts, that everything was safe.
Q.	And on the 12th, what did you do?  Did you stay home?  Did you go out?
A.	The situation was still calm.  I could move around freely.  I went out in the morning to see if there wasn't any problem, if our houses hadn't been attacked.  Then I had to go and visit my sister who was living alone and who was staying in Gatore secteur.  So, I went to see her, as usual.  While on my way there, I passed Gatore secteur office on my way and I saw two vehicles from Rusumo commune there.  I did not dally; I only slowed down, but I saw the bourgmestre in the company of the inspecteur du police judiciaire of the police -- communal and judicial police inspector, and also a few other people.
Q.	And did you find your sister at home?
A.	Yes, she was at home and we discussed for quite a while.  We chatted for quite a while.
Q.	At what time did you arrive at your sister's house?
A.	It was about 10 o'clock; in any case, it was in the forenoon.
Q.	How far is the secteur office from the road?
A.	It is roughly ten metres from the road.
Q.	Did your sister tell you why the bourgmestre was there?
A.	You would understand very well that I asked that question.  Even if I hadn't stopped to find out what had happened, I said I saw many people with the bourgmestre, the judicial police officer, and he told me that people had died.  And I requested explanations regarding the circumstances of their death and they told me there is someone called Nkurunziza, his wife and children had died and that the bourgmestre had held a meeting to give instructions regarding the security of the people, and that those perpetrators of the killings had been arrested.
Q.	Nkurunziza is No. 185 on the list handed out.  For how long did you stay with your sister?
A.	We were together for roughly an hour and a half, perhaps two hours.
Q.	Where did you go after the visit to your sister's house?
A.	After visiting my sister, I returned to the centre where I was working, where my business was situated.
Q.	On your way home, did you see the bourgmestre's vehicle with the people you had seen arriving?
A.	No, there wasn't any vehicle there any longer.
Q.	Do you leave -- at what time roughly did you pass through that area?
A.	It was between 11:30 a.m. and 12 noon.
Q.	And once you got into your shop, what happened?
A.	When I got to my shop, I stopped there because I was in my house, and in the evening between 
4 p.m. and 5 p.m. I heard screams.  People were screaming, and I was curious.  I wanted to know what was happening.  I noticed that the screams were coming from the direction of the communal office, Rusumo.  And they were saying that they had been imprisoned, but they had been released because the bourgmestre was an accomplice, and he himself was going to pay for his complicity.  Other people joined their group.  There were scoundrels in the region.  When I realised that the situation was getting worse, I was afraid and I immediately went home.
Q.	What day was that?
A.	It was the 12th; it was a Tuesday.
Q.	In the evening of the 12th, did anything else happen in your area?
A.	I went home because I was afraid following what had happened.  People were guilty who were saying that they had been released.  I simply went home and I didn't know what happened subsequently.
Q.	And what happened on the 13th?
A.	On the 13th of April, I -- I was still worried and I wanted to go and find out whether they hadn't attack our houses.
Q.	Had they attacked your house on the 13th?
A.	No, nobody attacked our houses.  I remember very well.  I do recall that there was shortage of beer and I wanted to have a drink.  So I went to a place called Kiyanzi to look for beer.  And there, in Kiyanzi, I met a man called Havugimana.  I asked him where he was going and he told me he was fleeing.  Then I asked him why he was fleeing and he told me that his elder brother called Oswald had told him that the bourgmestre could no longer provide for their security because he did not have the means, and that even those -- people who had been imprisoned had been released.  So he told them that whoever had the means should flee.  It was Oswald's junior brother who told me so.  So I told him that may the Lord bless him and enable him continue his journey.
Q.	Which Oswald are you referring to?
A.	I know Oswald very well.  He was one of the tenants of the bourgmestre's house.
Q.	Was he one of your friends?  Were you neighbours?  What was the relationship between you and Oswald?
A.	We knew one another.  He didn't live very far from my house.  And besides, we were all of the same profession; we were all traders.
Q.	At what time did you return from Kiyanzi?
A.	I left Kiyanzi between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.
Q.	And when you left Kiyanzi where did you go?
A.	The situation had significantly changed.  I did not even stop at my shop.  Since I wanted to slake my thirst, I went immediately home.
Q.	On that day of the 13th, did you catch sight of the bourgmestre?
A.	I did not see him in person on that day.
Q.	Did you see him after that day?
A.	I did not see him again since that date.
Q.	Since the time you heard the announcement of the president's death and the day you arrived in your area, were there any dangers in your area?
A.	The people who arrived in my area included those who came to my house the following day, the 14th.
Q.	And the people who arrived in your home on the 14th, where were they coming from?
A.	Among them were people from Byumba, others from the Birenga commune.
Q.	Did those people explain to you why they were coming to your home?
A.	Yes, they told me they were fleeing and that the RPF, which at the time was known as Inkotanyi, was getting closer to their area and that the RPF was killing people.
Q.	For how long were those people in your area -- in your home?
A.	I sheltered them up to the 28th when we were forced to flee.
Q.	Did you go to your shop on the 14th?
A.	Yes, I went there in the morning because the security situation was worsening.
Q.	Had anything new happened?  Why do you say that the situation was worsening?
A.	When I arrived I found a crowd around the house and they were saying that two people had been killed.
Q.	Did you know the people who are killed -- who had been killed?
A.	Yes, I knew them, but I did not enter the house where they were, but I knew them.
Q.	Did you know their names as well?
A.	Yes, I knew their names.  One of them was known as Marie and the other was called Beatrice.
Q.	Did you see their corpses?
A.	No, I didn't get close to them.  Furthermore, in our tradition, it is not normal for a man to approach a woman's body.  I didn't draw close to the area.  I was afraid and I immediately went home.
Q.	Did you learn, even subsequently, what was the cause of their death, how they died?
A.	I went home after that and my house was far from that area, but I had heard that hoodlums had come at night and killed them.  That is the information I managed to gather subsequently.
Q.	And what were those two people, who had been killed, doing in April 1994?
A.	They were trading -- they were traders.
Q.	Did they also have shops like you?
A.	Only the person called Marie -- or, rather, the person called Marie was selling beer, and the other sold milk.
Q.	Did they have shops, or they were renting the places where they were selling this?
A.	They were renting. They were tenants.
Q.	And if they were tenants, did you have the opportunity of knowing the owners of their houses?
A.	Yes, I knew the owners of their houses.
Q.	Can you give their names to the Chamber?
A.	Marie was the tenant of the bourgmestre's house and Beatrice was renting a house belonging to the manager of the local cooperative bank.
Q.	Do you know the name of the manager of the local cooperative bank?
A.	Yes, I know his name.
Q.	What was his name?
A.	His name was Jonathan Kananura.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Could the interpreters spell the name?  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Kananura is spelt as follows: K-A-N-A-N-U-R-A.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	You have just said that when you arrived you heard that thugs had killed the husband of Beatrice, but you didn't see the bodies because in your tradition men do not look at the bodies of women they don't know.  Were you living in the same building at that time?
A.	I do not know whether he spent the night in the same room, but I know that one of the women was renting the house belonging to the bourgmestre, while the other was renting a house belonging to the manager of a local cooperative bank.
Q.	You said that subsequently you went home.  Were the people you had received on the 14th, the refugees you had received on the 14th, still in your house?
A.	Yes, they were still there because, as I said, we went together on the 28th when we fled.  We travelled together when we fled.
Q.	Were those people Tutsi or Hutu?
A.	They were Hutu, but there were also some Tutsi in that group.
Q.	Apart from the refugees you received in your house, were there other refugees in Rusumo commune?
A.	Yes, there were many.  There were some in the Kirehe secteur and others in Gatore, and also in Nyakarambi.
Q.	How many Tutsis were among those you housed?
A.	There was one Tutsi woman with her children.
Q.	Were those people related to you somehow before the date of the 28th of April 1994?
A.	Among them there was a woman married to my brother-in-law.
Q.	And who was your brother-in-law?
A.	If I were to give his name, I believe that could lead to the --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Excuse me -- excuse me, Madam President.  In the heat of the examination I do make mistakes.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Was your sister-in-law Hutu or Tutsi?
A.	She was Tutsi.
Q.	So after the 14th, what happened, Witness?
A.	I observed that the situation was getting increasingly difficult and we were experiencing difficulties in our trade; people could attack us to exhort money.  So I decided to stay at home up to the 28th when we fled.
Q.	Witness YEW, can you tell the Chamber the state of the refugees who arrived in your house?
A.	They were ordinary refugees.  There were men, women and children in the group.
Q.	Did they arrive in your house on foot or they travelled in vehicles?
A.	Some of them came on board vehicles.
Q.	And on what date did you flee from Rusumo?
A.	We crossed the border on the 28th of April 1994.
Q.	And before crossing the border, didn't you have problems on the way?
A.	Yes, we encountered difficulties in the area known as Kiyanzi.
Q.	And what kind of difficulties did you encounter?
A.	We found a roadblock there which was manned by people who were preventing us from crossing the border, and they asked us to give them money.  Finally, we gave them money and we crossed the border.
Q.	Were you able to identify a few persons among those who asked you for money?
A.	Yes, I was able to identify three of them.
Q.	And you had seen these three persons previously?
A.	Yes, I saw them.
Q.	And where had you seen them most recently?
A.	I hadn't seen them in a long time.  I just found them in that place on that day.
Q.	You stated a moment ago that during the day of the 12th, the person the bourgmestre had arrested at the end of May had been released; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That is what I stated.  I said I saw persons who were surprised and who called him as an accomplice and that he -- they had to pay for their complicity. 
Q.	Witness YEW, when you said that they treated him as "he".  Who do you mean by "he"?  Who are you referring to when you said that they were treating him?  Can you clarify this for us?
A.	They were talking about the bourgmestre who had put them in prison.  And I recognised amongst that group Augustin Nkunumwami, who was nicknamed Maréchal.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
That would be No. 178 on your list of proper nouns for Nkunzumwami, and Maréchal is spelt, 
M-A-R-E-C-H-A-L.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Who else were you able to recognise?
A.	I recognised the person whose name I mentioned and I told you that I was frightened, but I was able to identify that person and I immediately went home, as I told you.
MR. KAREGYESA:
It's not clear whether this person that he identified, he identified him at the barrier, or it's not clear where he was when he identified Maréchal.  If counsel could clarify that one by giving dates, places and time.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I believe that we are giving the counsel for the Prosecution unnecessary clues.  You said that on the 12th, people were released.  I asked if you recognised any persons amongst those who were identified.  I believe the clarifications had already been provided by the Prosecutor himself.  Perhaps this did not go through, as they were speaking at the same time.  But as far as we are concerned, there is no further confusion.  Is there? 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness YEW, were you able to hear what these persons said when they threatened the bourgmestre?
A.	As I have already said, I left because I was afraid, but I had heard, because the people were starting to be disrespectful towards the bourgmestre and they showed that the security situation was worsening.
Q.	And what were they saying about the bourgmestre?
A.	I have already answered.  They said that there was a person of bad morality; that he had put them in prison; that he was on the side of the Inkotanyi and that he would pay.
Q.	Witness YEW, on that date -- this was the 12th of April; wasn't it?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And on the 13th of April, did you see these criminals again?
A.	On the 13th of April when I left my house I described the path that I took, but I did not see them again.
Q.	When you were blocked at a roadblock where you had to give money, were you in the company of the refugees that were in your house?
A.	Yes, I was with them and we arrived in Tanzania together.
Q.	Along the way, did you hear that any order had been given to prevent the people to cross the border to go into Tanzania?
A.	No, I never received information of that sort.
Q.	And did you hear of any weapon distribution taking place in your area?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you hear that the bourgmestre had ordered the people to rape Tutsi women?
A.	No, I never heard such an order.
Q.	You mentioned the names of Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi's tenant.  Can you tell us what their ethnicity was?
A.	As I have already stated, there was one person named Marie who was killed and she was a Tutsi.  There was also Oswald Rutagenwa, and a person named Murokore. There was another person named Murwanashyaka.
Q.	Did you hear who killed Marie and Beatrice?
A.	As I have already stated, people said that they were killed by criminals, but I was not able to find out exactly who the killer was.
Q.	Did you find -- did you hear or find out where the bodies were, in what house the bodies were?
A.	There were many people there and the bodies were in the house of the manager of the people's bank, the banque populaire.
Q.	Before you fled, were persons killed in your locality?
A.	Before I fled, the persons from Nyakarambi had been killed and those were the victims I was able to know, because I also had personal safety problems and I no longer left my residence, because I had heard that people were going to attack us in order to take money from us.  So those were the only two victims of Nyakarambi that I was able to meet, because of that specific reason.

	1710H 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Were any Hutu killed in your locality in April 1994?
A.	With the exception of one person that I heard of who was killed in Nyakarambi, but I never went to that place, but I heard people speak of the death of this person.
Q.	Witness YEW, why did you flee on the 28th?
A.	It is clear because the refugees that were at my house said that the RPF was gaining ground.  And the RPF arrived in our commune, and I saw injured persons -- or saw persons were injured who told me that they had been shot at, so I could do -- the only thing I could do is to flee.  And so I decided to cross the border and go to the other side.
Q.	And so did the RPF also kill persons in your commune?
A.	Subsequently, when I reached the refugee camp in Tanzania there were some persons that I told them to flee, but then they refused, but the children were able to cross the Akagera river.  And when they reached Tanzania they told me that their parents had bean killed by the RPF. 
Q.	Witness, are you prepared to return to Rwanda?
A.	The time is not yet come for me to return to Rwanda, because in 1996 I returned to Rwanda and we were almost targeted by the authorities, so once again I went on the road to exile.  So I would say that I personally am not prepared to return to Rwanda.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, we have come to the end of our examination-in-chief of Witness YEW.  We had said that it would take us three hours to complete this examination-in-chief, but we have done our utmost in order to complete our examination-in-chief in one hour and ten minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you proceed with the cross-examination, counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, with your indulgence, I pray that we adjourn for the day so that I can exam this witness tomorrow morning.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, can we know why this request for an adjournment has been made?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I pointed out this morning that we would be asking for an adjournment on account of the fact that this witness was not listed for today.  The witness who was supposed to appear in his stead, after NG1, is YCW.  Counsel did not even have the courtesy of applying for your Lordships' permission to vary the order of witnesses, he just entered un fait accompli.  And I did mention that when there is such a change, it is disruptive based on the preparations we had.  And as a result, I'm not in a position to proceed, given that there is only ten minutes to the adjournment.  

So, I pray that we take the adjournment now to allow me sufficient time to prepare for the examination of this witness tomorrow morning.  And it is going to be very brief examination, Your Honours.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, with your leave.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
On the 5th of August 2003, this same Prosecutor stated, Madam President, Your Honours, before I began with the examination-in-chief, I would like to bring to your attention something dealing with the order of appearance of my witnesses.  And it was perhaps 8:45.  In reviewing the list, starting with Witness TAK, we were supposed to hear Witness TAS --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Unfortunately, Counsel for the Prosecutor (sic) is reading too fast for the English booth to keep up.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the English booth is complaining about Counsel's speed, if you could intervene?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please speak slower.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I wish to apologise to the interpreters and the court reporters.  

Madam President, I was saying that on the 5th of August 2003, the Prosecutor had stated during the hearing whilst he had the floor to exam a witness, I believe it was Witness TAK, he informed the Trial Chamber of the following:  "After reviewing the list of witnesses, after Witness TAK we were supposed to hear TAS, TAP and TBC.  Unfortunately, we have been informed that TAP is unavailable and might not be able to come and testify today.  Therefore, we suggest that we should continue with Witness TBC and Witness TAS today."  

So we moved from Witness TAS to Witness TBC.  And it was only after TBC that TAS came to testify.  I am referring to the transcript of Tuesday the 5th of August, this is page 2, paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  "I am hoping that Witness TAP's health should improve and then we can hear this." 

So, I just wanted to bring this change to the attention of the Trial Chamber.  And these were changes that were beyond our -- we take due note of what the Prosecutor said.  And the Prosecutor then proceeded with his re-examination.  Madam President, I am -- on several occasions I have made -- I have protested, you will remember Witness TBI and TBJ, and you'll remember what I said on those occasions.  And so I believe that the Prosecutor should apply the same rules.  What applies to the goose, applies to the gander.  And he should implement -- in fact, apply to himself what he applies to others.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel.
MR. KAREGYESA:
(Microphone not on.) -- to Counsel's mischaracterisation of events.  I always had the courtesy of informing the Court of any variation and sought the Court's indulgence; Counsel, this morning did not.  He just informed us that he would be calling YEW, when it was YCW who was listed.  

And if Your Honours recollect, on every occasion when there was a variation of the order of witnesses, the Chamber granted Counsel short breaks to prepare for the cross-examination of those witnesses.  And all I'm asking is similar treatment, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Counsel Kouengoua, what are the next witnesses that shall be appearing during this week?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, this week I am not in a position to tell the Trial Chamber who should be appearing exactly this week.  I am expecting witnesses to arrive on Thursday.  I was promised that these witnesses would arrive on Thursday.  And I also believe, Madam President, I mentioned this this morning as a side line that most certainly -- but we are just trying to resolve this problem, we might actually reduce the number of witnesses that I had initially suggested, especially if it can allow us to avoid the problem of Rule 15 bis, that is my main concern, Madam President.

If everyone were already available here, then I could give you the names of those who were to testify.  But, as I am still working on my team to see if it is not possible for this section to block certain of those persons in view of the current situation, I believe that it might not be a bad thing, unless the parties do not agree or the Trial Chamber does not agree.  That is our main concern, Madam President.  

We have asked, but we don't know.  We said that while we were waiting for one of our expert witnesses to come and testify next week, but if that can be done, Madam President, I believe that things would move very quickly for us.  Well, at least, so that we can respect the deadlines that we had set.  Of course, if there are any problems that arrive, I would like you to know that it is not because we have not done our utmost.  

In any case, tomorrow the Trial Chamber will be sure of the fact that Witness YCW, I believe, will be testifying tomorrow.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel  --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:-
	The Presiding Judge was speaking.
MR. KAREGYESA:
-- which witnesses are currently in Arusha, because that would help us to do forward planning; which witnesses are in Arusha as of today?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I suppose that you have answered the question by telling us that Witness YCW, is that the only witness that you have in Arusha currently available?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President, that is the witness that the Prosecutor was clamouring for, and my assistant has just -- has just informed me the Witness UPT should also be in Arusha.  I have not received confirmation of this, but in any case, YCW has been in Arusha for two or three days, I believe.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So, Witness YCW will be appearing for sure and you will be verifying that Witness UPT is here?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
However, we should take into consideration that those who have not been announced might be set aside, because it is not easy for anyone.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is up to you to make the application.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
That is what I intend to do, Madam President. I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We have now reached the end of our day, it is 5:25 p.m., and we shall adjourn until tomorrow 8:45 for the cross-examination of the witness that is present here.  And after that, we will hear Witness YCW.  I thank you all.  This hearing is now adjourned.
