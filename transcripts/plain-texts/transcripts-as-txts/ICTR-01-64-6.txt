P RO C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Court is in session.  

Good morning, Witness TAP.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath, and the Prosecutor will now lead the 
re-examination.

Very well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Prosecutor.  You may proceed.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honour.
WITNESS TAP
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MOBBERLEY:
Q.	Good morning, Witness TAP.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Witness TAP, yesterday you were asked when you first told me -- when you first told me that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi had raped you; that is, before you came to Court.  Can you tell us when you first told me that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi had raped you?
A.	I told you on Sunday.
Q.	Do you recall our meeting on Sunday?
A.	I do.
Q.	Do you recall that during that discussion you told me that you had some new information, but that you weren't prepared to speak about it at this stage?
A.	I remember.
Q.	Do you recall our meeting on Tuesday night?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you recall then telling me between five and 6:30 that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi had raped you?
A.	I remember.
Q.	Will you confirm for the Judges that's the first time that you told me that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi had raped you?
A.	On Sunday I met with a white woman and I had something to tell her, but I did not feel strong enough -- it was something that was close to my heart, I tried to give her the information.  I gave her some details, but I did not feel strong enough and did not give her all the information.  On Tuesday she came back, and I tried to overcome myself to tell her that Gacumbitsi had raped me.  And that is when, if I am not mistaken, that I gave the information to this white woman.
Q.	Thank you, Witness TAP.  I've got some questions of clarification for you now arising from the questions you were asked in cross-examination.  

In cross-examination yesterday you confirmed that you were first raped by Athanase, Alexis and Vincent after the events at Nyarubuye parish.  Now, what I want to know is:  Were you raped by Sylvestre Gacumbitsi on the same day as you were raped by Athanase, Alexis and Vincent or on a subsequent day?
A.	It was the same day.
Q.	Witness TAP, you also said that you went to Kabesime's place for four days Kabesime was with you and looked after you, but after that she ran away and you stayed there.  You said you stayed there until the Inkotanyi found you there.  Do you remember how many days you were at Kabesime's place after she leaves?
A.	If my memory serves me right, I remained there three days after she had left.  This is an approximation, of course.  We couldn't keep track of days at the time, but I think that it was approximately that number of days.
A.	Thank you, Witness TAP.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
I have nothing further for the witness, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness TAP, we have reached the end of your testimony.  We would like to thank for coming to testify before the Tribunal, and we wish you a safe journey to return home.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President. 
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, I believe that we have just had the last witness that was scheduled for this week.  Can you tell us what you now intend to do?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honour.  Indeed, this was our last witness scheduled for this week.  She was the ninth Prosecution witness so far.  As intimated to Your Lordships at the beginning of this week, the Prosecution now applies for adjournment of the proceedings on account of a busy schedule before another Chamber between Monday, the 11th, through Friday, 15th of August.  The terms of the scheduling notice for the Cyangugu case, requires us to be before Trial Chamber III on Monday 11th of August through Friday.  

With your leave, Your Honours, the Prosecutor would be ready to proceed with its remaining -- with her remaining witnesses between Monday, the 18th of August through Friday, 28th of August.  We expect to be in a position to close the Prosecution case latest Friday 28th of August.  

We have so far led eight protected witnesses from the list of 22.  We have, to date, dropped five witnesses from that list, which means we are left with nine protected witnesses.  It is possible that subsequent to a review, it may be unnecessary to call all nine; we may drop some of those nine witnesses.  In any event, Your Honours, we are committed, if all things remain constant, to completing the Prosecution case on or before the 28th of August.  

I'm most obliged, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No comment, Mr. Prosecutor -- or, rather, Counsel Kouengoua, the Defence?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honour.  

Madam President, Defence understood that the Prosecution was going to announce the list of the next witnesses, otherwise we have no comments to make.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, when will we have available the list of the next witnesses that you will be calling before the Court? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the order of appearance depends on two factors; the availability of witnesses from Kigali and a decision by the Prosecutor on whom she intends to drop.  We intend, in the course of the coming week, to work closely with WVSS to establish who will be here and also to establish who eventually we intend to call.  

We undertake, as usual, to file the order of appearance not later than Friday the week preceding the actual hearing.  Most obliged.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We would like to thank the Prosecutor for this information.  This hearing is adjourned, and we shall resume on the 18th of August -- on Monday the 18th of August with a continuation of trial and the appearance of Prosecution witnesses.  

I would like to add for the record, that each time the Trial Chamber ordered a closed session in this trial; it did so to ensure the security and safety of -- and protection of witnesses.  Thank you.   
	(Court adjourned at 0902H)
