P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing resumes.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

Counsel Kouengoua, without wishing to interfere in your Defence strategy, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that witnesses as to the morality of the Accused should not take up too much of the Trial Chamber's time.  I think you had better devote your efforts to the events or acts of which your client is accused.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, you have the floor. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President, your Lordships, Counsel for the Prosecution, the registry, ladies and gentlemen, the interpreters and the stenographers, court stenographers.  

At the outset I should like to impart some information to the Trial Chamber.  Whilst I remain somewhat anxious, because as a man of law, coincidence, of course, has no place in what we do.  Yesterday in beginning presentation of my Defence case, we were let down by the electronics.  Technical, scientific faults are not a problem, but it's when I'm beginning it's a problem; and then we changed Trial Chambers, and then I was informed at 2:15 p.m. that among my nine ministers -- witnesses, seven who were supposed to come today, everything had been organised, three or four of them have disappeared in a refugee camp.  

Madam President, on hearing that, I thought of the limited number of witnesses that was proposed (sic) to me, so I thought we'd make the best of a bad job, but then, at night, I was told that the witness who was supposed to appear this morning at nine o'clock has gone to hospital, ZHZ, Witness ZHZ.  I thought that she had an attack of malaria, but the protection section, WVSS section, brought me a medical document, medical certificate -- I am holding in my hand, Madam -- they just brought me. 

So the order of the witnesses that I had given you can no longer be respected.  And this morning I asked the WVSS section whether instead of ZHZ we could bring in someone else to replace him so as not to interrupt or delay the course of justice.  That was the information I had to submit to you, Madam President.

So in all logic, the calendar that I filed on Friday has, contrary to my intentions, been upset.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you Counsel, but I think these are simple coincidences, I don't think it was the Defence case that was being targeted.  

It often happens that witnesses fall ill, and as to what happened yesterday with the technical equipment, that also can happen, especially as we were informed that something happened over the weekend where the equipment had been interfered with or -- and that is why we had those problems yesterday.  It's not your fault, and if I can at all reassure you, believe me, these are the hazards of life.  

Now, the witness that was supposed to appear after ZHZ is UHT; is he here?  Is the witness present? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I did ask for him to be brought, but I have no way of checking.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
There are two witnesses here, UHT and UMT.  Perhaps we could begin with UHT.

Good morning Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness, your pseudonym is UHT; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very good.  You will now make the solemn declaration, and the registry will help you to make that solemn declaration.  

You will then be examined by the Defence, cross-examined by the Prosecution, and then perhaps re-examined by the Defence, and the Judges also might be asking you -- putting questions to you.  You may now make the solemn declaration. 
(Declaration made by Witness UHT in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank the witness, and thank the registry.  

Counsel Kouengoua, you may proceed with the examination-in-chief. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before beginning the examination-in-chief I should like this first part to be in closed session so as to avoid anything that might reveal the identity of the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In order to ensure the protection of the witness, we will now move into closed session, and we do present our apologies to the public for that. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 5] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

	0905H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.  Counsel, pray proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness UHT, we are now in open session.  If I ask any questions that might lead to revealing information with respect of your identity, making it possible to identify you or localise you, don't answer, or at least draw our attention to that.  And what I say in respect of myself, equally applies to any question you might be asked; you can either refuse to answer or point out the difficulty.  

Therefore, Witness UHT, where were you when you learned of the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana?
A.	I was at my home at the cellule, the name I gave you in the closed session. 
Q.	Do you remember the date of the day when you learned of the president's assassination? 
A.	I remember that the president died on the 10th of April 1994.
Q.	Witness UHT, on what date did you learn of the assassination or the demise of the president?
A.	I heard the news of the death of the president on the 13th.
Q.	You heard the news about the president's death on the 13th; by what means?  How did you hear about it?
A.	I heard the news regarding the death of the president over the radio.
Q.	And when you heard that news, what was the reaction of the populace in your cellule?
A.	In our cellule, when the populace learned of the death of the president, they were afraid, and that includes me.
Q.	And what happened after that?
A.	During those days, on the hill opposite, Gatongo Hill, there was a man beating a drum and saying, "Rwandans be vigilant, watch out for the enemy".
Q.	And what was the name of that neighbouring hill?
A.	Gatongo Hill in Rukira commune, a commune adjoining ours.
Q.	Gatongo is G-A-T-O-N-G-O, Gatongo; G-A-T-O-N-G-O.  Gatongo is No. 44 on the list of proper nouns that we filed with the Bench.

Were you aware -- were you informed that the inhabitants of Rukira sought refuge in Rusumo commune?
A.	First and foremost, I knew that there were refugees from Byumba who were in the vicinity of Rwanteru; that's what I knew of.
Q.	Witness UHT, is Rwanteru in Rusumo commune?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And according to you, and to the extent you can recall, from what -- from when did the refugees begin to come to Rwanteru?
A.	The refugees who were in Rwanteru had arrived before the president's death.
Q.	Did other refugees -- after the death of your president, did other refugees come to your commune?
A.	Yes, after the death of the president people came from Rukira to seek refuge in Rusumo commune.  They came from everywhere.
Q.	When you say "from everywhere," after mentioning Rukira, do you know the names of other areas from whence the refugees came?
A.	Well, it was in fact the road they took, but they originated from different, various different regions.
Q.	And this movement of people was as of what date?
A.	Most of them we could see after the 13th -- as of the 13th.
Q.	Before you heard the beating of drums, were there any problems in your area?
A.	No, there was no problem in our area, to the extent that our responsable had warned us, told us that we should not accept that anybody introduce any notions of dissension in the society in our area.  He had warned us, forewarned us about that.
Q.	Witness UHT, you have just said that you heard the beating of drums.  How many days after the death of the president did you hear those drums?
A.	I can't remember the days, but what I know is that I heard that drum that was being beaten.
Q.	Do you know the people who were fleeing into your commune?
A.	Yes, there was some that I knew by sight, but I did not know their names.
Q.	During the initial investigation you stated that --
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, I object to that, and -- for the simple reason that the witness is here and giving testimony on oath and cannot be -- Counsel cannot quote from an unsigned statement to this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is upheld.  Counsel, please reformulate your question. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I thank you.  

I don't know whether that objection is also valid for the cross-examination as well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For now we are in examination-in-chief. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness UHT, you stated that people were moving into your commune and you said that you knew some of them and you did not know some of them.  Can you say roughly what number of people were moving into your commune?  Can you tell the Court approximately the number of people who were moving into your commune?
A.	In the course of time, the number of refugees kept rising, but initially they were not very numerous.
Q.	Did you leave your cellule during that period?
A.	At a certain time I left the cellule; that was around the 16th.
Q.	Where did you go on the 16th, Witness UHT?
A.	On that occasion, I was accompanying some refugees who had visited me and I wanted to take into Rwanteru where some other refugees were found.
Q.	And what happened?
A.	On the 16th, that refugee in question had spent a night in my home, on the night of the 16th, but since he did not know the road to -- that he had to take to go to the refugee camp, I had to accompany him right to Rwanteru.  I took tobacco leaves and we transported them to the market, which was close to the refugee camp.
Q.	Did you succeed to take the refugee where he was going?
A.	No, I did not succeed to take him to his destination.  When we got to the road near Gasagara, at the crossroads we met people who were carrying banana leaves -- who were wearing banana leaves and who were masked, and those people took our tobacco leaves and ordered us to throw them, and they ordered us to turn back.
Q.	The -- could the Kinyarwanda interpreters spell the word Gasagara for us, the word used by the witness, please?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Gasagara is spelt as G-A-S-A-G-A-R-A, Gasagara; G-A-S-A-G-A-R-A.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, you said that people wearing leaves intercepted you.  What happened subsequently?
A.	When they intercepted us, since the refugee in question was my brother-in-law, the brother of my wife, he was therefore Tutsi, so they questioned us with regard to our identity, and they ordered us to turn back.  As a matter of fact, they did not actually discover that he was Tutsi, but he looked like a Tutsi, so they obliged us to turn back.  And when we got to Kanyambo, we tried to escape, but it -- we didn't succeed, so they continued pursuing us.  We were still under their control.
Q.	Kanyambo is spelt K-A-N-Y-A-M-B-O.  

And what happened subsequently, Witness UHT?
A.	Subsequently, as we were trying to hide, a grenade exploded in Segakware's home.  Those people caught up with us where we were and they arrested us again and led us towards Nyarubuye.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Could the Kinyarwanda booth spell the word Segakware, please. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Segakware is spelt as S-E-G-A-K-W-A-R-E, Segakware. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Interpreter.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	What happened subsequently, Witness UHT?
A.	Subsequently, they led us towards Nyarubuye, until we got to Nyarubuye, the church in Nyarubuye.
Q.	And when they took you to the church, what did you discover there?  Did you find people there?
A.	When we got there, we found a large number of people who had been killed.  We saw people in military gear and others wearing the gendarmerie uniforms, and others were wearing costumes which also looked like uniforms. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Kitenge is spelt as K-I-T-E-N-G-E.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Interpreter.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	And what happened in Nyarubuye once you got there?
A.	When we got to Nyarubuye we were afraid, and finally, when they released us and occupied themselves doing other things, we stayed in the area.  We saw people killing others, we saw children who had allegedly survived massacres, we saw a certain Imelda (phonetic) the wife of Ntibenda (phonetic).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you go a little slower, please, so that the interpreters could interpret what you are saying?
THE WITNESS:
Right.  Would you like me to go through what I just said, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can continue, but please speak a little slowly.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness UHT, you told the Chamber that there were children wandering about, and people said they were survivors.  Madam President asked you to answer the questions slowly, because the pace at which -- at the pace at which you are going the interpreters and the stenographers cannot follow you.
A.	I crave your indulgence, I don't know the procedure in this Tribunal. 
Q.	Now Witness UHT, when you saw those children wandering about, what happened next?
A.	After seeing those children, we stayed in the area for a long time.  As a matter of fact, we were looking for a strategy to get out of that area, and at one time we sight -- we saw the communal vehicle coming and we were curious to note that it was a van.  And when it arrived on the scene, people came out of it and I could see communal police officers in uniform.  The other people I could see were three people in civilian clothes and a driver.  Those were the people who alighted from the vehicle.
Q.	Witness UHT, when you say that the people intercepted you on the road, did they threaten you?
A.	Yes, indeed, we were even beaten.
Q.	Do you think such threats could have culminated in killing; your deaths?
A.	Yes, it was possible.
Q.	Now, you say that at one time people said they saw the commune van coming, police officers and civilians alighted from it.  Did you know those civilians?
A.	I could identify among those civilians the driver of the communal vehicle.  As for the others, I realised that I didn't know them.
Q.	Witness UHT, prior to the arrival of the vehicle, what had become of the children who were wandering about in the parish -- on the parish premises?
A.	As regards those children who were wandering about the premises, I did not monitor what happened subsequently.  I don't know when they left that area.
Q.	But you said they left the area, all the same?
A.	I don't know.  It is possible that they were killed after we left or maybe they found a place where they took them.  I don't know what their fate was.  But I would like to point out that there was the child of a certain Adeline (phonetic) from Mulindi; he was Tutsi.  At one time I saw this child in 
Gaserabake's (phonetic) home.  I did not know that child, but I noticed that he resembled his parents, because I knew what his parents looked like.  This child had survived.  I don't know whether there were other children with them -- with him who survived as well.
Q.	And before the communal van arrived, did you notice anything?
A.	I noticed that among the people who were dressed in uniform and kitenge, there was a man who was being applauded by the others, and it was being said that he was one who had led that operation.
Q.	Witness UHT, when the van arrived, you say that police officers alighted from it as well as three civilians and a driver.  Did you see Gacumbitsi Sylvestre amongst those people?
A.	Not at all.  Those three people were all weighing less than 60 kilograms.  So anyone who knows the height of our bourgmestre, even without close observation, he would have noticed that he wasn't among them.
Q.	Witness UHT, were you keen to get closer to the van?
A.	Yes, it was being said that the bourgmestre could be on board the vehicle, and since I was a detainee, I wanted to get close to it to find out whether it was possible for me to present my situation to him.  Knowing that the bourgmestre was a person who listened to the people, I wanted to present my problem to him. 
Q.	Witness UHT, you stated a while ago that there were two of you, that you were with your brother-in-law; please tell the Chamber the name of your brother-in-law. 
Witness UHT, don't answer the question.  I crave your indulgence, thank you, Madam President, thank you, Your Honours.

Witness UHT, during the events in Nyarubuye parish, when you saw children wandering about, when you saw the pickup arrive, and when you wanted to go and find out whether the bourgmestre was on board that pickup, were you still with that person you mentioned earlier on during the closed session?
A.	I was still accompanied by the person I mentioned in the closed session.  That person could not have gone away from him (sic).  Since he came from afar, and I was a resident of the region, it was in his interests to stay with me.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber, if you remember, when you arrived at the parish?
A.	I did not have a watch on me, but it was at about 7 a.m. or 8 a.m.; it was very early in the morning.
Q.	On what day was that, Witness UHT?
A.	It was on the 16th of April.
Q.	Do you recall roughly when you left that area; I mean, the parish?
A.	We were afraid of those youngsters who were at the parish, and that is why we could not escape from them.  We stayed there up to 2 p.m. or shortly thereafter, a few minutes after 2 p.m.
Q.	When you went back to the parish were you still accompanied by the person you mentioned earlier on?
A.	Yes, the person I recall -- I would like to remind you that he was my brother-in-law; we left that area together.  He was very afraid, but I managed to take him back to my home and he subsequently fled.  I later on saw him in Tanzania in a refugee camp, notably in the Buliki camp.  He said he was in that camp and was hoping to go to another camp occupied by Tutsis.
Q.	Did you also flee from Rwanda?  Did you yourself flee from Rwanda?
A.	Indeed, in the month of May I realised that the Inkotanyi were killing people arbitrarily, and I decided that it was better to flee, and I went to Tanzania.
Q.	To the best of your recollection, were any rapes committed?  Was anyone raped in your cellule?
A.	I never saw any bodies or any victims of a rape or saw such an act being committed.
Q.	Did the responsable of your secteur or the responsable of your cellule ever ask you to kill, loot or steal?
A.	No, none of these responsables ever gave such an order.  Actually, the responsables asked us to ensure that no one should sow division.
Q.	Witness UHT, you have stated that you were forced to go to Nyarubuye church where you were forced to kill persons; did these persons who forced you, did they give you weapons?
A.	No, we left without any weapons.
Q.	Before that date had any weapons been distributed to you in your cellule?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you ever hear that the bourgmestre allegedly gave orders so that people should not cross the Kagera river to go into Tanzania?
A.	No, I never heard of anything like that.  If the bourgmestre had given that instruction, then I would not have been able to find the person I was speaking of earlier and come across this person in Tanzania because this person would not have been able to cross the border.
Q.	Sorry.

Witness, Witness UHT, now, the person that you sought to bring to Rwanteru and with whom you were at Nyarubuye parish and that you were able to get across to Tanzania, that you were able to meet again in Tanzania, was this person of the same ethnic group as you were?  

Witness UHT, I'm sorry, but if you provide details that is not good, I would just like to ask you to answer this question with a yes or a no.  Did you have the same ethnic group as the person with whom you were?
A.	No, this person was my brother-in-law and he was of a different ethnic group from mine.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I have one last question that I would like to put to the witness.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Amongst the bodies that you saw, were these bodies all of the same ethnic group?
A.	Some of the bodies -- well, rather, I would say that I did not turn the bodies over and take a close look to determine who was   Hutu and who was Tutsi.  I only know that some persons were set aside from those who were going to be killed.  So, the fact that some persons were set aside before they were killed leads me to say that even amongst those who were killed, there were Hutu.  And in my opinion, I would say that the persons who were killed were of all the ethnic groups.
Q.	Thank you, Witness UHT. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have completed my examination-in-chief of this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you may now proceed with your cross-examination.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, you have just told this Chamber that prior to the killings at Nyarubuye parish people were separated before being killed.  Were you there when the separation was taking place?
A.	That is not what I stated.  Perhaps you misunderstood me.
Q.	The last question you were asked, Witness, was whether you were able to identify the ethnicity of the corpses, and you told Their Lordships that prior to people being killed at Nyarubuye parish, they were separated; isn't that correct?
A.	I stated that I saw a man and a woman who had been separated.  They were asked, "Where were you going, because you were Hutu?"  And I said how they were beaten and removed from the group.  "Therefore, you are Hutu, where are you going, why are you with the others?"
Q.	So, would it be your evidence, Witness, that those two Hutus you have just mentioned, a man and woman, were not killed?
A.	Well, I don't know what happened to them subsequently, but myself and my friend, whom I have mentioned, could have been killed.  I will put a question to you:  If I had been killed in Nyarubuye with my friend, wouldn't I have been killed despite my ethnicity?
Q.	Witness, is it your evidence that you participated in the killings on the morning of the 16th of April 1994 at Nyarubuye parish?
A.	No, I did not participate in the killings, but some persons were taken forcibly to Nyarubuye and they ended up being killed.
Q.	Witness, my question was simple:  When you went with this group of attackers who you've just mentioned to Nyarubuye parish on the morning of the 16th of April 1994, did you yourself participate in the killings of survivors?
A.	No, I did not participate in these killings at all.
Q.	Now, you told Their Lordships that you were there between eight o'clock and two o'clock; can you tell us what you were doing during those six hours?
A.	I was at that location, I was afraid and I was waiting to see what would happen to me.  I did not know if I was going to be killed or not.  I could see that people were disappearing little by little, and when I saw that those who had brought me to that location were not watching me closely, I was able to escape.
Q.	So it would be your evidence, Witness, that you sat there for six hours and watched other people kill survivors.
A.	The people -- those people had not been killed on that same morning.  The bodies that we saw there when we arrived were the bodies of persons who had been killed the day before.  What the attackers were doing was to finish off those who were not yet completely dead.
Q.	Precisely, Witness.  So you would want this Court to believe that you sat at Nyarubuye parish for six hours and all you did was to watch attackers finishing off survivors that morning?
A.	I could not sit down.  Did I have any peace of mind?  Of course not, I was shaking.
Q.	Now, can you describe to this Chamber the scene you witnessed at Nyarubuye parish on arrival on the morning of 16th of April 1994?
A.	As I have already said, I saw gendarmes; I saw soldiers and people who were wearing kitenge clothing; I saw corpses near the door and others in the courtyard; I saw children, and people said that the children were survivors; I saw a red vehicle, and people said that it belonged to the gendarmes.  It was a red vehicle.  I also saw the other vehicle that I have already mentioned.  In brief, this is what I saw.
Q.	And would it be correct to suggest, Witness, that the soldiers and gendarmes you found at Nyarubuye parish that morning were --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I object.  Madam President, the Prosecutor has just said, and I quote -- unless the French interpreter would like to correct what has just been interpreted:  "Is it possible to suggest".  To ask questions in that fashion, I believe that this line of questioning is not the line of questioning that the Trial Chamber wishes the parties to follow.
MR. KAREGYESA:
I'm totally at a loss, I don't understand the Counsel's objection.  I hadn't even asked the question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, please, you may proceed.
MR. KAREGYESA: 
Most obliged, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Now Witness, you have just told this Chamber that you found soldiers and gendarmes at Nyarubuye parish that morning.  Is it correct to suggest that these soldiers and gendarmes were members of the Rwandan Armed Forces?
A.	Yes.  They weren't foreigners; these were members of the Rwandan Armed Forces.
Q.	And is it correct, Witness, to suggest that the soldiers, the gendarmes you found there that morning, were participating in the killing of survivors?
A.	The persons who were present were finishing off the survivors, the bodies of those who were not yet dead; that's what I said.
Q.	Yes, and the question was:  In the six hours you purport to have been in the parish watching, were soldiers and gendarmes participating in finishing off those who had survived the massacre the day before?  It's either yes or no.
A.	Yes, they were participating.
Q.	Now, Witness, weren't you shocked that members of your armed forces were involved in murder in broad daylight?
A.	Yes, I was shocked beyond measure, but what could I have done?
Q.	And is it also correct, Witness, that you did not flee Rwanda until May 1994, a month after this incident you are just describing?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Now, if you were shocked and frightened, Witness, why didn't you flee then?
A.	I was waiting for the Inkotanyi to come, because I was hoping that they would free us from this injustice.  And when I saw that the Inkotanyi also perpetrated this type of injustices, that is when I decided to flee.
Q.	Isn't it correct, rather, Witness, that you didn't flee because you were not targeted?
A.	Who could have targeted me?
Q.	Well, the people you purport forcibly took you to Nyarubuye, the soldiers and gendarmes you found at Nyarubuye.  They didn't target you, did they?
A.	Yes, since the day I left Nyarubuye, nobody went after me, nobody followed me; I was not bothered any further.
Q.	In fact, it's correct, Witness, isn't it, to suggest that you weren't at all frightened on that occasion because you were part and parcel of the attackers?
A.	You're stating that I was part of the attackers.  How can you say that?  You are attacking me when I am telling you that I was in very poor condition, that I was shaking, that I was so frightened that I was wetting myself, and I am surprised to see you attacking me.
Q.	Witness, you have never returned to Rwanda, have you?
A.	Since I left Rwanda, to this day I have not returned there, and I have no desire to do so.
Q.	And isn't it true, Witness, that you've never returned to Rwanda and have no desire --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- because of the massacres you participated in at the parish of Nyarubuye on the 16th of April 1994?
A.	I have told you what happened that day, but I did not tell you what I lived through in that country and that led me to flee; I did not tell you that.  And it is because of these events that I had to live through subsequently that I have no desire to return to my country until the situation changes.
Q.	Witness, on the morning of the 16th of April 1994, what time did you leave your home heading for Rwanteru with your brother-in-law?
A.	I left my house very early in the morning, around 6 a.m.
Q.	And what's the distance between your home and Rwanteru?
A.	It is a distance that you can cover in 45 minutes or rather 35 minutes; a 35-minute walk, if you are young and you can walk at a good pace. 
Q.	Now, at what point on that morning did you meet this group of attackers dressed in masks and banana leaves?
A.	We came across them at a few minutes past six, but I would ask you to take into consideration the fact that I was not wearing a watch and I am only making an approximation.
Q.	And it's correct, Witness, isn't it, that these attackers asked you to join them to do the work of hunting down the enemy?
A.	When we came across these persons they first asked us to show our identity cards, and we did.  Then they said, "You have shown us your identity card, but you are in the company of an Inyenzi."
Q.	Did you show them your identity card?
A.	Yes, I showed them.
Q.	And your brother-in-law showed them his identity card?
A.	My brother-in-law was afraid to show them their -- his identity card, and he asked them -- and he told them, rather, that he wasn't yet old enough to have an identity card.
Q.	Now, subsequent to that, Witness, it's true, isn't it, that the attackers told you to join them to go and do the work of hunting down the enemy; yes or no?
A.	They did not ask us to accompany them to kill the enemy, but rather, it was a manner of, a way of hurting us.  I don't know what the intent was, but this is what I understood.  I thought they wanted to hurt us.
Q.	Witness, did you make -- or did you meet an investigator who interviewed you prior to coming to testify in Arusha?
A.	Aside from an investigator that I met at my home in July, I did not meet anyone else.
Q.	More specifically, Witness, you were interviewed on the 28th of July this year, weren't you?
A.	Yes, it was on that date that I was interviewed.

BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	And did you tell that investigator, and I quote, "They advised us to go and do the work of hunting down the enemy"?
A.	If this person wrote down my statement in that manner, he was mistaken.  I came across a person named Aloys , and you can even ask this person.  That is not what I said.
Q.	And did you also tell Aloys, the investigator, that, and I quote, "We hid our tobacco in the bushes --"
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Witness UHT is before you.  The Prosecutor said earlier that the statement was not signed, and therefore if the statement was not signed, that no one had the right to mention the statement.  This is what the Prosecutor said.  Is the version that the Prosecutor has, has it been signed?  If it has, then he should show the Trial Chamber.  If it has not been signed, then I should respectfully request that the first two questions that have just been put to the witness should be struck from the record.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Defence counsel.  Mr. Prosecutor, what would your response be? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
My response is that the Defence investigator, hired by Counsel Kouengoua, interviewed a witness.  Counsel Kouengoua disclosed the statement.  It has been guiding us in these proceedings, and as the adverse party, I'm entitled to establish whether what is stated in this statement is what this witness told the investigator, even though it's not signed.  I acknowledge it wasn't signed, but I'm entitled to find out whether what the investigator took down is what this witness told him. 

And as for, you know, counsel being the -- this witness belonging to counsel, he was leading him in-chief, and it's inappropriate for counsel to lead his witness on the basis of the statement, but for the adverse party, it is within my remit. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Kouengoua.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the matter here is not whether or not the witness made statements to an investigator hired by me or not.  The issue here is, the Prosecutor stated this morning that these unsigned statements cannot be used if the witness is present, and the Trial Chamber acceded to his view.  The Prosecutor cannot come a few moments later to say that the version he have -- unless the version he has was signed. 

If he has questions to ask, he should put them to the witness.  What is the purpose of the investigator?  He should put the question directly to the witness.  An unsigned statement, based on the theory that he formulated against the Defence, that he should stand by his position.  I do not see how he can now ask to reverse this position.  And Madam President, I do not believe that when the Prosecutor makes up that hypothesis, that an unsigned statement cannot be used as long as the witness is present, I can -- this -- I don't see how this would apply to a Defence statement.  This should be a general principle that the law must either accept or reject.  Initially it was accepted.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you are repeating, going over the same ground again.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, I just thought that by doing so, it would clarify my thoughts.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, that's fine.  We have understood you.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, are you not in the same position?  This is what the Prosecutor has told you.  When you cross-examined, we have also allowed you to read out statements made by the witness, and the Trial Chamber is of the view that your position is different now.  And this is why we have allowed the objection raised by the Prosecutor and that we now dismiss yours, because you are not in the position.  You were the one who brought the witness here.  You were the one who examined the witness, and you are the one who tendered -- who brought these documents, who disclosed these documents. 

Therefore, Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed with your question. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, you hadn't responded to my last question because of the interruption from counsel.  I'll ask it again.

When you met Defence investigator Aloys on the 28th of July this year, did you tell him, and I quote, "We hid our tobacco in the bushes and followed them"? 
A.	Yes, that is what I told him.  I told him that we threw our tobacco in the bush, but I did not tell him that we hid the tobacco.  I told him that we threw our tobacco into the bush. 
Q.	Earlier in your testimony this morning you referred to someone from Gatongo hill who was beating a drum and alerted Rwandans to watch out for the enemy.  Did you -- what did you understand "the enemy" to mean at that time? 
A.	At the time I understood that the enemy was the Inkotanyi who had attacked us.  You know that we had spent a great deal of time at war, and it was my understanding that the Inkotanyi had attacked us, and I thought to myself the situation was difficult.  The Inkotanyi had -- were attacking us, even in our locality.  This was serious business. 
Q.	Now, having thrown away your tobacco, Witness, where did you proceed with the attackers? 
A.	They made us walk and struck us.  And they took the road in the direction of where they were going, but we did not know where they were taking us, and we were expecting to be killed at any moment. 
Q.	Did you tell the Defence investigator, Mr. Witness, that you were beaten by these attackers as they took you? 
A.	I told him that they took us and they kicked us on the way and struck us with the clubs they were carrying, unless he forgot to include that in my statement. 
Q.	Now, from where you met the attackers to the place you referred to as Kanyambo, what is the distance? 
A.	It's a short distance because Kanyambo is a cellule that neighbours mine, and there is a short distance between the two.  Moreover, if someone were to turn on their radio and I was at the drinking place in that location, then I could hear the radio. 
Q.	And it's true, Witness, that you were with the attackers when they destroyed the house of Sebatware with a grenade, isn't it? 
A.	How can you say that I was with those attackers when, in fact, I was possibly a candidate for death?
Q.	Witness, please answer the question put to you.  You were with the attackers when they destroyed the house of Sebatware with a grenade, weren't you?  Yes or no? 
A.	I never said I was with them.  Those who attacked Sebatware's, I wasn't with them.  When I reached Rwakanyambo -- I reached Rwakanyambo, but Sebatware's house is on the hill, but it is called Maraba.  But I wasn't even at the location, I was somewhere else.
Q.	Is it your evidence that you had escaped from the attackers? 
A.	I told you during my first testimony that when we reached Rwakanyambo, that we saw people, but I was able to escape from them.  And I believe that these persons were reached -- went to Sebatware's.  They were frightened when they heard a grenade exploding, and it is possible that when they went to Sebatware, they came across other attackers.  You have to understand, even though they were attackers, they were also afraid. 
Q.	Witness, you still haven't answered my question.  Did you escape -- listen.  Please listen to the question.

At the time the attackers proceeded to destroy Sebatware's house, had you escaped from their control, yes or no? 
A.	Are you talking about the attack at Sebatware's?  But after that, they were able to catch me again. 
Q.	And how long after the attack on Sebatware's house did they catch you again? 
A.	While I was looking for a place to hide I saw them, and they came back running.  And they caught up with me again, and they said, "Here are the persons who had escaped from us."  So they caught up with me, and then they left with me.
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that you were actually present when they destroyed Sebatware's house? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President. 
THE WITNESS:
You claim that I participated in the destruction of the house, but I am telling you that I was not there.  Why do you want me to be with those who destroyed the house?  Why are you saying this? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think you have already put this question twice to the witness and it is now time to move on. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, I am suggesting you were there, and that is how you knew that a soldier had been injured by a grenade.
A.	I heard mention of that event and, moreover, I don't know that soldier.  I don't even know his face, but I heard people talking about it, rather. 
Q.	Well, according to you, Witness, at around what time was the attack on Sebatware's house? 
A.	It was about seven o'clock. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, don't know if that's a.m. or p.m.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	And it would be 7 a.m. in the morning, Witness, wouldn't it? 
A.	Yes, about 7 a.m., perhaps a bit after or a bit before, because you must understand I wasn't wearing a watch. 
Q.	Is it correct that subsequent to the attack on Sebatware's house, you proceeded with the attackers to Nyarubuye parish? 
A.	They took me away the second time and beat me more, as well as the friend who was with me.
Q.	And it's correct, Witness, you didn't tell the investigator who interviewed you that you were beaten a second time around when the attackers got you? 
A.	Could you put the question again, please?  Repeat the question.
Q.	You didn't tell the Defence investigator, who interviewed you on the 28th of July, that you were beaten up by the attackers on the second occasion when they got you? 
A.	You see, I was speaking Kinyarwanda, but the investigator was writing down what I said in French.  I did not reread what he had written to check whether it was a correct representation of what I said, so it is my testimony here that is the most truthful because I did not check the statements as recorded by the investigator. 
Q.	All I'm interested in is whether you told the Defence investigator in Kinyarwanda that you were beaten up by the attackers on the second occasion.  It's either yes or no. 
A.	Yes, I spoke to him or I told him, and I can even confirm it in his presence that I told him that I had been beaten a second time. 
Q.	So you were beaten the first time, you managed to escape, and you were beaten a second time and taken to Nyarubuye.  Now, how long did it take you from Kanyambo to Nyarubuye parish? 
A.	When I left Kanyambo to go to Nyarubuye, we were beaten and we were afraid.  We did not leave with them; they forced us to follow them while beating us.  We left Kanyambo at about seven o'clock and arrived at Nyarubuye at about eight o'clock, as I stated previously. 
Q.	So it's your evidence, Witness, that it only takes one hour on foot from Kanyambo to Nyarubuye parish? 
A.	You see, the distance is not great, and I was not wearing a watch.  It is a small distance.  It is a walk that one can do in an hour. 
Q.	And according to you, you were resisting the attempts to forcefully take you with them, so that ought to have caused a delay, isn't it, Witness? 
A.	You are saying -- could you put your question -- repeat your question, please?
Q.	You just told their Lordships you were resisting the attempts of the attackers to go with them and that they beat you up and forced you.  Now I'm putting it to you, Witness, that you couldn't have done it in an hour considering that you were resisting.  It ought to have taken longer. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when you were being interviewed by the Defence investigator, did you explain to him how you resisted the efforts of the attackers to take you to Nyarubuye? 
A.	Yes, we shouted.  We said, "Where are you taking us?  Why are you taking us there?"  But we -- it didn't help at all.  They took us and took us there.
Q.	And did you sustain any injuries from these beatings, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I was wounded.  It was bruises.  I was kicked.  I didn't have a wound as such, but my friend did have a wound on his shoulder.  In fact, they were paying more attention to my friend than to me because his identity was not clear for the assailants -- to the assailants. 
Q.	And did you establish then why you were being beaten? 
A.	Because my identity card had recently been issued, they thought it was a false card that had been obtained fraudulently because it was new.  I think that was what was going on in their minds when they were beating us. 
Q.	So you suspect -- let me rephrase it.  Your brother-in-law refused to show them his identity card; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, he did not have his identity card to show who he was.  He preferred to introduce himself in another way.  In fact, he did not want to show his identity card because it would have shown that he was a Tutsi, which is why he preferred not to show his identity card. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I must admit, I did not understand very well.  That item should have been given in closed session.  We know who that person is, we heard in closed session, and there can't be a million possibilities.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, I don't think there is any problem.  I don't think there's anything there that can reveal his identity.  I don't think there's any risk involved here.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	So it would be correct, Witness, to suggest that the attackers were targeting people they suspected of being Tutsi? 
A.	Their purpose I don't know.  I don't know what that was because I didn't know what their plan was.  I wasn't working with them.  I cannot think in their stead.  I cannot answer for their acts. 
Q.	But you've just told their Lordships, Witness, that they suspected you were Tutsi because of a new identity card.  So clearly you did establish that they were --
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Objection, Madam President.  Madam President, these questions are of a speculative nature.  The witness never said that he was suspected of being a Tutsi.  He said that his card was a new one, a recent one, and perhaps they thought it was false. 

We cannot ask speculative questions of the witness as to what other people are thinking.  He's here to testify what he experienced.  If he has any direct questions, let counsel of the Prosecution ask the question. 
We've been here for an hour now around -- talking around speculations.  I think the line of conduct should run the same for everyone.  He is there.  Ask him what he experienced and not what other people thought. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we've already settled that problem. 

Counsel for the Prosecutor, pray proceed.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Now, Witness, when you arrived at Nyarubuye parish, how many vehicles did you find at the parish? 
A.	I found only one vehicle.  The other vehicle found me there afterwards. 
Q.	And it's correct, Witness, that the courtyard of the parish was littered with corpses?
A.	Yes, many corpses. 
Q.	Now, in addition to having been beaten the whole morning by this group of attackers, you must have been terrified by the sight you saw?
A.	Absolutely.  Beyond imagination.  It was terrifying. 
Q.	But terrifying as it was, Witness, you decided to stay there for six hours, up to 2 p.m.?
A.	I told you that there were people holding me up.  I'm speaking of these criminals who forced me to go to that place.  Do you think that for the whole time I was free?  In fact, I couldn't do what I wanted.  I had to comply with their instructions in order to preserve my life.  I was not free to move as I wished. 
Q.	Now, at what point in time, Witness, did you see the communal vehicle? 
A.	When you say the communal vehicle, in fact, I heard people say that it was the communal vehicle, but I don't know that for myself.  It was a pick-up in which -- a pick-up truck in which there were communal policemen. 

In fact, the vehicle didn't belong to the commune.  Perhaps it was a vehicle that belonged to someone else.  Quite simply, I heard the people say that it was a communal vehicle, but I don't know that.  I don't know that for a fact, with any certainty. 
Q.	But, Witness, now the question is, at what time did you see that vehicle you referred to as the communal vehicle? 
A.	Counsel, this is a long time ago.  I don't know at what time the vehicle came, but some time after my arrival.  The vehicle arrived; people got down from the vehicle; they talked to the soldiers a few minutes.  I left the place after the vehicle had gone, but I can't tell you exactly, but the vehicle arrived when I was about to leave that location. 
Q.	So you've told this Chamber in examination-in-chief that you left Nyarubuye parish at around 2 p.m. or shortly thereafter.  So would it be your evidence that you saw this communal vehicle closer to 2 p.m.? 
A.	No, the vehicle arrived before noon. 
Q.	And can you tell their Lordships where you were when you saw the second vehicle that you believe belonged to the commune? 
A.	I was in a courtyard opposite the place known as Nyarutunga.  Nyarutunga is spelled N-Y-A-R-U-T-U-N-G-A.  N-Y-A-R-U-T-U-N-G-A. 
Q.	Would that be the parish courtyard, Witness? 
A.	Yes, next to the church. 
Q.	Witness, did the tell the Defence investigator, Aloys, who interviewed you, and I quote, "After killing some of the survivors we left, and at the Nyabitare junction we saw a pick-up belonging to Rusumo commune"? 
A.	No, that is a mistake.  If you know the region, know the area, there is no road going to Nyabitare.  What I said, rather, was that it was towards the road going to Nyarutunga.  If you know the place, is there a road going to Nyabitare?  Even the road to Kiyondo cannot be used any more.  No vehicle can take that road nowadays. 
Q.	In fact, Witness, the Nyabitare junction is about 15 kilometres away from Nyarubuye parish, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, yes, quite. 
Q.	Now, considering, Witness, that the investigator places your seeing the vehicle after you had left the parish, isn't it actually true that you saw this vehicle after you left the parish? 
A.	No, I did not see it when I -- upon leaving the parish.  I told him that when I was trying to leave the parish, that is the moment when I saw a vehicle approaching from the road to Nyarutunga, but that is when I saw it, but I was still at the parish.  That is what I said. 
Q.	Witness, you were talking to this Defence investigator in the Kinyarwanda language, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And both of you are fluent in that language, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	So it's your suggestion, Witness, that the Defence investigator recorded things other than what you told him? 
A.	Is it the first mistake we've noted since I have begun my testimony? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
I have no further questions for this witness, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank counsel for the Prosecution. 

 Do you wish to re-examine the witness? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President.  Thank you, madam.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness UHT, were you of the same ethnic group as your spouse? 
A.	No, my wife was a Tutsi and I am Hutu.
Q.	Are you still with your wife? 
A.	Yes, I am still with my wife.  We have four children, and we live together. 
Q.	In April 1994, were you already married? 
A.	We were married in 1985, and to date I live with her.  I never sought for, nor took, another wife. 
Q.	On the 16th of April, 1994, from Rwanteru to Nyarubuye parish, were you capable of measuring time? 
A.	I did not have a wristwatch, and even I wasn't paying attention because I never thought I would be brought to speak of those events.  If I had imagined that I should one day speak of those events, I would have been more careful in measuring the time it took to cover the distance.
Q.	That day you left your home to go where you said you were going, you were intercepted; you were mistreated.  You were walking on the asphalt road or the tarred road or you took a shortcut to reach the parish? 
A.	The road is not tarred at that point.  We therefore used the road that is well known but is not tarred. 
Q.	Witness UHT, I shall repeat my question.  Did you take a shortcut or did you take the main road where the -- used by motor vehicles? 
A.	I repeat what I said.  We took the normal road; we did not take a shortcut. 
Q.	During your -- this time of torture, your calvary -- you were beaten, kicked -- did you ever leave the company of your brother-in-law? 
A.	I did not part company with him because I thought if I left him, he could not get out of the situation because he doesn't know -- didn't know the area. 
Q.	Are you telling the Trial Chamber that the military, the gendarme, the people wearing their uniforms, the people that came with the pick-up to the parish, saw you at the same time as they saw your brother-in-law? 
A.	I don't know.  I don't know whether they saw me.  I can't speak in their stead. 
Q.	But can we say here that you and your brother-in-law returned alive from Nyarubuye parish? 
A.	We were beaten, certainly, but we thank God because we weren't killed.  And what did we have any more than the ones who were killed?  It was merely good fortune, chance, and we thank God.
Q.	The group of assailants who forced you to go to Nyarubuye parish compelled you and your brother-in-law; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you maintain before the Trial Chamber that your brother-in-law is Tutsi and -- was Tutsi and you are Hutu; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I confirm that my brother-in-law is Tutsi and I am Hutu, that is the truth. 
Q.	Witness UHT --
A.	Yes, I hear you. 
Q.	-- can you tell the Trial Chamber why you can no longer return or you wish not to return to Rwanda? 
A.	Madam President, your Lordships, I do not want to return to Rwanda for one precise reason.  Before, under the government of the time, the events that took place under their authority I did not like, but those who came to power, took power, have disappointed us.  We thought that they would correct the injustices committed.  But what did I see?  I witnessed horrible acts.  Many people were killed at Nyarubuye.  But at Kamarashavu, near Mulindi, I saw more.  Many people were killed atrociously.  Where we were, people were killed without any investigation as to why they were killed. 

And following those events and in view of the fact that the present government did not do anything to correct the situation, I cannot go back to Rwanda because I am the age I am.  I know what's going on.  I cannot go back to my country.  It's my home country.  I grew up there; I studied there; I got married there.  But if things would change there, I would go home immediately, but that not being the case, I do not want to return to Rwanda. 
Q.	Witness UHT, you told me a while ago, as well as the Prosecutor, that a pick-up arrived in the parish.  Was there any inscription on that pick-up? 
A.	There was no inscription on that pick-up. Besides, people who thought the vehicle belonged to the commune later on realised that it was not true because the Rusumo commune had the inscription "Rusumo commune" on its vehicles, and it was of a nickname Ruhumbangegera. 
Q.	(No translation)?
A.	Yes, counsel, let me spell it:  R-U-H-U-M-B-A-N-G-E-G-E-R-A, Ruhumbangegera. 
Q.	Witness UHT, I thank you. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have no further questions to ask in this re-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

I would like you to clarify something, Witness.  If I properly understood what you said, you did say that there was no inscription on the vehicle that you saw arrive, that is, the vehicle which, according to what you've said, belonged to the commune.  You said that it was apparently not the case.  But I properly understood that you recognised the driver of the vehicle.  Could you please clarify this point?  "I could note I could identify the driver of the communal vehicle."  Did you indeed say that? 
THE WITNESS:
I could identify the driver of that vehicle, that is, the vehicle of the commune.  As a matter of fact, I knew him by sight, but I didn't know his name. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which means it was indeed the vehicle of the commune that you saw; is that right? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I could recognise the driver of that vehicle; I knew him by sight.  But if I were to meet him today, I would be able to recognise him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you identify him on the spot, that is, in the Nyarubuye parish? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I saw that driver and I recognised him, but I did not know his name. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When you say your brother-in-law, are you referring to the brother of your wife?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.  When I talk of my brother-in-law within this context, I'm referring to the brother of my wife.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And in April 1994 -- you said you got married in 1995 (sic).  He was already your brother-in-law in 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I said in 1985, 1985.  That is what I said. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you got married in 1985 and not 1995? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, 1985. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Witness, when you arrived at the parish, Nyarubuye parish, you said you saw large numbers of corpses in the courtyard.  Do you remember saying that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE REDDY:
And among the corpses, were there women and children also? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were. 
JUDGE REDDY:
And did you form any estimate of the number of corpses that you saw at the parish that day? 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, when you see a body or corpse, you are afraid.  Even if it's only one corpse, you fancy there were many of them.  I was terrified when I saw those bodies. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, all I want to know is whether these ran into many hundreds or thousands or just a few.  You'd have some idea.  It must have created some impression on your mind, this horrific sight. 
THE WITNESS:
I crave your indulgence.  I saw a lot of people.  I was afraid.  I could not make an impression, have an impression of the number of bodies. 
JUDGE REDDY:
All right.  And you also said that the soldiers and the gendarmes were finishing off the survivors.  I think you said that in answer to the Prosecutor.  Do you remember that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, they were finishing them off.  It wasn't only gendarmes.  There were bandits who were wearing leaves, and they assisted them in finishing them off.
JUDGE REDDY:
All right.  How were the soldiers and gendarmes finishing off the survivors?  Were they shooting them or doing something else?  What were they doing exactly to finish them off? 
THE WITNESS:
No, they had shot at them the previous day, but they used cutlasses or machetes and clubs to finish them off.
JUDGE REDDY:
That is all three groups, the gendarmes, the soldiers, and the men in the banana dress and the kitengi uniform, they were all using machetes and traditional weapons, were they?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I could see people killing them.  Indeed, yes, there were all sorts of groups.  Be it people who were wearing leaves or soldiers, the gendarmes, they were all busy finishing off those people.  I don't have -- I can't say it in any other manner.
JUDGE REDDY:
Did you get to have a look inside the chapel at Nyarubuye? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  At a certain time I was in front of the door and I could see corpses.  I could see corpses through the door, and there were people dragging the bodies outside the church to create room to pass.  I am talking of the entrance of the building there was a heap of bodies, but I did not get inside the church. 
JUDGE REDDY:
And were these bodies being dragged from inside the church? 
THE WITNESS:
They were dragging the bodies at the entrance in order to create a path through which they could pass.  The bodies were inside the church, at the entrance to the church. 
JUDGE REDDY:
And were they trying to get into the church or get bodies out of the church? 

THE WITNESS:
Among the people who were busy finishing off the bodies, there were some people who were inside the church. 
JUDGE REDDY:
And who were the people who were dragging these bodies about? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that some of them were soldiers, others were wearing kitengi uniforms.  It was all these people wearing uniform -- military uniforms.  They were from these groups. 
JUDGE REDDY:
Yes, thank you very much. 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you, Your Honour. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness --
THE WITNESS:
I'm listening to you.
JUDGE EGOROV:
-- who, in your opinion, was responsible for massacres occurred in your commune in April 1994, very briefly? 
THE WITNESS:
It is not up to me to answer this question.  I am not a judge.  It is a responsibility of the Judges to determine who was responsible for those massacres. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
I'm only interested in your opinion. 

So in April 1994, did you see Mr. Gacumbitsi, former bourgmestre, or anybody else from the communal administration, trying to stop massacres and to restore law and order in the place where you lived? 
THE WITNESS:
Our bourgmestre on several occasions tried to teach us to live in harmony, in peace and harmony.  He at no moment asked people to sow dissension.  He did not convene -- he convened several meetings, and at none of those meetings did I hear him call on people to kill one another. 

I have nothing to say with regard to the other communal authorities.  What I'm trying to do is to defend our bourgmestre.  If you know the perpetrators of the massacres you can bring them to justice, but as regards our official, he is innocent. 

JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  We have come to the end of your examination.  We wish you a safe journey back home, and we thank you for coming to testify before this Tribunal. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Your Honours.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall take a break now.  I believe we have another witness, who is perhaps Witness UMT, who is waiting in the witness room. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
It is Witness UMT, Madam President.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are taking our 15-minute break.
(Court recessed from 1110H to 1129H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Court is in session. 

Counsel Kouengoua, your next witness?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, witness -- Your Honours, Witness UMT. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness; therefore, we shall call you under -- we'll use a pseudonym, UMT.  You will be referred to as Witness UMT.  You are now going to make a solemn declaration, and the registry will assist you to make this solemn declaration. 
MR. JUMA:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up, raise your right hand, and repeat the following words after me.
(Declaration made by Witness UMT in Kinyarwanda)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'd like to thank the witness and the registry.

Witness, Defence will put questions to you, then the Prosecutor will lead your cross-examination.  The Defence will perhaps then proceed with a re-examination, and the Judges may also put questions to you if they so wish.

Counsel Mbattang, you may proceed. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Good day, Madam President, good day, Your Honours.  Good day, Mr. Prosecutor and his assistants.  Good morning to the registry.  Good morning to the interpreters.  Good morning to the court reporters.  Good morning, Witness UMT.

Madam President, I would like to -- I move that we go into closed session because during the first part of my examination-in-chief, I will be putting questions to the witness that might lead to his identity being revealed and, therefore, might affect his security. 
MS. MOBBERLEY:
No objection, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

We shall therefore go into closed session in order to protect the witness.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 32 to 33] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.  Counsel Mbattang, you may proceed with the examination-in-chief. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness UMT, in April 1994, where were you? 
MS. MBATTANG:
He already answered this question.  He needs to move forward, closer to the microphone. 
THE WITNESS:
In April 1994 I was at my residence. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	How did you hear of the news of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I heard of the news of the death of President Habyarimana on the radio at 6 a.m. on the Thursday. 
Q.	Do you remember what the date was, the date on which you heard the news? 
A.	It was the 7th of April. 
Q.	Witness UMT, when you heard the news, what was your reaction? 
A.	When I heard the news, as instructions that each person was supposed to remain at home and that people were not supposed to gather in groups of more than two persons, I decided to remain at home. 
Q.	Witness UMT, you stayed at home.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber what was your neighbours' reaction? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question? 
Q.	Witness UMT, how did your neighbours react to the news of the death of the president of the republic? 
A.	After the news was announced, everyone was in a state of shock.  People were asking themselves questions about the events that had taken place the day before. 
Q.	Witness UMT, after you experienced these events, were there any incidents or did you remain serene? 
A.	The people were in a state of shock, but a week afterwards the situation changed. 
Q.	What changed in the situation? 
A.	Killings took place.
Q.	What killings are you referring to? 
A.	Well, in my secteur, persons were killed.  The houses of other persons were looted, and these acts were perpetrated by criminals who were carrying spears and clubs. 
Q.	Witness UMT, these criminals who were armed with spears, were they from your region? 
A.	Yes, these criminals who were carrying spears were natives of that secteur.
Q.	Witness UMT, were these criminals in your secteur before President Habyarimana died? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question?  I did not understand what you asked me.
Q.	Witness UMT, these criminals that you said were looting in your region, were these same criminals, did they live in your secteur before the events of April 1994? 
A.	Well, I said that after the death of President Habyarimana, initially the situation was calm, and then there was some insecurity.  These criminals who were carrying machetes and clubs, we would see them, and those were the criminals who killed people.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
And Your Honours, the witness had already answered that question and his answer was that these people carrying spears were natives of his secteur. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness UMT, after these incidents, did the communal authorities come to investigate, to restore peace? 
A.	After these incidents, I did not see any authority in the said secteur. 
Q.	(No translation)?
A.	I don't know if the authorities had been informed.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
Your Honours, we didn't get the question in English. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, could you be so kind as to put the question to the witness again? 
MS. MBATTANG:
Yes.  The question that I had put to the witness -- I first asked the witness if he saw an authority and he said that he did not see any authority, and then the second question was to ask the witness if he could tell us if the authorities had been informed of the incident. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness UMT, after the president of the republic died, did you notice in your region if persons from other regions of the country arrived? 
A.	Can you please repeat the question? 
Q.	Witness UMT, after the death of the president of the republic, did you see any foreigners arrive in your region; that is, did people who lived in other regions arrive in your region after the death of the president of the republic? 
A.	Some persons crossed -- would go through our region on their way to Tanzania.  There was a crossing point at that place, and so I could see people going through our region on their way to Tanzania. 
Q.	Witness UMT, did you hear or did you notice that the persons going through your region to go to Tanzania faced any difficulties to cross the Akagera river? 
A.	These persons who were transiting through our region would cross the river without any problem.
Q.	Are you saying, Witness UMT -- sorry, before I put that question, let me ask another one.

How far was your house from the road that leads to the Akagera? 
A.	The distance between my residence and the Akagera could be covered in a 30-minute walk. 
Q.	Witness UMT, the question that I am putting to you is, how far is your house from the road that leads to the Akagera bridge?
A.	Four metres separate my house from the road. 
Q.	Did you notice that the people who were going towards the Akagera bridge turned back? 
A.	I lived in that cellule and I did not see anyone turn back, I did not see anyone be intercepted, and I did not see anyone throw anyone into the Akagera river.  There was a man whose name was Musare, and he was the one who owned a canoe that assisted people in crossing. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Musare, Mr. Interpreter, if you would be so kind as to spell that. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This word is spelled M-U-S-A-R-E, Musare. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness UMT, did you see Mr. Gacumbitsi in your cellule or in your secteur after the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I saw him before the death of President Habyarimana, and I saw him again in a refugee camp in Tanzania. 
Q.	Witness UMT, did you learn of or hear that the bourgmestre, Gacumbitsi, had given instructions to the effect that no one should cross the Akagera to seek refuge in Tanzania? 
A.	No, I never heard those orders mentioned, that Gacumbitsi gave any such orders, and knowing that I lived at that location. 
Q.	You said before that you did not see Gacumbitsi in your area.  Was the responsable -- did the responsable of your secteur organise a meeting after the president's death? 
A.	Please repeat the question.
Q.	Did the responsable of your secteur organise a meeting in your area after the death of the president of the republic? 
A.	The responsable in our secteur called no meeting after the death of the president.
Q.	Did you learn of or hear that the responsable of your secteur encouraged the Hutu to kill Tutsi? 
A.	The conseiller of our secteur never incited Hutu to kill Tutsi.  There were, moreover, Tutsi who had sought refuge at his residence.  How could he incite Hutu to kill the same people that he had hidden at his home?
Q.	Witness UMT, did you hear about the distribution of arms in your secteur? 
A.	There was no distribution of arms in my secteur.  I didn't see any. 
Q.	Witness UMT, you said a while before that people were killed in your secteur and that houses had been looted.  Were they houses of the members of any specific group or was it any house of anyone from any ethnic group that were looted? 
A.	Some houses belonged to Hutu and were looted as well as houses belonging to Tutsi. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I didn't catch the full question, but I think she said, "Who were the people killed in your area?" 
THE WITNESS:
There were Tutsi victims and Hutu victims in our area. 
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness UMT, do you know who killed the Hutu or the Tutsi? 
A.	I've explained that the perpetrators of the massacres were delinquents and those delinquents killed Hutu as well as Tutsi. 
Q.	Witness UMT, you said previously that you were a tradesman, a trader in 1994.  Were you also a victim of the thieving or killing? 
A.	I escaped being a victim also.  I was trading at that centre.  I left the trading centre and fled.  I approached the Akagera river because security at the trading centre was not assured. 
Q.	Witness UMT, did you stay in Rwanda after April 1994? 
A.	Please repeat the question.
Q.	In other words, Witness UMT, were you obliged to leave your cellule and seek refuge elsewhere? 
A.	(No translation).
Q.	Did you stay in that cellule up to today? 
A.	At a certain point I sought -- I went into exile in Tanzania.
Q.	Why were you obliged to go into exile, Witness UMT? 
A.	I noted that my safety was in peril, was threatened, and I decided to go into exile as everyone else had done. 
Q.	What is your ethnic group, Witness UMT? 
A.	I am a Hutu. 
Q.	And you said -- you told the Trial Chamber that you did not -- that your situation was unsafe, that you did not feel safe?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Witness UMT, you have said that you sought refuge.  If I didn't quite catch it, can you specify in what country you were a refugee? 
A.	I was a refugee in Tanzania. 
Q.	Since your exile -- you went into exile in Tanzania -- have you returned to Rwanda? 
A.	Since having sought refuge in Tanzania, I never returned to Rwanda. 
Q.	Why, Witness UMT? 
A.	The reason that prevented me from returning to Rwanda is my own safety.  My younger brothers returned to Rwanda and they were arrested and imprisoned.  My sister was killed; my older brother was killed.  So you see, you must understand that I could not return to Rwanda. 
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, I have finished with Witness UMT. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

The Prosecution.
MS. MOBBERLEY:
We have no questions of this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No questions?  Very well, thank you, counsel for the Prosecution.  So there is no cross-examination, no questions; the Judges also have no questions. 

Witness UMT, we thank you for having come to testify before this Trial Chamber, and we wish you a safe return journey. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, could you escort the witness from the Trial Chamber. 
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
According to the information we have, Counsel, there are two witnesses who remain.  One is not here but could be here this afternoon, and the other one is still in hospital, is still admitted.  Could we hear one of your witnesses this afternoon?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, on the 6th of October -- rather, the 2nd of October at the pre-Defence conference I had indicated what was -- were our preferences, what we thought as to the defence and the speed of proceedings.  And if you remember correctly, the Trial Chamber told me that my programme was too ambitious, but now I see it has been totally thwarted. 

We should have heard three witnesses today, and now I can't.  I very respectfully request the Trial Chamber to allow me to see if the remaining witness can be heard tomorrow morning, not this afternoon, because I hadn't -- I did not give the necessary instructions.  I was taken by surprise.  The three witnesses I thought would be here today, there is the one that is ill and two we've heard this morning.  And the one we've heard now wasn't supposed to come at this time, so I had to try and patch something together. 

If the Trial Chamber does not object, I should like the witness who is able to testify, should testify tomorrow morning.  And then if the one who is ill is better, we might hear both before tomorrow afternoon.  That is the commitment I'm prepared to make, madam. 

And I respectfully draw the attention of the Bench to the fact that the events that have occurred do not make our task any easier.  We certainly had not expected it.  Psychologically, we were not prepared to face all these difficulties.  Our timing was up to the 31st of October.  And this is not a creation, fabricated.  It's because these events occurred so rapidly that we were taken aback. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecution, please. 
(Pages 34 to 39 by Diane Hermann)



























	1215H
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, in my jurisdiction, once counsel has accepted instructions he's supposed to be ready to proceed if witnesses are available. 

Now, considering that it's approaching 12:30, he has two hours between now and 2:30 to reorganise his affairs so that we proceed with the next witness, and the last witness for the week could be heard tomorrow, if he is in a better condition.  

In short, I oppose the application for adjournment to tomorrow morning.

Secondly, counsel made some remarks this morning concerning his witnesses who he purports have disappeared from the refugee camp.  If counsel, albeit please, could substantiate what counsel meant and indicate whether it is going to disrupt the hearings for next week.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, concerning what you -- the Prosecution has put a question to you regarding, in particular, the witnesses that purportedly have disappeared from refugee camps or in the refugee camps.  Can you tell us whether these witnesses will come to testify and how you wish otherwise to vary your list of witnesses?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam.  In the present state of affairs, I cannot say whether they will come or not.  The correspondence I received from WVSS is that the search is under way.  They want to try and find them.  What I must tell the Trial Chamber, the air tickets, everything necessary for them to come was done.  The people that were supposed to escort them went all the way where they were supposed to be, and let me tell you in all certainty, Madam, I would not like there to be any hiatus in the production of our evidence, and that is why if I knew immediately if they would be coming or not, I would find other people to replace them so that there should not be any hiatus.  I personally don't want there to be any hiatus.  I have no interest in having the proceedings interrupted.  I don't see -- in any case, an interruption would not be in the interest of the client I am defending.  So the present state of affairs I have no precise information, but when we adjourn, I shall go to WVSS and try to obtain the information available, and any information I receive I will forthwith communicate to the Bench and to the Prosecution, and I will ask WVSS if they can bring other witnesses who are supposed to appear later, so that there is no hiatus in the submission of the Defence case.  That is what I can tell the August Bench.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, of course we are concerned in view of what is going on.  We will grant you the adjournment until tomorrow for the two witnesses remaining for this week, but we should, nonetheless, like to have witnesses for next week, and we therefore hope that you will take all necessary measures, along with WVSS, so that your witnesses be here before the end of the week, so that we can continue with the submission of the Defence case.  As you know, after the 31st of October it will be extremely difficult to sit on this matter because all the Judges are busy elsewhere on other matters, on other cases, and we could only plan a further session for March or something like that.  So, you see that it is primordial, indispensable, that you do everything possible, all that you can, so that there be no hiatus in the calling of witnesses.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam Chairman, Your Lordships, you will not be disappointed by the efforts we'll make.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We adjourn the hearing for tomorrow morning at 8:45 with your next witness.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Lordships, I think there is an item that WVSS brought us this morning.  I've been wanting to tender it because my English is not very good, but I think they are saying here the sick witness, the witness who is ill, will only be able to be heard on the 9th or something like that.  Can you take this?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, Counsel, my English isn't perfect either, but on this medical certificate it is stated that the witness will not be able to appear before the Trial Chamber before two days have elapsed, and as it is dated yesterday, the 6th of October, in principle, tomorrow he should be there.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I was especially concerned with the present hearing.  I think it was last time they took him, we were informed at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., so I think the two days are today the 7th, tomorrow the 8th, then certainly on the 9th.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 Well, Counsel, we will check.  Well, in any case, if the witness can testify tomorrow he shall do so.  Well, of course, that's what we would like.  It would be marvelous if he could testify tomorrow, that's really what we want.

Very well, we adjourn until tomorrow at 8:45 a.m.
	(Court adjourned at 1230H)
