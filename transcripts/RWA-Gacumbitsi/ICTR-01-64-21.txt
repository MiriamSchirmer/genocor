MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing will resume.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, you are proceeding with the cross-examination of the witness this morning, I believe.  Very well, Prosecution has the floor. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS YEW
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAREGESA:
Q.	Witness, are you fluent in the French language?
A.	I get by.
Q.	Do you recall being interviewed by Defence investigators in this case?
A.	You're asking me his name or what he looked like? 
Q.	The question was whether you recall being interviewed by Defence investigators in this case. 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And do you recall making a statement to the Defence investigator who interviewed you?
A.	Yes, I did make a statement to the investigator.
Q.	And you recall signing the statement after it had been read back to you?
A.	Yes, I remember having signed the statement.
Q.	Do you remember the date you were interviewed and made the statement to Defence investigators, Witness?
A.	It's a long time ago, more than a year ago.  I don't remember the exact date, but it was in the course of last year.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Registry, please hand this document to the witness. 
BY MR. KAREGESA:
Q.	Witness, do you confirm the signature appearing on page 2 as yours?
A.	Yes, that is my signature.
Q.	And is that document you have before you your statement made to Defence investigator 
Aimable Sungara on the 17th of April 2002?
A.	Yes, it is my statement.  However, I think I should take the time to go through the document. 
Q.	Witness, in the course of your testimony yesterday afternoon, you told Their Lordships that you went to visit your sister in xxxxxx on the 12th of April 1994, and arrived at her residence at approximately 10 a.m.; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.
Q.	And is it also correct, Witness, that you saw Accused Gacumbitsi in Gatore on that morning?
A.	As I stated, I didn't stop as I passed through, but as I was walking slowly, I saw him standing next to the vehicle in the company of the communal judicial police inspector, but I went on my way to my sister's.
Q.	So it's correct, Witness, that you didn't interact --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sorry. 
BY MR. KAREGESA:
Q.	It's correct, Witness, that you didn't interact with Accused Gacumbitsi on that morning, isn't it?
A.	We didn't speak to each other at all.
Q.	And it is also correct, Witness, I suggest, that you did not hear what he was saying.
A.	It's true that I didn't hear what he was saying.  It's -- but it's only that my sister had reported to me what he'd said.
Q.	Now, isn't it true, Witness, that you found your sister at her residence?
A.	Yes, because she is the one who gave me the information.  She couldn't have given me the information if I hadn't found her at her home.
Q.	And wouldn't it be true, Witness, that since she was at home where you found her, she couldn't have heard what the bourgmestre was saying?
A.	But you will remember that I stated that I found the bourgmestre who was standing where he was, and while I was at my sister's place, he moved.  He went away, and the people who had been with him in the meeting dispersed and the news of what had been discussed at the meeting was thus propagated.
Q.	It's correct, Witness, that your sister was at home and didn't attend that meeting, isn't it?
A.	My sister told me that she had been to the meeting, but that she'd come home. 
Q.	So is it your evidence now that the meeting was held before your arrival at Gatore?
A.	Yes, indeed, because the people that reported to me what had been discussed during the meeting are the same people who had taken part in that meeting. 
Q.	And can you tell Their Lordships what your sister told you regarding the bourgmestre?
A.	Yes, if you want me to, I can tell you.
Q.	Please go ahead. 
A.	She told me of three main points.  She told me that there had been killing in the locality and that the bourgmestre had come and asked the people to avoid anything that could be a threat to safety, and that the killings should stop because he did not want the killings to continue in his commune, and that the perpetrators of the killing had been arrested.
Q.	And did you establish when the perpetrators of the killing had been arrested, Witness?
A.	As I stated yesterday, I didn't spend any time there to find out what time the evil-doers had been arrested.  All I was doing was reporting what my sister told me.  I then bid her goodbye and left.
Q.	And, Witness, did you establish when the alleged killings had taken place?
A.	I could not determine the time, know the time, but if I refer to when the killings were reported to me, I can estimate that they must have taken place in the morning or in the night.
Q.	Can you recall the date, Witness, that the killings took place?
A.	I only know the date on which the deaths were reported to me by my sister, which was the 12th.
Q.	So is it your evidence that the deaths took place on the morning of the 12th of April 1994?
A.	As I have already stated, I was not a witness and I cannot give you the exact time.  I can only be certain of the date on which my sister spoke to me about it, but if I were to estimate the time that the killings took place, it would mean that either I was present when the killings took place or in the vicinity.
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that Nkurunziza, who had been killed, was one of your neighbours or lived in your neighbourhood?
A.	He wasn't my neighbour because between my residence and his, I could not know what was going on at his home. 
Q.	Witness, I'll quote from your statement made to Defence investigators on the 17th of April 2002 and I'll ask you a question.  And I quote: "On 12th April 1994 criminals from xxxxxx attacked Nkurunziza and his family, who were our neighbours, and he was killed with his two children and wife."  You told that to Defence investigators, Witness, didn't you?
A.	I don't know how he wrote down my statement, but the victim was not a neighbour, not an immediate neighbour.
Q.	And your statement says, Witness, that Nkurunziza and his family were killed on the 12th of April 1994, doesn't it?
A.	Yes, that is correct, but what I said here, I can't be very exact as to the time, but when I heard the news, it was the 12th of April.
Q.	Now, are you able to tell Their Lordships then, if you heard the news of death on the 12th of 
April 1994, when were the alleged killers arrested?
A.	I have already explained my sister told me that they'd been arrested that very day, the 12th of April. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, according to your statement, your evidence yesterday, you left your sister's residence after maybe an hour and a half, two hours, and went to Nyakarambi.  How long did you stay in Nyakarambi on the 12th of April 1994?
A.	I stayed there quite a while, until about 4 p.m.  That is when I saw what I would call a demonstration, a group of people insulting the bourgmestre, alleging that he was on the Inkotanyi's side, and I felt I should not stay there but go home because I was fearful; I was afraid. 
Q.	And is it your evidence now that this demonstration was in Nyakarambi centre?
A.	Yes, it was in Nyakarambi, and those who demonstrated came from the direction of the communal office.
Q.	Witness, isn't it actually true that Nkurunziza and his family were killed on the night of Sunday the 10th of April 1994?
A.	I'm explaining to you what was told to me by my sister.  If I mentioned the 10th, I would be speaking of events of which I didn't know. 
Q.	And it would also be true, Witness, that the arrest of the killers took place on Monday, 11th of 
April 1994; isn't it?
A.	I did not mention the 11th.  I mentioned the 12th because that is the day on which I heard the information from my sister.  When I passed, I saw the two communal vehicles; I saw Gacumbitsi at the same time and the judicial police inspector who was also at that place.
Q.	Witness, I'm putting it to you that you are mistaken, Gacumbitsi went to Gatore on the 11th of April 1994 and not the 12th. 
A.	I'm referring to the statement I made which is the truth, which I consider to be the truth.
Q.	I'm also putting it to you, Witness, that the killers who had been arrested were released at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, 12th of April 1994.
A.	I don't agree with you, because when I saw the troublemakers making their demonstration, I saw them in the afternoon.  It wasn't in the morning.  I indeed saw them in the afternoon.
Q.	Witness, did you tell investigators about arrests that took place in Nyamugari?
A.	I wasn't in Nyamugari when those people were arrested, but at Nyakarambi trading centre, people were discussing the arrests, that the people had been arrested at Nyamugari.
Q.	So you are not in a position, Witness, to tell us anything about those arrests, other than the discussions you overheard in Nyakarambi; is that correct?
A.	It's just the discussions I overheard in Nyakarambi because I did not go to the place where the people had been arrested. 
Q.	And it would also be true, Witness, that you were never at the commune when they were released?
A.	I have already explained that I was not in a position to follow their release on the 12th, but they were released because they took -- they -- there was what I call a demonstration, but I don't know the people that obtained their release. 
Q.	In fact, Witness, you don't know anything because you never saw or personally witnessed anything?
A.	I can't say I know nothing because things were told to me.  My sister told me that people had been arrested, and I had confirmation of that when I saw the people doing what I call a demonstration, and I could recognise Augustin Nkunzumwami, also known as Marechal, among the demonstrators.
Q.	Witness, you told this Chamber yesterday that you knew Oswald.
A.	Yes, indeed, I did state that.
Q.	In fact, you knew him and the rest of his family; that is, his parents, brothers and sisters.
A.	I knew Oswald and I knew his xxxxxxx brother, who was a xxxxxxx.
Q.	And is it true, Witness, as you told this Chamber yesterday, that you lived near each other; that is, you and Oswald?
A.	I did not state that we were neighbours, but there wasn't -- the distance between my place and his was not considerable.
Q.	In fact, I'll quote your exact words from your testimony in-chief yesterday, and I quote, "We lived near each other."  Isn't that true?
A.	I don't know if I should correct what I said.  What I meant was that they lived near us.  I don't know whether the interpretation was correct, but we weren't really neighbours.  But they didn't live very far from us.  I don't know whether in -- this nuance in Kinyarwanda is fully grasped, because to say "neighbours" means that you are immediate neighbours.
Q.	In any event, Witness, you knew where Oswald's homestead was, didn't you?
A.	My work did not allow me to travel very much and to go to the countryside, so I didn't pay much attention to his residence.  We'd meet at the trading centre where we both had our shops and businesses.
Q.	Witness, is it your evidence now that you didn't know where Oswald's home was?
A.	As I have already stated, he didn't live hard by the road.  It was quite a way from the tarred road, and I didn't have the opportunity of going there.  More often than not, I took the asphalt road to the trading centre where I had my business. 
Q.	(Previous interpretation continued) ... The question was:  Did you know where Oswald's home was, yes or no?
A.	I don't know whether you want me to say whether I knew his house or the locality or the direction in which his house was.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you tell us, yes or no, whether you knew where xxxxxx lived? 
THE WITNESS:
He lived at a place called Nyabijega.  Nyabijega is spelt N-Y-A-B-I-G-E-G-A -- J-E-G-A.
BY MR. KAREGESA:
Q.	And, Witness, because you lived near each other, you would have known that his parents were killed in broad daylight on the 12th of April 1994, wouldn't you?
A.	I didn't learn of it on that date because I wasn't very near.
Q.	Can you tell Their Lordships when you learnt of it?
A.	I heard -- I learnt of it later.  I heard about it later.  I can't remember on what date exactly, but I 
couldn't -- I wasn't free to move and leave my house.
Q.	On the contrary, Witness, you've told this Chamber how, on the 12th, you went to Gatore, came back to Nyakarambi.  You've told Their Lordships how you went to look for a beer on the 13th of April 1994 in Kiyanzi.  Isn't it true that you were actually very mobile in the course of that week?
A.	I moved around but it wasn't really moving around for any purpose at all.  I just wanted to make sure my business hadn't been attacked.  I didn't move around without any purpose, as you suggest. 
Q.	So is it now your evidence, Witness, that you did move around and you didn't stay at home?
A.	As I have already stated, I went to my place of business to check that everything was safe, that my business hadn't been attacked.  I had no other reason to move around, especially as I was not undertaking my usual activities.
Q.	And at your business premises, Witness, would you check with your watchman to ensure that everything was secure?
A.	Yes.  I would arrive and ask my watchman questions, and open up and check the inside that everything was all right, and then I would close up again. 
Q.	And it's true, Witness, that your watchman participated with others in the murder of Bernard on the 14th of April 1994, isn't it?
A.	No.  I would be levelling accusations against a person that I didn't see and, moreover, I was not present.
Q.	But you do know, Witness, that Bernard, a Tutsi businessman in Nyakarambi, was murdered on the 14th of April 1994, don't you?
A.	Yes, that is true, I heard that the man called Bernard had been killed, but he was killed after I'd already left.  I did not return to the place where I had my business since that date.
Q.	In fact, after his murder on the 14th of April 1994, Claude Nzeyimana drove the deceased's vehicle to your shop, didn't he?
A.	I was not present, as I have already stated.  When I arrived in the morning to see what had happened, I noted that two ladies I mentioned had been killed.  I was afraid and I went home, so I doesn't know what happened subsequent to that, especially as my mother had told me that people had said that they were going to attack me at my house in order to obtain money, which is why I decided to stay home.
Q.	Witness, when did you first learn of Bernard's death?
A.	I heard the news when I was at home.  I had already left the trading centre and I could not go back there; I mean, where the murder had occurred.  So it is obvious that I heard the news of his death after the 14th.
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that you loaded the merchandise in Bernard's truck onto a pickup truck and took it to your native secteur?
A.	You are relating that scene as if were you on the spot.  But if I relate what I went through, I was hiding at home and I want to tell you that I didn't go to Nyakarambi after that date, so I cannot tell you what happened subsequently.
Q.	After which date, Witness, are you referring to?
A.	I am referring to the 14th of April, in the morning.  When I saw what had happened and when I recalled the protests I had seen, I was afraid and I didn't go back to Nyakarambi after that date. 
Q.	Witness, isn't it actually true that you maintained a roadblock about 30 metres from your house, at which numerous Tutsi civilians were murdered in flight from Rukira commune?
A.	No, there was no roadblock.  I had my own problems.  The fact that I was sheltering Tutsis and Hutus in my home, people who had sought refuge in my home, I had problems with my sister-in-law, who was a Tutsi, so you'd understand that I had problems myself. 
Q.	So, Witness, would it be evidence that between the 14th of April 1994 and when you fled on the 28th of April 1994, you stayed at home and didn't move about?
A.	I stayed at home, as I've already explained to you.  I had a sister-in-law who was a Tutsi and who was staying with me in my house, and there was another group of refugees who had sought refuge in my home.  I told you that I was being threatened and people could come and loot my house so I stayed in my home until the time when I fled.
Q.	Witness, do you know somebody by the name of Kigati?
A.	Did you say Kigati?  I do not know anybody by the name Kigati.
Q.	Witness, I want to read from your statement and ask you a question, and in the English translation, this would be the first sentence on page 3, and in French it would be the third paragraph on page 2, and I quote, "I must say that the Tutsis that died were killed by these groups of criminals and other attackers who came from elsewhere."  

Witness, from the evidence you've given both in-chief and cross-examination so far, you deny witnessing any killing of Tutsis; is that correct?
A.	I was not there when they were killed, but I have already spoken of the death of Marie and Beatrice.  These were Tutsis.  These were Tutsis.
Q.	And it's correct, Witness, to suggest that you are not in a position to say who the killers were?
A.	I have already explained to you that when they were killed, I had spent the night in my home.  I hadn't spent the night where they were killed, so I am therefore not in a position to tell you who killed them.
MR. KAREGYESA:
I have no other questions for this witness, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Witness, I have a short question for you.  You mentioned Oswald's brother, who was a teacher and who you knew.  What was his name and what did he tell you exactly?
THE WITNESS:
It wasn't Oswald who was a teacher.  He was a trader. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Oswald was a trader, but I was referring to his brother, who was a teacher. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I indeed made mention of his brother, who was a teacher.  On the 13th of April, when I got to Nyakarambi where I was doing my business, that was in the morning, when I arrived there was no beer because there was a shortage of beer.  So I was obliged to go to an area known as Kiyanzi to look for beer.  When I got there, I met Oswald's brother, known as Hatungimana.  We greeted each other and I asked him why he was there, and he told me that he was fleeing because his brother, Oswald, had told him that the bourgmestre had advised him to flee because the situation was becoming serious and criminals who had been jailed had been released and consequently he was not in a position to provide for our security.  So he therefore advised me to flee, and the others also fled.  And I wished him good luck. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank you, Witness. 

Counsel for the Defence, do you have any further questions to put to the witness in re-examination? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
The Defence counsel do not have any questions to put to the witness in re-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Witness, you have come to the end of your examination.  We thank you for coming to testify before this Chamber, and we wish you are a safe return home. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President. 
(Witness excused)
 MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, do you have any other witness?  You mentioned Witness UPT this morning. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, Your Honour, good morning.  Madam President, before answering the question put to us by the august Chamber, I have a motion to file, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are listening to you, Counsel. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, as I did announce yesterday -- in fact, the day before yesterday, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 13(D) Madam President -- I believe it's paragraph (E) -- the Defence counsel of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, in view of the circumstances that are prevailing, would move the Chamber to allow the Defence counsel to shorten the list of witnesses that was filed before the Chamber, 
Madam President.  This is the purpose of our motion.

Secondly, Madam President, we want to draw the Chamber's attention to the fact that this morning the next witness we are calling is XW -- is YW, I beg your pardon -- YCW.  So the next witness will be YCW.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are seeking leave to shorten the list, and you don't mention the witnesses you want to withdraw from your list? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I would like primarily to withdraw Witness BK1, RDM, BK -- so it's BK1, RDM and RDS for the moment, Madam President.  And we did announce to the Chamber that if it is necessary for the Defence and for proper conduct of proceedings, we will still keep the current list but we want to reduce the number of witnesses on that list to expedite proceedings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, for this week the only witness left is YCW.  You don't have any other witnesses? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the Chamber and all parties are facing Rule 15 bis.  We would like to file another motion before the Chamber but we cannot do so without having accurate information from the witness protection section.  And I believe if we had those details, we will do quite a few things and avoid using or relying on 15 bis and we would be able to do a lot of things.  

For now, we don't have the information we need.  We don't know whether witnesses will be arriving this evening, and that is precisely why I'm not in a position to specify any further, Madam President. 

Madam President, with your permission -- I did not consult my notes -- I am not sure the list I gave was exact.  I mentioned BK1, RDM, RDS.  Madam President, I was saying that my motion had to do with Witness BK1, RDM and RDS.  

As to the question regarding the witnesses I have for the rest of the week, I say this morning I intend to call Witness YCW, and if we still have enough time I will call Witness UPT, who was announced yesterday.  Yesterday it was not certain, but this morning, it is a certainty.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Counsel for the Prosecution, do you have any remarks on the motion filed by Counsel Kouengoua?
MR. KAREGYESA:
We have no objection, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

Counsel Kouengoua, the Chamber grants both motions presented by you regarding the withdrawal of Witnesses BK1, RDM and RDS, and we also grant your motion requesting the appearance of YCW and UPT this week.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  For this week, as I said earlier on, I would wish that this morning we should hear Witness YCW, and on Friday, Madam President, if other witnesses, as I'm made to understand, arrive this evening, I would call two or three other witnesses on Friday and we will see whether the Chamber cannot authorise us to sit on Saturday, in keeping with 15 bis.  This is still not certain, Madam President, but I'll find out.  If it is possible, it would be desirable.  But for today, I would call Witness YCW.  That is what I announce, Madam President, and I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please bring in Witness YCW? 

Counsel Kouengoua, did you look into the issue regarding the Exhibit D04? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
We gave that issue all our attention, Madam President, but as you know, yesterday, we were exhausted at the end of the day, but in the course of this week, we shall look into that question.  We crave your indulgence.  We haven't forgotten it, but we were hard pressed yesterday.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we will be expecting your answer in the course of the day. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I  would also like to mention a minor problem regarding a technician who has to come and do some work in the hall -- in the court.  If you bear with us, that technician, who is arriving from Paris and has to go back, will come into the courtroom and do some work on the equipment, if you don't mind, do some adjustments on the equipment - fine-tuning of the equipment. 

I wanted to know whether both parties have no objections because these people will be working with the stenographers to do some fine-tuning.  No objections?  Very well then.  Thank you. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
We have no objections, Your Honours, but we'd just like to know the timing.  When will this interruption be?  Is it today and, if so, at what time?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As a matter of fact, it will not be interruption.  The technician will be there while we are working and will spend 30 minutes or an hour, maximum.  I only wanted to know whether you do not object to his presence. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, with regard to what counsel for the Prosecution has said, our objection is not in regard to the principle of the work done by the technician.  The question we want to put to you is -- has to do with whether the witness will be testifying while the technician will be working.  I don't think we have anything against the work of the technician, but since we are dealing with protected witnesses and the technician has not taken a solemn -- made a solemn declaration, we would wish that somebody else should work -- or should speak while the technician is doing his work and that it shouldn't be the protected witness who is testifying at that time.  I'm suggesting, therefore, some kind of simulation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  You are appearing this morning to testify under the pseudonym YCW.  You will start by making a solemn declaration.  You will be examined by Defence counsel, subsequently by the counsel for the Prosecution, and it is possible that the Judges will also put questions to you and the Defence counsel may also re-examine you.  The registrar will administer the oath to you. 
MR. JUMA:
Mr. Witness, could you please stand up?  Raise your right hand and repeat the following words after me.
(Declaration made by Witness YCW in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the witness and the registry.  

Counsel Kouengoua, you may proceed.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  We would like to make an application to the Trial Chamber that the testimony of the witness take place in two stages: The first stage would be in closed session and the second stage would be in open session, Madam President.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall now sit in closed session for the first part of the testimony of the witness.  We regret to inform the public of this. (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 12 to 14] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

	1000H
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	When did you hear of the news of the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana? 
A.	I heard the news of the death of President Habyarimana on the morning of the 7th of April.  I heard the news on Radio Rwanda, and it was announced that the president had rested. 
Q.	And how did you react? 
A.	Deep down inside, I was frightened because of the news, because of the death of our president; the president of our republic, it greatly saddened me.  

In the meantime, a communiqué was read out on the radio prohibiting people from gathering, and the members of the population were to stay in their homes. 
Q.	And how did the people in your locality react to this news? 
A.	Generally speaking, the reaction was not very positive because this was the death of the president, people were not happy. 
Q.	And did you leave your house on the 7th of April?
A.	I did not leave my house, I remained there.  I stayed at my house. 
Q.	And what about on the 8th of April? 
A.	Similarly, I did not leave my residence on the 8th.
Q.	What about on the 9th? 
A.	Just as on the previous days, I did not leave my house on the 9th.
Q.	When did you leave your house then? 
A.	It was not until the 10th of April that one could leave one's house and travel for four to five kilometre distance.  At the time there was no food, no goods available, so we needed to go to the banana plantations to harvest bananas and go to the various markets and get food. 
Q.	And what did you do on the 11th?
A.	On the 11th, I started to see people fleeing, and refugees arrived in our area from other communes and préfectures; I am referring to the neighbouring areas, neighbouring préfecture.  We started to move around and you could roam a distance of five to six kilometres. 
Q.	When you say that people came from the neighbouring préfecture, could you give us the name of the neighbouring préfecture?
A.	Yes, there was Byumba préfecture.
Q.	And on the 12th, what did you do? 
A.	Very early in the morning, on the morning of the 12th, I was in my residence and I saw a conseiller go by my house.  He was on his motorcycle.  We thought that the conseiller was starting to move about that there was a lull in the situation.  

Subsequently, I saw a child go and get water and she said that criminals had attacked Kurunziza's house and the latter had killed the owner of the residence.  We were surprised and feeling panicky, and we wondered how these criminals could have killed Kurunziza, this was in the morning around 
7 a.m.  I bathed and then I went to seek for information, to find out if he had really been killed.  And so, I went to the secteur office around 8 a.m.  When I reached the secteur office, the bourgmestre of the commune was there with policemen.  I saw the inspector of the police judiciale, IPJ of our commune.  They started to conduct an investigation into the events that had taken place in my secteur.  

During the course of their investigation, they were able to identify the persons who had killed Kurunziza, and they were able to arrest all the perpetrators of these killings.  The following persons were arrested:  Nkunzumwami, Augustin, who was also known under an alias Maréchal.  He was assisted by a person named Bubingo, Ismael.  There was a person named Habukubaho, as well as a person named Batege Nteziryayo, a person called Uwizeye, who had not continued in his career in the army.  So this was on the 12th.  These persons were rested on the 12th.  They were interviewed by the bourgmestre and the inspector of the police judiciale.  So they were asked how they had planned this murder, because this was something totally new in our secteur.  

A few moments later, a young woman came and said that her parents' residence had been attacked the day before, but that the people living in the house were able to flee.  The young woman -- the young girl said that she did not know where her parents were at the moment she was speaking to us.  The house belonged to Everiste Kamanzi.  He was a teacher who lived in the same secteur as I did.  

They asked the young girl questions about the identity of the attackers, and she said that she was able to identify one Grégoire Havugimana amongst the attackers.  They did everything they could to arrest Grégoire and he confessed.  He was asked whether he had attacked Kamanzi's alone or in the company of others.  Grégoire acknowledged that he was part of a group that was led by Augustin Nkunzumwami.  He was also able to mention the names of other persons who had not been mentioned previously, including one Ntambara and a person named Munyaguruba.  The last two persons were also arrested.  They actually -- they were waiting around to find out if their names were going to be mentioned.  So they were there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you have mentioned a great deal of names.  We need to spell the names out for the record because we do not know them. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, absolutely, Madam President.  I was going to ask the interpreter in the Kinyarwanda booth if he would be so kind to help us, because it seems that not all of the names that have just been mentioned appear in the list of proper nouns that we have communicated to the parties. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Nkunzumwami is spelt N-K-U-N-Z-U-M-W-A-M-I, Nkunzumwami.  Bugingo is spelt B-U-G-I-N-G-O.  Habukubaho is spelt H-A-B-U-K-U-B-A-H-O, Habukubaho.  Batege is spelt B-A-T-E-G-E, Batege.  Nteziryayo N-T-E-Z-I-R-Y-A-Y-O, Nteziryayo.  Uwizeye is spelt U-W-I-Z-E-Y-I, Uwiyeze.  Kamanzi is spelt K-A-M-A-N-Z-I, Kamanzi.  Ahishakiye is spelt A-H-I-S-H-E-K-I-Y-E.  Havugimana is spelled 
H-A-V-U-G-I-M-A-N-A, Havugimana, and Ntambara is spelt N-T-A-M-B-A-R-A.  Munyarubuga is spelt M-U-N-Y-A-R-U-B-U-G-A, Munyarubuga. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank the interpreter.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness YCW, you were just saying that on the 12th persons were killed and investigations were being conducted.  Did you know a person named Nkurunziza?
A.	Yes, I knew Nkurunziza.  He is the person who was the victim of those attackers.  They killed him, his wife and his children. 
Q.	When the child who went to fetch some water told you that Nkurunziza had been killed, did you go to his house? 
A.	As soon as I reached the secteur office, I realised that authorities were already there.  In the meantime, I went to ask Karenzi a question.  Karenzi was the victim's older brother, and he spoke to me of the circumstances in which the attack had taken place, because we couldn't really understand how he had been killed.  And as for me, I did not go to the residence of the victim, but subsequently, I went to the place where the victim was killed. 
Q.	Were Nkurunziza and Kamanzi neighbours? 
A.	We lived in the same secteur, but in different cellules.  Kamanzi lived in Ruvenge cellule and the other person lived in the Nyamirango cellule. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I know it is a question of interpretation, but I asked the witness whether the two victims were neighbours.  I don't know what the witness said, but the witness stated his identity and I would like this passage to be struck from the record.  The question was whether the two victims were neighbours, but actually he introduced --
THE WITNESS:
The two persons were not neighbours.  Nevertheless, they lived in the same secteur.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Did you go to the secteur office by foot or by motorcar? 
A.	I went by motorcar.
Q.	Were the two victims Nkurunziza and Kamanzi -- did they both belong to the same ethnic group? 
A.	Kamanzi and Nkurunziza were of the same ethnic group, but Nkurunziza's wife was of a different ethnic group.  Kamanzi was Tutsi, Nkurunziza also, but Nkurunziza's wife was Hutu.
Q.	And to your knowledge, were you able to know who were the attackers, the assailants who attacked those two families?
A.	Yes, we were able to determine who the assailants were because the authorities undertook an investigation, and the perpetrators themselves admitted having committed that crime. 
Q.	And when the aggressors -- assailants recognised having committed that crime, were you present?
A.	Yes, I was present.
Q.	You have just stated that you went to Nkurunziza's house; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I went to Nkurunziza's house later, subsequently after the aggressors had been arrested.  The bourgmestre, the judicial police had left -- after they left going back to the communal office in their vehicle, that is when I went down to Nkurunziza's house. 
Q.	To your knowledge, did the conseiller of the secteur go to the scene of the crime? 
A.	When I arrived there I found the conseiller at the secteural office.  I also found the bourgmestre, the policemen and the judicial police inspector, but when I went to Nkurunziza's house, I did not see the conseiller.  When I went there, I never saw him.
Q.	When you saw his motorbike pass in the morning, you said you saw him passing on his motorbike in the morning, was he going towards Nkurunziza's house, or was he going in the opposite direction? 
A.	From my residence, he was taking the -- he was heading towards the sectoral office because Nkurunziza lived very close to the sectoral office.  So I don't know exactly where he was going because I didn't see the place where he went.  I only saw the direction in which he left, because he took the road passing by the sectoral office towards the communal office.  So, it was very close to Nkurunziza's residence. 
Q.	Do you remember the time at which the bourgmestre and the judicial police that you mentioned arrived in the secteur for the investigation? 
A.	They arrived on the spot between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.
Q.	Do you remember at what time they departed?
A.	They left before noon, I would say between 10 a.m. and noon.
Q.	And according to you, who left the place first, the bourgmestre or yourself? 
A.	It was the bourgmestre who left first.  After having held a meeting when he told us that if in case any other aggressors made any attacks -- launched any attacks, we, the population had the right to capture them and hand them over to the authorities.  And after that brief meeting the bourgmestre departed. 
Q.	Apart from Nkurunziza's family and Kamanzi's family, to your knowledge, were other people attacked in Rusumo commune? 
A.	In the course of the meeting organised by the bourgmestre, he informed us that another group of aggressors had attacked Nyamugari, and he informed us that he had detained those criminals the evening before, and he mentioned Kamanyero Dismas, Merarute, someone called Noheli, as well as one Telesphore.  He informed us that he had put those people in jail because of the serious crimes they had committed, namely; the attack they had made at Karemera Igiki (phonetic) whom they tried to kill by asphyxiation with smoke to the extent that he died in his house. 
Q.	Witness YCW, after the death of the bourgmestre, you went to Nkurunziza's house.  Did you see the bodies of the victims? 
A.	Yes, I saw the bodies of the victims, in particular, of Nkurunziza, his wife and his children. 
Q.	Was Kamanzi also killed? 
A.	No, they did not kill Kamanzi.  Nobody committed murder at Kamanzi's, but his residence was attacked and his motorbike was looted as well as other property, such as clothes.  And after the aggressors were arrested, they were asked what they had looted, because Kamanzi's child had informed the authorities that their domicile, their residence had been attacked, and the child was able to recognise their clothes as well as his father's motorbike. 
Q.	And to your knowledge, was that property recovered? 
A.	Yes.  Inasmuch as the child was still very young, his maternal aunt Mukaruganga, Bridget, was there.  She was told that inasmuch as she was a relative, she could recover the property so that those who had fled could recover it as soon as they returned home.  However, the lady could not recover the motorbike because there was no one to drive it, but the clothes  were recovered. 
Q.	And what did they do with the motorbike? 
A.	I told you what they could recover forthwith, but subsequently, the conseiller also handed back to its owner the motorcycle and he left with it. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness YCW.  According to you, the wrongdoers who were arrested in Gatore, did they remain in jail? 
A.	Could you repeat the question, please, Counsel?  Those wrongdoers, evildoers were not jailed at Gatore.  The bourgmestre took them away.  So please, repeat the question so that I can understand you better. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness YCW.  I wanted to ask you what happened to the wrongdoers the bourgmestre had arrested? 
A.	After having been arrested by the bourgmestre, he took them off in his vehicle and said publicly -- he stated publicly at the meeting that he was taking them away to jail them.  And so, the bourgmestre and the judicial police inspector took them away and they were going to join other wrongdoers in jail who had committed crimes at Nyamagare, who were already detained in the communal jail. 
Q.	And we are still on the 12th.  Did you leave your secteur on that day? 
A.	Yes, on the 12th, I left my secteur.  After leaving Nkurunziza's residence, I took a vehicle and I went to Nyakarambi where I ran my business.  I arrived there between 1:30 and 2 p.m. to see how my business was doing.
Q.	And how long did you stay in Nyakarambi on that day? 
A.	Approximately four hours, because I left the place at about 4:35 p.m. to go home.
Q.	During the approximate four hours you spent there, did anything particular happen on that afternoon in Nyakarambi? 
A.	When I arrived in Nyakarambi, there were people demonstrating and who were abusing the bourgmestre and the sous-préfet.  They were saying that the bourgmestre and the sous-préfet were detaining innocent people, imprisoning -- jailing innocent people, and if those people were not released, the bourgmestre would pay for his acts.  And their tracts had been distributed by Kasaru who resided in Kibungu and in those tracts, the populace was informed that the bourgmestre supported the Tutsis and it even said that the bourgmestre and the sous-préfet were Inkotanyi accomplices, and that it was the Inkotanyi who had killed the president of the republic, and they were going to kill those two accomplices, and then we became afraid.  And I could see young people, workers who disguised themselves as louts, hooligans and had no respect for us.  And when we told them, "What is this behaviour?"  They insulted us saying, "You are imbeciles", and we began to be afraid. 
Q.	And to your recollection, the Gatore wrongdoers, did they stay long in jail?  Did they stay in jail long?
A.	At about four or 5 p.m., I saw a group of about 40 to 50 people demonstrating, and among the group I saw the Gatore wrongdoers who had already been released, and I took flight because those wrongdoers had already been freed and they said: "The one who jailed us would be answerable to us.  We will kill him without doubt".  So we were afraid.  They were saying many nasty things, saying, "Just wait for our leaders to come and we will teach the bourgmestre a lesson.  And they threatened him with insults, saying, "You imbeciles, you dogs, you Inyenzi".
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Please, Kinyarwanda booth.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Inyenzi is spelt, I-N-Y-E-N-Z-I. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I think the witness also said Mukarugomwa.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
M-U-K-A-R-U-G-O-M-W-A. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, interpreter.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	You have just said that among the group that was demonstrating, you observed the people who had been arrested in Gatore in the morning, after the events that had occurred there; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I saw them.  I identified them among the group.
Q.	And to your knowledge, where did they head after that?  Where did they go after that? 
A.	Inasmuch as my residence was behind my shop, I left them demonstrating in the road, and I took my vehicle and I went home because I was afraid.  I was afraid because when we were still at the secteur office, I had shown that I did not fully agree with the criminal acts that were being perpetrated, and that was the reason that drove me to leave and go to my residence and go home.
Q.	And between Nyakarambi and your home in Gatore, how long does it take? 
A.	It is about 25 or 30 metres, it's a very short distance. 
Q.	Witness YCW, you have told us that in the morning a child who was going to get some water told you that there had been attacks on Nkurunziza's house.  So you washed and went to the secteur office.  And now, you just told us that when you saw the people at Nyakarambi, you went to your house behind the shop.  Now what is the Trial Chamber to conclude?  You lived at Nyakarambi or at Gatore? 
A.	Counsel, could you please repeat your question?
Q.	You lived in Gatore -- did you live in Gatore secteur or in Nyakarambi? 
A.	I told you at the outset that I lived in Gatore.  I had a shop there and I had another shop at Nyakarambi. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Interpreters, can you tell me if there is a problem.  In French I heard: "I went to my residence which wasn't far away, about 25 metres", that is what I heard.  That is what we heard in French.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you tell us the distance between your shop in Nyakarambi and your place of residence in Gatore?
THE WITNESS:
Between Nyakarambi and my residence, there are 13 kilometres. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	And how long did it take you to go from your abode to Nyakarambi -- from your place of residence to Nyakarambi? 
A.	Well, it depends on how fast you drive.  You know a vehicle can run at 180 kilometres an hour, it depends on your speed.  But if you drive at a normal speed, you can cover that distance in 15 to 20 minutes. 
Q.	We are still on the 12th.  We were still on the 12th of April.  Now, Witness, on the 13th of April, were there any further events?  What happened in your locality? 
A.	No particular events occurred in my locality.  On the 13th, I went to my place of work at Nyakarambi very early in the morning to see how the situation was, what the situation was.  I arrived there at about 8:30 a.m.  On my arrival at Nyakarambi, I met the local businessmen, we were in front of my shop, and we began talking and a few moments later we saw the bourgmestre coming from his residence, and he stopped and greeted us.  And when he arrived there, the bandits, the hooligans began to shout: "Here is that cretin coming".  In any case, the hooligans couldn't attack him because there were policemen around carrying rifles, but they came up to him and we had the impression that they were going to attack him, and we asked the bourgmestre: "Sir, why did you release those criminals?"  And he answered me --  he answered us and said: "It wasn't I who released them.  I don't even know what to do."  So we asked him, "What are we going to do?"  And he answered, "I think that in view of the prevailing situation, anybody, everybody should be ready to flee because you see these hooligans are determined.  I personally can't do anything because I am not the one who released them, but it is the sous-préfet who released them, and you know, I am a subordinate to the sous-préfet and we asked him, "What are we going to do because the situation is getting worse and worse".  

There was there a businessman, a trader whose name was Paulo Murwashyaka.  There was Mutabazi's son.  There was Jovine and two other people.  Having seen that the bourgmestre was undecided, unclear, he said, "I will go and see the situation".  He went to the house used as a shop and we, for our part, we each went our own way.  We dispersed and each one went our own way.  

As for me, I went into the house where I had my shop and I began talking with my elder brother.  We were wondering what we were going to do and he told me, "You know, we better begin considering the possibility of fleeing because the situation is getting worse and worse".  And we began to put out things together, packed our bags and we took the vehicle that was there.  We loaded our luggage and a short while later, we saw Murwashyaka who was our neighbour, and he told us, "You know, personally, I see that the situation is difficult, is very serious since the bourgmestre himself is -- has lost hope and asked us to flee to the extent possible".  He took his vehicle and he took his family, and there was also another businessman who was a neighbour whose name was Kayumba.  He got into his vehicle and they drove off to Tanzania.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Kinyarwanda booth, please can you come to our assistance and spell out the various names the witness has pronounced.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
M-U-R-W-A-S-H-Y-A-K-A.  Mutabazi is spelt, M-U-T-A-B-A-Z-I.  Kayumba is spelt, K-A-Y-U-M-B-A.  There was also Jovine, which is a Christian name, J-O-V-I-N-E.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, to your knowledge, did the bourgmestre have houses at Nyakarambi?
A.	Yes.  As I stated, he stood in front of his house.  In fact, he had business premises that he rented to various people.  So it was business premises, shops. 
Q.	Did you know those who were the tenants of the bourgmestre's house? 
A.	Yes, I knew them, they were my  neighbours.  They were traders like me.  There was one person known as Murwanashyaka, Théo; there was another person known as Oswald Rutagenda; there was another person Marie, I don't know her family name.  There was a person named Murokole and whose nickname was Nepo.  There were many other buildings within the compound.  I believe that there were perhaps tenants, but it was impossible for me to know who those persons were because we didn't see them often.
Q.	Witness, were the tenants you have just named all Tutsi or Hutu? 
A.	They were of different ethnic groups.  There were Tutsis as well as Hutus.  Oswald, for instance, was a Tutsi.  Marie was a Tutsi.  Nepo was Hutu.  Murwanashyaka was of mixed parentage, since both of them were of different ethnic groups.  His mother was a Tutsi and his father was Hutu.  Nepo was Hutu. 
Q.	Were the bourgmestre's tenants or are the bourgmestre's tenants still living?  Are they alive, to your knowledge? 
A.	With regard to the tenants of the bourgmestre's house, one of them died but the others are still alive.  The dead person was Marie but the others are still alive. 
Q.	Do you know the date on which Marie died? 
A.	Marie died on the 13th of April.  She died on the night of the 13th April.  However, I was not present when she was killed because I left well before that date.  The following day in the morning, I came to Nyakarambi and she had already died. 
Q.	In your opinion, Witness, what was the relationship between Gacumbitsi and his tenants? 
A.	Broadly speaking, Gacumbitsi and his tenants had good relations, because most of the time he was there having a drink. As a matter of fact, there was a bar and a restaurant there as well as shops.  So the relations between Gacumbitsi and his tenants were good.  They never had any problems.
Q.	You said that Marie was killed.  Did you see her body? 
A.	I went to the spot where she was killed, but I could not see her body because I did not get into the house to see her mortal remains, because in our tradition, a man cannot go and look at a woman's body, this is our tradition. 
Q.	Witness YCW, was Marie the only person who was killed at night? 
A.	In the house in which Marie was, there was her junior sister known as Beatrice, she was also killed. 
Q.	Were Marie and Beatrice living in the same house? 
A.	I did not know exactly where Marie was resident.  But as regards Beatrice, I knew her place of residence because she was a trader, but I do not know whether Marie was also a trader in that building.  She was living with her junior sister or was living elsewhere. 
Q.	Could you have learned in April 1994 that Gacumbitsi expelled some of his tenants? 
A.	No, he never expelled his tenants.  He never expelled his tenants because -- unless that was after I left.  While I was still in the country, I never saw him expel his tenants. 
Q.	Witness YCW, did you open your shop on the 14th of April, that is the day you learned of Marie's death? 
A.	When I got to the spot on the 14th in the morning, I did not open my shop because the situation was getting worse and worse, such that we all took the decision to flee to Tanzania because it was very close to our area.  So I did not open my shop. 
Q.	You said a while ago that Gacumbitsi passed in front of the shop on the 13th and was threatened by the people, and you said that the situation was serious and he was threatened and he could be killed.  After that, where did he go? 
A.	While he was going towards his house, a few minutes later he headed for his residence.  Since that day, that is the 13th, I never saw him again the following day on the 14th.
Q.	Witness, your shops were in Nyakarambi.  Was there a market in Nyakarambi near your shop? 
A.	Yes, near my shop there was a market.
Q.	And what was the usual day in which that market was held? 
A.	The market day was Wednesday of each week.  However, since the events started, the market was no longer held.
Q.	In Gatore secteur, which was yours, following the death of the president, was there any distribution of weapons? 
A.	Generally, there was no distribution of weapons in my secteur.  I do not understand how weapons would have been distributed because there was no war at the time.
Q.	Did you hear that Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi incited members of the population to rape Tutsi women and girls?
A.	No, I never heard of such incitements because in my area, there were Tutsi women and girls and nothing of the sort happened to them. 
Q.	In your capacity as a trader, did you usually travel within Rusumo commune? 
A.	Are you referring to the period of insecurity or prior to those events?
Q.	I am referring to the period prior to the insecurity, before the death of the president? 
A.	Yes, I moved about in the entire Rusumo commune, throughout Rusumo commune, because my commercial activities were closely related to members of the population, and these activities were carried out in collaboration with some members of the population.
Q.	Do you know an area in Rusumo called Rwanteru?
A.	Yes, I knew that area, more so as it was close to my shop.  It was a very short distance from my shop, I knew that area.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Rwanteru is No. 210 on the list handed out.  The name of the place is Rwanteru.
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Was there anything particular in Rwanteru? 
A.	I don't know what you are alluding to when you talk of anything peculiar.  There was a building, a hill, or what are you referring to?  I don't quite understand your question, Counsel.  Could you please further clarify your question?
Q.	Witness YCW, were there soldiers in that area you have just recognised? 
A.	To what period are you referring to, because I may be wrong as regards the period?  Was that in 1992, 1993 or 1994?  Please, I would like you to further explain what period you are referring to in order to answer your question. 
Q.	I am referring to 1994.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I have an appointment at 11:00.  It is now 11:06, maybe we should take a break. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I have no objection to that, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, we have shall take a break now and resume the hearing in 15 minutes.  Thank you.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President.
(Court recessed at 1106H)
(Pages 15 to 25 by Sithembiso Moyo)



























(Court resumed at 1130H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This court is in session. 

Witness, we would like to remind you that you are still under oath, and the Defence shall proceed with its examination-in-chief. 

Counsel Kouengoua, you may proceed. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness YCW, before the break, before we adjourned, I had asked you whether, in 1994, there was a military camp in Rwanteru. 
A.	Yes, there was a military camp in Rwanteru.
Q.	Did you know the person in charge of the military camp? 
A.	As I had asked you to clarify the date you were referring to, I remember that in -- between January 1994, and April 1994, I saw quite often a sergeant named Mutabazi and he seemed to be the commander of the Rwanteru military position.
Q.	Can we spell the name Mutabazi?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mutabazi is spelled M-U-T-A-B-A-Z-I, Mutabazi. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Did you have any relationship with the military camp or with persons in the military camp? 
A.	I'm not sure I understood your question, Counsel.  Could you please repeat it? 
Q.	I was asking if you had any ties or links with persons in this camp, in this military camp.
A.	I still don't understand your question.  Are you asking me if I had any family ties or professional ties?  Because quite frankly, I don't understand your question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, is it -- do you really need to pursue this line of questioning? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I can change; it's not a problem. 
BY MR. KOUENGOUA:
Q.	Witness, was there a refugee camp in Rwanteru?
A.	Yes.  In 1994, starting on the 11th of April, refugees would come, and as they went everywhere, the refugees camped everywhere, and in Rwanteru, refugees arrived at the time and I saw them go through the centre where I had my shop, on their way to Rwanteru.  So there were refugees in that place because I could see them going by and continued in that direction, but I was not able to go and see how the camp was.
Q.	Witness YCW, after the events you described to us, did you remain in Rwanda or did you leave Rwanda?
A.	I left Rwanda and I went to seek refuge in Tanzania, and that is where I went when I left Rwanda.
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber when you left Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda on the 28th of April 1994, and I reached Tanzania on the same day.
Q.	You left Rwanda on the 28th and you reached Tanzania on that same day.  Between that moment when the president Juvénal died on the 6th of April and your departure from Rusumo on the 28th of April, did you ever hear that meetings were held in which the people were incited to kill one another? 
A.	I never heard of a meeting in which the people were incited to kill one another.  As I have said, the meeting I attended was the one organised by the bourgmestre in the office of our secteur in which he denounced the killings and exhorted us to avoid participating in killings because if anyone was found guilty of having participated in such events or such acts, would be punished, so I never heard or participated in any meetings.
Q.	During the same period of time, did you hear any commune official asking the people, asking the Hutu people, to kill, to massacre, rape, the Tutsi population?   
A.	I'm not sure I understood your question.  Are you speaking of an official? 
Q.	Witness YCW, this is my question:  Between the 6th of April and the 28th of April, did you see, hear or learn that the bourgmestre or the conseiller du secteur had allegedly asked the Hutu people to attack the Tutsi people? 
A.	No, never.
Q.	You told the Trial Chamber that you left Rusumo commune on the 28th and that you reached Tanzania on the same day; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.  I did leave Rwanda on the 28th of April and reached Tanzania on that same date.
Q.	Did you go through the area called Les Chutes or The Falls?
A.	Yes, and that is where I crossed the border.
Q.	Along the way, did you come across any roadblocks?
A.	Whilst I was fleeing, I did not come across a single roadblock.  I went up to the bridge and the way was -- the path was open and I crossed over into Tanzania, where I was welcomed.
Q.	Did you not hear that the bourgmestre had given orders to prevent persons from leaving Rusumo commune to go to Tanzania?
A.	No.  I never heard of such an order.  And if he had given such an order, then we would not have been able to cross the border, because it did not take us long.  In one or two hours there are -- a crowd had already gone through the border, and in Tanzania, the Tanzanian authorities did not understand what was happening.
Q.	Before you fled to Tanzania on the 28th of April, was it in your habit to go to the Chutes, The Falls?
A.	Yes, I would go there quite often.
Q.	Was there also military camp there? 
A.	Yes, in Kayenzi and in the place called Chutes, there were many soldiers.
Q.	Did you ever have the opportunity to get to know the name of the commander? 
A.	The commander was nicknamed Bikumagu.  I didn't know his name but he would often come and buy some goods at my shop that I would deliver at the military position.
Q.	Witness YCW, since the 28th of April, have you ever returned to Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  I returned to Rwanda in 1996, on the 12th of December.
Q.	Do you still live in Rwanda even now? 
A.	No.  I am no longer in Rwanda, because when I reached there, when I got there, the authorities started to persecute us.  They killed my child.  They put my elder brothers into prison.  They killed my uncles and my sister.  And when I noticed this, I realised that I started -- I went into hiding and I returned to Tanzania.
Q.	When did you leave this country for the second time?
A.	I don't remember the date, but it was in 1997, in May.
Q.	Did you -- were you an eyewitness to the killings of any of your -- the family members you have just mentioned for us?
A.	I did not see them being killed, but where we had been settled in the camps upon our arrival, they came to arrest my uncle, and they asked the heads of households to go and collect supplies, but they left and never returned.  Up until my departure, I did not see them again.  And even afterwards, they continued to arrest people at night, under the pretext that they wanted to question them, and the victims would never come home.  We were very frightened and we would no longer spend the night at home and we would sleep outside.
Q.	Witness YCW, at the beginning of our examination, you said that you knew the bourgmestre of Rusumo commune and you mentioned his name.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber whether he is in this courtroom?
A.	I caught a glimpse of him.  He is in the courtroom.
Q.	Can you tell us where? 
A.	He is behind you.  He is sitting down behind you, and I can see him from my position, from where I am.
Q.	What is he wearing? 
A.	He is wearing glasses.  I don't know if the interpreters will be able to translate what I'm saying, but he's wearing a black jacket and a shirt that seems to be blue.  I cannot see what colour his trousers are because he's sitting down. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Thank you, Witness YCW.

Madam President, I have no further questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua. 

Judge Egorov would now like to put some questions to the witness. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Witness, I'd like to ask you a few questions in order to clarify for myself some issues of your testimony.  Let us go back to the events of the 12th of April 1994.  You gave us the names of the assailants, as they were six in number; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
I could not give an exact figure.  I mentioned only six names but there might have been more than six persons.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  Did you know those persons? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. -- Your Honour, please, could you repeat the question? 
JUDGE EGOROV:
I want to know whether you saw some familiar faces of persons among these six gentlemen.  
THE WITNESS:
I'm not sure I understand your question. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
I'd like to know whether those people, the assailants, were familiar to you.  Have you met them somewhere before that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I knew them well before.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  And could you indicate the ethnicity of those persons? 
THE WITNESS:
The persons I mentioned were of Hutu ethnicity.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Did they carry any weapons? 
THE WITNESS:
Do you mean when they were in that place or at their house? 
JUDGE EGOROV:
You have seen them, so could you see any weapon? 
THE WITNESS:
Each time I saw them, because they lived in the same locality as I did -- I would like to give you a specific, clear answer, but I'm not sure whether you're asking me if I saw them walking around carrying weapons or whether they were carrying weapons when they came to the secteur office. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Have you seen the picture or have you seen how they were arrested by Gacumbitsi and the policemen who arrived at your place? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was an eyewitness to their arrest.  I don't know whether you wanted me to continue or not. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Did they carry -- I mean the assailants, did they carry weapons at the moment of their arrest? 
THE WITNESS:
When they were arrested, I did not notice that they were carrying weapons.
JUDGE EGOROV:
And could you tell me how many people arrived to your place with Mr. Gacumbitsi? 
THE WITNESS:
I remember that the persons who arrived with the bourgmestre was the inspecteur de la police judiciaire of the commune.  There were also various members of the communal police and there were three of them.  Those are the persons that I was able to see. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
You also mentioned that Mr. Gacumbitsi took all the arrested with him in his car to the communal office; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
He did not put them in the vehicle that he generally used.  There were two vehicles.  There was a second vehicle in which the inspecteur de la police judiciaire was and it was another Toyota Stout, and there was another vehicle, a dual-cabin pickup.  So, in fact, there were two vehicles. 
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you.  And my last question:  Should I understand that those assailants belonged to Interahamwe? 
THE WITNESS:
In reality, I never heard anyone refer to these people as Interahamwe.  They were not referred to as Interahamwe at the time.  Therefore, I never heard anyone refer to them as Interahamwe.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you have just told us that you knew the persons that had been arrested well before.  Were these persons who lived in your secteur? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  They lived in the same secteur as I did. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Moreover, you told us that on the 12th, you were at the Nyakarambi trading centre when you saw persons who were demonstrating against authorities, more specifically against the bourgmestre and the sous-préfet.  You stated that you also knew these persons, that they worked with you. 
THE WITNESS:
The persons that were making noise, I did not know them all but I knew some of them.  Amongst them, there were some thugs who lived in the commercial centre where I held my shop.  They were the ones who were making the most noise.  And I generally saw some of those criminals, so I didn't know all the members of the group but I knew some of the criminals.  Some of them were young children who did not have anything to do or who would sometimes help people carry their bags.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you know what the ethnicity of these young people was? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't know what the ethnicity was of each and every person because most of them would come and settle in town from various other communes and préfectures, and I therefore could not know what their ethnicity was.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Witness.  I will now turn to the Prosecutor and he will proceed with his 
cross-examination. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed. 
MR. KAREGYESA:
With your leave, Your Honours, we would like to start our cross-examination in closed session to protect the identity of this witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, you have no comments that you would like to make with respect to the request made by the Office of the Prosecutor? 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
No, Madam, no comments. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We shall now move into closed session.  We regret to inform the public of this but we are obliged to comply, to proceed in this manner, in order to protect the identity of the witness. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 32 to 35] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

	1216H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session. Mr. Prosecutor, pray proceed. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, do you recall being --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sorry.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, do you recall being --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's gone off again, sorry.
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	... investigators in this case?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
No answer yet. 
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Can we please have your answer, Witness? 
A.	I did not understand the question.  If you could repeat it, please? 
Q.	Do you recall being interviewed by Defence investigators in this case? 
A.	Yes.  I saw them. 
Q.	And it's true, Witness, that the Defence investigator you met recorded a statement from you?
A.	Yes.  I think I made a statement, and I believe he did note it.
Q.	And do you recall signing a statement, Witness, after it was read back to you? 
A.	I did not sign the statement, because the investigator told me he was in a hurry, and that he would see me again later so that I could sign the statement.
Q.	And how many times, Witness, did you meet this investigator? 
A.	I met him twice.  There was a third time I met him, later.
Q.	Now, do you recall the date on which you met him for the first time, Witness? 
A.	As regards our first meeting, I cannot be specific as to the date.  However, I can say that it was last year, in 2002.  That's when I met him.  That was when I met the first investigator. 
Q.	 (Previous translation continues)...
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, pray forgive me, I cannot recall the date but as regards 2002 -- but as regards the meeting I had with the other investigator, I think I can remember the exact date of our meeting. 
Q.	Witness, I'm still on 2002, and I appreciate that you cannot recall the date.  My last question was whether you can recall the month of the interview with the investigator. 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, my apologies but I cannot remember the month in which we met last year.
Q.	And did he record notes of the interview you had with him on that occasion, Witness? 
A.	Yes.  He took notes.  I could see that he was taking notes, making notes.  He left and promised me to come back.  He came back and asked me questions, again making notes.  He promised me that he might come again to ask me further questions, but I never saw him again.
Q.	So it would be correct, Witness, that you had two interviews with that investigator last year, 2002, on a day, date and month you do not recall? 
A.	We met on two different occasions. 
Q.	And on either of those occasions, Witness, did you sign any statement? 
A.	No.  I never signed the statements that were taken note of.
Q.	And, Witness, after the first two encounters you've just mentioned, how many more did you have with Defence investigators in this case? 
A.	I met another investigator, a different one from the one I'd met before, and I only met him once.
Q.	And do you recall the date on which you met this second investigator, Witness? 
A.	I think I remember the date.  It must have been the 2nd of September of this year, the current year.
Q.	And that would have been six weeks ago, Witness, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I think you can count the number of days that have passed since the 2nd of September and today, and you will see the number of days that has passed.
Q.	And on this occasion, Witness, did the investigator record a statement from you? 
A.	Yes.  He took notes while he was interviewing me, in the course of the interview.
Q.	And do you recall signing this statement, Witness, on this occasion? 
A.	I remember quite clearly that I did not sign the document drawn up on that occasion.
Q.	So it's your evidence, Witness, that on the three occasions you were interviewed by Defence investigators, at no point did you sign any statement?  Am I correct? 
A.	At no time did I sign my statement, because the investigator promised me he would come back and we -- it was planned that I should sign on his return.
Q.	And it's also correct, Witness, to suggest that you are only able to recall the most recent interview because it's only six weeks ago, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  That is the case.  If I remember the date, it's because it was recent.  Moreover, when I met him, something else happened that helps me to recall my meeting with the investigator. 
Q.	And it's equally true, Witness, that you can't recall the dates of the interviews -- the two interviews last year, because it's a long time ago, isn't it? 
A.	No.  That is not the reason.  The reason, in truth, is because I wasn't paying attention in order to be able to remember that date, and I did not take note of the day.  I did not write it down, because if something has happened, even a long time ago, but you write the dates down somewhere, you can remember. 
Q.	Witness, in your evidence in-chief this morning, you told Their Lordships that you left your home at around 8 a.m. and went to your local secteur office; am I correct?  On the 12th of April 1994. 
A.	Yes.  I left my residence.  I can't be specific.  I could say it was 8 a.m.  It was between 7:30 and 8 a.m.  That's when I headed for the sectoral office.
	(Pages 36 to 38 by Mark Porter) 




































	1230H
MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	I would like to put it to you, Witness that you never found Gacumbitsi at the secteur office on the 12th of April l994.
A.	I told you the whole truth regarding what I saw.  I witnessed what he did in the secteur office.  I was present on the spot.  Consequently, no one can challenge what I said, and I am not changing my statement.  I saw him with my own eyes.  I heard the statements he made and I have nothing to change in my statement regarding that event.
Q.	In fact, Witness, Kurunziza and his family were killed on the night of Sunday, 10th April l994, isn't it?
A.	I know fully well that Kurunziza died on the night of the 11th because we learnt of his death in the morning of the 12th of April l994.
Q.	Witness, why are you so certain about these two dates, the 11th and 12th of April l994?
A.	There is no doubt in my mind regarding those dates because I very well remember the days we stayed in our houses, and that was when we were waiting for news delivered over the radio to obtain information.  We had problems obtaining food.  I know very well that during those days -- I can remember the events that occurred.  I can remember the dates because I was still at home and I was not doing anything else.
Q.	Well, I am suggesting to you, Witness, that you did not remember these dates and that is why you never told or gave the Defence investigator the dates you now mention in court?
A.	Normally, when a question is put to you, you answer the question if it relates to events in a certain area and you can give specific details.  I gave details including dates, and it is not my fault if he did not note those dates, but I know that I gave him those dates.  So whoever wrote down my statement and omitted the dates committed an error, but I did mention those dates.
Q.	Well, Witness, I am putting it to you that you did not remember the dates, and, therefore, did not tell the Defence investigator of the key dates of the 11th and 12th of April.
A.	What you are saying is not true.  As far as I am concerned, what I have told you is the truth.  All the questions he put to me regarding dates and days were answered with all the details, the necessary details.  I don't know whether he mentioned those dates or not, but as far as I am concerned, I know very well that I told him the whole truth.
Q.	Witness, I will read from the second paragraph of your statement to the Defence investigator, recorded on the 2nd of September 2003, and I quote: "What happened in your area after the death of President Habyarimana's death?"  
A.	Obviously people were worried and we heard on Radio Rwanda that everyone had to stay home.  They were some attacks some days later.  Criminals launched and attack on the house of a teacher Everiste Kamanzi at Gatore and stole his motorcycle and clothes.  The same night they attacked Kurunziza's house and killed him along with his family members.  
Q.	Clearly, Witness, this answer is consistent with the question recorded in your statement and no suggestion is given as to the exact dates you have given us; isn't it?
A.	What I am saying is that I was answering questions put to me by the investigator and that I also gave him information regarding the dates of events which we were referring to.  I said that I gave all the information that was expected of me.
Q.	In fact, Witness, the portion I have just read you from your statement is more consistent with the fact that you cannot recall the date of last year on which you were first interviewed; isn't it?
A.	That is not true because if you do not remember something at one moment in time, that doesn't mean that your memory is blank, that all the data in your memory has been lost and that you have forgotten all the information.
Q.	Witness, you did know of a Tutsi trader in Nyakarambi by the name of Benard; didn't you?
A.	Yes, I knew him.  I knew him, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	And you are aware that he was killed on the night of the 13th of April l994; aren't you?
A.	No, I am not aware of that.  I do not know whether he was killed on the night of the 13th of April l994.  That information is unknown to me.
Q.	In fact, Witness, you were present on the 14th of April l994, when his shop situated not too far from yours was being pillaged?
A.	I did not witness the plundering of his shop.  I did not witness that event.
Q.	When did you first learn of his death, Witness?
A.	As regards Benard's death, I will tell you that I was not aware when he was killed, when he died.  I saw his junior brother fleeing, accompanied by a certain Murwanashyaka Paul.  He was on border a Daihatsu vehicle and that Daihatsu vehicle belonged to Murwanashyaka.  That is what I know.
Q.	So is it your evidence, Witness, that you did do not know whether or not Benard was killed?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I learnt of it like any other member of the population.  I learnt about it later.  Consequently, I cannot tell you that he was killed on such and such a day.  I heard people talking about his death, but I cannot say that I witnessed his death or any other event relating to that individual.  So, I therefore cannot talk about events I did not witness.  I cannot tell you about the circumstances of his death because I did not witness his death.
Q.	And you didn't witness Kurunziza's death either, did you, Witness?
A.	With regard to Kurunziza's death, that event was related to me, but as far as he was concerned, as far as I am concerned I saw his body because I went to his home.  We left the secteur office and we went to his house to see what had happened since Kurunziza was a colleague and we belonged to the same religion.  So we hurried up to go and help the family to bury Kurunziza's remains.
Q.	And it's equally true, Witness, that you didn't witness Marie and Beatrice's death on the 13th of April 1994?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, when Marie died I was not present.  I was going home and the following day I observed that she had been killed, but I wasn't present when she was killed.
Q.	So, it would be your evidence, Witness, that up until your departure on the 28th of April 1994, you did not witness a single death, isn't it?
A.	Are you referring to the date of the 28th?  Which month are you referring, to Mr. Prosecutor?  Unless I did not understand the question. 
Q.	--(inaudible) would you have Your Lordships believe that you did not witness a single instant of murder?
A.	As of that date, I -- that -- from that date up to the day I fled, I did not witness the death of any particular person.
Q.	And it's true, Witness, you are reluctant to return to Rwanda because you are wanted by the Parguet in Kibugo préfecture, isn't it?
A.	That is not the reason preventing me from going back to Rwanda.  I have already told you the reason why I am not going back to Rwanda, and I believe it is a valid reason.  I told you that I will not go back to Rwanda in view of the situation -- what the authorities did to me.  I was a member of a large family, but it seems that at the moment there are only two of us left, two members of my family left, and all of this is due to the authorities -- what the authorities did in the country, and it is not because I am afraid of being arrested by the Office of the Prosecutor in Kibugo.
MR. KAREGYESA:
I have no further questions for this witness, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Counsel Kouengoua, do you have any questions to put to the witness in re-examination?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I have no further questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel Kouengoua.  

Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you for coming to testify before this Court and we wish you a safe return home.  

Please could you lead the witness out of the courtroom. 
(Witness excused)

Counsel Kouengoua, do you have a witness for this afternoon?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I propose that the Chamber should allow me to call the next witness tomorrow morning if this does pose any particular problems.  And, Madam President, as I pointed out earlier with regard to Rule 15, if tomorrow the Chamber is of the opinion that it is not possible, I will call that witness on Monday, Madam President.  That would not pose any problem with regard to the deadline given to us because we are committed to abiding by the deadline set, and if at all it were not possible for us to do so, we will inform the Chamber accordingly.  That is what I said and I stand by that statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua.
	Counsel for the Prosecution, what are your remarks?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour, we object to Counsel's proposal on two grounds.  We are operating on a very tight -- or against tight constraints because we have only five days within which we can proceed in the absence of a third Judge.  Now if we blow this afternoon, it may create complications in calculating what is meant by a day.  Today is Thursday, we close business now, we lose the afternoon.  Are we able to recoup the other half of the day or not?  The wording of the -- of the Rule 15bis (A) is five working days.  

We submit that if we stop at this stage and not resume this afternoon, we would have lost the outstanding hours in this working day.  

The other basis of our objection, Your Honours, is that, the Office of the Prosecutor is holding a training workshop on Friday and Saturday and it was anticipated that all three Chambers, the Trial Chambers will be used from 9 am up to 5:30 on Friday and Saturday for the training exercise.  So if we adjourn this matter to tomorrow, Your Honours, it disrupts a European Union Financed training programme that has brought into Arusha trainers from Europe and the Pacific.

Simply put, Your Honours, we believe since Witness UPT is in town, there's no reason why we should not depose of her evidence today and conclude three days of very good and brisk business so that the remaining two days can be utilised next week.  

Most obliged, Your Honours.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  What do you have to say, Counsel Kouengoua?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I want to add simply, Madame President, that we, the Defence of Gacumbitsi, have not had 24 hours of work.  We didn't work on Tuesday because it was a public holiday.  If the Chamber, during tendering of evidence, between the 8th and 18th of August, would notice that there was no hearing without the Prosecution objecting.  I would like to state that Gacumbitsi's Defence Counsel is doing everything to speed up, to expedite proceedings and that is what I am telling the Chamber, and I have always said it.  I thought that yesterday -- and you saw that when we were talking yesterday,
Madam President, I said that I hadn't yet seen the witness.  It was my assistant who was telling me he would arrive on such and such a day.  If, Madam President, there's a meeting organised by the European Union or United Nations on Friday, no problem is posed.  The problem that we are facing today and which concerns Defence has to do with Rule 15, and it refers to five working days.  Everybody is aware of that.  We -- up to now we have had only three days of hearings.  Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and I want to point out that we have two other days that we want to use as judiciously as possible in order to meet the deadlines set for us.  I don't believe the time which is very very precious to all of us has been badly utilised, but as far as we are concerned, Madam President, we have not asked for any leave or any rebate of time in the tendering of our evidence -- of our Defence evidence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you finished, Counsel?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I thank you.  Counsel for the Defence, is your Witness UPT here in Arusha?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Yes, he is in Arusha, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If that is the case, can you prepare him during the lunch break and possibly start later, maybe at 3 p.m.  Tomorrow we won't be able to sit and we want to hear your witness as soon as possible.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I want to inform the Chamber that the deadline given us was five working days.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But today counts as a working day, and we should avail ourselves of this day to the maximum.  We will give you a little bit more time.  We adjourn now and resume at 3 p.m.  This should give you enough time to prepare your witness.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, we crave the Chamber's indulgence that we should be allowed to call this witness at 4 p.m.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And you want to examine this witness for how long?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, we are trying to adjust the situation as the Chamber has observed.  Situations where we have envisaged using three hours, we use two and where we had to use five hours, we use four.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I asked you a very specific question.  How much time do you think you will take for your 
examination-in-chief?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Supposing that this could last one hour, one and half hours, I believe we will still be within the deadline, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we could start therefore at 3:30, is that okay?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Very well then, we shall therefore resume at 3:30.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I would like to see you for a few minutes with regard to the technician.  If the technician cannot come and do the adjustments, we will continue to have problems in the hall.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, I believe the problem regarding technicians it doesn't pose a problem as such.  I think we should take someone who isn't a neither Judge, a lawyer or a member of the Court to talk into the microphone so that the technician can do the fine thing that we need.  This would be convenient for everyone because if the Honourable Judges and the lawyers are there, it would pause a problem, but I believe the technician only needs to have somebody talk into the microphone instead of the stenographers being present in order to do the adjustments.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I see no people working here now, we have to go on break and we cannot ask them to work while others are on break.  We can have that person take the -- make the solemn declaration, writing his -- it is not in the interest to observe the witnesses and the witnesses are not facing any risk in particular, it is just the technician who is coming to do his work and go away.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, the Chamber has all the latitude to make the appropriate decisions.  All I am doing is to make suggestions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All we want is to solve the problem.  Very well then, we thank you all.  We are adjourning and we will start this afternoon at 3:30.
	(Court recessed at 1319H)

	(Court resumed at 1531H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This Court is in session.  Good afternoon, everyone.  We should have a witness that will testify this afternoon, but we would like to know what is going to happen in the days to come and we would, therefore, like to ask the representative of the witness support section to please tell us what the current situation is and whether witnesses shall be arriving soon, how many witnesses are available now.  We thank the representative of the witness support section.
MS. BECKY:
Thank you, Madam President.  The witness support -- the Witness and Victims Support Section for the Defence intends to bring five witnesses to Arusha that bear the following pseudonyms, NG2, NG4, RDR, MQ1 and MQ4.  These are five factual witnesses that shall be available to testify in the week that begins on the 20th of October up to the 23rd of October.

With respect to the last two factual witnesses for the Gacumbitsi case, these two persons had been repatriated from one country to another.  This is a voluntary repatriation, and it should be mentioned that these two persons do not yet have identity cards, and the identity cards are used as a basis to issue travel documents allowing these persons to travel to Arusha.  At the present state (sic), the section cannot guarantee that these persons shall be present before the end of the month.  We have undertaken the necessary measures so that their identity cards will be issued.

As to the three expert witnesses in the Gacumbitsi defence case, the travel of one of the expert witnesses, Mr. Ndengejeho has been scheduled for next week.  For the other two expert witnesses dealing with forensic matters, we would like to inform the Trial Chamber that the ministry of foreign affairs of the French republic has agreed to make the two high-ranking civil servants -- to make them available to the Tribunal.  Therefore, the registry has sent them a contract dated as of the 7th of October.  We are still waiting to be communicated their travel plans that will be communicated to us by the Defence team, and that will allow us to organise the travel plans of these two witnesses.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you for this information.  That is quite useful.

Do the parties have any questions that they would like to raise?

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. KAREGYESA:
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honour.  I have two issues arising out of the WVSS submission.  Now, it's my understanding that WVSS is bringing five factual witnesses next week; namely, NG2, MG4, RDR, MQ1 and MQ4.  In addition, I also understood that arrangements had been made for the expert witness Ndengejeho to be here next week.  Now, if that's correct, Your Honours, there may not be sufficient time in two working days to go through the evidence of five factual witnesses and an expert witness.

The last time Professor Ndengejeho was here, in the Semanza trial, his testimony took a whole week, so it may not be prudent to fly this expert here next week because it's unlikely that we would be able to go through his evidence in addition to the five factual witnesses.

The other point, Your Honours, is that WVSS has gone ahead to arrange the attendance of Witness MQ4, who was not listed by the Defence in accordance with your scheduling order made under 73ter.  As such, this witness remains unlisted and cannot properly appear before Your Honours unless the Defence files a motion to vary its witness list.  That's all I have to say for the time being, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

I will now ask the representative of the witness support section to provide the clarification that has been requested by the Prosecutor.
MS. BECKY:
Thank you, Madam President.  With respect to expert witness Ndengejeho, we have been in close contact with the Defence team and it is supposed to tender a report written by Mr. Ndengejeho before the Trial Chamber.  And we understand that this report needs to be filed 21 days before the expert witness can testify.  And this is why we felt it was appropriate, and this of course in close consultation with the Defence team, to bring him in as of next week so that he can begin to testify in the period of the -- beginning on the 27th of October, and this will allow us to comply with the 21 days required for the filing of the expert report.

As to the other experts, the forensic experts, no dates have yet been set, and it is the Defence team's responsibility to provide clarification on this matter. 

As to Witness MQ4, our section only provides support, and our job is to bring witnesses appearing on a list that is given to us by a defence team; therefore, it is up to the Defence team to ensure communication of the names of the witnesses to the other party, and our section only deals with transporting the witnesses to Arusha at a request made by the Defence.  It is not our responsibility to verify, for example, if one of the witnesses whose name has been communicated -- or whose pseudonym has been communicated is on the final list of witnesses that has been forwarded to the Office of the Prosecutor.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Madam Witness (sic).  So Witness UPT is now here; is that correct?
MS. BECKY:
Yes, Madam President, Witness UPT will be the last witness scheduled for this week.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you. 

Counsel Kouengoua, can you answer the Prosecutor with respect to your witnesses and, more specifically, with respect to Witness MQ4 and the expert witness?
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I thank you, Madam President, Your Honour.

As far as Witness M4 -- or rather, MQ4, Madam President, we have submitted the name and statement by this witness to the Office of the Prosecutor.  And until this very specific point in time, we have not received any objects (sic) or comments in this regard.  And, Madam President, we were preparing to file a motion in this regard but, before that, we needed to know whether the other party had no objection to raise with respect to the name and the statement of the witness that was communicated to the Office of the Prosecutor.  They did not do so.

But that is not the issue, Madam President.  As far as the Defence is concerned, we have always tried to work in an atmosphere of clarity, and I never thought that a witness, such as MQ4, or other witnesses would be endlessly debated here in the courtroom because even those who were disclosed on the list we are currently withdrawing them from the list of witnesses, as we have stated, in order to harmonise our defence with the whole Trial Chamber and, of course, with the Office of the Prosecutor.

Therefore, Madam President, if what the Prosecutor is now stating -- that he does not agree with this witness coming to testify and with the statement made by this witness -- that's another issue.  But we gave the name, and we had to file a motion before your Trial Chamber in this regard.  Moreover, Madam President, I also believe that the Office of the Prosecutor did not to react to this communication because he knows perfectly well that many of our witnesses were contacted in September for the hearing of the 6th of October, and I believe everyone is aware of this.

Now, Madam President, with respect to the expert witness, once again, I am dealing with a situation as it is.  Mr. Ndengejeho testified during two weeks.  This is information that I cannot confirm or deny, but if Semanza perhaps lasted two years (sic), my trial -- case will be presented between the 6th to the 31st of October; therefore, I did not intend to ask for the two weeks you used previously.  To say that 31st of October is too short with what I am expected to do, that is not what is being discussed here.  We are in a Tribunal where the situation has changed, and we must do our best to adapt to the situation.  If the expert witness -- if the professor tells the Trial Chamber or the Defence that in less than a week -- in less than five days, he cannot testify, that is another matter, but I don't think that is the case.  But if we need three weeks for him to testify, taking into consideration examination-in-chief and cross-examination, this is information sent by the Office of the Prosecutor that the Trial Chamber will have to take into consideration.  The Prosecutor is of the view that perhaps the expert witness might require additional days, and we don't see how we can oppose ourselves to it.  He is the one who needs time for his cross-examination, Madam President; but, as stated by the representative of the witness support section, we are of the opinion that if the witness arrived in Arusha during next week, he could testify beginning on the 26th or the 27th.  It's just that we do not know that there would be difficulties with respect to examination or cross-examination.

And we stated that if certain witnesses were going to be withdrawn in order to take into consideration certain facts, there is no obstacle, there is no reason for the Defence not to consider this hypothesis, and this, Madam President, is our position.

Madam President, with respect to the French experts, we have some difficulties.  Even during the break I attempted to speak with the Institute Medico-Legal in Paris, the forensic institute in Paris.  I left messages and I am waiting for answers.  I think that we have really shown due diligence.  We hope that everything will take place smoothly, but to as the expresses concerned (sic), the registry had given them two weeks as of the time of their appointment, which would be as of the 11th of September, I believe, or a date somewhere in that vicinity; as of the 6th of October, actually.  And so those are the nuances that needed to be brought to the attention of the Trial Chamber.  So, Madam President, what I was saying this morning has now been confirmed.  For example, at the present stage we have only one witness in Arusha, and this is not because of any fault of the Defence, Madam President; these are just situations that we sometimes have to face.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel; nevertheless, I believe it is time for you to decide which witnesses you wish to withdraw in order for you to file a motion in this regard.  Moveover, with respect to Witness MQ4, which you seek to add to your list, it is now time for you to file those motions.  And with respect to expert witness Ndengejeho, it would be good to know how long will be needed to hear this expert because we have time constraints that we have to deal with.  You know that we cannot sit, in theory, beyond the 31st of October, and we need to resolve all of these problems in order to see what is possible.

If there are no further questions that need to be raised to the representative of the witness support section, then we will thank her and we will tell her that she may now leave.
Counsel Kouengoua, please file your motion as quickly as possible -- as soon as possible.  Now we shall ask you to call in your witness.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Witness UPT, Mr. Registry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness UPT, please. 

Good afternoon, Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are a protected witness and we shall speak to you -- or we shall use a pseudonym to speak to you.  The pseudonym that shall be used is UPT.  The Defence shall examine you.  Then the Prosecutor shall cross-examine you.  The Judges may have additional questions to ask you, and the Defence may proceed with a re-examination.
THE WITNESS:
I understand.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

We would now like to ask you to undertake your solemn declaration and the registry will assist you with this.
MR. JUMA:
Madam, will you please stand up, raise up your right hand and repeat the following words after me. 
(Declaration made by Witness UPT in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the witness and the registry.

Counsel Mbattang, you will be examining the witness?
MS. MBATTANG:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may now proceed.
MS. MBATTANG:
Good afternoon, Madam President; good afternoon, Your Honour.  Good afternoon to the Office of the Prosecutor.  Good afternoon to the interpreters.  Good afternoon to the registry.  Good afternoon to the court reporters.  Good afternoon, UPT.
Madam President, I would like to divide my examination of this witness into two stages: the first stage will be in closed session because she will be stating her identity for the record; then I shall move into open session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections, Mr. Prosecutor?

Very well.  We shall, therefore, move into closed session for the first part of the examination of the witness, we regret for the public.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French booth requested the Defence counsel to provide the interpreters' booth with a copy of the statement.  As of the present stage, the interpreters do not have one.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If the registry would be so kind as to assist in collecting copies of the witness statements from the Defence counsel and hand them over to the interpreters.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 51 to 52] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

A.	Yes.

(Pages 53 to 55 by Verna Butler)




























	1615H
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	You heard of killings in which areas?
A.	We heard of killing at Kibungo.  We knew that people were killing each other, but we didn't know -- we did not know what the precise situation was.
Q.	Witness, to your knowledge, in Rusumo before the death of Marie and Beatrice, were there other killings?
A.	No, there were no killings before.
Q.	Were there -- was there thieving?

A.	We heard the news on the 11th of April and we heard that it had been done on the 10th of April.
Q.	Witness UPT --
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honour, given counsel's sufficient latitude to lead hearsay upon hearsay, I thought this was a witness of fact, and the reason being here is to testify to matters which she witnessed.  How long are we going to be treated to matters outside the personal knowledge of this witness?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think that she -- the witness was also speaking of matters that she had witnessed, because she told us she went into her house, the house where allegedly Marie and Beatrice were killed, and she saw a corpse.  However, Madam Mbattang -- Counsel Mbattang, I think you might perhaps get closer to the accusations levelled against the defendant.
MS. MBATTANG:
Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  I was saying, Madam President, that up to date I am in the allegations against the defendant, and I understand very well that some of these things here are bothersome.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness UPT, you told us before that you lived at Nyakarambi, how far was your house?
MR. KAREGYESA:
This is a mischaracterisation of the witness's evidence.  She said she lived in Gafuzo (phonetic) cellule.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Mbattang, please, proceed.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	UPT, you lived in Nyakarambi; isn't that what you said before?
A.	Before Nyakarambi was a cellule, I was in Gafuzo cellule, but afterwards, with the new -- with the redrawing of the boundaries of the cellule, we were in Nyakibande -- Nyakibande.
Q.	Where did you live before?
A.	I lived in Nyakarambi.
Q.	Was the communal office in Nyakarambi?
A.	Yes, but it was said that the communal office was in Kirehe but, in fact, it was on the border between Kirehe and Nyakarambi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you are running the risk of divulging information that could lead to the identification of the witness.  Please, be cautious in your questioning.
MS. MBATTANG:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness UPT, when you were next to the communal office, can you tell the Trial Chamber --
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the witness had not say anywhere in her evidence that she was next to the communal office.  This manner of leading is totally unacceptable to the Prosecution, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, could you reformulate your question?
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness UPT, how far was your house from the communal office?
A.	Less than a kilometre.
Q.	From your house, could you see what was happening at the communal office?
A.	From outside, yes, but someone who was inside the house could not see what was happening at the communal office.
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber whether on the 9th, there had been a meeting at the communal office?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, counsel is suggesting --
THE WITNESS:
I do not know of such a meeting. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Counsel, we didn't hear what you said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please be prudent.  Do not give her dates -- for a specific date pertaining to specific events such as a meeting.
MS. MBATTANG:
Agreed.  Agreed, madam, I shall keep watch on that.

BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness, you said that you knew the defendant, Gacumbitsi.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber whether he had a house at Nyakarambi trading centre?
A.	Yes, he had a house at Nyakarambi.
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber where Marie and Beatrice lived?
A.	Marie rented the bourgmestre's premises and Beatrice was our neighbour.
Q.	Witness UPT, can you tell the Trial Chamber who was the landlord of the house occupied by Beatrice?
A.	It was said that the house belonged to an old man whose name I had forgotten, but who was called Busokoza.  Busokoza is spelt B-U-S-O-K-O-Z-O -- Z-A, excuse me, Z-A.  B-U-S-O-K-O-Z-A.
Q.	Marie and Beatrice, were they killed in the same house?
A.	Yes, they were killed in the same house.
Q.	Were they in the habit of living in the same house?
A.	No, they did not live in the same house.
Q.	Witness, do you know why the two girls were together in the same house the day they were killed?
A.	On Tuesday afternoon some hooligans passed and who said there were Inkotanyi in Gacumbitsi's house.  Marie was, therefore, afraid and she went to Beatrice's house.
Q.	Witness, are you saying that the two girls were killed in Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	No, they were killed in the house where Beatrice lived.  Marie went to that house on Wednesday.  She wanted to flee, but Beatrice convinced her to stay, dissuaded her.  She said the situation was not good if she ran away.  She would be killed outside and it was preferable to be killed inside than to be killed outside and be eaten by vultures.
Q.	Witness, do you know why Marie wanted to flee?
A.	She had observed that the situation was becoming untenable.
Q.	Did you see Gacumbitsi on that day?
A.	No, I did not see him on that day.
Q.	Witness UPT, can you tell us why you didn't see Gacumbitsi on that day?
A.	On that day when the hooligans passed brandishing their machetes, they were saying that Gacumbitsi was sheltering hooligans at his house and if they found him, they were going to kill him.  And from that day hence we did not see Gacumbitsi.
Q.	Witness UPT, apart from Marie, were any other tenants in Gacumbitsi's house?
A.	Marie had a restaurant, but another tenant had a shop, but I can't remember his name anymore.
Q.	What became of that tenant, Witness?
A.	I did not pay particular attention to that tenant who had a shop.
Q.	He was of which ethnic group?
A.	He was a Hutu.
Q.	Witness UPT, after Marie and Beatrice's death, were there any other deaths?
A.	One that I could identify was the death of someone called Bernard.
Q.	He was of which ethnic group?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	How was he killed?
A.	He was killed by the same hooligans under the leadership of Kirenge and Kigati.
Q.	Witness, you've just given us two names.  Can you spell them?
A.	Kirenge is spelt K-I-R-E-N-G-E, K-I-R-E-N-G-E.  Kigati is spelt K-I-G-A-T-I; K-I-G-A-T-I.
Q.	Were they Bernard's employees?
A.	Who are you talking about, Counsel?
Q.	The two people you just mentioned, the two hooligans.
A.	No, they were not employees -- they were not Bernard's employees, but they lived at the training centre.
Q.	Counsel, were they employees of another businessman at the training centre -- at the trading centre?
A.	No.  No, they had rented another house separately.
Q.	Witness UPT, you said earlier that you had heard about the president's death over a radio station.  Which radio station was that?
A.	It was Radio Rwanda.
Q.	Were you used to listening to the radio at the time?
A.	We realised that the situation was peculiar and we all listened to the radio, but in the evening of the president's death, there were no radio messages.  So we only got the announcement over the radio the following day.
Q.	Witness UPT, before the events of April 6th, 1994, was it your custom to listen to another radio station?
A.	We could also listen to Radio Muhabura, but it was mostly over the weekends.
Q.	And that radio station, Radio Muhabura, belonged to whom?
A.	That radio belonged to the RPF which had attacked from abroad.
Q.	Witness UPT, were you accustomed to listening to programmes over that radio station?
A.	Yes, we often listened to programmes over that radio station.
Q.	Did you listen to that radio station in hiding or openly?
A.	We listened to that radio station openly, because we like listening to music played over that radio station.
Q.	While listening to a broadcast over that radio station, did you hear mention made of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi?
A.	Once we heard that Gacumbitsi was sending youngsters and they were thanking him over the radio station for sending youngsters.
Q.	Witness UPT, in April 1994, certain acts were committed in Nyarubuye parish.  Were you aware of such acts? 
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the counsel should restrain from giving evidence from the Bar.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel for the Defence, I asked you to watch out the way you put your questions to the witness.  Avoid putting leading questions to the witness, such leading questions to the witness.
BY MS. MBATTANG:
Q.	Witness UPT -- Witness UPT, you told the Chamber that there were killings in your area on the 13th of April.  You also told the Chamber that you learned of acts of theft in Nyamugali.  Apart from these two acts, did you learn of other acts committed in other areas in your commune?
A.	There was a general atmosphere of insecurity.
Q.	Witness UPT, from 6th April to the end of the month of April, did you hear Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre, incite Hutus to rise up against Tutsis?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you hear of distribution of weapons in your area?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you hear or learn that Gacumbitsi incited Hutus to rape Tutsi girls?
A.	No, I never heard of that.
Q.	Did you see Tutsi women or girls raped?
A.	No.
Q.	Witness UPT, did you remain in Rwanda up to this date?  Have you been in Rwanda since then?
A.	No.
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda?
A.	I left Rwanda in 1994.
Q.	And since that date, have you ever returned to Rwanda?
A.	No, I have never returned to Rwanda.
Q.	You said earlier that you got married to a Hutu.  Do you intend to return to Rwanda?
A.	I do not know.  It is not up to me to take that decision; it is up to my husband to do so.
Q.	Witness UPT, before leaving your country, Rwanda, did you, in the course of the month of April, see Gacumbitsi holding a meeting in your area?
A.	No, I never saw him chairing a meeting in our area.
Q.	Witness UPT, are your parents still alive?
A.	My mother is still alive, but my father is dead.
Q.	When did your father die?  In what year did your father die?
A.	My father died in 1994 during the massacres.
Q.	Do you know who killed him?
A.	Among the people who I have named was a person known as Bugingo, but I could not recognise the others.
MS. MBATTANG:
Madam President, I have no further questions to put to this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Mbattang.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, please, you may now start cross-examining the witness.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAREGYESA:
Q.	Witness, it's correct, isn't it, that between the 7th and 17th of April 1994, you did not see Accused Gacumbitsi?
A.	I did not see him.
MR. KAREGYESA:
I have no further questions for this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  

Witness, you said that the distance from your house to the house occupied by the two women who were killed -- that between your house in which those women were killed, there was another house; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you also know inhabitants who were renting that house, the inhabitants of that house?
THE WITNESS:
The owner of the house was known as Nzera (phonetics), but he was already dead and the house was occupied by his daughters.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You told us that Marie and Beatrice were killed at night.  Did you hear at what time they were killed?
THE WITNESS:
Since they were our neighbours, we heard people smashed in their doors at about 9 p.m.  At 8 p.m. those hooligans had passed around and asked people to lock their doors and go indoors.  They came from behind the market where they had been smoking hemp.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you see them?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have any further questions to put to the witness in re-examination, Counsel for the Defence?
MS. MBATTANG:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, then.  Witness, thank you.  We've come to the end of your testimony.  We wish you a safe journey back home.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please lead the witness out of the courtroom.  
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Kouengoua, I believe we have come to the end of the testimony of the witnesses who are present in Arusha. 
MR. KOUENGOUA:
That is correct, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we await for the arrival of the other witnesses next week.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
Madam President, as announced by the head of the witness protection section, if we have any information we shall pass it on to the Chamber and to the OTP as soon as possible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, please do try to get this information as soon as possible.  We will try to hold our status conference on Monday in another case.  So if you have any further information, disclose it to us as soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements.
MR. KOUENGOUA:
I will try to do so, Madam President.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Mr. Counsel for the Prosecution, may I ask you a question?  It refers Witness MQ4.  Now, when you have a written statement, do you have the same position or there are some changes with respect of this witness?
MR. KAREGYESA:
Your Honours, the witness list is a matter regulated by Rule 73 ter.  It is a standard requirement with fixed deadlines set by the Chamber in a scheduling ordering.  Now, this Chamber gave a scheduling order, and a list containing the names and pseudonyms of 26 witnesses, signed by                           co-counsel Mbattang, on the 14th of September 2003, was filed with the Chamber.  

Now, it goes without saying, Your Honours, that this is the only list properly before this Chamber.  And this is why, again, Rule 73 ter provides for the procedure to be followed should there be a variation or should counsel seek a variation of that listed.  In this case, counsel has not filed the relevant motion seeking leave of the Chamber to vary this list, and therefore, any purported disclosure of that -- of the statement of MQ4 does not cure this fundamental defect.
JUDGE EGOROV:
Thank you, very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you all.  We shall adjourn and resume, in principle, on Monday, and we shall see at what time, bearing in mind what I said earlier.  And we hope to receive the information promised by the Defence counsel as well as the motion regarding varying the witness list.  

The session is adjourned.
