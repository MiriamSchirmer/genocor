Q.	Good morning, Witness.

A.	Yes, I saw him in the morning period, at midday, and in the afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That question has been answered, but you should be careful about leading questions. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, do you know what became of Mika's two children?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us?
A.	One of his children is dead.
Q.	Do you know when he may have died, or the period, possibly the date?  Do you know the date on which that child died?
A.	It was on the 8th.
Q.	Were you present at his burial?
A.	I was not present at his burial, but I saw what happened, since I resided in the same centre.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Is there a mourning period customarily in Rwanda?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Could you please specify that period to us?
A.	It lasts between six and seven days.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you hear of a place known as Kiziba?
A.	Yes, I heard of a place by that name.
Q.	Did you also hear that weapons were distributed to the people of Kiziba?
A.	No, I did not learn of that.
Q.	In Gishyita, was there a Tutsi population?
A.	There were Tutsis in each commune.
Q.	Can you tell us what their situation was from a security standpoint following President Habyarimana's death?
A.	After President Habyarimana's death, I no longer saw the Tutsis.  They started seeking refuge in various locations.
Q.	And where did they seek refuge?
A.	I was told that they sought refuge in Bisesero and in parishes.
Q.	And according to your sources, why did they seek refuge in Bisesero and in the parishes?
A.	It was because the RPF radio called on them to assemble in specific locations so that the RPF could protect them.
Q.	Did that radio station have a name?
A.	It was called Radio Muhabura.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness --
THE WITNESS:
"The voice that saves people."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you hear the announcement yourself on Muhabura radio to the Tutsi to seek refuge in Bisesero and parishes?
THE WITNESS:
They were not called upon to seek refuge in Bisesero, specifically.  Tutsis were called upon to assemble in specific locations so that they could be protected. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you hear the announcement yourself? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
On what date was this announcement made? 
THE WITNESS:
I believe it was run on the 8th or the 10th.  The announcement was made during the broadcasts of that radio station. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, do you know a person called Charles Sikubwabo?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Who was he?
A.	He was bourgmestre of Gishyita commune.
Q.	Thank you.  Do you remember seeing him the day after President Habyarimana's death?
A.	I did not see him.
Q.	Do you know a person called Obed Ruzindana?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	Do you recall seeing him in Gishyita on the 7th of April?
A.	No, I did not see him.
Q.	Did you learn that on the 7th of April a meeting was held in Gishyita town centre?
A.	No.  I heard nothing of the sort.
Q.	Did you learn of a rape committed in Mika's house?
A.	You mean Mika's house?  No, that is not possible.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, you did not hear about the rape or it is impossible?  What's your evidence? 

THE WITNESS:
I did not hear it, and as far as I am concerned, it is not possible.  You cannot rape someone in a house in which your wife was.
JUDGE SHORT:
That's impossible? 
THE WITNESS:
In my opinion, it is not possible.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In a house in which your wife does what? 
JUDGE SHORT:
And how do you know that --
THE WITNESS:
In my opinion, you cannot rape someone in a house inhabited by one's wife.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that a scientific impossibility, a physical impossibility, or is it a moral impossibility?   What makes it impossible for one to rape someone in a house inhabited by his wife? 
THE WITNESS:
In Rwanda culture, it is not possible to commit a rape in a house inhabited by one's wife.  You have your wife and your children in the same house.  It is not possible in Rwandan culture. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Even if your wife and your children are not there? 
THE WITNESS:
You mean if the wife and the children are not at home? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, yes. 
THE WITNESS:
In my opinion, it is not possible.  That is my opinion, my opinion.  It is not the opinion of anyone else.  As far as I am concerned, it is not possible.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Certainly not, it is not the opinion of everyone else. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, did you know the people who were living in Mika's house in April 1994?
A.	Yes, I believe I know them.
Q.	Do you remember any of them?  Do you recall their names?
A.	Yes, there were Mika, his wife, his two children and a niece, his wife's niece.
Q.	Do you recall the name of his wife's niece?
A.	Her name was Esperance.
Q.	Do you know what happened to her during the events of April, May, June 1994?
A.	In mid-May, as I was returning home from my office -- I had found work somewhere -- I heard that people had come to Mika's house and abducted Mika's wife as well as his wife's niece and had taken them away with them.  On that day, Mika had gone to take part in a funeral, the funeral of one of his cousins.
Q.	And you do not know what happened to her later?
A.	Are you referring to the niece? 
Q.	Yes, Witness. 
A.	I do not know what became of her.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when did this abduction take place?  Can you help us with the date? 
THE WITNESS:
It was in mid-May.  I don't recall the exact date. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When did you hear of it? 
THE WITNESS:
I heard of it in the afternoon, when I was returning from work.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In the afternoon of which day, of the day it happened? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, in the afternoon of the day it happened. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who told you about it? 
THE WITNESS:
Neighbours who were living in that centre, I heard them talk about it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What are their names? 
THE WITNESS:
There is, for instance, a trader who was called Senani.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Senani, he is the one who told you about it? 
THE WITNESS:
In the centre many people were talking about it.  Besides, I didn't know the names of all the various persons.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And who told you where Mika was?
THE WITNESS:
His neighbours who were living at that centre.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
They told you where he was? 
THE WITNESS:
Huh?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
They told you where he was? 
THE WITNESS:
People said that he had gone to bury his cousin.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you ask him?  Did you ask him where he had been when his wife --
THE WITNESS:
I could not ask Mika that question.  I did not have any specific relations with him.  I used to see him pass or go by like any other person.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Then how did you happen to know all the things about him? 
THE WITNESS:
He used to reside in the same centre as myself. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Therefore?  Therefore?  Because he used to reside in the same centre as you, is that why you knew about where he was and all the other details? 
THE WITNESS:
You know that if you live in the centre of the town, if anything is happening in that centre, I can learn about it.  It wasn't necessary for me to go and ask him questions.  I didn't have any relations with him.  He was older than myself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you do state that you used to reside at the centre of Gishyita town.  Can you tell us if the Gishyita secteur had an office for the conseiller, Mika?
A.	No.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, this ends my examination-in-chief.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, too. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Ms. Madenga, it's your turn now. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning to you. 
A.	Good morning, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want to thank you for coming.  I was listening to your evidence.  So I will just ask you a few questions to clarify a few points.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I understand, Madam Prosecutor.
Q.	Firstly, let's talk about the security situation soon after the death of the president.  You personally heard Radio Muhabura announce that the Tutsis should assemble at particular points; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	When that announcement was made by Radio Muhabura, did you personally see Tutsis assembling at the specific points broadcasted by the radio station?
A.	Yes, the Tutsis took refuge at specific points.
Q.	Do you also confirm that the security situation affected Tutsis only, and it was the Tutsis as an ethnic group who assembled in those points?
A.	Can you repeat your question, Madam Prosecutor?  I didn't quite understand it. 
Q.	It's a follow-up.  After Radio Muhabura had announced that Tutsis should assemble at specific points, the question is: The people who took refuge were Tutsis?
A.	Yes, they were Tutsi. 
Q.	Do you also confirm that following the announcement that the president's plane had crashed, there was also violence perpetrated on the Tutsis, the Tutsi civilians?
A.	Yes, there were acts of violence perpetrated against the Tutsi population.
Q.	In addition to the violence perpetrated against the Tutsis as an ethnic group, their properties were looted; do you agree?
A.	Yes, some of their property was looted.
Q.	You also agree that it was members of the Hutu population, the gendarmes, the Interahamwes who were perpetrating this violence on the Tutsi and also looting their property.  Do you agree?
A.	I did not see gendarmes.  It appeared to me that it was the Interahamwe who were doing that.
Q.	Did you also see some of the Hutu civilians joining the Interahamwes to perpetrate the violence on the Tutsi population?
A.	The Hutu civilian population?  As far as I am concerned, the Hutu civilians were the same as the Interahamwe.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Let's briefly look at the security situation, specifically in Gishyita.  It started soon after the announcement.  We can put it on the 7th of April 1994. 
A.	Yes, there was insecurity.  The president of the republic had just died.
Q.	By virtue of this insecurity, you said on the 7th of April 1994 -- you said it was business as usual for you because you were not a target.
A.	No, that is not what I said.  I said that I had a temporary job.
Q.	We'll come to your job, but now we are talking specifically about the 7th of April 1994.  Violence had started in Gishyita. 
A.	Is that the question you are asking me? 
Q.	Yes, the question is, by the 7th of April 1994, violence had started in Gishyita. 
A.	There was insecurity; violence followed.
Q.	You were not at Mika's home the night of the 7th of April 1994, were you?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can Madam Prosecutor repeat her question for the interpreter.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	You were not at Mika Muhimana's home on the night of the 7th of April 1994, were you?
A.	During the night?  What would I be doing there at night? 
Q.	That's good.  You are not there.  You had no business to do at Mika Muhimana's house.  Now, the follow-up question to that is that on the 7th of April 1994, two civilian women, one Gorette and Langida, were at Mika Muhimana's place.  Would you dispute that?
A.	I am not aware.
Q.	If it is alleged that two women were raped by Mika, would you dispute it?
A.	Me?  Or did the others say that?  Please, can you repeat the question.  I didn't quite understand it. 
Q.	If it's alleged that the two women were raped at Mika's home, would you dispute it?  You said were you not there. 
A.	I am not aware if they were raped.  I didn't learn about it.
Q.	You confirm that there was another niece by the name of Esperanza (sic) who was also staying at Mika Muhimana's home?
A.	Yes.

JUDGE SHORT:
His testimony was that Mika's wife's niece, called Esperance, was staying there.  Are you referring to somebody else?  He did mention Esperance, didn't he?  So what's your question? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat your question, please.
MS. MADENGA:
The question is for the witness just to confirm what he said in his evidence-in-chief that Esperanza was staying at the home of Mika Muhimana.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's what he said.
JUDGE SHORT:
That's what he said in his evidence.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are you disputing it?
MS. MADENGA:
No, I am not.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why does it have to be confirmed?
JUDGE SHORT:
This is not a question which you think might be relevant to that issue.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	If Esperanza was at Mika Muhimana's house and allegations are that she was raped by Mika Muhimana, would you dispute it?  You were not there.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness already told you he wasn't there.  He wouldn't know. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And he said it's impossible in Rwandan culture for that to happen, according to him. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Because that was where we were going, to the Rwandan culture.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Let's briefly look at that culture which you call the Rwandan culture.  According to you, it's impossible that someone can be raped in someone's home.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In the presence of his wife.

JUDGE SHORT:
Not in someone's home.  He said it's impossible for someone to be raped in the home -- for someone to rape another person in the house which his wife lives. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours, because I had not finished my question.  I will just --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And he graciously agreed that that is his opinion but it is not the opinion of everybody else. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Continue. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	I want to put a name to you and if you can kindly confirm whether that person -- whether you know whether this person at one stage lived at Mika Muhimana's home. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, why don't you do it in stages.  First of all, get to know whether he knows the person; then ask him the other questions about the person.  If he doesn't know the person -- otherwise his answer to us would not be --
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, can you have a look at that name and can you confirm, firstly, whether you know the person that bears that name. 
A.	Okay.  Tell me the name. 
Q.	Just hold on.  The registry is coming with the name. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Can you read the name? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have been able to read the name. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know the person?  Do you know that person? 
A.	I do not know that person.
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honours, I would like to tender that name as the next Prosecution exhibit.  And for the purpose of the record, that name relates to the first Defence witness, DA. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
This name is entered as Exhibit P. 61, to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 61 admitted, under seal)
 BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in mid-May you said you were returning from the office when you learned about the abduction of Mika's wife and Mika's niece, Esperance; do you recall saying that?
A.	Yes, I confirm it.  I heard about it. 
Q.	In terms of dates, when did you secure this employment?  When did you start working? 
A.	Are you referring to my temporary employment?  I began in 1992, the work. 
Q.	So in 1994 you were still working the temporary employment?
A.	We could hold temporary jobs depending on the availability of work.
Q.	Let's focus for the time being on the month of April 1994.  You still remember the dates when you were temporarily engaged in this work in April of 1994?
A.	In the month of April?  Please, can you repeat your question?
Q.	We are talking about the month of April 1994 and we are looking at the dates when you were contracted for this temporary work. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So what is the question, Counsel?
MS. MADENGA:
The question is, during the month of April 1994, does the witness recall the dates when he was temporarily employed.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was he not temporarily employed the whole time?
MS. MADENGA:
He said in 1992, the work would come and then sometimes --
THE WITNESS:
Did you understand me well?  I said indeed that I started work in 1992.  I didn't talk of 1994.  I talked of 1992 and not of 1994.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, in 1994, were you ever employed?
A.	Yes, I was employed.
Q.	When you were told at the centre that Mika Muhimana's wife was one of the people who were abducted, did you confirm that indeed Mika's wife had been abducted?
A.	You are talking about Mika's wife? 
Q.	Yes, Witness, that is what I asked you.
A.	You are talking about Mika's wife?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor --
THE WITNESS:
I talked about the niece of Mika's wife.  I didn't talk of Mika's wife.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, you talked about the wife and the niece, both of them, not one. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Are you now saying it's only --
THE WITNESS:
I talked about the niece of Mika's wife.  You even asked me the question concerning her name and I told you what her name was, Esperance, and as for Mika's wife, I said she was called Xavéra.
JUDGE SHORT:
The question is, who did you say was abducted?  Was it Mika's niece or Mika's wife and her niece? 
THE WITNESS:
It is the niece who was abducted, not the two women. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When did you say that abduction took place? 
THE WITNESS:
That happened during mid-May.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Let's continue and focus on the death of Mika's child.  Mika's child died on the 8th of April 1994; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Did you attend the funeral?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness has said that -- answered that question in examination-in-chief.  He said he didn't attend the funeral.  Unless you seek to dispute it, to show that he attended it, asking the question does not help either way.
MS. MADENGA:
That is where we are going, Your Honours. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You want to contest that he attended?  Is that your instructions?
MS. MADENGA:
Those are not the specific instructions, but the nature of questioning will go to see why he did not attend if it was a neighbour and he was not employed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, Gishyita centre is a small centre.  You were a neighbour to Mika Muhimana.  Why did you not attend the funeral of Mika's son?
A.	I did not take part in the funeral of Mika's son because I did not have any special ties with him.  I wasn't a member of his family.  When you are a member of the same family, you take part in funerals.  There was no relationship between us.  I used to see him just as he went by. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want to put it to you that the reason why you did not take part in the funeral is because of the security situation and the violence which was being perpetrated; there was never a time when you sat as a community to have the mourning period relating to Mika Muhimana's son.
A.	Does mourning take place before or after the funeral? 
Q.	You can tell us, according to your culture, whether it takes place before or after, but the question is that you were a neighbour; you did not go to Mika's house because there was no mourning period for Mika's son; people were being killed, so the community did not recognise the mourning period because of the security situation. 
A.	No, that is not true.  If I did not attend the burial of Mika's child, it's because I wasn't a member of his family.  I didn't have any ties with Mika.  I don't know what your culture is.  We help people who are related to us. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were not related to Mika.  As a neighbour, you did not even bother to attend the funeral of his son, so you also were not interested in his whereabouts.  You didn't know where Mika was during the period of the genocide; is that not correct?
A.	To say that I was not interested in knowing where Mika was during the genocide would not be true because I used to see him.  I was not interested in going to his home, but I used to see him.
Q.	It was not your business to see what Mika was doing during the genocide, was it?
A.	You don't mind somebody else's business.  He wasn't minding my business.  I don't know whether he used to see me, but I used to see him.  I don't know whether you understand the meaning of what I am saying.  You mind the business of your wife and children.  If one says I was minding Mika's business, it would mean that I used to get involved in his private life.  What I am saying is that I used to see him.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mika was the conseiller of Gishyita secteur.  Naturally, people would go with their concerns to him in that capacity; is that not correct?
A.	The conseiller of a secteur is a conseiller.  Those who needed him went to see him.
Q.	And they would approach Mika at the council office; is that not so?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
To which office, Counsel? 
THE WITNESS:
What office?  He didn't have an office. 

MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, I just want him to confirm that wherever he was entertaining the concerns of the community was regarded as an office. 
THE WITNESS:
He did not receive people in the office of the secteur because the secteur did not have an office.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	But he would receive people with problems and people regarded wherever the reception was to be Mika Muhimana's office.  Was that not so?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, you will have to go in the witness box and give us that evidence that people regarded it as an office.  If you think you want to ask this witness is it proper to refer to the place where he met people as an office, put it that way, as a question.  But if you put it that the people regarded it as an office, and you haven't given us any evidence of people who said they regarded it as an office, your questions will be faulty.
MS. MADENGA:
I am indebted, Your Honour. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Just ask him where -- he says Mika was a conseiller.  Ask him where Mika operated from as a conseiller.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Where did Mika operate from as a councillor?
JUDGE SHORT:
Not councillor, conseiller. 
THE WITNESS:
Mika operated as a conseiller in his home.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
I have no further questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Professor, any re-examination? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President, just a couple of questions. 	
      
      
      RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would the centre of Gishyita be, in a sense, a certain number of buildings were located there or was it a small centre?
A.	It was a small centre.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I shall rephrase my question.  During all the events of April, May and June, did you see Mika in the centre of Gishyita?
A.	I told you that I used to see him all the time.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
I have no more questions for this witness, Madam President.  I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Mr. Witness, was it Rwandan culture in 1994 that only the relations of the deceased family would attend the mourning period? 
THE WITNESS:
That depended on the ties that people had with each other.  For example, if you are in hospital, somebody who loves you will visit you.  For my part, I used to see Mika in the centre.  There were no particular ties between he and I.  He was a conseiller and I had my temporary employment. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So is it your evidence that only the close relations and the friends of the family would attend the funeral ceremony and the mourning period? 
THE WITNESS:
Friends -- it is said that you know your real friends when you are married.  That is why I say that a real friend will come to your assistance.  He was conseiller.  I was not on the same social rank as he was. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, where was Mika's house? 
THE WITNESS:
Mika's house was above the Catholic Church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And is that where you saw him at the times when you saw him at the centre? 
THE WITNESS:
I used to see him when I walked by to the centre.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you go to that house any time between the 8th and the 16th of April? 

THE WITNESS:
No, I never went there.  I didn't drink with him.  We didn't visit each other.  I used to see him as he went by.  There was no collaboration between us.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you had no particular reason to see him; is that what you are saying? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't have any problem with going to see him as a conseiller. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, I didn't ask you --
THE WITNESS:
I had no problem to go submit to him as conseiller.  He is here.  You can ask him whether I went to see him in this capacity.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You didn't actually go to see him in any capacity, did you? 
THE WITNESS:
I had no reason to go and see him.  What could he do for me? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So if you saw him at all, you saw him as he went on his business and you went on your business? 
THE WITNESS:
That's right.  I knew him because he was the brother of the director of my school.  He was the director of the CFG.  If I hadn't been taught by his brother who ran the CFG, I wouldn't have known him.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
During the period following the president's death, from the 7th onwards, did you hear that people had been attacked in Gishyita? 
THE WITNESS:
The people who were attacked?  Could you please repeat the question, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you hear of any attacks of people after the 7th of April in Gishyita, after the 7th of April? 
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to Gishyita secteur or Gishyita commune? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Secteur. 
THE WITNESS:
I heard nothing of it. 
JUDGE SHORT:
When did you say you heard of the president's death? 

THE WITNESS:
On the morning of the 7th. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you hear an announcement that people should stay at home? 
THE WITNESS:
On the radio?  I heard people say it; I didn't own a radio. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But you heard that it was announced that people should stay at home. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I heard of it.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you comply with that announcement and stay at home? 
THE WITNESS:
I heard this announcement -- considering that I was working not far from my home.  Unless the announcement stated that people should stay at home, inside their houses. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm asking you, did you stay at home in accordance with the announcement which you heard or you disobeyed that announcement?  Just tell me what you did. 
THE WITNESS:
I did not obey the communiqué. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, you said on the 7th you did not -- you saw Mika, but you did not see Sikubwabo.  Is that not correct? 
THE WITNESS:
I said that I did not see Sikubwabo, that I saw Mika.
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you know where Sikubwabo used to live? 
THE WITNESS:
He lived beyond the commune office in a place called Gatoki. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you ever see him with Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
JUDGE SHORT:
But you never saw him the way you used to see Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
Are you talking about Sikubwabo?
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, I am talking about Sikubwabo. 
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not see him as I used to see Mika. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, lastly, who did you hear abducted the niece of Mika's wife? 
THE WITNESS:
They said that it was Interahamwe who had come from Gisenyi. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You knew the Interahamwe very well, did you?
THE WITNESS:
I knew that Interahamwe were criminals. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you ever see Mika with the Interahamwe? 
THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE SHORT:
He had no relationship with the Interahamwe? 
THE WITNESS:
I know nothing about it. 
JUDGE SHORT:
What about Sikubwabo? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't understand your question.  Are you referring to Sikubwabo and the Interahamwe? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know.  If he collaborated with the Interahamwe, I am not aware of it.  I didn't see him very often.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you know the leaders of the Interahamwe in your area? 
THE WITNESS:
I might know the heads of the Interahamwe if I had myself been an Interahamwe.  I therefore did not know their leader. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for your testimony before the Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home. 

THE WITNESS:
I thank you for putting questions to me. 
(Witness excused) 
 MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Mr. Issa, please call the next witness. 
MR. KAPAYA:
May I ask Your Honours' indulgence for just a minute.  We had information from the professor yesterday that the next witness testified in Ntakirutimana.  Could he be kind enough as to tell us the pseudonym of this witness in that case? 
 MR. SONGA:
Mr. Prosecutor, I don't know what witness you are referring to.  Are you talking about the witness who just finished testifying or the one who is coming in now?
MR. KAPAYA:
The one who is coming in now, TQ14.
MR. SONGA:
From the information I have, Madam President, he has never testified. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kapaya, this witness has never testified before this Tribunal. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour, for that information. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness, and to protect your identity you'll be referred to as Witness TQ14 in today's proceedings.

Mr. Issa, please. 
(Declaration made by Witness TQ14 in Kinyarwanda)
 MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Mr. Witness, do you have a document in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I see a document before me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read the information mentioned therein? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can read it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm that these are your personal particulars? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is the truth. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:

THE WITNESS:
It is indeed my signature. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  This document is entered as Exhibit D.58, to be kept under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. 58 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, lead your witness, please. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS TQ14
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I am going to put a certain number of questions to you.  You will try to be as precise as possible and answer only the questions put to you.  This is my first question, Mr. Witness.  When did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I learnt of the death of President Habyarimana in the morning of the 7th of April 1994.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And how did you learn of it?
A.	I learnt of it on Radio Rwanda, very early in the morning, at dawn.
Q.	Were you at the address that is indicated in the list of particulars that has just been shown to you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Just a moment, please.  Please do not give any names that would serve to determine your identity.  This is for your own security.  I shall repeat the question, if you will, and you will just answer yes or no.  On the day of the events, that is especially in April 1994, were you at the address that is indicated in your particulars that you have just identified?
A.	Yes.
Q.	In April 1994, did you know a person called Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	How did you make his acquaintance?
A.	I have known him for a long time, from the time when he was a trader in about 1970, and I also knew him when he was elected conseiller of Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Did you also know his family?
A.	I did not know his family well.  I only knew that his family lived in the secteur. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you say that you did not know his family well, do you mean, for example, that you did not know his wife?
A.	I knew his wife.  I was thinking that you wanted to know whether I knew his father and mother, but I did know his wife.
Q.	Thank you.  Could you tell us her name?
A.	His wife was called Xavéra Mukabetera.
Q.	What was her occupation?
A.	She was a teacher.
Q.	Did you know her ethnic group?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know what became of her?
A.	I know nothing about it. 
Q.	Did Mika Muhimana have children?
A.	Yes, he had children.
Q.	Did you know them?
A.	I know two of Mika's children, of whom one died, so I know the one who died and the one who is still alive. 
Q.	Did you also know their names?
A.	I know the name of the one who passed away.
Q.	Can you give it to us?
A.	It was a young child of five who was called Gaston.
Q.	You say that this child died.  Do you know how he died?
A.	He died in hospital and we buried him.
Q.	Do you know the date of his death?
A.	It is the 8th, the day after Habyarimana, so their deaths -- so he died after Habyarimana.
Q.	Did you take part in his burial?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And do you remember the date?
A.	He died on the 8th, and on the next day he was not buried.  I think he was buried on the 10th. 
Q.	And on the day of burial, did you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	He was there.
Q.	On the eve of the burial, did you also see Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, I could see him.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you hear about a place called Kiziba?
A.	Yes, I heard of it.
Q.	Did you also hear that on the 7th of April there was a distribution of weapons to the civilian population of Kiziba?
A.	I heard nothing of the sort.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us whether during the month of April, May and June there were Interahamwe in Gishyita?
A.	Listen, I don't think there were Interahamwe in Gishyita because the Interahamwe were comprised of people -- of youths of the MRND party.  Normally, in our area, this party was not well established, so there were no Interahamwe. 
Q.	When you say, Mr. Witness, that in your area there were no Interahamwe, are you referring to the secteur or the commune of Gishyita?
A.	I am referring to the entire Gishyita commune.
Q.	In April did you hear about an attack led by Tutsi assailants -- by Hutu assailants on the Adventist church in Gishyita?
A.	Are you referring to the Adventist church?  Could you please repeat your question?  I have not quite understood it. 
Q.	Thank you.  I will try to repeat it.  Perhaps I'll go in phases, and I'll start by putting this question to you.  Was there an Adventist church in Gishyita?
A.	There were many Adventist churches in Gishyita.  I do not know the church you are referring to.
Q.	And in Gishyita secteur, were there also many Adventist churches?
A.	No, there was only one church in Gishyita secteur.
Q.	In April 1994, did Tutsis seek refuge in that church?
A.	No, that did not happen.
Q.	Witness, do you know a place called Muyange?
A.	Yes, I know that place.
Q.	Can you situate it in relation to the Gishyita Adventist church?
A.	Muyange was a hill situated below the church, below the Gishyita Adventist church.  It was a small hill situated below the church, and between Muyange and the church was Mvumvero valley. 
Q.	And if you stood on Muyange hill, could you observe what was happening at the Adventist church?
A.	No, it is impossible because there was a cactus forest on that hill such that you could not see what was happening at the Gishyita Adventist church.  By the way, there was another forest on that hill where the Adventist church was situated.  That forest had been planted by a white man called 
Gary Hatti (phonetic).
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Please bear with me.  Let us go back to the date of 7th of April.  Were you at Gishyita town centre on the 7th of April?
A.	Yes, I was.
Q.	Can you tell us again from what time to what time you were at the Gishyita town centre?
A.	I got there at about midday and I left the centre in the evening at about 6 p.m.
Q.	Did you hear that the people were invited to a meeting at Gishyita town centre at that time?
A.	No.  No meeting was held at the Gishyita town centre.
Q.	And if someone were to tell you that there was a meeting there before you arrived there, a meeting attend by the population, what would your reaction be?
A.	To my knowledge, all meetings held at the commune office or the secteur office were held at the end of the morning period, so in my opinion, that was impossible. 
Q.	Do you know a person called Charles Sikubwabo?
A.	He was the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune.
Q.	Did you see him at Gishyita town centre on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	Gishyita town centre is situated not far from the commune office, so the bourgmestre must have passed through it; however, I did not see him.  People pass through the centre.  If he had passed through the centre, I would have seen him.
Q.	Do you know a person called Obed Ruzindana?
A.	Yes, I know him.
Q.	Do you remember seeing him at Gishyita town centre on the 7th of April?
A.	No, I did not see him there.
Q.	Did you see Mika and Charles Sikubwabo outside the date of the 7th of April?  Did you see them together?
A.	Counsel, could you repeat your question? 
Q.	Willingly.  After 7th April, but during the events of 1994, did you see Mika and Sikubwabo together?
A.	Never.  I never saw them together.
Q.	Did you hear that Mika committed an act of rape in his house on the 7th of April?
A.	I heard nothing of the sort.  Mika had a wife and she was living in his house, so I do not think he committed such rape.  By the way, I never heard anything of the sort. 
Q.	Do you know the people who lived in Mika Muhimana's house?
A.	I wasn't living in his house such as to know all the persons who lived with him.  Otherwise, I used to see a young lady and there were members of his family as well.
Q.	Do you know the name of the young lady you made mention of?
A.	Her name was Esperance.
Q.	How did you come to know her?
A.	I used to meet her at the cooperative in Umucyo (phonetic) and she was operating a phone booth. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you hear about her during the events of 1994?
A.	I recall an event that occurred in mid-May.  I heard that bandits, some Abakiga, had come and abducted her.  Otherwise, I heard nothing else regarding that issue. 
Q.	Abakiga, who is that?
A.	These are people who behave like bandits, looting and committing crimes across the entire commune.
Q.	Can you situate that event in time?  During those events, when did that event occur?
A.	I believe it was around mid-May, because Mika was once more bereaved.  He lost his cousin and we went to bury the cousin.  That is when we heard about that event. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  With the assistance of the registry, I will show you a name and ask you to tell us whether you know that person.  Witness, do you have that name in front of you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber whether you know that person?
A.	I do not know that person.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I will have placed before you another name.  You have the name before you, Witness.  Do you remember who that person is?
A.	No, I do not recall who that person is. 
MR. SONGA:
If the registry would bear with us, I would ask him to place before the witness another name. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, have you read that name?
A.	Yes, I have read it. 
Q.	Do you remember who that person is?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Under what circumstances did you know that person?
A.	I do not know whether you want me to tell you who the parents, the grandparents and the great grandparents of that person were.  In short, all I can say is that person is a member of our family.
Q.	It would be a good idea to put down on a piece of paper the name of the mother, the grandmother and what your relationship with that person is. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, has he given the details in Kinyarwanda?  Please, take it to the Kinyarwanda interpreter for translation.

Mr. Witness, you have not written as to what is your relationship to this name appearing on the piece paper in front of you. 
THE WITNESS:
If that paper were brought back to me, I would indicate the relationship between that person and myself.  And if you wish, I could tell it to you orally. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just write it down on the same piece of paper.  

Professor, since the name of that lady is written on a piece of paper, if you give us the relationship, his relationship with this lady, would that compromise his identity? 
MR. SONGA:
I don't think so.  I don't think so, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you tell us how this lady is related to you, the lady written on the piece of paper in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
This lady's father is called (By order of the Court, this name has been deleted from the record).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just give us you relationship, your relationship.  Don't mention names.  How is this person related to you? 
THE WITNESS:
I would say that she's a cousin to me and my family. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I wonder if I should carry on, or may I remind the courtroom that it's already break time.  Since I still have some other questions, can I proceed? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How long would you go to conclude your examination-in-chief?  Professor Songa, five or ten minutes, you can continue. 
MR. SONGA:
I would say I could take a maximum of 15 minutes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can continue with your questions.  

And the name mentioned by this witness, the name of the father of this person, will be expunged from the record. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have just written down the name as well as the relationship with that person, the relationship he (sic) has with you.  What was the person doing in April 1994?
A.	That person was doing nothing.  The person was staying at her parents' or his parents' house.
Q.	Was it the same thing the person was doing in March 1994?
A.	That person was still young and she was living at her parents' home.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, if somebody were to tell you that in April 1994, on the 16th of that month, that Mika raped her in the Mugonero complex, what would be your reaction?
A.	I would tell him that this is impossible because, given where the residence of that person was and that of Mika, there wasn't any contact between the two of them.  That person was residing at Kagano.  But what I wanted to tell you is that there was a long distance between the two residences.  The person was residing at a place called Mubikombe, so there was no contact between that person and Mika, and Mika wasn't used to going to that area.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, I would like, however, to draw your attention that you don't have to give names of persons because this may endanger your safety or the safety of other persons whose names you have mentioned on the piece of paper.  However, I will want to clarify my question to you.  If you indeed say that there was quite a distance between the two addresses -- my question, however, has to do with a rape that was committed at the Mugonero hospital.  If you came to learn that there was rape in the Mugonero hospital and that the subject of the rape was this person who was related to you and this person was raped by Mika, what would be your reaction?
A.	Did you say the 16th?
Q.	16th April 1994. 
A.	I cannot accept that because there was no contact between the two persons on the 16th.  Mika was in Gishyita, and the place where the rape was alleged to have been committed was not visited by Mika.
Q.	My last questions will have to do with a name that is on that piece of paper. 
MR. SONGA:
Can registry help us with this. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have a name before you.  Do you know that person?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you know the person in April 1994?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell the courtroom -- can you tell the Court where the person was in April 1994?
A.	That person was a student ***************, and she used to reside in a neighbourhood -- in a commune that was adjacent to ours.  She was living at *********************.
Q.	Was she Hutu or Tutsi?
A.	The person in question was Tutsi.  She was our neighbour.
Q.	Can you tell us if she's still alive?
A.	The last time I saw her was in July.  I met her at Bukavu, where we were in exile.  I left the country in July and I met that person in Bukavu.  We had a conversation, and that was the last time I saw her.  Otherwise, I don't know what has become of her.  
MR. KAPAYA:
May I intervene just as a point of clarification.  Is the witness referring to this person as a her or a he, because there appears to be a confusion?
JUDGE SHORT:
I heard she. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, is this person female or male? 
THE WITNESS:
The person is male, Your Honour. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think the problem was the French grammar.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know the circumstances under which the person survived the events of April to June 1994?
A.	We talked about it.  That person was accompanied by his two friends, and I asked him, "How come you are here"?  And the person told me that, "When the events occurred, I wasn't in my house.  I was lucky to have canoe that took me to Ijwi and I just spent three days in Bukavu." 
Q.	I would like to understand.  In April he was no longer in Rwanda. 
MR. SONGA:
I think the witness said three months.  He just spent three months in Bukavu.
THE WITNESS:
I can confirm that that person was still in Rwanda.  I met him in Bukavu in July, during our exile.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I will ask the question again so that you understand better.  How did the person survive?  Did he talk to you about where he was hiding? 
A.	The person told me that he had left his house to go close to the lake.  He therefore left his grandfather's house and went towards the lake, took a canoe that took him right to Ijwi.  That person left Ijwi to go to Bukavu.  It is during our exile that I met him.  That is what the person told me. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  My last question.  Were you bearing the same name as your father's?
A.	Are you talking about me?  No.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have just concluded my examination-in-chief.  The names that were mentioned on that piece of paper, I would like the sheet to be tendered as an exhibit.  I would like to thank you, Madam President.  

And, Mr. Witness, thank you. 

THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The first document which he referred to is Exhibit D. 59, to be kept under seal.  The second document will be Exhibit D. 60, under seal.  The third document is Exhibit D. 61, under seal, and the fourth document is Exhibit D. 62, under seal.  And the last document is Exhibit D. 63, under seal. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. 59, D. 60, D. 61, D. 62 and D. 63 admitted, under seal)
 MADAM PRESIDENT:
      We'll take a short break for 15 minutes.  Thank you.
      (Court recessed at 1120H)
(Pages 1 to 30 by S. Eboe-Osuji)




























	(Court resumed at 1140H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The sitting is resumed.  

Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecutor on your right.  Understand the questions and answer them briefly.  

Yes, Mr. Kapaya, go ahead with the cross-examination.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Bonjour, Prosecutor.
Q.	Were you resident in Gishyita commune in April '94?
A.	Yes.
Q.	When -- when did you come to Gishyita commune in '94?
A.	On the 25th of March.
Q.	Were you ordinarily resident in Gishyita commune in -- say in 1994?
A.	Since I was born, I was residing in that commune up until the year that you mentioned.
Q.	Was there a time that you were resident in Kigali?
A.	I never resided in Kigali, but at a certain point, I was working in Kigali.
Q.	Were you working in Kigali in 1994?
A.	Before the war, I was working in Kigali.
Q.	My question was:  Were you working in Kigali in 1994?
A.	Since January 1994 up until the date you mentioned, I was working in Kigali.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What date?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Up to what date?
THE WITNESS:
Up until the 25th of March 1994, I was working in Kigali.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Ninety-four.  How long have you been working in Kigali before the 25th of March?
A.	I think I started working in 1986.
Q.	So, between 1986 to 1994, you were not resident in Gishyita; is that so?  Is that your testimony?  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	 Can the Kinyarwanda repeat, because his microphone wasn't on?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It seems there is some confusion.  Can you, Mr. Kapaya, repeat your question?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I asked you whether between 1986 and 20 -- and March 1994, you were not resident in Gishyita commune.
A.	I wasn't residing in Gishyita, because I was working in Kigali.
MR. KAPAYA:
Can I ask Mr. Issa, please, can you, again, show the witness Exhibit 59 -- 69 -- 61 and 63, one at a time?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Say the numbers again.
MR. KAPAYA:
Fifty-nine -- I am referring to the witness to 59.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. SONGA:
Can the Defence see the document?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Exhibit D. 59.  Professor, you don't have that exhibit with you?
MR. SONGA:
We have it, Madam President.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, did someone tell you whether that person testified in this case as a witness?
A.	Nobody told me so.
Q.	And do you know whether that person testified in this case as a witness?
A.	I know nothing of it.
Q.	How about this person here, do you know whether or not she testified as a witness in this case?
A.	I know nothing of it.
Q.	Likewise, you don't know whether that person testified as a -- as a witness?
A.	I do not know if this person testified in this trial.
Q.	The Defence did not tell you whether these people testified or not in this case?
A.	The Defence didn't tell me.
Q.	Now, let's talk about D. 61.  You testified that that person is your relative.  You testified that that person is your relative, right?
A.	Yes, I told you that.
Q.	Now, did you expect her to say -- to tell you whether or not she had been raped?
A.	Can you repeat your question?
Q.	You testified here that she did not tell you that she had been raped.  Now, my question is: Did you expect her to tell you that she had been raped?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If she had been.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Put the question.  If she had been raped, would you expect her to tell you?  Is that not the question you are asking? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it's the same question and in different way. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It is an interesting question.  The question is predicated on a -- on whether it happened or didn't happen.  If it's happened, would the witness with the person -- would the witness expect the person to tell -- to report to him.  That's -- that's merely what you are asking.
THE WITNESS:
If that person were raped, she could have had told me or not.  It would have been up to her to choose to tell me or not.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So, you are saying that she -- if she were raped, she could or could not have told you about that -- about that fact?
JUDGE SHORT:
That's not what he said.  He said, she may have chosen to tell him or not.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, is it not almost a taboo in Rwanda for women to talk about rape?  Do you know that or you don't know?
A.	When a person is a victim of rape in Rwanda, the person screams and calls up for assistance and people come to help her.  That is a custom in Rwanda.  So, if a person is being raped, they would shout out and call for help and people around would run to her aid or assistance.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Kapaya, are you referring to the period of rape -- genocide?
MR. KAPAYA:
I'm talking about Rwandan custom generally whether -- whether the society is open to talk about rape and that kind of thing.  That is my question.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You see, Counsel, you are falling in the same trap that the previous colleague of yours fell into.  Unless you have put evidence which establishes that custom, so that you can put the custom to the witness, the question is meaningless, and the opinion -- any opinion he may give is of no value at all.  You would have to do a lot of ground laying to be able to ask that question in a way that it improves the evidence. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, we -- we brought several rape victims in this case, and they testified as to what, I mean, as to what  the custom is as relates issues of rape in Rwanda.  I just wanted to hear from the Defence side.  Those were Prosecution witnesses.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
From the Defence side, then ask what the custom is.  If the custom varies with the Defence and the Prosecution, ask the Defence custom (sic), what is the custom with regard to rape?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I believe that there are many ways of getting to the same point.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Then get -- get your point through your way.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do witness -- do women in Rwanda usually talk about rape?  When a woman is raped, do they normally talk about these things to their --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In open?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	-- in the open, for instance?
A.	Normally, when any person is attacked, the person goes to judicial authorities who examined it and take a decision.  As far as I am concerned, rape is an act of aggression.  And if a person were the victim of an aggression, they will have to go to the judicial authorities so that they can take action.   That is the culture in Rwanda.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The question, Mr. Witness, that is being put to you is this:  If a woman has been the victim of a rape in Rwanda, is it usual for her to go talking about it to other people?  That is different from the people who may be around, and for whom she might shout for assistance.  If she is been raped, would she normally go and talk about it in the public after that?  Or is it something that the people would normally conceal or not be too proud of?

THE WITNESS:
Now, listen, I do not know anything about rape.  A person -- a woman may be raped and all will depend on where the woman would have been raped.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Thank you.  I will not belabour the point.  Now, you told this Tribunal that you heard on Radio Rwanda on the 7th of April that the president had been killed.  Did the radio say who caused the death of the president?
A.	No, this is what I heard over the radio.  It was said that the plane carrying the head of state had been downed during the night of the 6th.  That is what I heard.  It wasn't said -- or the person who had downed the plane was not mentioned.
Q.	Did the radio say that consequent to the killing of the president, people should stay in their homes?
A.	When Radio Rwanda announced the news, the press release stipulated that people shouldn't travel.  It was said over the radio at dawn.
Q.	So, if say, you were in Gishyita commune, you wanted to go to Gitesi in Kibuye town, what would you do?  Did the radio say or was there -- do you know the procedure that was followed?
A.	I couldn't go there.
Q.	If say, you wanted to go for treatment -- you had fallen sick, you wanted to go to Kibuye, you wanted to travel from Gishyita centre to Kibuye to Gitesi -- to Gitesi commune, that's in Kibuye town, how would you go about travelling?
A.	To fall ill is another thing entirely.  You can be taken on a stretcher or in a vehicle.  It would depend on my illness.  If I have a headache, or if I am wounded in the leg, it would depend.  Otherwise, to go on the street when the radio had stated that people should not do that, I don't think that it would have been easy.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, did the radio announcement say that people should stay in their homes or that they should not travel from one area to another?  What exactly did the radio announcement say?
THE WITNESS:
I did not memorise the announcement, but what I understood is that the radio did not broadcast this release several times, but the announcement was asking the people to stay where they were following what had happened and not to be afraid.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you understand that to mean that people should stay in their various communes or or that they should not leave their houses?  What was your understanding of this announcement?
THE WITNESS:
For my part, I understood that the announcement forbade people to move about here and there.  That is how I myself understood it.

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So that if you -- if you wanted, say, to go to Kigali, was it not the procedure that you had to obtain a laissez-passer, a permit to authorise you to travel from one place to another?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Kapaya, we would like to -- your assistance.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was that a standard way of travelling before there -- before the plane crashed, or are you suggesting it's something which was introduced following the plane crash?
MR. KAPAYA:
That was something that was introduced during the war, rather, that if you wanted to move from one commune to another, you got to go to the bourgmestre, obtain a permit and then show it on the roadblock as you go along.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That was given at the announcement, or as part of the announcement that was made that people stay at their homes?
MR. KAPAYA:
I wanted to find from the witness whether it came from the radio or it was a practice that was communicated later on.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Was that not the case?
A.	It was not the case either before the war when everyone who wanted to take a trip -- to go on a trip, could take a bus and go where he wish to.  The announcement did not refer to any permits or travel permits.  I didn't hear that.
Q.	Witness, while you were in Gishyita in April, May, June, did you belong to any political party?
A.	I did not like political parties.  I belong to no political party.
Q.	Do you know whether there were any political parties in existence in Gishyita commune in April, May, June?
A.	Multiparty politics were introduced well before.  I don't know whether this was the only region that did not have a party.  But, however, what I know is that parties continued to exist until our exile.
Q.	Do you know the parties that were in existence in Gishyita commune in April, May, June '94?
A.	All parties were represented.  However, all parties did not have the same membership.  Some had more members than others.  All parties did not have the same number of members.
Q.	Do you know which political -- can you name the political party -- parties that existed in Gishyita commune during that period, if you know them?
A.	There was the MDR party; there was the PL party.  These are the two parties that had large number of members, because -- more than the others.  The MRND had -- was present, but had very few members.  There was the PSD and other parties that I cannot name here.  There were many political parties in the country.
Q.	Do you know what Impuzamugambi stand for?
A.	I used to hear about this party.  It is the CDR.
Q.	Was it in existence in Gishyita commune in April, May, June?
A.	There were not many members of this party.
Q.	Were you a member of the Interahamwe in April, May, June?
A.	I told you that Interahamwe was the youth wing of the MRND, whereas in this region, there were not many MRND party members.  A while ago, I said that I did not belong to political parties.  So, I was not a member of the Interahamwe.
Q.	Now, you testified that there were no Interahamwe in Gishyita commune --
JUDGE SHORT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, my question is:  How many secteurs are in Gishyita commune when -- in Gishyita commune in April May, June?
A.	Gishyita commune was made up of several secteurs, but I can give you the names of the secteurs that I know.  You will perhaps understand the topography of Gishyita commune.  I can give you the names of Gishyita secteurs that I remember.
Q.	If, for instance, there was Interahamwe in Mpembe secteur, would you know that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which secteur?
MR. KAPAYA:
Mpembe.  I said Mpembe.
THE WITNESS:
I couldn't be unaware of it, because this is a secteur which is next to ours.  And I would like to add that I know that Interahamwe were the youth wing of the MRND that had been trained which -- I knew what it was doing.  The Interahamwe did not go unnoticed, but in our region, there weren't any.  The secteur that you have just mentioned is next to ours.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us the process by which a person becomes an Interahamwe?
A.	I don't know how a person became an Interahamwe.  What I know is this, that the Interahamwe were the youth wing of the MRND.  I do not know how these Interahamwes were created.
Q.	Did they bear arms?  Did they have a special uniform?  How would you recognise a person -- if you look at someone, how do you know that this person is or is not an Interahamwe?  How would you recognise one?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Maybe you can put it better, Counsel.  How did he know that there were no Interahamwe in his -- in his secteur -- in his place?  How did he know it that they were not there?

Witness, how did you know that there were no Interahamwe in Gishyita?
THE WITNESS:
I used to hear about Interahamwe activities everywhere.  How the Interahamwe used to loot people's property, kill and committed crimes.  In our area, these Interahamwe had a common goal.  It was a group of 30 to 50 persons that moved together and had the same objectives.  Such groups did not exist in our area.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking how did you know the groups did not exist in your area?  How were they identified so that you know they are not there?
THE WITNESS:
They were identified by their acts, because in our commune, there was no problem of insecurity.  I am referring particularly to the week that followed the death of the President Habyarimana.  There was no security problem.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Because you are suggesting that the reason why you say there were no Interahamwe in Gishyita is because there was no insecurity in Gishyita following the death of the president.  Is that -- that is your reason for you saying there were no Interahamwe?
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, would you mind repeating the question?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you:  Are you saying, is the fact there were no insecurity -- there was no insecurity in Gishyita, the reason you are putting forward for saying there were no Interahamwe?
THE WITNESS:
That is not the reason.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the reason?
THE WITNESS:
As I told you, the Interahamwe could not go unnoticed.  They showed themselves.  They stayed together.  They were young people.  If these people had existed, or these young people had been present in our area, we would have seen them on the hills.  That is the answer that I can give you, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel is asking you --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are you trying to convey that there were no acts of violence or looting in your area?
THE WITNESS:
I think that in the first week following the death of Habyarimana, there were no such acts.  These acts took place during the second week, there was violence, there was looting.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel is asking you, these group of 50 people you are talking about, who could not go unnoticed, how did you -- did one identify them?  That's the question you are being asked.
THE WITNESS:
Since I heard about Interahamwe -- as I heard about them, I did not see any such people in my area.  This was a group of people.  It was not necessarily 50 people, who had a particular way -- mode of conduct, who moved together in a group, and which group committed crimes.  However, in our region, I did not see any such group, which is why I stated that this Interahamwe did not show themselves in our area and I did not see them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You said that there were no -- there was no violence in the first week after the death of the president.  What about the following weeks?
THE WITNESS:
During the second week after the death of the president, there were acts of violence.  Tutsis who lived in this area began to leave their homes to go to the hills, the Bisesero hills.  And this started when Radio Muhabura announced that Tutsis should come together.  This was on the 13th.  This radio station made an announcement which asked Tutsis to go to Bisesero where security would be provided for them by the RPF -- an RPF brigade that was present there.  And that is when the problems started, when the Tutsis left their homes to go to the hills of Bisesero.  When they arrived at the Bisesero hills, they would return to seek food in their homes.  And that is when problems came.  They used to come down the hills -- from the hills to seek food, and it is from that point, Your Honour, that the problem started.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We just want to know whether there were acts of violence in the subsequent weeks.
THE WITNESS:
There were acts of violence at the place that I have mentioned; that is, Bisesero.  I hear that there were clashes, that people were killing each other; that is, as from the 13th.  That is what happened.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who were the perpetrators of the violence?

THE WITNESS:
These acts were committed by bandits, these acts of violence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who were those bandits?
THE WITNESS:
How would I know?  These were young rascals.  I think it was these young rascals who committed such acts.  I don't think that the other members of the population committed such acts.  I heard that this happened in these Bisesero hills.  I for my part did not reach that place.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Kapaya, proceed. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, do you know whether Tutsis sought refuge at Mugonero complex in April '94?
A.	I know this.
Q.	And do you know that on the 16th of April, they were killed at that place?
A.	I heard about it.
Q.	Did you, by any chance, go to Mugonero hospital on the 16th of April?
A.	No, I never went there.
Q.	Do you know who was responsible for the killing of those people at the hospital?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	Do you know that other Tutsis sought refuge at Mubuga church in Gishyita in April '94?
A.	I heard about it.
Q.	And that on the 15 of April, they were killed there?
A.	I don't know whether they were killed on the 15th or on the 16th.  All I know is that such crimes took place at this place.
Q.	Now you talked about Esperance.  Do you know the surname of this lady, Esperance, the lady who was staying in Mika's house?
A.	She was called Mukagasana.
Q.	You testified here that she was working at a phone booth.  Where was it -- where was that phone booth located in Gishyita centre?
A.	I did not say that she worked in a telephone booth.  This telephone booth was located within an association called Umucho.  It was a cooperative of sorts.  Besides, this cooperative sold other articles, especially foodstuffs.  And this is where the telephone booth was located.  It was not a telephone booth as such.  It was just a cooperative.
Q.	So it is your testimony that she worked there?  Is it what you are saying, that Esperance worked at this cooperative?
A.	That is where I used to find her.  Even **************************************** there as well; that is, at this cooperative.  I used to go there to take a glass or two of drinks, or do something else.  I don't know whether she was employed there, but what I know is that I used to see her there, and that she used to return home to Mika's.
Q.	And how far was that booth -- how far was it from Mika's house?
A.	From Mika's house to the place where this cooperative was located, there was not much of a distance.  This distance could have been covered in five minutes walk.  It was quite close to the Catholic church.
Q.	You testified that she was abducted by Abakiga.  Did you witness the abduction with your eyes -- with your own eyes?
A.	No, I did not witness it with my own eyes.  I heard about it upon our return from the burial of Mika's cousin.  When we arrived at the house, the woman was no longer there.
Q.	And what period was that?  Was it in April, May, June?
A.	It was in mid-May.
Q.	And where did Mika's cousin die?  What is the location, the place where this person died?
A.	Mika's cousin who worked in the youth camp outside the commune -- well, I heard that he had died.  I was part of the burial party.  Surely, he died in hospital.
Q.	Was it in Gishyita centre?  I mean, where did Mika go to attend the funeral?  What cellule or secteur?
A.	It was in Gishyita secteur.  I do not remember the name of the cellule.  It is possibly Rutuna or Rwaramba.  This is a cellule that was below the communal office.
Q.	And how did you know that Mika had gone there?
A.	We were together.
Q.	And what is the name of the cousin who died?
A.	He was called Asiel.
Q.	Between April, May and June, did you witness -- did you attend any meeting in Gishyita centre, any political meeting?
A.	I did not participate in any meeting.
Q.	Did you see if any meeting were held in this period by the authorities?
A.	I am not aware of that.
Q.	Do you know a person called Gisambo?
A.	I do not know that person.
Q.	Do you know Charles Sikubwabo?
A.	He is the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune.
Q.	Are you aware whether he had a car, he had a vehicle, the commune vehicle?
A.	I am not aware.
MR. KAPAYA:
That's all, Your Honours.  I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kapaya.  

Professor, any re-examination?
MR. SONGA:
I have no questions in re-examination, Madam President.  And I thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey.  

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness to the exit door?
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Your Honours.  
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, call in the next witness.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness, and, therefore, to protect your identity, you will be referred to as Witness DAC.  You also do not disclose any information that would compromise your identity.  Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth. 

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness. 
(Declaration made by Witness DAC in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you see a document in front of you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read the particulars mentioned there?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you confirm that they are your personal particulars and are correct?
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You also verify your signature on the bottom of the page?
THE WITNESS:
It is my signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe the witness has disclosed his name.  If it is so, please let this be expunged from the record.  This document is Exhibit D. 64, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. D. 64 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please go ahead with your evidence.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  

I would like to raise a motion before you to the effect that this witness should be heard in camera for specific reasons of security. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, I hope you don't have any objection.
MS. MADENGA:
We have no objections, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Madenga.  

Mr. Issa, please ensure a closed session.  Professor, you want the entire evidence of this witness be held in closed session?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President, that is the purpose of my motion

(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 44 to 47] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 31 to 43 by Haruna Farage)




(Court resumed at 1438H)
 MADAM PRESIDENT:
The sitting of the Court is resumed.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecution on your right, so try to understand the questions and reply to them briefly.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, is there any need for closed session, or can we just continue in open session? 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, I would wish so for the same reasons.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Wish -- what is so?  What would you wish for the same reasons?
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, it depends on the questions the Prosecutor is going to ask.  I mean, the questions may be such as not to --
MR. SONGA:
Insofar as the questions will relate to the person that we are going to mention during the in-chief examination, we will have the same concerns during the cross-examination, so I would, therefore, like to crave your indulgence and request that we continue in closed session.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But if the Prosecutor is not asking questions which would disclose the identity of the witness, what would be the need for a closed session? 
MR. SONGA:
If we can have those guarantees and that we can be certain about that, that will be fine, but it would be unfortunate if it wasn't certain that the identity of the person concerned would be revealed.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness has been adequately informed.  Counsel for the Prosecution are conscious of the need to ensure that the witness's identity is not revealed.  Is there no real reason why we couldn't proceed like we have done with the other witnesses?  And if there is need for asking questions that would require closed session, then the Prosecutor will ask, or we would, or even you if you thought the matters that were being dealt with required a closed session.

Witness, you will remember that we are in open session now, unlike before, so don't speak out names of people that would make your own identity be at risk.  Be careful before you mention the names of individuals.  Is that understood by you, Mr. Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I have heard you and understood you well.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Madenga, please go ahead with your cross-examination. 
MS. MADENGA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours, and members of the Defence team and Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MADENGA:
Before I start my cross-examination, Your Honours, I would just want to remind the witness that since we are now in open session, we will refer to the person, the woman he was talking to with the pseudonym which is on record, SBG.

With your leave, Madam President, can I proceed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, go ahead. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you knew Mika Muhimana was conseiller de secteur.  Were you not also related to Mika Muhimana in 1994?
A.	I didn't have any family relationship with him, but our parents were friends -- were neighbours.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have a name which I have written on this piece of paper.  I want you to look at the piece of paper and tell me whether you know the person.  Can you read or do you need the assistance of the Kinyarwanda interpreter?
A.	I think it would be better for an interpreter to assist me here because there are some things that may be written in French, and I cannot read French.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
This is a name.  Can you read a name?  You can, of course, read a name.
THE WITNESS:
If the name figures in the document -- on the document that I have before me, I'm not aware.  I can read the name.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Do you know that person?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us what relationship between yourself and that person?
A.	The person whose name is on this document is my wife.
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Still looking at that piece of paper, that person -- is that person related to the Accused person, Mika Muhimana?
A.	My wife doesn't have any family ties with Mika, ***********************.
Q.	Is it not correct that that person is Mika's niece?
A.	No, my wife is not Mika's niece.  She *********************************************************************** **************************
MS. MADENGA:
We will come back to that, but for the time being, Your Honours, I would like to tender that piece of paper as the next Prosecution exhibit, and also for the purpose of records, the name relates to DN, who is Defence Witness No. 5, according to the list.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat what you say?
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, I'm just referring you to the order and list of Defence witnesses, and I'm saying for purpose of the record, the name we are referring to refers to DN, who is Defence Witness No. 5, according to the list provided by the Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  This document is entered and exhibited as Exhibit P. 62, to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 62 admitted, under seal)
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	To the best of your --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please proceed.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	To the best of your recollection, at what stage did DN *****************?
A.	If I make an estimate -- or do you want me to give you the year during which that ********************** ********************?
Q.	Mr. Witness, we can start with the year.  Which year are we talking about?
A.	Talking about the year, I do not think that I can recall the specific year, but I know that that person lived in ***************************************************************************************************** ********************* into wedlock.
Q.	So DN was married *******************?
A.	She came from ******************************.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want you now to assist me.  We are going to talk about BG.  You told us that on 16th April 1994, BG came to your home.  Did she tell you how the Mugonero complex was attacked?
A.	Yes, the person told me that the complex had been attacked.  She was inside the hospital.  She told me that the hospital had been attacked by Interahamwe who had come from various locations, including Ruhengeri, Gisenyi.  It was being said that the attack on Mugonero had come from those locations.  I had stayed at home because I was scared that my wife may be killed.
Q.	You said BG spoke to *****************for approximately an hour.  Did you hear the content of the conversation between BG and ***************?
A.	When those people were talking, I left them alone.  I went home to my house.  They stayed on the road for some time together.  When my sister-in-law came to the house she told me that**************** had asked her to become his wife.
Q.	In relation to the 16th April 1994, how much time had elapsed when ************ and BG talked about getting into a marriage relationship?
A.	I told you that she had just spent about more than a week at my house.
Q.	During the course of that week, did BG ever talk to you about her children?
A.	Were you referring to her children?  Well, certain people -- I think there are people who had children when they were still in their parent's home.  This child's name was ******************************* while she was still in her parent's home.
Q.	The question, Mr. Witness, is whether BG discussed her children with you, the whereabouts of her children?
A.	I do not know whom you are referring to.  When you say, for instance, BG, is it my sister-in-law of whom I talked to you? 
Q.	Mr. Witness, that is correct.  The person you were referring to in your evidence-in-chief is the person we are referring to as BG, because we don't want her security to be compromised.
A.	The person who came to take refuge in my house is the person you refer to as BG, I think.  So you should explain to me clearly if it's the same person you're talking about.
Q.	That is the same person and that was the initial explanation I made, but now that we are in open session, we are going to refer to that person as BG, the pseudonym, and not her actual name.  Do you understand this far?
A.	I am understanding you now.
Q.	So the follow-up question was that when BG came to your home on 16th April 1994, did you and BG discuss about the whereabouts of BG's children?
A.	We did not say anything in respect of her children because I knew that her children had stayed in their her grandparent's home; that is, in the home of BG's mother.
Q.	Mr. Witness, BG was coming from Mugonero complex and there was an attack perpetrated on the Tutsis, including yourself.  You would agree with me that she was concerned about the welfare of her family members.
A.	That is obvious.  When she left Mugonero to come to my house, she had concerns.  She was lucky to be able to come out of Mugonero because many people had been killed there.  It is obvious, therefore, that she was concerned and that is even why she came to my house and she asked me to go and see if her family were still alive in Kibuye.
Q.	When it was obvious she had those concerns, you want the Court to believe that within the course of a week, before establishing the whereabouts of her family, she was preparing to ********************?
A.	The truth be told, I can't tell you if she was inclined to ************* or not.  Probably she wanted to or probably she didn't, but, in any case, I think she wanted to marry her (sic).  If she didn't want to marry him, ************ wouldn't have forced her to.
Q.	Can you assist us a bit?  Who was ***********?  What was *************** occupation?
A.	*************** was a member -- was a normal person.  He didn't have any special job.
Q.	Did ****** belong to any political party in Gishyita?
A.	To tell you the truth, if you want me to talk about the background of political parties, I wouldn't be in a position to tell you.  I wasn't a member of any political party and I did not really know much about political parties.
Q.	Mr. Witness,************ was an Interahamwe; is that not correct?
A.	To tell you the truth, I do not know if he was an Interahamwe or not.  We were told about Interahamwe.  We were shown Interahamwe who had come from Ruhengeri, Kamagu and Gisenyi.  I didn't see him wearing the uniforms or attire of the Interahamwe to be able to tell you.  I told you I stayed at home because I had concerns with my wife's security because she herself was threatened.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will show you the last name?
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honours, if I can ask the registry to show the witness Defence Exhibit 8 under seal.  It was tendered on 6th April 2004 during cross-examination through the Prosecution Witness 
No. 5, BG.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What number again? 
MS. MADENGA:
It's Defence Exhibit No. 8, which was tendered on 6th of April 2004.  It was tendered during the course of cross-examination by the Defence and it was tendered through Prosecution Witness No. 5, who is BG.
JUDGE SHORT:
Before you go on, Mr. Witness, you said you do not know whether ************ was an Interahamwe because you did not see him wear the uniform of the Interahamwe.  What uniform did the Interahamwe wear?

THE WITNESS: 
I don't know what you understood.  I said that I heard about Interahamwe and nobody showed me Interahamwe to tell me that these are Interahamwe and that they are wearing the uniforms of the Interahamwe.  I couldn't tell the Interahamwe from the rest of the population.  There wasn't any difference, you know, amongst these various people, amongst the different people.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go on.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I'm waiting for registry to show the witness Defence Exhibit No. 8.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Do you know that person, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, I know that person.
Q.	Did you discuss with BG about this person?
A.	As concerns that woman, no, we didn't discuss her.
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is the woman who kept BG's children during the genocide.  If you'd actually discussed with BG, isn't it obvious that she would have confided in your that her children were at this woman's place so that you would go and check on them? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to seek clarification on a matter.  When I listen to the witness, he refers to one child; when I listen to the Prosecution's questions, she is referring to several children.  What exactly did the witness say in respect of the children of BG? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you ask the question again, please?
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  We can put the question to the witness. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Do you know how many children BG had in 1994?
A.	BG had one child, and until today she has only one child.  She did not have any more children.
Q.	Do you know the name of that child?  I just want to know whether you know it or not.  Don't call it out.  Do you know the name of that one child?
A.	Yes, I know the child's first name, but I do not know this person's family name.
Q.	BG told the Court that she had two children.  You are saying that BG had one child.  Isn't it correct that you really don't know much about BG?
A.	I believe that BG is the person who took refuge in my home when she came from Mugonero.  This is the person that I'm referring to as BG.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, Witness.  You are being told that person took who refuge in your home, when she gave evidence before this Court, she said she had two children.  Now, you say she has one child.  Which of you is telling us the truth? 
THE WITNESS:
I am telling you the truth as I know it.  I told you that she had this child when she was still with her parents.  Up until now, this is the only child that I know.  I don't know whether she had other children.
JUDGE SHORT:
So what you are saying is that, so far as you know, she only had one child, but you are not prepared to dispute her evidence that she had two children? 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot deny it.  If she said that she had two children, perhaps somebody else gave her another child.  I myself have other children that I look after, and I consider these children as my very own.  If she did say then that she had other children, then I would accept it.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Lastly, Mr. Witness, I want to put it to you that on the 16th of April 1994, when Mugonero complex was attacked, BG left Mugonero complex and went to Bisesero.  There was no need for her to come to your place because you are Hutu.  She was actually running away from assailants who included Hutu civilians. 
A.	What I can say about that is that BG did not go to Bisesero.  She came to my home when Mugonero was attacked.  She did not go to Bisesero.  I am telling you the facts as I know them.
Q.	And looking at Defence Exhibit D. 8 under seal, she actually confided her children to the lady written there.  You described your relationship with her as intimate, yet you did not even discuss the whereabouts of that one child you know about.
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And also, if **********had sexual intercourse with BG, it's not they were consummating a marriage; ************was raping BG.
JUDGE SHORT:
I don't understand your question.
MS. MADENGA:
I wanted the witness to comment.  I said if you say ************** -- because in his evidence-in-chief he stated that************* took BG as a wife by consent, so the question is if **********took BG as a wife, it was not by consent of BG.  He actually said in his evidence-in-chief that he accompanied BG to *****************
THE WITNESS:
Do you wish me to answer?

BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Yes.
A.	I don't see how a person who has been raped can go to *********** and this person, ***********, would buy this person a Bible and give her a store.  She **************************************************, so she did this of her own volition.  She wasn't raped.
Q.	And lastly, if you took BG to ******************, you, in your capacity as a Hutu, you were conniving with people who were facilitating the rape of Tutsi women.  Can you comment?
A.	That is not the case.  I went to*************** home.  I was Hutu, and he was Hutu.  This woman had family ties with other Hutus because her mother was a Hutu, so that was possible.  If her mother was Hutu, how can you say that she could not marry*************? 
Q.	Just allow me to ask you one more question.  I had said lastly, but I just want you to assist me to one aspect, and this is a different aspect.  It just relates to your life.  Without disclosing the cellule, at one stage, were you, like, ***************?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would the Prosecutor please repeat the question for the Kinyarwandan interpreter?
MS. MADENGA:
I said to the witness, at one stage was he *********.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was he a ***********?  Is that what you are asking? 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
Recently, I was  *******************
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Were you ********************?
A.	I was not **********************.  Since I am of modest means, I asked ******************************* *********.  I wished to go and earn a little money, and when upon my return, I found that************ had been conducted and ****************
Q.	Are you aware or not aware that you ************************** you were suspected to have participated in the genocide?
A.	I know nothing about it and I never participated in the genocide.  Anybody who accuses me will find that I will defend myself.  I did not play a role in the genocide.
MS. MADENGA:
I have no further questions.  Thank you, Your Honours.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Madenga

Professor, any re-examination? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President, just two or three questions.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in answering a question put to you by His Honour, you stated that you might not deny it if you were told that BG had children other than the one that you know; is that correct?
A.	I did not quite understand your question, Counsel.
Q.	I shall try to rephrase it.  If you were told that BG had two children, how would you react?
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, he has already answered the question.  He said so far as he knows, she had only one child, but he would not dispute if BG had said she had two children.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Remember, he's your witness.  You can't very well cross-examine him.
MR. SONGA:
No, Your Honours.  With your leave, I shall return to the matter.  I just wished to be sure that I did, in fact, understand the answer when he was seeking to distinguish between the child of BG and other children that may have been given to BG.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, you are introducing a completely new element into the matter.  The answer of the witness was very clear.  The questions related to BG's own children and not children who may have been given to BG, so you are introducing a completely new element.  I think there was no ambiguity as to what Counsel asked and the answer that the witness gave.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, you know that I don't like to stay on one point of view, but the reason why I am attached to this point of view is because in his response, even he, apart from his children, might have children given to him.  I don't know whether everybody understood the same thing, but this is what caused me to put the question.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness was categorical about BG, and what he did say is, "Yes, I know one child of hers, but I can't dispute that she may have another," and once he has said that, I can't see what you need to clarify in that answer.  If, of course, you want to dispute it, your difficulty will be that the witness is your own witness, so you can't put him under cross-examination attack and tell him he's lying.

MR. SONGA:
I shall not press the matter any more.  I shall now continue with my re-examination. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, where was the child of BG that you know when BG was in your home?
A.	I understood that the child was nowhere else than at her grandmother's home in Kibuye.  However, I cannot say where the child was because we did not, BG and I, discuss this child or the child's whereabouts.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my re-examination. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, did you say that there was an exchange of Bible between *********** and BG?
THE WITNESS: 
I said that she received a Bible from a certain ************** so that she could go and pray on the Sabbath.
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm sorry, I must have got your evidence wrong then.  Okay.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, you said that the evidence that there was no rape, or ***********did not rape BG, is because he would not do so and then give him (sic) a Bible.  That's what you said.  Did we misunderstand you? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I don't know how you understood the question.  I said that it is **********who gave the Bible to BG.  Instead, I said, actually, that *********** could not have raped her and give her ************************** clothes and help her or allow her to go and pray.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this brings us to the end of your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony.  You are free to go now, and have a safe journey.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, bring in the next witness.

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness and will be referred to by your pseudonym DAB.  You also make sure that your identity is not disclosed in the course of evidence before this Tribunal.  
Thank you.  

Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth.
(Declaration made by Witness DAB in Kinyarwanda).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you see a piece of paper in front of you which contains your personal particulars?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can see the document before me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read it? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm that this document contains correct information? 
THE WITNESS:
That's right.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You also accept your signature at the bottom of the page as correct.
THE WITNESS:
It is indeed my signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is Exhibit D. 65, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 65 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed with your evidence-in-chief.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.   

I would once more crave your indulgence to allow us to go into closed session to protect the identity of the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, prepare for a closed session, please.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 59 to 66] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 48 to 58 by Trevor Gerbes) 


	1615H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you have (unintelligible) at this time, but unfortunately we do not have enough witnesses.  The witness support section informed us that they are bringing the witnesses.  So we adjourn and resume when the witnesses are here.  Thank you. 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, thank you.
(Court recessed from 1627H to 1639H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceeding is resumed. 

We've been informed that due to some logistic problems, the witnesses cannot be brought in.  So we adjourn and resume tomorrow morning at 9:00.  Thank you.
(Court adjourned at 1640H)
