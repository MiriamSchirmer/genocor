EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	A very good morning, Witness BB.
A.	Good morning, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	In front of you, you have a protected witness information sheet.
A.	Yes, I can see the document but I can't read.  The document is before me but I can't read. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  I know that you can neither read nor write, but you remember you appended your signature after we confirmed your personal particulars?  Do you identify the signature on 11 as your signature? 
A.	That is correct, I appended my signature on the document. 
Q.	Thank you very much.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, the Prosecution want to tender the protected witness information sheet as Prosecution Exhibit No. 15.  Can it placed under seal?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The protected information sheet of Witness BB is entered as Exhibit P. 15, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 15 admitted, under seal) 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I will proceed. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we want to focus on the events which prevailed after the 6th of April, 1994.  Can you tell the Court how you heard about the death of the president? 
A.	It was a Wednesday and I was going to Mubuga where I was going to meet a certain 
**************************, a trader.  I met him and when I saw him, he told me that classical music was being played -- broadcast over the radio and that the president of the republic had been killed.  He told me that, fortunately -- "It is fortunate that I have seen you, you people of Bisesero, there are many of you, and I think I, myself, will come and take refuge in Bisesero."  
On Friday we remained at home.  We had remorse, and the next day on Saturday we went to church.  At about 11 a.m., we heard drums being played and jerrycans, and the noise was coming from the Musenyi direction.  People of Musenyi were calling for help because they had been attacked.  We came out of the church and went towards Musenyi.  When we arrived at Kiziba -- 
Q.	Do you recall, in terms of date, when you were at the church when you heard people beating drums? 
A.	That was the 9th day. 
Q.	The 9th of April 1994? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Can you now tell us what happened in terms of the security situation, from the 9th of April 1994, when you were in church and you heard people beating up drums? 
A.	From that date, security deteriorated.  We were no longer safe.  We moved towards Kiziba and when we reached Kiziba, we realised that the houses of Tutsis were being destroyed, their cattle and sheep were being pillaged and people were also being killed. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  I want you to focus now on the journey to Kiziba, and we also want to focus on you.  You referred in your evidence that "we" -- who was in your company when you went to Kiziba? 
A.	There were many of us.  I cannot exactly recall the names.  Everybody came out of the church.  Women remained in the church and the men went out to see what was happening. 
Q.	Let's also for the time being focus on you.  What was your marital status in 1994? 
A.	I was married.  I had a wife and six children. 
Q.	Can you tell us what happened to your family when you heard about the death of the president before you went to Kiziba? 
A.	In the month of May my wife was killed; my two children were also killed.  I remained with four children who are still alive today. 
Q.	I am sorry about that.  We will come back to that.  I now want you to tell the Honourable Court, in terms of distance, how far is Kiziba from where you resided in 1994? 
A.	The distance was about three kilometres long.  I am only making an estimate, though, because I didn't measure the distance.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Why did you decide to go to Kiziba? 
A.	In our culture in Rwanda, when somebody calls out for help, you go to see what is happening to him. 
Q.	So according to the culture, did you go to see what was happening? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Can you personally -- can you tell the Court what you personally saw?  What was happening? 
A.	In Kiziba, when we arrived close to the centre of Kiziba, we saw on the other side of the centre a crowd of people numbering about 200, and in that crowd, I could identify a certain Rwingimba who was a policeman in our commune.  I also saw Mika in that crowd.  He used to be the conseiller of the secteur and a trader.  They were all -- all the assailants who were killing people and who were pillaging, but I couldn't identify them because in such circumstances, you can only identify people you are used to seeing. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You referred to Mika.  Who is Mika? 
A.	Mika is a Hutu man.  He was the conseiller of the Gishyita secteur. 
Q.	Before going to Kiziba, had you known Mika? 
A.	I knew him well before because he used to have a beer store, a small bar and he also sold coffee.  I also saw him during weddings and at Munyatwari's home, who was his friend.
Q.	Do you know the family or the surname of the person you are referring to as Mika? 
A.	His name is Mika Muhimana.
Q.	We will refer back to Mika Muhimana shortly.  But now, I want to look at the crowd you referred to, the crowd of 200.  Were these people armed or not armed? 
A.	They were armed with machetes, clubs, cudgels and also stones, because in our region stones were used as weapons. 
Q.	You also referred to seeing Mika Muhimana.  How close were you from Mika when you saw 
Mika Muhimana? 
A.	I would say about some 50 metres, but I am only giving you an estimate, because from where I am sitting up to where he is sitting, that could represent a distance. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you said from the witness stand to where who is sitting?
A.	From the dock right up to the wall at the end of the courtroom. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, the witness has made an indication from the witness stand to the end of the wall.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant --
MS. MADENGA:
And maybe with assistance from registry, we could ascertain the distance.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant, can you tell us the exact measurement, please? 
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, maybe I can proceed whilst they are trying to ascertain the distance. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, please proceed. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	You indicated the distance that is how close Mika was to you when you saw him at Kiziba hill.  Can you recall what Mika was wearing? 
A.	I cannot recall the clothes that he was wearing on that day, but I think I remember that he was carrying a long gun which had a wooden butt. 
Q.	When you saw Mika carrying a long gun, what specifically was Mika doing? 
A.	Mika and Rwingimba were opening fire on the people, and other assailants who were using machetes and the stones. 
Q.	Did you hear -- did Mika say anything during the attack at Kiziba? 
A.	There was noise.  We were talking all at the same time and they were saying: "You should halt all the Tutsis." 
Q.	You referred to Rwingimba.  Who is Rwingimba? 
A.	Rwingimba was a communal policeman at that time.  And the name is spelt R-W-I-N-G-I-M-B-A.
Q.	Let us come back to you, Mr. Witness.  When Mika Muhimana and the assailants were attacking people at Kiziba hill, what did you do? 
A.	I was in the company of other people and we tried to defend ourselves using stones.  But you will understand that you cannot defend yourself against people who are armed with guns if you have only stones.  I and a certain Rwakayiro, we went towards Ngendombi hill where we stopped in order to see why we were being attacked.  We tried to throw stones at them in order to halt them.
Q.	When you went to Ngendombi hill, Mr. Witness, did you find Ngendombi hill safe? 
A.	No, there was no security there.  People were chasing us.  People were trying to stop us and kill us, so we stopped at Ngendombi to see if we could find stones and defend ourselves with them since we didn't have any other weapons. 
Q.	Did the assailants pursue you to Ngendombi hill? 
A.	Yes, they were chasing us.  They came after us.
Q.	When you say "they," did you identify any of the attackers who pursued you to Ngendombi hill? 
A.	Rwingimba and Muhimana were the leaders of that attack.  If they hadn't had guns or firearms like guns and grenades, we would have been able to defend ourselves and push back the crowd.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We are now at Ngendombi hill.  Can you tell us how close Mika Muhimana was when you first saw Mika at Ngendombi hill? 
A.	He was about some 20 metres because he was pretty close to us and they had realised that they had guns and we were only using stones.  So they came closer to us, but you will understand this is only an estimated distance.
Q.	When Mika was at approximately 20 metres from where you were, did you notice whether Mika then was armed or not armed at Ngendombi hill? 
A.	He was still carrying his gun.  He was also carrying grenades.  And at Ngendombi, he killed three persons using the grenades.  One of those persons was a native of Musenyi.  I couldn't get his name but I know the names of the other two. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You said he also carried grenades.  How did you identify that 
Mika Muhimana was carrying grenades at Ngendombi hill? 
A.	At Ngendombi there were stones.  We defended ourselves using stones when they were firing at us and we would hide behind the trees there, but Mr. Mika slung his gun over his shoulder.  We thought he was going to go back, but we saw him bring out something that had the shape of a sharpened stone.  He threw it at us and we saw people fall to the ground and we wondered what was happening and we went farther away and fire was opened on a certain Nguriso.  There was a certain Ndahimana, Camile and another young boy who were impacted.  I later learnt that that man was a native of Musenyi but I didn't quite know his name. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Among the casualties, you referred to a person you called Camile.  Did you know Camile before the incident at Ngendombi hill? 
A.	That is somebody I knew because he was a resident of Kiziba.
Q.	You also referred to one Ndahimana.  Did you know Ndahimana before this attack? 
A.	I knew him.  **************************************. 
Q.	Did you have an opportunity to come back and look at the bodies of Camile and Ndahimana? 
A.	The time was about one o'clock, and when we saw Nguruso fall down, we tried to flee and when we reached the summit of Ngendombi, we saw the assailants backtrack.  We went back to where we were before and we realised that Ndahimana had been wounded.  But when the assailants were going back, they finished him off with machetes.  And I do remember Camile because he died instantly.  We realised that his chest was torn apart and that his eyes were bloodshot.  This young man, the Musenyi that I couldn't identify, was also dead on the spot, and Musherefu as well. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  When the assailants were finishing off Ndahimana with machetes, did you see Mika Muhimana? 
A.	Mika was carrying a gun and had grenades.  He didn't have a machete.  He supervised the action himself.  He was a leader and he couldn't soak himself in blood whereas he was the boss.
Q.	Thank you very much for that information.  You also referred to Musherefu who was killed.  Who killed Musherefu?
A.	It is Mika who shot at him.  
Q.	When Mika Muhimana shot at Musherefu, how close were you from Muhimana? 
A.	I was at about 20 metres from him.  We were trying to defend ourselves by throwing stones at them and the assailants who were attacking us, they in turn were attacking us with their guns.
Q.	Thank you very much.  How did you know that it was a bullet from Mika's gun which killed Musherefu? 
A.	I was quite close to Musherefu, and Mika was facing us.  There was a short distance of about 
20 metres and I could see them well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, before you proceed, I do believe that the registry has the measurement of the distance from the witness stand to the wall behind the Defence.  

Mr. Constant, please, would you?
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Madam President.  The distance between the witness box here and the wall behind the Defence bench is approximately 16 metres, one six metres.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Constant.

Yes, Madam Prosecutor, please proceed.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are now at Ngendombi, there has been an attack led my Mika Muhimana.  You had already described the casualties.  What happened after the Ngendombi attack?  What did you do?  
A.	When we realised that the situation was difficult, we took our wives and children from our homes and sought refuge at the Muyira hill.  All our neighbours were there in order to resist the attacks. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, approximately how close is Muyira hill from Ngendombi? 
A.	The distance is about four kilometres, but that is only an estimate.
Q.	So when you left Muyira hill, and you said you left with other people, can you tell us the ethnic composition of the people who left Ngendombi hill to go to Muyira hill?
A.	All the Tutsi detainees assembled to see why the Hutus were pursuing us.  We did not imagine that someone could kill another without a valid reason.
Q.	As you left Ngendombi hill to go to Muyira, at this stage, did you still have your family, that is your wife, and your six children? 
A.	Yes, we were always together.
Q.	What happened at Muyira hill? 
A.	We assembled at that location.  We were hiding in bushes and we spent the night there.  The next day we would go out and look for food in our homes, but subsequently, our houses were destroyed.  And after they were destroyed, we remained in the bushes, and the assailants used to come and loot our property, but we tried to look for food in order not to die of hunger.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you see Mika Muhimana at Muyira hill? 
A.	I saw Muhimana again in Ngarama -- in Kigarama, he was leading another attack.  That was in the morning at about 9 a.m.  I came down accompanied by one of my children, who was aged seven -- rather, that child was aged three.  I was carrying him on my back and others were hiding with their mother, and I went to Kigarama and I heard the sound of a car engine.  I could not see that vehicle because I was hiding in a bush.  All of a sudden, I saw people alighting or coming down to Kanyinya and they were moving towards Kigarama. 
Q.	Can you please clarify, how far, in terms of walking distance, is Muyira hill from Kigarama?  Is it the same place or is it a different place? 
A.	It is a distance that can be covered in 15 minutes' walking. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We are now at Kigarama, and you indicated that you were hiding with your three-year-old when you heard a vehicle and people alighted.  Did you identify any of the people who came to Kigarama? 
A.	Well, I did not see the vehicle.  I heard the sound of a vehicle, that vehicle stopped in Kanyinya and I saw people alight from that vehicle and move towards Kigarama.  There was a hole in which people were hiding in that location.  The assailants went towards that hole, brought out a girl and escorted her along that valley. 
Q.	Do you know the name of this girl who was discovered by the assailants? 
A.	That girl's name was Maribori, but that was only a nickname, I did not know her name.  Maribori is spelt as follows:  M-A-R-I-B-O-R-I. 
Q.	Among the assailants who discovered a girl nicknamed Maribori, did you identify any of them? 
A.	The assailants came down, I could see them; they were about 150 in number.  I could see them through the bushes.  I was able to recognise Mr. Muhimana.  I recall he was wearing a black jacket and his gun was slung over his shoulders.  He was accompanied by other assailants who were armed with machetes, clubs and sticks.  I was also able to recognise a certain Kabanda and Sandayiheba.  Muhimana was their leader.  He was at the head of the assailants. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When you saw Mika Muhimana wearing a black jacket leading the assailants, how close were you from Mika Muhimana? 
A.	There was a stream between us and they were on the other side, on the other bank of the stream.  I would say that the distance was about 50 metres but that is only an estimate. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you now explain to the Honourable Court what the assailants who were being led by Mika Muhimana did? 
A.	Those assailants continued searching, scouring the woods.  They used a little child to flush out a woman by the name of Mukabitega.  Shortly after that woman was flushed out, I heard her cry.  She was taken away and subsequently killed. 
Q.	Witness, did you personally witness how Mukabitega was killed? 
A.	When the assailants flushed out somebody, they surrounded the person.  I could see them very well because there were about three thickets between us.  The assailants started by raping her, and subsequently, I saw her body lying on the ground.  The assailants left thereafter.  

The little child again showed the assailants another lady by the name of Mukalibanje.  She was a carrying a child aged seven.  The assailants also killed that child.  She was aged seven months. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Before we go to a woman called Mukalibanje, let's go back to the person you referred to as Mukabitega who was raped and killed.  Do you know Mukabitega's first name? 
A.	Her name was Therese Mukabitega. 
Q.	Did you know Therese Mukabitega before this incident? 
A.	I knew her (by Order of the Court the words have been extracted and put under seal)
Q.	When the assailants were raping Theresa Mukabitega, did you manage to identify any of the assailants? 
A.	Apart from Mika, who was leading the assailants, Kabanda -- I could not recognise anybody else, there were many of them. 
Q.	Do you know how close to Therese Mukabitega, Mika Muhimana was when the assailants were raping Theresa? 
A.	That woman was flushed out and she was taken very close to where I was hiding in a valley.  I would therefore say that the distance between where I was hiding and where they were was about 30 metres.  However, I could not identify the people who raped her because she was surrounded by the assailants. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  When you say they raped Theresa, did you personally see what was happening? 
A.	The reason why I said that they were raped is that after the assailants left, that was in the evening, I tried to find out, to monitor the situation, so I went close to Therese Mukabitega and I realised that they had slit her throat, torn her skirt and thrust a stick into her genitals.  About 10 metres away from there, I also found the body of Mukalibanje.  It was lying on the ground, the legs were apart and the body of her child who had been killed was placed on her genitals, as if she was being forced to have sexual intercourse with the mother -- as if the child was being forced to have sexual intercourse with the mother. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  What happened to the bodies of Therese Mukabitega, 
Bertha Mukalibanje and the child who was placed on the mother's private parts? 
A.	I went back up the hill in the evening.  I wanted to give some food to my child.  The next day, before the assailants arrived -- they used to arrive in vehicles.  We told ourselves, before the assailants arrive in their cars, we should bury these bodies.  So I asked Mr. Sagasara and (by Order of the Court the name has been extracted and put under seal) to assist us to bury the dead.
Q.	Do you also know the state of the body of the child of Bertha Mukalibanje? 
A.	We buried the three bodies; notably, Bertha Mukalibanje, Therese Mukabitega and the baby. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  After the burial of the three, what did you do? 
A.	We were waiting for the assailants to return.  It was during the day, so we caught up with other refugees to try to organise our flight.
Q.	Did the assailants come back? 
A.	The assailants came every day.  The attacks were launched every day from Monday to Sunday.  They used to track us down in order to kill us. 
Q.	So from this hiding place, did you move to any other area? 
A.	I left my hideout in order to go home after the assailants had left.
Q.	At this stage, Mr. Witness, in Kigarama, you still had your family, the wife and the six children? 
A.	Yes, there were still alive, but on that day we were not together.  They had left to go and hide with other women. 
Q.	Did you ever go to Runyangingo hill?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are not getting the translation. 
MS. MADENGA:
Pardon, Your Honour? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are not getting the translation.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He said that they all of a sudden saw an attack on Gitwa; the assailants had flushed out some fugitives.
MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, the last question I had asked the witness is whether he went to Runyangingo hill and he was explaining the circumstances under which he went to Runyangingo hill.  Maybe we can continue from there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecution. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
THE WITNESS:
We left in the morning, I was accompanied by***********************, Assiel Kabanda and a certain Alexis Nduwamungu.  We went to hide in a millet farm in Uwingabo cellule.  The assailants flushed us out and we left again to go to Runyangingo.  When we got to Runyangingo, we hid in a pine forest.  The assailants kept pursuing us.  They came very close to us, they flushed us out again.  We tried to defend ourselves with stones, and that was when I saw Muhimana again, as well as many other assailants who accompanied him.  There were about 100 to 200 people.  They were very numerous.  They flushed us out and when we threw stones at them, they fired at us.  All of a sudden, I saw 
Alexis Nduwamungu fall under gunfire.  

There was another person, fair in complexion, that I saw.  When the assailants were firing, they were standing in such a way that there was a distance of 20 metres between each of them.  I was standing very near Kabanda, and very near me was Alexis.  So I saw Alexis fall.  Subsequently, Kabanda was also shot.  When we realised that the situation was becoming more and more difficult, we fled.  I was with ********************.  We got to a place where a hole had been dug because we were looking for castorer.  We hit inside that quarry.  At about 5 p.m., after the gunfire had ceased, we came out of that hole and we tried to find out what had happened to our companions who had been killed.  So we went to the area where they had been killed and we found Nzagamwita, who was bleeding around the area of the kidneys; bullets had gone through him.  We also saw Assiel Kabanda's body; he was naked.  His head had been cut off.  He had also been castrated, so they had cut off his penis.  
Alexis Nduwamungu was also naked; they had shot at him and he had fallen.  He had fallen under the gunfire.  That was in the evening.  We left to go and look for food.  We could not remain on that hill. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  These were very difficult circumstances.  But in terms of time, do you recall when you went to Runyangingo hill? 
A.	Well, during that period, we could not keep track of days because no one was waiting for a salary.  But if I remember correctly, it was towards the end of June because after that attack, other sporadic attacks were launched, and shortly thereafter, the war stopped.
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  You also mentioned that you saw Mika Muhimana in Runyangingo.  How close were you to Mika when you first saw him in Runyangingo hill? 
A.	I could give you an estimate.  Between the place where they were standing when they were shooting at us and where we were standing and throwing stones at them, there was a distance of about 80 metres. 
Q.	I did not quite get the distance.  Is it eight or 80 metres? 
A.	I stated that the distance was about 80 metres.  That is only an estimate; it could have been less. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  You talked about Assiel Kabanda.  Did you know Assiel Kabanda before violence erupted in April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I knew him.  We used to live in the same cellule.  He was a trader, as you know, traders are very popular.  He was a trader just like Muhimana, and they were doing their business in the same centre. 
Q.	You indicated that Assiel Kabanda was shot at.  Who shot at Assiel Kabanda? 
A.	From where I was standing and throwing stones, I could see Mr. Muhimana shoot at Assiel Kabanda.  Kabanda was someone who would be clearly seen because he was very tall and he was wearing a cap, and he was bald, I beg your pardon.  He was also wearing a shirt.  I was very close to the scene so I could very well see what was happening.
Q.	On this incident in Runyangingo --
A.	(Overlapping microphones)...Mika was wearing a green overall, a green jacket. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Now, we want to focus on the composition of the assailants.  Besides Mika Muhimana who shot at Assiel Kabanda, did you identify any other persons who were armed with guns, who were also shooting at the refugees? 
A.	There was another gentleman who was dark, he was middle-aged, but I could not know his name.  I did not know his name; he was also carrying a gun. 
Q.	Thank you very much for that clarification, Mr. Witness.  I just want to know the approximate distance between this man whom you don't know and Mika when the shooting was going on.  How far were the two men from each other, do you know? 
A.	When the assailants shot at us, we were standing in front of them and we formed this kind of wall to throw stones at them, and they were standing in front of us.  The distance between us was about 15 metres. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Do you know what subsequently happened to Assiel Kabanda? 
A.	The following day I did not return to Runyangingo, but a man by the name of Jean, with whom we were, told me he had gone to bury him.  He was assisted by Nzagamwita's nephew and both of them buried the remains of Kabanda.

Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I'm interested to know the status of your family at this stage, when you are in Nyangingo hill.  Did you still have your family, your wife and your six children?
A.	During that period, they were already dead.  My wife, baby and my eldest son were dead.  There were only four children left and they were living with their grandmother.  I hid them in the bush.  I was desperate, and I told myself that if I died, they would also die and be eaten by dogs.  I couldn't do otherwise.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness, for sharing that information with us.  Did you manage to bury your wife and the two children who were killed? 
A.	I was not able to bury them.  I left with the other men to defend ourselves.
Q.	Do you personally know who killed your wife and your other two children, or the circumstances under which they died? 
A.	I was not able to find out.  I did not find out who killed them, because I arrived when they were already dead.  I buried them.  I was not able to find out who had killed them.
Q.	I'm sorry about that.  Now, in conclusion, we were talking of this man who you referred to as Mika Muhimana, the man who was leading the attack, the man you saw armed with a gun, the man you saw shoot at Assiel Kabanda.  Can you identify Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes.  I can identify him.
Q.	Can you look around the Court and describe where Mika is sitting, what Mika is wearing? 
A.	Yes.  Even if I have problems with my eyes, I can see that he has put on weight.  He's wearing a black jacket, and a skullcap, and a white shirt.  He can see me himself.  If the situation had not arrived there, in any case, gotten to this point, we were all Rwandans.  He is there.  He can see me.  I can see him.  He is there at the back towards the side.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, can the record show that the witness has identified Mika Muhimana?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has pointed out to us the Accused.  He has identified him. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  The last question I want clarification from you is whether you were approached by any investigator who wanted you to make indications in relation to what you've just told the Court. 
A.	Yes.  There was a foreigner who came, and he was conducting investigations.  We showed him the place called Kiziba and then we went to Ngendombi, Igarama and Nyangingo, as well as to Kanyinya.
Q.	Do you know the name of the person whom you are referring to as a foreigner? 
A.	It was a white man.  I do not know his name.

MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, if I can seek your indulgence to ask my colleague from registry, Mr. Issa, if he can show Exhibit -- Prosecution Exhibit 2, specifically page 193 of that exhibit, to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Issa, please show the picture, please. 
THE WITNESS:
It seems to me that even if I do not know his name, on this picture, you can see the person in question.  And we saw each other in Kibuye as well.  Yes.  This is the person in question.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 

I have no further questions for the witness, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Mr. Witness, now you'll be asked questions by the Defence counsel sitting towards your left.  Please understand the questions and answer them very briefly.  Thank you. 

Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	I would like to ask my first question.  Mr. Witness, under what circumstances did you come into contact with the investigators of the Tribunal? 
A.	They found me at home.  This is near the road, near to a built-up area.  They asked us -- they told us, "We have Rwandans who are detained in Arusha.  Anybody who knows what they did in Rwanda should speak up."  And since I had heard that Mika was detained here, I said that I knew what Mika had done.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  During this investigation, did the investigators ask you to tell everything you knew about the events that happened in Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	I told them of the facts that I had witnessed, and you can see the facts.  They were written down.  I do not know whether you have them.
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, I do have them.  Under what circumstances did you know Mika Muhimana?
A.	He was a trader.  I told you that he was a trader.  And a trader is well known by all the persons who go to purchase things from his store, and it was quite close to the market.  And when we had money to buy a bottle of Primus, one went there.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you -- did you also know his family? 
A.	It is not everyone, but I knew -- but I knew his father who was called Manasse Ntamakemwa, and his older brother who was called Aaron (phonetic), and another who was called Maharera (phonetic).  These were two secteurs.  They lived in a different secteur from mine.
Q.	Did you also know his wife? 
A.	I saw in his home a woman, a dark-skinned woman, and I was told that this was his wife.
Q.	Would you also know his ethnic group? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You state, in the only witness statement that you made to the investigators, that you learned of the death of President Habyarimana on the following -- on the following Thursday when you were going to Mubuga; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	The following Thursday, what date was that? 
A.	It was the 7th. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You also state that when you arrived at Mubuga, a Hutu trader called Munyantwari told you that he feared the worst in the coming days because the Inyenzi had killed the father of the nation; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And who was this Munyantwari?
A.	Munyantwari was a Hutu, a Hutu trader, and a friend of mine.
Q.	You said that you were going to Mubuga; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  It was to Mubuga that I was going.
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, what was the distance between your home and your destination in Mubuga? 
A.	There is a distance that can be covered in an hour and a half, an hour and a half of walking.
Q.	On the date of 7th April, was the witness -- I beg your pardon -- were the citizens free to move about? 
A.	In our area, problems had not yet started.  We were still poor.  We didn't even have radio sets.  If I had known how the situation was, I would not have gone to Mubuga.
Q.	What did you notice on the road when you were going to Mubuga? 
A.	Hutus were very sad.  I did not see anything else.  They had not begun to do anything whatsoever.
Q.	Did you have a sense that your road was safe? 
A.	They had not yet started or dared to kill people.  The situation worsened on Friday, and it was on Saturday that the assailants began to launch their attacks.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When your friend Munyantwari told you that he feared the worst in the coming days, what was your response? 
A.	I had nothing to say.  I was saying that I was going to hide him, considering that he was a friend of mine.
Q.	Thank you.  You state, Mr. Witness, that hostilities began on Saturday when you were in church for the normal service of eleven o'clock; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And what date was that? 
A.	This Saturday was the 9th. 
Q.	Thank you.  When you referred to a church, what church is this? 
A.	It is the adventist church.
Q.	And this church was in Mubuga, was it not?
A.	No.  This church was in our cellule, in (by order of the Court the name has been extracted and put under seal).
Q.	What did you do in Mubuga? 
A.	I was going to see this trader to buy coal, and when he said that the situation was critical, I returned home.
Q.	What was the security situation on your way back? 
A.	There was no problem.  The problems had not yet started.
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you locate Musenyi secteur for us? 
A.	Musenyi secteur is adjacent to Gishyita secteur where the communal office was built.  And it is in this secteur that Muhimana was resident.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you were in church, there was a catechist who was leading the prayers.  Who is this catechist? 
A.	We do not call that prayers.  It is actually the pastor, the elder of the church.  He is called Emmanuel Habiyamberi.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that you went out to see what was going on, and you noted that on the opposite hills, houses were burning; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What were these opposite hills? 
A.	Between where we were and Musenyi, there were -- there was Nyarutovu hill.
Q.	I might still ask the questions:  The opposite hills, was there only Nyarutovu, or are there other hills? 
A.	There were no other hills.  It is only Nyarutovu hill that was opposite, that -- it was placed between where we were and Musenyi.
Q.	So the houses that were burning were on Nyarutovu hill?
A.	No.  It was actually houses that were situated in Musenyi.  The assailants had not yet arrived at Nyarutovu.
Q.	Thank you.  And what distance was this hill where you saw houses burning, from you?
A.	But why do you keep asking me questions about distance?  I am only making estimates.  I would not be able to determine this distance with a tape measure.
Q.	You, Mr. Witness, even your estimates might satisfy us.  Is that a way of answering the question?
A.	The distance was about one kilometre.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You state that amongst the attackers, you recognised the communal policeman Rwigimba, who was leading the looting of Tutsi homes; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	At that point in time, when Rwigimba was leading the looting of Tutsi homes, where was that? 
A.	I told you that we went down to approach Kiziba.
Q.	If I understand you correctly, when you saw the policeman Rwigimba, he was in Kiziba. 
A.	Yes.  He was in the company of Mika there in Kiziba.
Q.	I thank you.  You state that Mika was there.
A.	Yes.
Q.	How did he arrive the scene? 
A.	You mean there in Kiziba?  We found him there, and on the road, there was a motorcycle.  There were two persons on board this motorcycle.  There was Mika and another person whom I did not know.  The place was open.  It was along the road. 
Q.	Please try to be more precise.  Did you find Mika amongst the assailants, or did Mika meet you when he was on the motorcycle? 
A.	He came on this motorcycle, and behind him there was another person.  He and Rwigimba directly began to shoot at people.  But beforehand, Rwigimba had started to cause the burning of houses, and they had come back from Tambuheni (phonetic).
Q.	Let us try not to answer several questions at once.  When Mika arrived on the motorcycle, did he meet you? 
A.	Yes.  He met us there.
Q.	Thank you.  Did he come alone with the person who was on his motorcycle, who was accompanying him, or did he come with a crowd of assailants?
A.	He stopped his motorcycle on the road, and he joined the other assailants, and they began to shoot at people.
Q.	I'm sorry, Mr. Witness, but I am going to have to ask a question regarding distance.  When you saw him arrive on his motorcycle, how far was he from the place where you yourself were? 
A.	We were 30 metres away from where they were on the road.  We were facing the assailants.  We were there in Kiziba.
Q.	And between the place where he left the motorcycle and the place where he joined the other assailants, what was the distance? 
A.	If I made an estimate, from the road to the place where the assailants were, I would say it was about 15 metres.
Q.	And between you and the assailants? 
A.	I have told you -- I have already told you, I think that you did take it down.
Q.	You can always repeat an answer, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Did you not note it? 
Q.	I am sorry that I was distracted.  I did not take note. 
A.	Yes.  If you did not take note, I made an estimate of 20 metres.
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you locate Kiziba hill for us?  
A.	That hill is located in Musenyi.
Q.	Why do you state that you approached Kiziba hill?  Why did you approach Kiziba hill? 
A.	We could hear the screams of the people of Musenyi, and we went to see what was going on.
Q.	How did you notice that the policeman Rwigimba was leading the looting of houses?  How did you realise that he -- it is he who was leading the looting of Tutsi homes? 
A.	If he had not used a gun, either -- that is Rwigimba or Muhimana, if they had not used guns, we would not have been frightened.  So we became frightened because of the guns.  Or else the looters would not have been able to carry out their acts without the presence of guns. 
Q.	When Mika came down from his motorcycle, what did he do first? 
A.	He came down from his motorcycle.  He had a long gun.  And when he arrived close to Rwigimba and other assailants, they began to shoot at us.
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you talk to us about Mika's weapons? 
A.	I told you that he was armed with a gun. 
Q.	That is the only weapon that you saw? 
A.	Subsequently, we noted that he had a grenade when he took it off from his belt, when he arrived at Ngendombi.
Q.	Who shot at Rwakayiro?
A.	It is Rwigimba who shot at us.
Q.	And who shot Rwakayiro, and who was Rwakayiro?
A.	He was a Tutsi like us, and he was with us.
Q.	When Rwigimba shot at Rwakayiro, what hill was this on?
A.	We were in Kiziba.
Q.	I do not know whether I did not understand you correctly, but a while ago, before this Court, you did state that it was on Ngendombi.
A.	No.  Rwakayiro fell in Kiziba.  I am referring to Assiel Rwakayiro.  You should also look at my written statement.  I stated this to the investigators who came to question me.
Q.	While Rwigimba was shooting at Rwakayiro, what were you doing?
A.	We were throwing stones at them, to prevent them to kill us all.  We had realised that the situation was dangerous.  The assailants were beginning to burn houses.  And we were trying to prevent them from attacking our village.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, you state that the assailants began to chase you, and when you arrived at Ngendombi hill, they threw a grenade at the fugitives; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  We were running away when we arrived at Ngendombi, where we found stones.  When we realised that the assailants were going to reach our village, we stopped to defend ourselves, and it is this time that they shot at Musherefu and threw a grenade that hit the two other people, that is Camille and the other person.  I think that I have given you all of these details.
Q.	Let's take it easy, Mr. Witness.  From Kiziba to Ngendombi, what is the distance? 
A.	I am trying to give you an estimate.  Let's say half a kilometre.
Q.	At what time did you arrive at Ngendombi? 
A.	I think it was about 1 p.m.
Q.	Thank you.  In the chase that the attackers launched against you, you realised that a grenade had been thrown at you; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  I had previously wanted -- I previously explained this to you, and I gave you the names of those who were wounded by that grenade.
Q.	Well, we will get there, Mr. Witness.  Was it the only weapon used? 
A.	At Ngendombi, I said that Musherefu was shot at and Muhimana was carrying a gun and also had on him grenades.  I think that I explained this to you, and I think that you took that down.
Q.	On the day -- on the day on which you were chased, you didn't talk about another weapon.  It's, rather, on the next day.
A.	No.  It is on the same day that that took place.  That was on the 9th.  I think I was referring to another area where we stopped and later tried to fend off the assailants, after having crossed Nyarutovu.
Q.	On what date did you find Camille's body ?
A.	It was on the 9th. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, sometimes we need clarifications.  In your statement you said the following.  When you reached another hill, called Ngendombi, he threw a grenade on those who were fleeing.  And this was the 9th.  And it is -- you said it was on the next day that you discovered the corpse of Camille, who was amongst those who were fleeing; is that correct? 
A.	It is on that day, after the assailants had retreated in the evening, that we went to see those who had died, and we buried the dead, because the casualties weren't high, or there weren't very many victims at that time.
Q.	Thank you.  Where exactly was this corpse?
A.	The corpses were at Ngendombi.
Q.	And Camille, did you know him?
A.	He used to reside at Musenyi, not far from the Kiziba centre.  We knew his first name.  We called him Camille, and when we met him on the road, people called him Camille.
Q.	In your written statement, you state that it is the next day that you found Camille's body.  My question doesn't have to do with the date but on "you."  You said "you," "you" who found Camille's body.  Who are "you"? 
A.	I'm referring to myself and all those who were with me when we were trying to flee, when the assailants were chasing us at Kiziba.
Q.	I think, Mr. Witness, that we are far from Kiziba already.  We are now at Ngendombi.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	When the grenade was thrown at you, which direction did you take? 
A.	We left Kiziba, and when we reached Ngendombi, we found stones, and it was with those stones that we defended ourselves in a bid to fend off the assailants.  And it was at that point that Muhimana threw the grenade, and he fired at Musherefu who had tried to flee.  We had to go and bring out our children and wives to head for the Muyira hill.  I think you took note of that.
Q.	The direction you took after the grenade was thrown at you, was it -- were you heading for your homes? 
A.	Yes.  We were going back to our homes in order to evacuate our women and children, in order to meet at Muyira.
Q.	Thank you.  You also assert that Camille had been torn apart and that you can tell the difference between grenade wounds and gun wounds; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And how did you gain your expertise? 
A.	When you see a deep wound that was cut by a machete, you can tell it, but if you see something like a hole and if there are, you know, portions of your body that have been taken out, I think you can always tell the difference between the weapons used.
Q.	You said Camille's body was at -- you said Camille used to reside at Izaza (phonetic)?
A.	No.  He used to reside at Musenyi.  I used to reside at (by order of the Court the name has been extracted and put under seal).  They were not my neighbours.
Q.	At least you said so this morning, in this courtroom. 
A.	No, Camille used to reside at Musenyi, and I myself at (by order of the Court the name has been extracted and put under seal).  I don't think I said what you are asserting.
Q.	For once that I -- I noted things down.  Apparently, that is not what you said.  Now, we'll proceed in any case.  You state that you recognised a certain **************.  Was that person your neighbour?
A.	Yes.  He was my neighbour.  He resided at (by order of the Court the name has been extracted and put under seal) cellule, but before the war, that cellule used to be called (by order of the Court the name has been extracted and put under seal) and it was situated in the Gisovu commune.
Q.	Thank you. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, perhaps I can just indicate that at this time the witness is revealing the cellule.  If that information can just be expunged from the record or kept under seal? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The protected information disclosed by the witness will be kept under seal. 
And Mr. Witness, we may remind you that you are a protected witness.  Please don't disclose the name of your cellule, place of residence or any other information which may lead to identify you.  Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, after the grenade was thrown, you headed for your homes.  At the same time, you say that Ndahimana, who was hit by that grenade, was later on finished off by the assailants; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How did you know that he was later finished off?
A.	When we were standing there, after he had been hit by the grenade, when we were at Ngendombi, we could see the assailants finishing off where he had fallen.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, let's stick to the throwing of the grenade.  When we read your statement, you state that the assailants chased you and threw a grenade at you.  But before the Honourable Judges, you are more categorical.  You said that it's Mika who threw the grenade.  How did you obtain that additional information? 
A.	Rather, I do not know why the investigators did not commit that to paper.  I told them I was on the spot.  It is not information that a third party brought to me.  It's something at which I was eye-witness.
Q.	When the grenade was being thrown, you were looking at the person throwing the grenade? 
A.	I could see him.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You state that the other refugee called Musherefu was killed by a bullet shot by Mika; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Can you be a little clearer as to the time? 
A.	I told you that that happened on the 9th. 
Q.	Was it during the day, at night, at about what time was it?
A.	I told you that it was about 1 p.m., and immediately thereafter, the assailants retreated.
Q.	And you were seeing with your own eyes the person who fired?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	You also declare or state, Mr. Witness, that that was the first attack that Mika and Rwigimba were launching; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	When you say first attack, are you referring to Ngendombi or to Kiziba? 
A.	I explained to you that on that day, the assailants, starting from Kiziba, killed people there.  We fled towards Ngendombi.  And it is there that we stopped and the people were also killed there.  It was on the same day, and it was a Saturday.
Q.	Thank you.  Were you aware of other subsequent attacks led by those two men?
A.	Yes.  I explained to you that I saw Muhimana again at Igarama when he was torturing those young ladies.
Q.	My question, Mr. Witness:  Did you see on another occasion those two men leading an attack? 
A.	I never saw them again together, but on other occasions, I saw this man, Muhimana, once again.  I never saw Rwigimba again.  Probably he had been assigned to another locality where I wasn't.
Q.	Now, before going further, Mr. Witness, who is Musherefu?
A.	Musherefu was a Tutsi like us.
Q.	And what was his occupation?
A.	He was a farmer/stock breeder.
Q.	At what distance were you from him when he was shot down?
A.	The distance was about one and a half metres.  I mean, there was a metre between him and myself.
Q.	And what was the distance between you and Muhimana?
A.	I have explained to you that he was at about 15 metres, but that is only an estimate.  We didn't have any measuring tape or instruments that we measured the distance with.
Q.	How much time did it take you to go from Ngendombi hill to Muyira? 
A.	When you are fleeing, you don't count the minutes or the hours.  You just flee.
Q.	Well, the flight had ended for quite a while.  What time did it take you to leave from Ngendombi to Muyira hill?
A.	If I can estimate the distance in kilometres, I would say there is a distance of about one kilometre between those two hills but that's only an estimate.
Q.	Thank you for that estimate.  On what date did you arrive at Muyira, Mr. Witness? 
A.	We reached Muyira in the evening of the 9th. 
Q.	And what is the distance between Muyira and Kigarama?
A.	Well, it is not Kigarama but Igarama.  Between Muyira and Igarama, if you want to know the distance, I have told you that it's a distance that you can use 15 minutes of tracking to move from one location to the other.
Q.	Thank you for the clarifying that it was Igarama and not Kigarama.  For how long did you stay at Muyira? 
A.	We remained at Muyira for a number of days, and I can't give you the exact number because, for the whole three-month period, when we were the target of attacks, we couldn't remain on one spot.  But, generally, we stayed at Muyira, and when we realised that the gunfires were too much, we would leave Muyira to move to other hills, and on our route, while we were fleeing, some people were hit but the others continued.
Q.	Thank you.  You say, Mr. Witness, that in the month of May 1994, you were hiding in bush in the Gitwa, Igarama cellule with your three-year-old son and that you heard the noise made by the engines of vehicles and that the drivers had parked the vehicles at Kanyinya, at about one kilometre from your hiding place; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Can you confirm that you heard a car parking one kilometre from where you were?
A.	Yes, I heard the noise of an engine that was stopped, and I saw people come down from a hill.
Q.	You want to say that you saw them come down from a distance of one kilometre? 
A.	They were quite near the Igarama valley, but I heard them park the car at Kanyinya.
Q.	And you thought you knew who owned the car?
A.	I couldn't identify the owner of the car.  I heard the car being parked, and immediately thereafter I saw people come down, and I concluded that it was from that car that they were coming because that is how attacks usually took place.  Interahamwes used to come on board vehicles and alighted from those vehicles to start attacking people.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that you saw Mika in the midst of the attackers, including Sandayiheba and Kambanda and that they captured a little girl in the small wood; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Who is Sandayiheba?
A.	Sandayiheba is a Hutu who was part of the assailants who were killing Tutsis. 
Q.	How did you know him, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I used to know him well before.
Q.	Where did he used to reside?
A.	He used to reside at the Bisobo locality.
Q.	And who is Kambanda?
A.	He was also a Hutu.
Q.	Where did he used to reside?
A.	He was Sandayiheba's neighbour in the Bisobo locality.
Q.	The little girl you mentioned, Mr. Witness, was she captured on the spot? 
A.	Yes.  She was captured at Igarama.  She was discovered in a hole where she was hiding in a eucalyptus wood, and she went and hid there with women, and when the assailants flushed her out, she went and showed where the women were hiding.
Q.	When the young girl was flushed out, did you see that yourself, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes.  I was a witness to that.  I was seeing them.
Q.	Well, what was the distance therefore between you and where the little girl was hiding?
A.	I have told you that I was at about 50 metres.
Q.	You were in your hiding place 50 metres away?
A.	Yes.  50 metres from my hiding place, and the place where those young -- those ladies were discovered.
Q.	From your hiding place, could you see outside the hiding place? 
A.	Yes.  They were facing me.  It is true that there was grass in front of me but through the grass I could identify those persons.
Q.	Does this mean visibility was good? 
A.	I was hiding, and I was expecting to be flushed out and killed.
Q.	You talk about the little girl that was harassed by the assailants.  How was she harassed? 
A.	I saw the assailants talking to her brutally, by frightening her and asking her to go and tell them where other people were hiding. 
Q.	Did you know the little girl before? 
A.	Yes.  I knew her. 
Q.	What was her name?
A.	She was called Maribori, but it would appear that that was an alias or a pseudonym, not quite her name, a nickname, as it were.
Q.	From where was she?
A.	She was a native of our cellule.
Q.	Did you know her parents?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Before she was captured, did you know her hiding place?
A.	No.  I didn't quite know where she was.  But I know that on that particular day, she sought refuge in that hiding place.
Q.	You say that after that little girl had been harassed, she led the attackers towards her hiding place from where they got out with a young lady called Therese Mukabitega, wife of (by order of the Court the name has been extracted and put under seal); is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.

Mr. Witness, don't speak out the name in the mike.  Mr. Witness, how is this name related to you?  Could you please tell the relationship to the interpreter?  

And, Mr. Interpreter, please write it down on the piece of paper.  We believe that this relationship has been disclosed in the examination-in-chief.  If it is so disclosed, please expunge from the record and keep it under seal. 

Please show it to the court reporter; and to the English Court reporter.  Mr. Issa, show it to Professor Songa.  

Professor, you may proceed now. 
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you state that Mukabitega was surrounded by Interahamwe, and that they were so numerous that from your hideout you could not see what happened to that woman; is that correct? 
A.	I have explained to you that after the Interahamwe left, I came out of my hideout and I realised that she had been brutally killed.  However, they had surrounded that woman in such a manner that I did not see what they did to her.
Q.	Thank you.  But when you state to the Chamber, as you did this morning, that the assailants first raped her, you are asserting what you did not see with your own eyes?
A.	I have stated to you that the assailants surrounded her, and I said that she was raped because her skirt was torn and a stick was thrust into her genitals, and those assailants were accustomed to raping women before killing them.
Q.	Let me repeat my question; last time.  When you asserted to the Chamber that she was raped, you were asserting a fact you did not witness with your own eyes; isn't that the case?
A.	I stated to you that she was raped.  So, considering the fact that she was a woman, they must have raped her.
Q.	I said that I was putting that question to you for the last time.  We shall proceed and take it that you did not see the events with your own eyes.  

You also stated, Witness, that the same little girl took the assailants to another hideout from which they brought out a woman known as Mukalibanje, Berthe; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you also state that they took Mrs. Berthe to a valley situated at a distance of 60 metres from the hideout; is that correct?
A.	That is correct; but that is still an estimate, I did not measure the distance.  I may be wrong in making such estimates. 
Q.	We all err when we make estimates of distances, so we can understand.  

We will go on to say, Witness, that you did not witness what happened to Berthe because of the trees that blocked your view; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	That blocked view was still from your hideout; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I was still in my hideout.  But when the assailants surrounded a victim, I could see part of what they were doing through the bush.  I was able to see some of the assailants, but when the assailants surrounded the victim, I could not see what they were doing to her.
Q.	I believe, Witness, that we understand you very well.  

Witness, you have made mention of a certain Segasagara.  I believe that in your statement --
MR. SONGA:
I will ask Madam President and the Tribunal to take all the necessary precautions because that name sounds like that of a protected witness.  So I would like to withdraw that question, since I would be running the risk of giving a name that would endanger the safety of the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, is this name a protected name?
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, from the list of the protected names we have, it doesn't form part of it, unless maybe it was a mistake.  But when we went through the details with the witness, we did not get the view that it was a protected witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, it is not a protected witness.  It is not a protected name. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, maybe we could dwell on this aspect because in the written statement it is stated that that is the witness's junior brother.  That is why I refrain from putting further questions to the witness regarding that name.  I am referring to page 4 of the witness statement, up to the end, because therein it is stated that it was his junior brother. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, it doesn't.  The English version does not discriminate (sic) that person as the witness's younger brother.  It goes like this:  "I buried three bodies following the help of my late young brother and an old man named Segasagara."
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Your Honour.  I made a mix-up between the two persons who assisted the witness, so Segasagara is not a protected person.  

So, with your leave, Madam President, I will put one or two questions to the witness regarding Segasagara.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Who was Segasagara?
A.	Segasagara was Tutsi.
Q.	How did you know him, Witness?
A.	He was my neighbour.
Q.	When you say "neighbour," do you mean he was your neighbour in the cellule or the secteur, or your houses were neighbouring houses?
A.	We lived in the same secteur, and we knew one another.  He assisted me in burying those bodies. 
Q.	Were you with him in your hideout?
A.	No, that happened the following day.  I asked him to assist me.
Q.	And where was he hiding during those events?
A.	I do not know where he was hiding.
Q.	After assisting you, did you part company immediately thereafter?
A.	Yes, we went back to join the other refugees who were not yet dead.
Q.	And what did he do?
A.	I do not know what else he did, apart from assisting me in burying the three victims.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that you were on Gitwa hill with Nzamwita, Nzakamwita, Rutabana and Nduwamungu, Alexis; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  We were also with Assiel Kabanda.
Q.	And who is Nzamwita?
A.	He is a Tutsi.
Q.	What was he doing?
A.	He was a farmer.
Q.	How did you know him, Witness?
A.	We used to live in the same secteur.
Q.	Did you know whether he was with his family at that time?
A.	No, I am not aware of that.
Q.	You never talked about that, Witness?
A.	We did not have time to talk about such matters because in a situation in which you are hiding, you wouldn't have time to talk about such matters.
Q.	And who is Nzakamwita?
A.	He was also a Tutsi, a Tutsi fugitive like myself. 
Q.	Did you know him while you were hiding or before then?
A.	He was also my neighbour in the same cellule.
Q.	Can you talk about Rutabana?
A.	He was also my neighbour, the same secteur.
Q.	And Nduwamungu? 
A.	Nduwamungu used to live in Gitabura secteur.  Regarding the manner in which we got to know one another, we got to know one another in hiding because he was also pursued, like myself.
Q.	Could you please tell us about Kabanda, Assiel? 
A.	I had known Kabanda well before.  He was a trader and we met in our hideout.
Q.	Witness, you spoke about your flight after you were flushed out around 10:00 a.m. during an attack led by Mika and his men?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What exactly did Mika do which made you say that he was one leading that attack?
A.	Ordinarily, when the assailants were not with someone who was armed with a gun, they could not kill us because we resisted the attacks with stones; but he was carrying a gun and encouraging them to come and kill us.
Q.	If I understand your answer correctly, he was leading the attack by virtue of the fact that he had a gun?
A.	Yes, he was carrying a gun, and it was with the aid of that gun that the assailants could kill us easily.  When he shot at us, the Interahamwe were encouraged to also attack us because you cannot fight against someone who has a gun, whereas all you have in terms of arms is stones.
Q.	Witness, did you see many people carrying guns?
A.	On that day, only two people were carrying guns, namely, Muhimana, and another man who was dark in complexion and whose name I do not know.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that on that day you ran in the direction of Uwingabo.  When you state that you ran, who were the people running with you in the direction of Uwingabo?
A.	The same people I mentioned to you, namely, Assiel Kabanda, Rutabana, Nzamwita, Nzakamwita, and Alexis Nduwamungu. 
Q.	So, in all, if I understood correctly, it makes six people?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you get to Uwingabo?
A.	Yes, we arrived there, and from there we left again to go to Nyangingo hill, and we hid in a pine forest.
Q.	Between Gitwa hill and Uwingabo hill, can you please give us an estimate of the distance?
A.	These are two neighbouring cellules.  It's only the boundary between the two cellules.
Q.	What happened on Uwingabo hill?
A.	I have told you of an attack that was led by Mika.  The assailants flushed us out of that pine forest.  We tried to resist that attack, and in the course of that attack, Nzakamwita was shot at, as well as Assiel Kabanda and Nduwamungu and Nzamwita.  Rutabana and myself hid in a hole from which cassiterite had been extracted.  
Q.	I asked you, Witness, what happened on Uwingabo hill.
A.	As a matter of fact, it is Uwingabo cellule and Ruyingingo is located in that cellule.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  One of your companions fell, Nduwamungu, and after he fell, you continued fleeing; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  We threw stones at them, and after Nduwamungu, Nzakamwita and Kabanda fell, we fled and went into hiding. 
Q.	You state that as you were fleeing, you were throwing stones?
A.	Yes.  We first of all tried to defend ourselves when we saw them returning, but as soon as our companions fell, we fled.
Q.	While fleeing where did you arrive; where did you intend to arrive exactly?
A.	On that hill on which Kabanda was decapitated and Nzakamwita was undressed, we went to hide in that hole, and we survived that attack.
Q.	While fleeing, Witness, were you looking in front of you or behind?
A.	After those people were killed, we fled, Rutabana, myself and other survivors, namely Nzamwita.  I don't know where they hid.  We never saw one another again.  Rutabana and myself hid in that hole from which cassiterite had been extracted.
Q.	Witness, when Nzakamwita and Kabanda were hit by the bullets, were you fleeing or throwing stones?
A.	They were shot at while we were throwing stones at them.
Q.	So you were looking ahead of you?
A.	Yes, we were face to face.  They were firing at us and we were throwing stones at them.
Q.	So why do you say, Witness, that you returned and that was when you realised that it was Nzakamwita and Kabanda?  Why did you have to return, whereas you were throwing stones at your assailants while looking at them?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So, did you see that with your own eyes when Kabanda, Nzakamwita -- when Kabanda and Nzakamwita were hit by the bullets?
A.	Yes, I saw that with my own eyes.
Q.	You state, Witness, that you hid in a hole with your last companion.  What hole are you referring to?
A.	It is a hole from which cassiterite had been extracted, that is where we hid.
Q.	Tell us who fired at Nzakamwita.  
A.	The person who shot at Nzakamwita was on the same side with Muhimana, and that was the person who fired at him.
Q.	And who shot Kabanda? 
A.	Mika Muhimana; he was on the same side where Kabanda was.
Q.	You said that you stayed in that hole.  For how long were you there?
A.	We were not wearing watches, but I believe we got there at about 5:00 p.m., and after the gunfire had ceased, we went back to find out what had happened, how those people were killed.  I believe I explained that amply. 
Q.	Who decapitated Kabanda?
A.	Mika shot at him, and I believe the person who decapitated him must be somebody who has been -- who was armed with a machete, but I didn't see that person.  When he was shot at, we fled.  So I would say the person who cut off his head must have been the person carrying the gun (sic).
Q.	You are going beyond the scope of my question, Witness.  My question to you was:  Who cut off Kabanda's head.  Thank you for the answer in any case. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness answered. 
MR. SONGA:
That is why I am thanking him, Your Honour.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, who cut off Kabanda's genitals?
A.	You would understand that the person who shot at him, that is, Mika Muhimana, is the person who allowed the others to attack him, so he used the others.  So I was not able to find out whether it was Mika himself who cut off Kabanda's genitals or whether it was Mika who cut off his head.
Q.	You know nothing regarding this point; isn't it?
A.	I know nothing about that.  I did not see Mika bending to cut off the victim's head.  What I saw was that he shot at the victim and he fell.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How did you end your day?
A.	Rutabana and I left this place, and we found Kabanda with his head cut off and his genitals cut off; Nzakamwita had a torn jacket.  This was in the evening.  So we went back, and I never went back there.
Q.	Please be precise, Witness.  Where did you return to?
A.	We went to Muyira because that is where we used to gather so that if the assailants came, we would face them.
Q.	And what date was this when you returned to Muyira.  
A.	We were confused.  We had no sense of time because, you see, this was not a time for work or celebration. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you returned to Muyira, how long did you stay there?
A.	We stayed there until the killers stopped killing, when they fled.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my cross-examination.  I would like to thank the witness for his availability.  I would like to thank Madam President and Your Honours for your patience.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, professor.  

Yes, Madam Prosecutor, any re-examination? 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President, I have no re-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.

Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  Thank you for assisting the Court with your testimony.  We wish a very safe journey home.  

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness to the exit.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, who is your next witness?
MS. MADENGA: 
Madam President, the next Prosecution witness is Witness BU.  

We are ready with Witness BU, but if we can just take a short break.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will take a short break for 15 minutes. 

MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.
(Court recessed at 1210H)
(Pages 25 to 32 by Judith Baverstock)


































(Court resumed at 1305H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed.  We resumed late because we were informed that the witness was having lunch.

Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
I observe that my client is absent.  He wanted to take a bite and he's surprised by the fact that we are beginning now.  Could we inform him that Court has started?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please

Professor, your client is having food in the adjacent room.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He needs energy.
MR. SONGA:
I am lost, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are telling you that your client is having food in the next room.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And I said he needs the energy.
MR. SONGA:
The (indecipherable) as he is not well.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, that's why he needs the energy.
MR. SONGA:
Right.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can we start?  Professor, can we continue? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, maybe we should give him five minutes to enable him to finish his lunch quickly.  He should be through in a minute or two. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this is what happens when you disturb the Court schedule. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, my learned friend has a couple of outstanding motions.  Two of them I believe we have responded to; one of them we intend to deal with orally.  I have spoken to him.  Maybe he wants to deal with the matter now.  It's regarding the postponement of the trial.  We might as well take this break to deal with that and make our representations on the record and the matter goes into deliberation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have not received the motion yet.  I, personally, myself, have not received any motion yet.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I have received a copy in French, and my French is not good enough to understand it.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is why I say maybe we can argue the motion orally, since we have the time.  Then you get the translation immediately and we make our representations and the matter is dealt with, rather than wait until the translations are through.  I haven't read it in English either, but I know what it's about.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And we don't know what it's about.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If he wishes to convert it into an open oral motion, then we can take the time, but perhaps with your witness sitting here, it will probably be better to deal with the witness and get on, because the time available, in any event, wouldn't be enough for representations on both sides if we are going to have the witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness and we are sitting in open session, so please avoid mentioning your name, the name of your residence, cellule, or any other information that may lead to your identification.  

You will take a solemn declaration to speak the truth.  

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness.  
(Declaration made by Witness BU in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we may remind you that you are not called by your name in these proceedings.  You will therefore be referred to as Witness BU.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor for examination-in-chief. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Grateful, Your Honours.  
WITNESS BU,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution.
Q.	Mr. Witness, the registry would have placed before you a piece of paper.  Do you have one there?  You should have.  Do you have it?
A.	Yes, I can see the document in front of me.
Q.	Do you recall that I asked my assistant to go through that document with you this morning, following which you signed that document confirming that the information contained therein is indeed correct and refers to you?  Do you recall that happening?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Do you confirm that that is your signature at the bottom of that document, sir?
A.	Yes, that is my signature.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, can I seek to enter this as a Prosecution exhibit, under seal?  I'm not sure what number we are on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is entered and admitted as Exhibit P. 16, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 16 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did you hear about the president's death?
A.	I heard about the president's death on 7th April 1994.
Q.	Did you remain at your home, having heard about the president's death on 7 April 1994?
A.	No.  I instead sought refuge in Bisesero.
Q.	Do you recall, Mr. Witness, when you arrived at Bisesero?
A.	I arrived in Bisesero on the 9th.
Q.	Can you tell the Court whether or not you had gone to Bisesero alone or you had gone there with other members of your family?
A.	I went there with many members of my family.
Q.	Having arrived at Bisesero on the 9th April, Mr. Witness, can you tell the Court whether or not you found other people there on that day?
A.	Yes, I found many other people there.
Q.	Can you tell me who these people were and what they were doing in the area of Bisesero when you arrived there on the 9th April 1994?
A.	Those people were Tutsis who had sought refuge in Bisesero.  They had come from everywhere.
Q.	How long did you remain at Bisesero for, Mr. Witness?
A.	I remained there from April up to the time when the French arrived and took us from there to Gitarama.
Q.	During your stay at Bisesero, Mr. Witness, did you witness attacks on Tutsi civilians in that location?
A.	I witnessed many attacks.
Q.	How often were the attacks launched at the area of Bisesero?  Can you recall that?  Were they launched every month, every week, every day?  Can you help me with that, please?
A.	There were attacks every day.
Q.	Were you ever able to establish those who led the attacks that you witnessed every day at Bisesero, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, when those attacks started, we were in Musasa cellule, and amongst the assailants was Sikubwabo, Charles; Rutaganira, Vincent; Mika; Ruzindana, and all the conseillers of secteurs in Gishyita commune.
Q.	I want to talk to you about the person you referred to amongst those leaders as Mika; do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I understand.
Q.	Did Mika have another name, a family name?
A.	I knew his name was Mika.  As a matter of fact, that is the name I knew a lot more than the other, which I do not know.
Q.	Had you known Mika before you sought refuge at Bisesero on the 9th April?
A.	I had known him well before then.
Q.	How did you know him, Mr. Witness?
A.	I knew him as conseiller of Gishyita secteur.  Every Tuesday I passed through Gishyita to go and take part in the activities of the communal dance group in Bugina.
Q.	How long had you known him before April 1994?  How long?  One month, one year -- that sort of thing.  One week?
A.	I had known him for a long time.  I do not know from what date I knew him, but I knew him for a very long time.  While he was conseiller, I knew him.  I also knew him when he was a trader in Gishyita.  It is true that I did not go to Gishyita every day, but he is someone that I knew very well.
Q.	Thank you for that, Witness, but I also wondered if you could help us in terms of the length of the period.  Perhaps you could recall whether you had known him for just one week, one month, a few years.  Can you estimate how long, if you can, please?
A.	In any case, I had known him for about four years, but that is only an estimate I am giving.  I did not pay attention to the date on which I started to know him, but if you go by my age, you would understand that I knew him.
Q.	Can you describe what Mika looked like in April 1994?
A.	He was fair in complexion.
Q.	Can you say whether he was tall or short, fat or thin, that sort of thing?  Can you help us with that?
A.	He was tall.  He was not fat, nor was he small.  He had an average height.
Q.	The men you referred to as Ruzindana and Sikubwabo -- start with Sikubwabo.  Do you know what or who Sikubwabo was?
A.	Sikubwabo was the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune.
Q.	What about Ruzindana?
A.	Ruzindana lived in Mugonero.  I saw him often on board a vehicle.  I knew he was a trader.  He was resident in Mugonero while we lived in Musenyi.
Q.	Do you recall, Mr. Witness, providing investigators from my office with a statement regarding what you saw at Bisesero in 1994?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	In that statement you describe witnessing several attacks in Bisesero.  Do you recall whether or not you told those investigators that you saw Mika in any of those attacks?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	I want to talk to you about what you saw Mika do, according to your statement.  Now, when was it that you saw Mika at Bisesero?
A.	From the month of April to the moment when the war stopped, he always came to participate in the attacks, but I saw him very closely once at Muyira, but he participated in every attack that was launched against Bisesero.
Q.	When was it that you saw him very closely at Muyira in terms of the date, do you recall, Mr. Witness?
A.	I no longer remember the exact dates, but it was in the month of May.
Q.	What exactly is Muyira, Mr. Witness?  What is Muyira and where is Muyira?
A.	Muyira is a hill that is found in Bisesero.
Q.	When you saw Mika at Muyira in May, did you see him alone?
A.	He was accompanied by many Interahamwe.
Q.	What did you see Mika do when you saw him at Bisesero in May, Mr. Witness?
A.	I could see him leading an attack, carrying a gun.  He came with his assailants to participate in the massacres.
Q.	Could you tell me what exactly he did or what exactly you saw him do when you saw him?
A.	I saw him when he was carrying out fairly heinous acts, and at that particular time he was raping a young woman who was a teacher.
Q.	Do you recall, Mr. Witness, the name of the young woman who you refer to as a teacher?
A.	I remember the name.
Q.	Can you tell us, please?
A.	She was called Josephine Uwamaliya, U-W-A-M-A-L-I-Y-A.  Uwamaliya.
Q.	Had you known Josephine before you saw her on Muyira hill on this day?  Had you known her before, Mr. Witness?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has given the relationship between himself and the lady, and this might identify the witness. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Just a yes or no answer will do, Mr. Witness.  Don't give me a relationship.  Just tell me whether yes or no?
A.	There is no problem.  Even if I'm identified, this young lady was (by Order of the Court the words have been extracted and put under seal).  She had just ended her studies and had begun to teach.  It was a young lady that I saw when she was born and whom I saw when she died.
Q.	Mr. Witness, what ethnic group did Josephine belong to?
A.	Josephine was Tutsi.
Q.	Do you know how old she was in 1994, sir?
A.	I no longer remember her age, but in any case, I know that she was born in 1971.  You can calculate to determine what age she had in 1994.
Q.	What were you able to observe Mika do to Josephine in May 1994, sir?
A.	He raped her.  In fact, he first forced her to have sexual relations with him, and afterwards she was killed.
Q.	Can you tell me where this incident occurred?
A.	This happened in Bisesero on Muyira hill.
Q.	Can you tell me what time of the day this incident occurred?
A.	Look, it was in the afternoon, but I was not wearing a watch, so I could not know the exact time, but it was in the afternoon.
Q.	Where were you located, Mr. Witness, when you witnessed Mika raping Josephine?
A.	I was hidden in a bush.
Q.	How far away was that from where Josephine and Mika were located?
A.	There was a little distance between me and the place where they were.  I did not have any instrument of measurement, but I would say they were about ten metres away from me.  But it's not at this place that Mika raped her.  He dragged her to about 20 metres away, but this is an estimate that I'm giving you.  You understand, if somebody is hiding, he cannot start measuring distances, and in order to see what was going on, I used to raise my eyes and look.  I would look a little, and then I would hide because this was something that caused shame.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know how Mika had come into contact with Josephine on that occasion?
A.	He flushed her out from the place where she was hiding, and then at that time Mika was with his Interahamwe.
Q.	Having flushed her out, what then happened?
A.	What followed, he raped her, and afterwards he killed her.
Q.	Let me talk to you a little bit more about what you have described as rape.  Now, Mr. Witness, I'm going to need you to testify in a little bit more detail about what you may have observed happening to Josephine.  Let me ask you this question.  Before Mika raped Josephine, did he say anything to her, do you know?
A.	They caught Josephine.  She begged them not to kill her, and Mika said, "Give me time to see this young lady first, this first lady who is so haughty," and Mika asked the young lady to undress.  She refused.  Mika pushed her to the ground and climbed upon her.
Q.	Did she still have her clothes on, Mr. Witness, when Mika climbed on her?
A.	No, she had already been undressed because Mika could not rape her when she was wearing her clothes.  She had already been undressed, had already been divested of all her clothing except for a shirt that she was wearing.
Q.	Were you able to see who had undressed her or whether she had undressed herself?
A.	She was undressed because she had been asked to undress and she refused, and Mika was with other people who undressed this lady.  While she was being undressed she was screaming, and afterwards I saw the rest the group move aside, and Mika stayed with this girl, this lady.  I raised my head to see, and then I lowered my head.  Mika had acquired an extraordinary reputation.  I did not want him to see me because I was scared and I was traumatised.  I just raised my head to see what was going on and then I lowered my head.  I was afraid.  But in any case, I saw Mika quite clearly.

	1345H
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: (continuing)
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall how Josephine was dressed on that occasion? 
A.	She was wearing a pair of trousers. 
Q.	Do you recall how Mika was dressed on that occasion? 
A.	I remember that he was wearing overalls. 
Q.	Now, you testified that you saw that Josephine was undressed.  Do you know if Mika undressed as well?
A.	I saw Mika unzip his fly and after climbing onto the young lady's body, I became frightened.  I began to tremble and I did not continue to see what was going on because I was telling myself that after this young lady, I would be the one to be killed next, since the young lady was hiding quite close to my hiding place and she had been flushed out.  And while the assailants were busy with what they were doing to her, I began to shake and then by chance, I saw them leave the place. 
Q.	Do you know how long Mika spent with Josephine on that day? 
A.	Look, I did not actually count the minutes but I think that he stayed four or five minutes.  This is an estimate, I cannot be categorical about it but I think that he stayed on her for four to five minutes. 
Q.	After those four to five minutes, were you able to see what Mika did next? 
A.	He abandoned her in that place in the hands of the Interahamwe and the Interahamwe cut off her legs and arms and other Interahamwe finished her off later, but this group left her with her arms and legs cut off.  She was not completely dead; she actually died a slow death. 
Q.	So, Witness, you testified earlier that you often raised your head and put your head down again in this bush that you were located.  Can I ask you, did anything obstruct your view of Mika on this day? 
A.	I could see him.  If I had continued to look at him, I would have seen him all the time, but at certain times I used to lower my head so that he shouldn't see me.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you saw -- if I asked you to look around the courtroom, do you think you will be able to see if you could recognise Mika, today? 
A.	I have already seen him.  Since I came in here, I saw him. 
Q.	Very well.  Can you then show me where he is located, then? 
A.	Yes, he is there.
Q.	What he is wearing?
A.	He is wearing a jacket and shirt and a Moslem skull cap, but since when did he become a Moslem?
Q.	Can you point in the direction which you think or you see Mika located in the courtroom, please?
A.	There he is, he is on that side.  He is wearing a white shirt, a jacket and a little Moslem cap. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, may the record reflect that the witness has positively identified Mika as being present in the room.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has identified the Accused. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I ask you, you mentioned earlier that you had seen Mika with Sikubwabo and Ruzindana.  Did you know if Sikubwabo and Ruzindana were present when Josephine was raped? 
A.	I did not see Ruzindana at that place.  Instead, I saw him during the first attacks and other occasions, but when this young lady was raped, I did not see Ruzindana.
Q.	What about Sikubwabo, did you see him when this young lady was raped? 
A.	I did see Sikubwabo.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I have no further questions for this witness.  Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.  

Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by counsel for Mika, the Accused.  You must understand the questions and then answer them briefly.  

Professor, you have the floor for cross-examination.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA.
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my first question is whether you were in contact with the investigator of the Tribunal? 
A.	I met with them. 
Q.	Under what circumstances did you meet with them? 
A.	I saw them come to my home and ask me questions about the events in Bisesero and I gave them explanations.
Q.	(Question not interpreted)
A.	I no longer remember on what date they asked me questions. 
Q.	Do you remember your interview with the Prosecutor's investigators on the 29th of January 2000, for example? 
A.	It is possible that I did meet them on that date, but I did not pay attention.  I do not remember the date.  I met them and quite a while afterwards they came back to see me.  It is possible that you are right. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In any case, may we take it that you only had one interview with the investigators? 
A.	I think I met with them once or twice. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I would like to ask a question regarding the precision of the dates.  When I read your statement which is in our possession, one would understand that you arrived in Bisesero on the 8th of April, instead, but today, you have talked about the 9th.  Could you give us some clarification thereon? 
A.	The date of the 8th is that on which we left for Bisesero in the night but we arrived there on the 9th.  We left our home on the 8th and we reached Bisesero on the 9th.  In fact, we spent the night quite close to Bisesero, on the boundary of Musenyi, and very early in the morning at about 6 a.m. on the 9th, I was already with the inhabitants of Bisesero.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for this clarification.  You have just stated before the Court that you stayed in Bisesero from April till the arrival of the French.  Do you remember the date on which the French arrived? 
A.	Look, I do not remember the date but in any case, it was towards the end of the month of June. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Under what circumstances did you know Mika Muhimana? 
A.	Here are the circumstances under which I knew Mika.  In fact, I have explained to you how I got to know him.  I saw him on several occasions.  I did not explain this clearly in my statement because if I began to explain to you under what circumstances I had known him, it would be quite long.  I was particularly affected by this event that the young lady was a victim to and I will tell you the truth.  I am not lying about him.  Even Mika is present in this court, he can confirm it to you.  Before, Mika was somebody who was very dangerous and very repugnant.  When we saw him on a path, people didn't take that path any more.  The incident where the young lady was a victim was a heinous incident indeed, but before that incident I knew Mika well.
Q.	Did you also know his family, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I did not know his family very well.  In fact, I knew Mika because he was a conseiller.  During this period, conseillers were very influential people.  A conseiller was somebody who was well-known; who was well respected.  I knew him but I did not know his family.  If I were to tell you that I knew his family very well, it would be a lie.  But I can tell you that I could see his children even though I did not know their names. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You stated that you knew him as a trader; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I did not go much to drinking places during that time, because I was not a drinking person but people told me that he sold beer.  I could pass through his drinking place when I was going to play, and when I was coming back I could see him sitting in front of his house.  But I cannot tell you that he did such and such another trade, but I know that at one point he bought and sold coffee because I could see coffee in front of his house.  But I saw him most when he came to hunt us in Bisesero with his gun.  Each time I could see him in Bisesero, I was there.

	1400H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	When did you see him on Bisesero, Mr. Witness; can you remember? 
A.	I used to see him all the time, but I cannot remember the dates.  Mika was present at all the attacks, and, in fact, it is he who was leading them.  He was the conseiller of Gishyita secteur.  He led all the attacks.  So he didn't stay at home.  What is more, in the month of April, it is he who was leading the assailants and looters.  And in the month of May also, he used to spill blood.  So he was always present in all the attacks from April to the month of June.  He was always in Bisesero.  However, sometimes he could come to these attacks without my seeing him, because, from time to time, I went to hide elsewhere.  Sometimes when we saw him, we were too frightened.  And I would say that you cannot see a person well in more than 20 attacks, because this is a person who is terrifying, and sometimes I might not recognise him because he was in the midst of a large number of assailants.  However, I saw him on several occasions.  

	He is here.  You can ask him.  And in fact, the day when he called Ruzanganwa, and told him to arrest girls and women and to tell them that they should gather to receive aid and that peace had come, I must say that he wanted to exterminate people.  On the next day, we saw buses full of assailants coming, and the fugitives, the refugees, died in large numbers. 
Q.	I don't know whether you've answered my question, which was when you saw Mika for the first time in Bisesero. 
A.	The first time that I saw him, that was in Mubuga, in front of a primary school.
Q.	Can you say exactly if Mubuga is in Bisesero?
A.	No.  Mubuga is a hill, and at that place there is a school.  There is another location called Mubuga where you have the headquarters of the Mubuga secteur.  So there are two areas that are referred to as Mubuga, but they are two different places.
Q.	I will ask my question for the last time so that we can make progress.  When did you see Mika at Bisesero for the first time? 
A.	I saw him first at Mubuga, and he was in the company of Vincent Rutaganira, and they were shooting at us.  That was the first attack in which I saw him.  And then I saw him again in Bisesero; that's in the Bisesero school.  And that was in the morning, at about 11 a.m. but I'm only estimating the time.  We were trying to flee, and the assailants were firing at us.  I saw him again at Kanyinya, but on that occasion, I wasn't close to him.  We were on the other side, on the other flank, of the river, and at that time he was saying that peace had returned.  And the last time that I saw him close-up was on the occasion where he raped the young woman.  And there I was quite close to him, but I was trying to lower my head in order not to be seen by him.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  A while ago, you testified to the Chamber that it's not always that you saw Mika.  Did I understand well? 
A.	Normally, since the month of April, up until the month of June, I couldn't see him every day, as if I was beside him, whereas he was more or less in -- like a beast.  I could see him today.  Other people may see him the next day.  But the only occasions on which I saw him are those I've mentioned to you.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I heard you testify in this Chamber that you saw Mika at least once in Muyira.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	When you say you saw him from a close distance, do you mean -- or what -- how did you see him on other occasions?
A.	On other occasions, I saw him while we were fleeing, and the assailants at that time were shooting at us and they were chasing us.
Q.	Can you describe to us the occasion on which you saw him close-up in Bisesero? 
A.	You want to talk about the incident with that young lady?  Well, on that day, I saw him from a close distance.  He took along the young girl who was hiding with me.  I don't know if that's what you're referring to and you want me to talk about.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You talk about the rape of Josephine Uwamaliya.  Can we know how you knew her?  Unless this may endanger your security. 
A.	Well, I can tell you about it.  I testified to that she was (by Order of the Court the words have been extracted and put under seal).  I saw her when she was born.  I also saw her when she died.  I knew her very well.
Q.	Did you know her parents?
A.	I knew them.
Q.	Can you give us their names?
A.	Her father was called Muzinduti and her mother was called Therese Mukabitega.
Q.	Thank you.  When she was discovered by the Interahamwe, was it at the same time that Mukangoga, Goretti, that she was -- was it at the same time that Mukangoga was discovered?
A.	Yes, she was hiding -- or they were hiding at the same place.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you say that Josephine was (by order of the Court the words have been extracted and put under seal)? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  She was (by order of the Court the words have been extracted and put under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE WITNESS:
Do you want to talk about that young girl? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No.  We just wanted to know that Josephine -- you said that Josephine was (by order of the Court, the words have been extracted and put under seal).  This will disclose your identity.  Wouldn't that be -- this being a protected information, please place -- be kept under seal and expunged from the record. 

Professor, please proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I was asking the question as to whether Mukangoga and Uwamaliya were hiding in the same place.
A.	They were hiding in the same place but in different bushes.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us more precisely how Mika raped Josephine?  What act did Mika actually commit? 
A.	I have told you what Mika did.  He took this young girl, Josephine Uwamaliya, and raped her, and then he left her in the hands of the Interahamwe, who killed her in a very heinous manner.  I think I clearly stated this.
Q.	We would like to know more, Mr. Witness, when you say that she resisted.
A.	That girl tried to resist, but to no avail.  Mika wanted that young girl to undress herself for him so that they could have intercourse together.  The young girl refused, and Mika had to resort to force, and given that she was not physically strong, and because she was hungry and thirsty, she could not face up to Mika.  And she couldn't face up to the Interahamwe either, since she wasn't very strong.
Q.	Mr. Witness, who undressed Josephine? 
A.	She was undressed by Mika, as well as other Interahamwe who were on the spot.  I saw them whispering.  Some Interahamwe were trying to move away, and Mika was telling them, "This girl has always been very arrogant and now we have to settle scores with her."  And I did not want -- I tried to see what was being done but I was compelled to do so. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Once again, the witness has just talked about the relation between the victim and himself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The relationship of the witness with the victim will be deleted from the record and be kept under seal. 

Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you could simply answer the question asked, the question was to know who undressed Josephine.  I heard your answer but I want to put in conflict with that answer an extract of your statement.  That is when -- we are on page 4 of the declaration.  "When Mika reached the bush, Mika told the girl that her arrogance was going to end that day, because she had been very haughty before, and then he asked her to remove her trousers, but since she was resisting, he asked one of the Interahamwe to undress her, and this was done by this said Interahamwe." 

Now, between your present statement and the statement that you -- your original statement, I would like to know who undressed Josephine?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Question asked and answered several times.  He's made himself very clear. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, hold on, hold on.  Mr. Songa is trying to argue that there is a conflict between his evidence and his statement, which he is entitled to do. 

However, Professor Songa, you will know that in his statement, there are two descriptions of what happened.  He first said that Mika personally undressed her by force.  That is in the first description.  Then in the second description, on the next page, he also said that when she resisted, he called one of the Interahamwe to undress her, which he did.  So you have to take both accounts into consideration when you are putting this question to the witness.  Don't just read one portion of his statement. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I think that the --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
(Microphone not activated) ... The passage pointed out by Your Honour on page 4 of the English version is actually not attributable to Mika.  That is attributable to Sikubwabo.  And the discussion as to how this witness was -- this victim, Josephine, was undressed, is actually on the final page, on page 5, and I actually made that mistake myself when I was reading the statement, and I had to read it several times to ensure that that passage was actually speaking about the rape of somebody else.  And then halfway, it jumps to talk about Josephine.  It starts off talking about Josephine and then it goes on to talk about somebody else and then it goes back to Josephine.  And if you read it again, you will see that it is -- that passage that you've referred to as undressing her by force actually refers to Sikubwabo and not Mika, and a totally different victim. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But, Mr. Phillips, you will know that in that passage, the word "he" is used subsequently.  When you say that "he" -- if you argue that "he ordered the woman to undress" refers to Sikubwabo, then you would realise that the "he" continues.  "He pushed her to the ground, and she sat down.  He then removed one of his trouser legs, put his weapon beside him and pulled the woman towards him.  He made her sit on his legs and raped her in that position."  Are you saying that that is Sikubwabo who raped her in that position.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct.  That whole passage refers to Sikubwabo, not Mika, and that's why I didn't touch on it in my direct examination.  The bit that concerns Mika starts after Josephine was discovered, and that's where they start talking about Mika.  And that's where the confusion lies.  You see, he describes Mika and then he goes on to talk about Sikubwabo raping somebody else, and then comes back to Mika again, and I actually had that difficulty when I was reading the statement, so I can understand where the confusion is.  And that's the way we read it, anyway. 
JUDGE SHORT:
All right. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
I would like to pay tribute, Madam President, to the intellectual honesty of the Prosecutor, who has just described the actions attributable to the various persons.  Now, can we give another chance to the witness by asking the question once again? 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Who undressed Josephine? 
A.	She was undressed by Mika and an Interahamwe who was in his company.
Q.	Thank you.  You say, Mr. Witness, that Mika was wearing a khaki ensemble and that he opened his fly; is that correct? 
A.	I saw khaki clothing.  I did not quite see with what he was wearing the khaki.  I can't say what he was wearing beneath the khaki. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I was merely reading your own statement, and there you say the following:  "That he was dressed in a khaki outfit.  He opened his fly."  Like you say, "He then ordered her to remove her trousers.  She resisted.  He first called one of the Interahamwe to undress her, which he did, removing her trousers and underwear, and leaving her with only a shirt.  Mika was dressed in a khaki outfit."  Now, can you confirm this statement?
A.	I do confirm it.  He opened his fly but I didn't quite see him.  All I saw was that he mounted her.  I did not see what he had as underwear.
Q.	Can we retain that Mika kept his -- did he keep his salopette?
A.	I always saw him wearing those -- this petticoat.  As for what he had under, I can't say.  I saw him on the woman, and I don't know how much -- what love he had for her.  Was he mounting her to save her?  And you will understand yourself that it wasn't a game.  He was on top of her, trying all -- raping her.
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I saw him wearing his clothes.
Q.	You say, Mr. Witness, that Mika gave her to his Interahamwe the order to kill Josephine; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  After having raped her, he left her in the hands of the Interahamwe, who cut her into pieces, cut, first of all, her legs and her arms.  And what they did later is they left her while she was still agonising.  The next morning, we went and saw her, and she was already dead. 
Q.	Let's come back a little bit, Mr. Witness.  Did I quite understand your answer when you said you did not see his underwear?
A.	I didn't quite pay attention to his underwear.  I was in a critical situation.  I was overtaken by grief and I couldn't know exactly how his underwears were.  What I remember was that he was wearing a khaki suspenders, jump-suit.  I myself, I can't remember what clothes I was wearing at that time.  I wasn't God to know what his underwear were.  What I can say is that he was wearing -- he was wearing a pinafore on top of the woman that he was raping, so please don't ask me what clothes exactly he was wearing.  Even the pinafore, I only saw, you know, furtively, because I couldn't see clearly.  You'd remember -- you'd understand yourself that I did not know that I was going to stand here before the Court.  I myself did not know that I was going to survive.  I could not go and see the underwear or the drawers or shorts that the people were wearing inside their clothes. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you see Mika's genitals? 
A.	I wasn't seeing his genitals.  He was on top of the woman, and I couldn't go to see.  They were some 20 metres from me, and you could not see exactly how the genitals of the man or of the woman were.  If there is penetration, you cannot know exactly how it was done.  I mean, I wasn't God to know it.  Can somebody sleep on top of another and that you see their genitals?  That's impossible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have told you from the very beginning that you should reply to questions in a very brief -- and don't go on giving long stories. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, as usual about this time, I ask you if we can hope to benefit from your assurance that you will wind it up by three o'clock. 
MR. SONGA:
I reserved a surprise for you, Madam President, but since you want me to spill the beans, I think I will be asking my last question. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I see. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is a surprise for us; no doubt. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	If I can restate what I understood, you did not see penetration, the penetration of Mika's penis into Josephine's body; is that correct, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I wasn't witness to the penetration of his penis, but the position he had over the woman showed that they were not playing.  That is, Mika and Josephine were not playing.  I heard the young woman scream in pain.  It is clear that he was raping her.  He did nothing else.  I saw him dismount, but I didn't pay attention to see how he inserted his penis into her genitals.  I saw that he raped her, but I can't say exactly.  You should even remember that he was sleeping with a belly down.  He wasn't sleeping on his back.

1430H
MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember having testified on Josephine's death in a Rwandan court?
A.	Yes, I testified on Josephine's death.
Q.	When was that?
A.	I don't quite recall the year.  It's been a while since then.
MR SONGA: 
Madam President, I am through with my cross-examination.  I would like to thank the witness for his availability, and I would like to thank the Tribunal, the Court, for having listened to us patiently.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.

Yes, Mr. Phillips, if you have any re-examination.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Just two questions, Your Honour
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have been asked about a lady called Goretti.  Do you recall being asked about her?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Do you know if -- do you know what happened to Goretti after she had been captured in May 1994?
A.	Goretti was not captured by the Accused.  She was captured but someone else, by another man.  I don't know whether I should give an account of those facts, but maybe you should ask me those questions when the acts attributed to that woman are before this Chamber.
Q.	Thank you very much, that will not be necessary.  Can I just ask you, did Goretti have any children, do you know?
A.	She had four children.
Q.	Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No further questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for assisting the Court with your testimony.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  Mr. Issa, please assist the witness.

The Court is adjourned for the day.  We will resume on Monday afternoon at 2 p.m.  Thank you.
(Court adjourned at 1435H)
