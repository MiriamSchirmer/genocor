P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  The Court is in session now.  May we have the appearance for the Prosecution? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  The Prosecution is represented by Mr. Adeogun-Phillips, myself and Ms. Renifa Madenga.  Thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, for the Defence? 
MR. SONGA:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  The Defence is composed of myself, Professor Nyabirungu Mwene Songa, to my left, Mr. Richard Kazadi Kabimba, co-counsel and Mr. Leopold Munderede, legal assistant.  To my right, there is also Mathias Sahinkuye, legal assistant.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  We welcome you, co-Counsel.  Thank you.  We see that the Accused is not present in the Court.  Professor, what do you have to say about that? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I noted the same thing, but beforehand, I received a telephone call from my client.  He said that his state of health did not permit him to be present and complained that since the Tribunal ordered that the registry send him a doctor for consultation, this instruction has never been carried out.  He therefore considers that his state of health requires emergency examination and requested that I convey this message to you.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Registry, could you please reply?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Madam President, this morning we received information from the commanding officer of UNDF, informing us that the Accused person was not going to be present today because of health reasons.  And the registry has contacted Dr. Chamba, who is the UN resident doctor, medical officer, at UNDF.  He is going there at three o'clock this afternoon and he has assured me that he will see him this afternoon.  I also informed him that should need be, we would invite him here tomorrow to come and tell us the situation, whatever is happening, and he has agreed to come tomorrow, should the Court decide to invite him to do so.  Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why was the doctor not sent last time after we made the order?

MR. HOMETOWU:
The doctor went there on Thursday.  But on Thursday we were here.  He goes there three times a week, Mondays and Thursdays and I think, one other day.  But Thursday last week he was there, but at that same time Mika was in court here.  And we made further arrangements that he should be seen on Friday morning, but I do not know what happened, but, apparently, he did not see him on Friday morning, maybe it is because that is not his schedule. Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And, Professor, what are your client's instructions with regard to the continuance of the trial? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  As I have just said, he only called me at about 1 p.m.  I did not have the opportunity to talk with him at length, but I know that he would have liked me to meet him so that we can decide what to do.  But for the time being, he would not like the Court case to continue in his absence because he would like to contribute to the counter cross-examination. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what application are you making? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  My application would be to postpone the session this afternoon to give me the opportunity to discuss with my client and to hear what he, himself, says about his state of health and to ensure or to find out whether the registry, after the failure to act since Wednesday, is ready to follow up the health of my client.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips, what do you have to say?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, not very much, other than to say that we are disappointed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Despite our directions, the registry had made no efforts to get the Accused examined by the doctor.  So we have deliberated and we ruled that the proceedings should be stopped for today, and we once again direct the registry to get the Accused examined by the doctor this evening or tomorrow morning.  And, if he is fit, we should be provided -- the Court should be provided with the fitness certificate so that we can proceed with the case.  

So we adjourn the case till tomorrow afternoon.  We will resume at 2 p.m.  
	(Court adjourned at 1417H)
