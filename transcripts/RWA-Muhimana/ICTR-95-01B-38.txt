 1                                             PROCEEDINGS
 2   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 3        Good afternoon to all. I declare the Court in session.
 4

 5        May the Prosecution introduce the members of its team?
 6   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
 7        Good afternoon, Your Honours. The Office of the Prosecutor is represented by Mr. Wallace Kapaya,
 8        Mrs. Renifa Madenga, Ms. Maymuchka Lauriston, Ms. Queen MacAlice and myself,
 9       Charles Adeogun-Phillips. I am grateful, Your Honours.
10   MADAM PRESIDENT:
11        Thank you. And the Defence too.
12   MR. SONGA:
13        Good afternoon, Madam President. Good afternoon, Your Honours. Good afternoon, my friends of
14        the Prosecution. The Defence is represented by myself, Professor Nyabirungu, assisted by
15       Counsel Kazadi and Munderede. I thank you.
16   MADAM PRESIDENT:
17        Thank you, Professor.
18

19       First of all, a happy new year to everyone present in the courtroom.
20

21        Now we have reached the stage of closing arguments. Before we proceed with the oral submissions,
22        Mr. Prosecutor, may we know the estimated length of time you will need for your oral arguments?
23   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
24        Your Honour, we kind of estimate about 40 to 45 minutes per speaker. Three of us would be handling
25        the closing arguments. I will deal with counts 1 and 2; Mrs. Madenga, count 3; and Mr. Kapaya will
26        deal with count 4 and the submissions on sentence, so he may need slightly longer, but I estimate
27        about three hours in total, Your Honour.
28   MADAM PRESIDENT:
29        Does that mean that you will be able to conclude your arguments today?
30   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
31        Oh, certainly, Your Honours. Certainly, we have to do that.
32   MADAM PRESIDENT:
33        Thank you. Go ahead, please.
34   MR. SONGA:
35        Madam President, I crave your indulgence to interrupt the proceedings in order to present to you a
36        concern. When we parted company last time, there was an important matter pending, inasmuch as
37        with regard to the Defence Witness DZ and DK, notice was taken of their confessions before the

                                SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 1
     MUHIMANA                                                                      TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   Rwandan authorities. However, the case file as presented by the Prosecutor contradicted the claims
 2   of the witness inasmuch as the witness was dealing with confessions but which were not included in
 3   the files presented by the Prosecutor, and this made the Prosecutor -- they think that we were dealing
 4   with witnesses who are not credible.
 5

 6   I am conscious of the difficulty I am raising by presenting this problem to you, but I am also conscious
 7   of the fact of the very soul of your Court and the spirit of the statutes and rules as the need for a fair
 8   trial. This is a requirement of Article 20 of the Statute. Similarly, the Rules, basically Rule 73, provide
 9   that once a person has appeared initially, the Prosecution or the Defence may always make motions.
10

11   And then, Madam President, I would like to refer you to Rule 85 of the Rules of Procedure and
12   Evidence, even though the order in which we have to present our evidence, there is a clause in this
13   text to the effect that you can proceed, otherwise, when the Chamber decides otherwise in the interest
14   of justice. I would also like to point out that if we read Rule 87 of the Rules of Procedure and
15   Evidence, we cannot say that the proceedings were over, since according to this Rule, the presiding
16   Judge of the Trial Chamber shall declare the hearing closed after the closing arguments and the
17   closing brief.
18

19   I remember, Madam President, Your Honours, that when this issue was raised on the 8th of
20   September, Honourable Judge Short expressed many regrets that the Defence had not dealt with the
21   entire case file which shows that the confessions of the witness were real and that they had actually
22   been noted by the Rwandan judicial authorities. But after such regrets, the Honourable Judge had
23   suggested that the Defence should ascertain whether there wasn't a legal source, a text or case law
24   that would enable the Court to proceed with that matter.
25

26   I would like to point out again, that in light of the Rules, the proceedings are not being reopened
27   inasmuch as we haven't presented our closing briefs and closing arguments. As a matter of fact, with
28   due respect to all the legal references, Your Honours, Madam President, I believe you have a
29   heightened sense of justice and that you are daily preoccupied with the need to ensure a fair trial. I
30   would like to state that I wouldn't like the Prosecutor to raise motions, even though they are entitled to
31   do so, to the motion of the Defence, which would enable us to repair the prejudice done to the
32   Accused, by the very fact that they try to discredit the witness without any real materials in support of
33   that challenge and without having any materials or evidence in its possession.
34

35   Madam President, Your Honours, I once more crave your indulgence for interrupting the proceedings
36   as envisaged in the Rules, but I believe that the need to ensure a fair trial commands that this motion
37   be raised. I thank you for your attention.

 1   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 2       Have you filed the copies of the confessions? We have not received them yet.
 3   MR. SONGA:
 4       Thank you, Madam President. As you would imagine, I have only been here for two days. But since
 5       this morning, I have done my best to submit the confessions given in Rwanda, and those documents
 6       were acknowledged -- receipt of those documents was acknowledged.
 7   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 8       Professor, if the confession is in Rwanda, how would you expect us to know the contents of the
 9       document?
10   MR. SONGA:
11       Yes, Madam President, that is precisely what I did by forwarding this document to you accompanied
12       by the case file which was tendered by the Prosecution.
13   MADAM PRESIDENT:
14       Professor, can we know one good reason why you did file this confession so late?
15   MR. SONGA:
16       Let me explain, Madam President. I believe all the aspects were already dealt with in the discussions
17       of 8th September 2004. At the time we had addressed you on the difficulties the Defence had
18       encountered because of the rule of confidentiality which is part of the practice in Rwanda, you showed
19       proof of a lot of understanding when the witness said -- stated that he was in possession of a copy,
20       but that he didn't have it on him. And you had requested that the Rwandan authorities be contacted in
21       writing in order that they provide those documents, and that if difficulties persisted, you would assist.
22   MADAM PRESIDENT:
23       Professor, when did you get hold of that document?
24   MR. SONGA:
25       My investigator who lives in Rwanda informed me last week that he had just obtained the document.
26       As we knew that the case was going to resume, we agreed to meet here. I arrived here in Arusha the
27       day before yesterday, and I obtained the document yesterday, and I prepared a mail today for
28       transmission to your Chamber and to the Prosecution.
29   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
30       When did you ask for it from the Rwanda government, on which day and in which way?
31   MR. SONGA:
32       Perhaps I wouldn't know the exact date, but I know the month. It was immediately after the
33       appearance of DZ, that was the day after he appeared. We immediately wrote to the Rwandan
34       authorities. We also wrote to the registry to request it to assist us in the forwarding of the mail. And
35       when DK appeared in the face of the same difficulties, and in spite of the fact that it was at the end of
36       the presentation of the Defence case, we immediately wrote to the Rwandan authorities. Whether we
37       are dealing with the letter relating to the confessions of DZ or DK, the Rwandan authorities did not

                               SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 3
          MUHIMANA                                                                      TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1        respond to those letters.
 2   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
 3        Did you copy any of your letters to either the court management or the Prosecution?
 4   MR. SONGA:
 5        I am not in a position to confirm that, but what is certain is that we agreed during the proceedings that
 6        was what had to be done and that was the procedure, and at the same time we were assisted, as
 7        usual, by the registrar of the Tribunal himself.
 8   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
 9        I didn't follow that. You were assisted by the registrar to do what?
10   MR. SONGA:
11        The procedure is that when we write to the Rwandan authorities, the mail is not sent directly; it is filed
12        with the registrar and the registrar himself then forwards the letter to the authorities in Rwanda. That
13        is the usual procedure. Whether it has to do with what we are dealing with now or whether it is to deal
14        with the protection of witnesses, we write a letter to the competent authority, but we first have to write
15        to the registrar to request him to assist in forwarding the letter; that is the procedure.
16   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
17        My question is: Was the letter copied to either court management or the Prosecution? The letter
18        addressed to the Rwandan authorities, seeking that they release to you the confessions of this
19        witness, is that letter copied to either court management or the Prosecution or any other person
20        outside the addressee?
21   MR. SONGA:
22        Your Honour, I was saying that although I do not have the documents with me here, my answer to
23        your question is yes.
24   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
25        How do you give the answer "yes" if you don't have the document? Is it from your recollection? Is it
26        because you yourself did the writing, or is it because it is traditional to do so?
27   MR. SONGA:
28        I say so because one of my legal assistants says the answer is yes, even now.
29   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
30        Prosecutor, do you have a copy of that letter, and if you do, what is the date on it?
31   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
32        I don't, Your Honour. I never received any such document.
33   JUDGE SHORT:
34        Professor Songa, this case was scheduled for closing arguments for the 6th, 7th and 8th of
35        December. Now, if close to those dates you were encountering difficulty in getting these confessions,
36        what efforts did you make to seek the assistance of the Court to get these documents? And don't you
37        think that this application you are making, you should have made it in writing showing due diligence,

                                  SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 4
         MUHIMANA                                                                    TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1       the efforts that you had made to obtain the document, and rather than just coming at this time and
 2       orally telling us without production of the letter that you say you have written, and you expect us to
 3       accept everything you said? You knew about this document in September and we are now in
 4       January. What efforts did you make from September to now to get these documents, and why have
 5       you not approached the Court if you were encountering difficulties to assist you to get the document
 6       up to now?
 7   MR. SONGA:
 8       Thank you, Your Honour. First of all, all mail passes through the Court Management Section.
 9       Secondly, I think we shouldn't be faulted on our perseverance. We didn't know that we would have
10       this document. I contacted my investigator since -- fortunately, he lives in Rwanda, and he gave me
11       access to the detainees and obtained the authorisation to obtain the document in his possession. If
12       the trial had resumed on the 6th of September -- of December, it would have been unfortunate for us,
13       but since the time frame was extended, we availed ourselves of it; it was in our favour. I believe you
14       understand me, Your Honour.
15   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
16       Professor, I think there is a fundamental point you are missing. The fundamental point is this: It must
17       be assumed that you believed this document to exist as long ago as 8th September, and, therefore --
18       and I think you believed then that it was a document which would assist your client's case. What is
19       being asked of you is this: With that knowledge and keeping in mind the exchanges that went on in
20       Court on the 8th of September, why did you not do anything tangible beyond asking or writing for this
21       document to show that we are seeking to get the document, so that, in fact, you would be saying,
22       "Yes, I have worked diligently and at long last, only yesterday I got the document" because that
23       doesn't entitle -- that would make it possible for us to see you as somebody who is diligently seeking
24       to advance his client's case.
25

26       Now, here you haven't showed us, one, what steps you took to obtain the documents you believed to
27       be of assistance to your client in this matter, when you did it and what the results were, which as
28       Her Lordship has said, if you had only sat down yesterday when you came and prepared a written
29       motion setting out all those things, you would place us in a much more easier way to understand your
30       predicament. And as you say, we are dealing with the issue of fair trial which is fair to both sides and
31       not fair to one side. There is no such thing as fair for one side. Fair means it cuts both sides. We
32       want to try and understand you, Professor, if we can, what diligence you have put in this matter
33       because our discretion in the matter can only be exercised when that diligence has been exhibited.
34   MR. SONGA:
35       Your Honour, I believed the results would precisely be the proof of the diligence. I know that I
36       contacted my investigator on several occasions, an investigator who is in Rwanda. I don't know if I
37       could have done more. But with regard to the official correspondences, they were channelled through

                               SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 5
          MUHIMANA                                                                     TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1        the usual channels. I don't know how much more I could have been diligent. I know you are
 2        suggesting I could have raised a written motion yesterday, but I would like you to understand the
 3        intensity of the work the Defence had to do the day before the presentation of the closing briefs. The
 4        work is tremendous and it wasn't easy at all.
 5   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
 6        But these documents, these letters, these correspondences which you pass through court
 7        management, you ought to have the copies; you ought to be telling us, "I passed a letter to court
 8        management dated on such-and-such a day, a copy of that is this one. I wrote again on
 9       such-and-such a day, a copy of this is this one." I am unable to see how you would be without the
10        copies of the letters you send which the Prosecutor -- at least one of which the Prosecutor says he
11        hasn't received yet.
12   MADAM PRESIDENT:
13        Now maybe ask the registry to get the copy of the letter.
14   MR. HOMETOWU:
15        Your Honours, we are conducting a search and the result would be made known to you very shortly.
16        Thank you.
17   MADAM PRESIDENT:
18        Professor, when did you get the document, the confession statements of DZ? Can you give us the
19        specific date?
20   MR. SONGA:
21        I received them yesterday, Madam President, and my investigator who lives in Rwanda informed me
22        of that last week.
23   MADAM PRESIDENT:
24        But you said that you received the copy last week, didn't you say that?
25   MR. SONGA:
26        No, Madam President. Maybe what I said wasn't well understood. Last week I was in Kinshasa, my
27        investigator was in Kigali and he informed me that he had just received that document. Knowing that
28        we had to meet here for the resumption of the trial, I arrived before yesterday and I received that
29        document yesterday; that is the situation, Madam President.
30   MADAM PRESIDENT:
31        Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, what do you have to say?
32   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
33        Your Honours, not very much. Suffice it to say that we identify with the observations and comments
34        that Your Honours have made.
35

36        I would just make one addition to what you have already said. The statement of Witness DK, who
37        testified before Your Honours on the 8th of September 2004, as far as we were concerned was

                                 SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 6
         MUHIMANA                                                                    TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1       actually in his custody. His evidence was that he had a copy of that statement and he had left it
 2       behind. The issue then arises as to how long it takes to obtain a copy of a statement from
 3       Witness DK himself. That is our first observation.
 4

 5       A second observation is in relation to the statement we have before us. It doesn't seem to relate to
 6       the statement that Witness DK referred to in his testimony. In that regard, Witness DK, at page 47 of
 7       the transcript of 8th September 2004, stated that he made another confession on the 31st of January
 8       2004. Well, the statement I have attributed to him is dated the 27th of July 2004. So as far as I am
 9       concerned, we are still not talking about the same statement anywhere.
10

11       And in relation to the obtaining of the statements, if the correspondence that accompanied the request
12       to the Rwandan government cannot be found, can we at least have the ones that accompanied the
13       statements from the Rwandan government? Thank you.
14

15       And just to add that we would also be asking if Your Honours are minded to admit the statements, we
16       would ask that the witnesses be recalled so that we can cross-examine them in relation to the content.
17   MADAM PRESIDENT:
18       Professor, can you provide us with the communication of the Rwandan authorities?
19   MR. SONGA:
20       Madam President, I was saying that regarding that witness, the Rwandan authorities never responded
21       to our correspondences. So we have no correspondence from the Rwandan authorities on that
22       matter.
23   JUDGE SHORT:
24       Mr. Songa, on what evidence are we to make this decision? What evidence is before us as for the
25       efforts you made and the results of those efforts? There is absolutely nothing before us, and how are
26       we to make this decision?

28       And with regard to the evidence -- the confession of the first -- DK, I think it's the witness who said he
29       had the confession but he had left it in Rwanda, how long -- why was it so difficult for you to get him to
30       produce the confession soon after he testified? I can't see any explanation for that, your inability to
31       produce that particular document. In any event, the point is as at this stage, there is absolutely no
32       evidence before us on which we can make a decision on your application.
33   MR. SONGA:
34       I believe I heard that investigations were being conducted on the file that was sent to Rwanda -- on
35       the correspondences I had sent to Rwanda. If the results of such investigations were presented to us,
36       I believe the answer to this question would be found. What I know is that the correspondence was
37       sent on the instructions of the Tribunal and that they exist, even though I did not bring copies. It is

 1        true that I do not have copies of the correspondences with me here. If we were working under normal
 2        conditions, my assistant would have gone to the office to look for it, but we don't have an office in the
 3        Tribunal, and the document we are referring to is in our house. This is a difficulty relating to our
 4        working conditions. We don't have an office here. We don't have any facility for storing documents.
 5   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 6        Professor, your witness, during the course of the evidence, had admitted that he had the copies. You
 7        could have asked him to send you the copies.
 8   MR. SONGA:
 9        Madam President, we should bear in mind the fact that the witness -- the witnesses we are dealing
10        with are detainees. We do not correspond with them; we need authorisation from the prison
11        authorities. If they were free witnesses, we would have proceeded otherwise, but we are dealing with
12        detainees.
13   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
14        Professor, I am still in a state of perplexity. You have perplexed me by suggesting that your copy
15        would be in the house because you don't have an office. I mean, the one thing you knew before you
16        stood up, before you even made a decision to speak to us, is that you would be expected to show
17        diligence in this matter. It can't be that you thought that you would merely ask the Court and that the
18        Court would not seek to know what you have done about getting these documents, and, therefore, an
19        explanation that your copies are lying in your room because you don't have an office in the Tribunal
20        astounds me. I mean, I get defeated by that kind of practice. I mean, I couldn't possibly imagine a
21        situation where you are leaving your documents in your house when you know those are the
22        documents you will be asked to show.
23   MR. SONGA:
24        I understand the purport of your comment, Your Honour, but all I am saying is the truth.
25   MR. HOMETOWU:
26        Your Honours, after a diligent search in the records -- in the case file, please I want to inform you that
27        there is no record of such correspondence coming from Professor Songa regarding the two
28        witnesses, DZ and DK. Thank you.
29   MADAM PRESIDENT:
30        We have deliberated and we are inclined to dismiss your motion, Professor. Thank you.

 9   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
10        Your Honours, on the 25th of October 2004 the Prosecutor filed a closing brief before the
11       Trial Chamber. The brief was essentially divided into six chapters, Chapter 1 dealing briefly with the
12        nature and assessment of the evidence adduced at trial; Chapter 2 dealing with the procedure or
13        history of the case; Chapter 3 dealing with the particulars and personal circumstances as we allege
14        them to be of the Accused in this case, Mr. Mika Muhimana; Chapter 4 dealing with the legal and
15        factual submissions adduced during the trial; Chapter 5 dealing with the legal and factual submissions
16        adduced in support of count 3, rape as a crime against humanity, and Chapter 4 dealing with the legal
17        factual submissions adduced in support of count 4; namely, murder as a crime against humanity.
18

19        Your Honours, I will be dealing with the -- very briefly, with an overview of the submissions that we
20        make in relation to Chapter 4 of the said brief; namely, counts 1 and 2, the charges of genocide or,
21        alternatively, complicity in genocide.
22

23        My learned colleague Ms. Madenga will deal with those concerning -- the submissions concerning
24        count 3, rape, and Mr. Kapaya will deal with those concerning murder as a crime against humanity in
25        count 4 of the indictment. He would also make some remarks in relation to sentencing. We haven't
26        filed a separate document, of course.
27

28        In that regard, Your Honours, the Accused in this case Mika Muhimana is charged in count 1 with the
29        crime of genocide, and in the alternative with that of complicity in genocide. Suffice it to say that at
30        this stage the Prosecutor relies in relation to those two counts on the same facts, and they are indeed
31        charged in the alternative.
32

33        It is our position as prosecutors that genocide was committed in Rwanda between April and June
34        1994, and we would also represent to Your Honours that the widespread massacres which occurred
35        in Rwanda in 1994 were geared towards the destruction and extermination of the Tutsi population
36        who were specifically targeted because of their ethnic origin and because such people were perceived
37        to be accomplices of the RPF.

     MUHIMANA                                                                       TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   For the benefit of the interpreters, I am referring to -- generally to page 11 of my closing submissions.
 2   Your Honour, in paragraph 6 of Chapter 4, we state that the Accused disputes that genocide occurred
 3   in Rwanda between April, May and June 1994. However, the Accused does not dispute -- the
 4   Defence do not dispute that at all times referred to in this indictment, there existed in Rwanda a
 5   minority ethnic group known as Tutsi and officially recognised as such, and they obviously make the
 6   same admission in relation to the Hutu ethnic group. We refer you specifically to paragraph 32(a) of
 7   the request -- our request to admit facts from the Defence where they have made those admissions.
 8

 9   Your Honours, I would represent to you that the totality of the evidence adduced in this case would
10   indicate to you that Tutsis at various locations and the events -- the various events charged in the
11   present indictment were killed in great numbers. In that regard, Your Honours, we have made some
12   submissions in our brief, paragraph 18 onwards in relation to the genocidal intent which is necessary
13   to be proven in relation to the offence of genocide, what is called the special intent to commit
14   genocide. In that regard, we outlined in paragraph 18 that before the Accused Mr. Muhimana can be
15   convicted of a crime of genocide, the Prosecutor has to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he
16   participated in the killing and causing of serious bodily and mental harm to Tutsi civilians in Gishyita
17   commune with specific intent to destroy those people or such persons in whole or in part. The
18   requirement that I have just outlined is indeed unique to the crime of genocide, and in that regard, it is
19   submitted at paragraph 18 of our brief that the special intent of a crime is a specific intention which, as
20   an element of the crime, requires that the perpetrator clearly intended the result charged.
21

22   The Prosecutor would represent to Your Honours, and we have done so from paragraph 19 to 21, that
23   there are factors that you as Judges can take into account in reaching the conclusion that the
24   offences underlined in support of the charge of genocide were perpetrated with the specific intent that
25   I have just outlined. In particular, Your Honours, at paragraph 23 of the closing brief, Chapter 4 of the
26   closing brief on page 15, we outlined that as part of many inertia -- or indicia that you can take into
27   consideration, the persistent pattern of conduct displayed by an accused person participating in a
28   multitude of sustained attacks on Tutsis at various locations, in this case in Gishyita and Gisovu
29   communes, between the period of April and June 1994, is evidence that his participation in those
30   attacks was intentional and as such may be constituted as evidence of his genocidal intent.
31

32   At paragraph 24, we make mention of the actions of the Accused concerning rapes of various women,
33   the transportation of attackers in various convoys to various massacre sites, and we also talk about
34   the statements and the directives of the Accused to various assailants as providing direct evidence of
35   his genocidal intent.
36

37   Similarly, in paragraph 25 of Chapter 4 on page 16, we state that Your Honours should be minded to

                             SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 10
     MUHIMANA                                                                     TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   the striking similarities between the killings of Tutsi civilians as you have heard in this case taking
 2   place in Gishyita secteur, Mubuga church, Mugonero complex and areas of Bisesero, and those
 3   launched against Tutsis in other areas and part of Kibuye préfecture and in Rwanda as a whole during
 4   the same period. And, in that regard, Your Honour, we argue and it's our case that those similarities
 5   indicate that the mass killings and other crimes alleged in this indictment must have occurred as part
 6   of a wider genocidal plan and policy to exterminate Tutsis throughout Rwanda between April and
 7   June 1994.
 8

 9   Your Honours, at paragraph 26, we carry on to say that in assessing the criminal responsibility and
10   the genocidal intent of the Accused, you as Judges should not assess the evidence against him in
11   isolation, that is, the evidence adduced by our witnesses, Prosecution witnesses, but, rather, we urge
12   you to consider such evidence in the context of the overall events that occurred in Rwanda during the
13   aforementioned period and specifically within Kibuye préfecture.
14

15   In paragraph 27, 28 and 29, we outline the evidence of some of our witnesses that support our
16   contention that the Accused possessed the requisite intent to commit genocide. For example, we
17   outline the evidence of Witness BI, who talked about how Tutsi -- Hutu women that were married to
18   Tutsi men were evacuated from the Mugonero complex on the 16th of April 1994.
19

20   We say at paragraph 27 of our closing brief that such evacuation at the time and in the circumstances
21   was indicative of specific intent to destroy members of the Tutsi ethnic group that were present at the
22   Mugonero complex at the time.
23

24   Witness AT says something similar. He also saw certain Hutu gentlemen being evacuated from the
25   complex. Witness X, as described in paragraph 29, heard the Accused saying it was the Tutsi that
26   had to die and there was nothing else to be done. She described to Your Honours, how having heard
27   this, she and her Tutsi husband fled towards the area of Bisesero.
28

29   Your Honours would also recall the evidence of Witness BJ that was led by my learned friend and
30   colleague Mrs. Madenga and how she described – how, after she had been raped by persons with the
31   Accused, she discovered that she had been mistakenly taken for a Tutsi, and that, in actual fact, she
32   as a Hutu, should not have suffered such a misadventure. Paragraph 30 of our brief summarises her
33   evidence in that regard.
34

35   At paragraph 32 of Chapter 4, Your Honours, we say that the totality of the evidence that we have
36   summarised from paragraph 27 to 32 of the said brief would indicate and provide you with sufficient
37   evidence that Mika Muhimana, in carrying out the criminal activities attributed to him in the said

                           SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 11
     MUHIMANA                                                                    TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   indictment, possessed the requisite intent to commit genocide.
 2

 3   It is further submitted that the criminal activities of Mr. Muhimana as outlined in Chapter 2 and
 4   Chapter 4 and the entire brief basically describes a pattern of purposeful action over a three-month
 5   period and include circumstantial evidence.
 6

 7   Your Honours, I would now go to the summary of the factual allegations that we referred to and we
 8   adduced in the brief in support of the allegation in the indictment and a summary of some of the
 9   interesting evidence that you may have heard from Prosecution witnesses.
10

11   In support of the charge of genocide and complicity in genocide in the alternative, the Prosecutor
12   relied on the evidence of witnesses and divided their evidence into four main events at four main
13   locations. They were the events in Gishyita secteur, Gishyita commune, which was essentially
14   evidence about attacks at the Kiziba commercial centre.
15

16   I am now referring to paragraph 39 of Chapter 4, page 18, for the interpreters. The events at the
17   Mubuga parish church, Your Honours, the events at the Mugonero complex and the events that
18   occurred within the area of Bisesero which spanned Gishyita and Gisovu communes. Taking the
19   events that occurred in the area of Kiziba commercial centre located in Gishyita secteur in Gishyita
20   commune, the allegation is outlined in paragraph 5(a) of the indictment and it is reproduced at
21   paragraph 40, on page 19 of the Prosecutor's closing brief, and I wouldn't necessarily repeat what
22   those allegations are.
23

24   Suffice it to say, Your Honours, that in summary, the Prosecutor in support of that allegation relied on
25   the evidence of three witnesses; namely, W, BB and BC. In essence, Your Honours, Witness W, who
26   was a Tutsi male, on the 9th of April 1994, described to you how he saw the Accused amongst other
27   attackers in his cellule of origin. His evidence was extremely pointed. He remembered the clothes
28   the Accused was wearing and saw him carrying a gun. Essentially, W's evidence, as far as the 9th of
29   April was concerned, was that he saw the Accused replenishing and supplying ammunition to
30   assailants who were involved in an attack on Tutsis.
31

32   Now, as part of the said attack, Witness W saw the Accused shoot a Tutsi man aged between 18
33   and 20. His name was Emmanuel, Your Honours will recall. We asked him why he was sure that the
34   Accused was implicated in the killing of Emmanuel, and he said, "Well, the Accused was right in front
35   of me, at a distance of some 20 to 30 metres. I had a very clear view of him." "How do you know that
36   the Accused shot Emmanuel?" We asked. He replied, "There were very few guns. I had a clear view
37   of the Accused." His testimony in that regard is summarised at paragraph 42 to 46, pages 19 to 20 of

                          SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 12
     MUHIMANA                                                                    TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   Chapter 4 of Prosecutor's closing brief.
 2

 3   Witness BB, who was a Tutsi, also testified that on the 9th of April she saw the Accused at her cellule.
 4   She saw the Accused whilst there was an attack on Tutsis ongoing, and she was located at a distance
 5   of about four and half metres from the Accused at this time. The location of this activity was at Kiziba.
 6   Now, she testified, Your Honours, that having arrived at the location where this attack was going on,
 7   the Accused ordered the Tutsis who were involved in this attack to be disarmed. They subsequently
 8   separated from the Hutu. And in separating or in ordering the separation of the Tutsi civilians from the
 9   Hutu at the time in Kiziba, Witness BB said that the Accused said that -- he referred to the fact that the
10   fate of the Tutsi civilians had in fact been sealed. That was her evidence before Your Honours, and
11   this happened on the 9th of April.
12

13   Again, the evidence of Witness BB was summarised at paragraph 47 to 49 on page 20 of Chapter 4.

 1        1600H
 2   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: (Continuing)
 3        Pardon me, Your Honour. The evidence I just referred to refers to Witness BC, not BB. We then
 4        relied on BB who saw the Accused arrive on the 9th of April at 11 p.m., and it's BB's testimony,
 5        Your Honours, that is summarised at paragraphs 47 to 49, and -- BC is summarised from 50 to 52.
 6        Pardon me for that error. So going back to the evidence of BB, Your Honour, BB was a Tutsi male
 7        who testified before Your Honours that on the 9th of April 1994 at 11 a.m., he saw the Accused arrive,
 8        amongst 200 assailants in an area known as Kiziba; the Witness BB was located at a distance of
 9        about 50 metres from where the Accused and his accomplices were located and was therefore able to
10        identify him. He described the Accused as being armed with a long gun with a wooden butt, and he
11        saw the Accused firing at people. Then comes Witness BC whose testimony I have just summarised.
12        Witness W talks about a further sighting in the area of Kiziba on the 11th of April. His evidence in that
13        regard is summarised at paragraph 52 on page 21. Having heard or reviewed the evidence of these
14        three witnesses, there are certain conclusions that can be arrived at, and we summarise those
15        conclusions at paragraph 53 to 56 of our brief. In that regard we say the following: That it is clear that
16        the area that we referred to, namely Kiziba, K-I-Z-I-B-A, is located in Musenyi secteur, and that is
17        spelled M-U-S-E-N-Y-I secteur. There is very little dispute about that, and we say why we make this
18        allegation. It is also true to say that all the three witnesses that we've considered, BB, BC, and W,
19        were all from neighbouring secteurs, secteurs generally neighbouring Musenyi. All three witnesses
20        described seeing the Accused at Kiziba trading centre on the 9th of April, with one further sighting by
21        W on the 11th. It is our position that they are talking pretty much about the same event or the same
22        series of events happening within the locality, the same locality. They all knew the Accused well
23        before the events; they had no problems identifying him in this Courtroom. Naturally, the Defence
24        disputes that the Accused was involved in the said attacks at Kiziba, but we say at paragraph 57 on
25        page 22 of our brief that they do not dispute that Kiziba commercial centre is in fact located in
26        Karama cellule, Musenyi secteur, Gishyita commune, so we agree on the location of the
27        Kiziba commercial centre. The Accused disputes the facts that he distributed weapons to members of
28        the Hutu population located at Kiziba; he disputes the fact that he participated in the attacks on
29        civilians at the said location at any time; and in support of his case, he calls or he relies on the
30        evidence of three witnesses: Defence Witness DM, Delta Mike, Defence Witness TQ1,
31        Tango Quebec 1, and Defence Witness Tango Quebec 13. Three witnesses. We summarise the
32        testimony of those three Defence witnesses on page 23 and 24 of chapter 4 of the closing brief. DM
33        says that, well, as far as he or she was concerned -- I can't remember the sex of DM now -- she, she.
34        I'm grateful, Your Honour. Witness DM stated that, as far as she was concerned, the area of Kiziba
35        was in effect inhabited by cattle rearers. They were shepherds and illiterate cattle rearers and
36        consequently such people could not handle ammunitions. We say that you should treat the evidence
37        of DM with a great degree of caution. And why do we say so? We say so, first of all, because DM

                                   LESLIE TODD - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 14
     MUHIMANA                                                                     TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   contradicted herself in cross-examination and stated that the inhabitants of Kiziba were soldiers, or
 2   some inhabitants of Kiziba were soldiers in the army of Habyarimana, so she shifted her position from
 3   wanting us to believe that because they were all cattle rearers and illiterate, they couldn't handle
 4   ammunitions and therefore the Accused in this place could not be replenishing their supplies, and
 5   then testified that in actual fact some of them were actually soldiers. We say that you should treat her
 6   evidence with caution because she's biased or likely to be, at a minimum. Why? Because she's
 7   related to the Accused. Therefore, it is very unlikely that Witness DM would say anything which will
 8   jeopardise her chances of having or being reunited with a child which she claimed to have had with
 9   the Accused person. We were very worried about her testimony.
10

11   Witness TQ1 didn't even know that Kiziba existed, had no idea that the place existed, so that defence
12   was that, well, the place in contention does not even exist to the best of her knowledge. Well, this fact
13   is contradicted by other witnesses called by the Accused, including Witness DM. So we wouldn't
14   dwell on Witness TQ1's testimony terribly long.
15

16   Witness TQ13: 13 heard of Kiziba but certainly did not hear that weapons had been distributed to
17   people in Kiziba. Well, why should she? And that's really the question, why would she? She did not
18   provide any factual basis as to why she should have been in a position to hear that weapons were in
19   fact distributed at Kiziba. We say at paragraph 64 of page 24 that you should reject her testimony in
20   its entirety. Therefore, we conclude at paragraph 65 to 70 of page 24 of 25 of chapter 4 that
21   Witnesses W, BB and BC, Prosecution witnesses, have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that
22   Mr. Muhimana instigated, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the killing of Tutsi at
23   Kiziba commercial centre. We state at paragraph 66 and 67 why we think so, and we add at
24   paragraph 68 that his mere presence, at a minimum, within the immediate environment of Kiziba
25   among the attackers, considering his position as conseiller would have had a legitimising and
26   encouraging effect on the perpetrators, and he, Mr. Muhimana, was clearly aware that his presence
27   amongst the attackers would have had such an effect. In addition, Your Honours only need to believe
28   one of these witnesses to convict Mika Muhimana of genocide based on the factual allegations in
29   paragraph 5(a) of the indictment. Just one. You don't have to believe all three of them, and we make
30   those submissions at paragraph 69 and 70. At paragraph 69 on page 25, we've asked Your Honours
31   that despite the fact that we've tried to particularise his criminal conduct pursuant to Article 6.1 as
32   instigation, aiding and abetting you as judges do not have to limit yourself to such characterisation. In
33   that regard, you are free to apply any theory that you find applicable to the facts of the case as long
34   as such theory fits within the confines of Article 6.1 of the statute. We say that by pleading Article 6.1
35   in the indictment we have put my learned friends for the Defence and the Accused on notice that any
36   one of the theories of direct responsibility would apply to Mika Muhimana's activities at Kiziba.

 1   Very quickly, Your Honours, I would move to the second event, Mubuga parish church, and the
 2   allegation is contained in paragraph 71 on page 25 of chapter 4. In that regard, we allege in four
 3   paragraphs, 5(b)(i), 5(b)(ii) and 5(b)(iii), that Tutsi refugees were gathered at Mubuga church from
 4   about the 8th of April 1994. We say there were 5,600, at least, humans in that church; namely, men,
 5   women and children. We also allege that the food supplies that were supplied to those refugees for
 6   their upkeep by an organisation called Caritas was looted at some stage after the 8th of April, and that
 7   the Accused in this case, acting in concert with others, was implicated in that act of looting. We also
 8   allege that the Accused Mika Muhimana was implicated, acting in concert with others, in the
 9   distribution of weapons and arms to assailants and attackers at that location.
10

11   Finally, we allege that the Accused was involved and participated in the attack on Tutsi refugees, all
12   5,600 of them, that were located in that church on or about the 15th of April 1994. In support of our
13   allegations in paragraph 5(b) of the indictment, the Prosecutor relies on the evidence of two
14   witnesses; namely, Witness AV, Alpha Victor, and AF, Alpha Fostrom. Their testimonies are outlined
15   on pages 26, 27 and 28, paragraphs 75 to 89 of chapter 4. AV testified, Your Honours -- it was a
16   lady, a very intelligent woman, extremely educated, well educated -- arrived at the Mubuga church
17   with other relatives on or about the 11th of April. She stated that four days after that, around about
18   the 15th of April, at around 10 a.m. in the morning, she saw the Accused, who she testified she had
19   known well before that date, arrive at the Mubuga church in a blue Suzuki Jeep. He had a gendarme
20   with him; she described what the gendarme was wearing. She then told Your Honours that she saw
21   the Accused take a box of grenades out of this Suzuki Jeep and placed it opposite the entrance of the
22   church -- by the entrance to the church. She subsequently then saw the Accused at some stage
23   throw a grenade through a window into the church. She told you that the grenade exploded, killing a
24   Tutsi man by the name of Kayihura, K-A-Y-I-H-U-R-A. She said his head was shattered. Witness AV
25   herself laid on the ground of that church wounded. She was injured and had suffered injuries to her
26   neck, her head and her shoulder. As a result of this attack, she testified that there were many
27   corpses in and around the church. That was AV's testimony about the 11th of April.
28

29   AF, having arrived at the church and sought refuge there from the 10th of April, saw the Accused
30   round about the 14th; about four days after he arrived there now, he saw the Accused talking to the
31   parish priest. He said that the Accused was in the company of Charles Sindikubwabo, referring to
32   page 27, paragraphs 81 to 84 generally. He described how later that day an attack was launched at
33   the presbytery of the Mubuga church. He was honest enough to say that he didn't actually see the
34   Accused during this attack, but had concluded that the Accused and others were responsible for the
35   attack, having seen them at the church earlier on in the day doing bad things. AF talked about how
36   certain girls were abducted and taken from the presbytery during the night of the 14th and 15th of
37   April and were subsequently raped. My colleague Mrs. Madenga will deal with that further in her

 1   submissions. He identified one of the girls, and that's reproduced at paragraph 24. He called her
 2   Claudine.
 3

 4   On the 15th of April, the day after, AF, still located within Mubuga church, talks about seeing the
 5   Accused at the same church during an attack on Tutsis. He thinks and he recollects that the attack
 6   commenced at about 6 a.m. It is my submission that the fact that Witness AF states that the attack
 7   occurred at 6 a.m. and one says it occurred at ten o'clock, that the testimony of these two witnesses is
 8   not necessarily inconsistent. It depends on what they term as the commencement of an attack. In
 9   any event, 10 years after the fact, witnesses are allowed to give varying estimates as to time. I don't
10   think that anyone can fault them for getting it wrong. All right. The issue is, in essence, AF and AV
11   agree that the attack took place on the same day. They agree that the attack took place in the
12   morning. Whether at six o'clock, 6:30, eight o'clock or nine o'clock, in my respectful submission, is
13   immaterial to the evidence 10 years after the fact. What did AF see happen? Well, he told us that the
14   refugees were, in essence, still sleeping inside the church, having been barricaded therein. The
15   assailants smashed the doors in to the church, and he was very close to one of those doors. Based
16   on his location at the church, he was able to identify the Accused with others. They were armed with
17   guns, and he describes their location as being in front of the church, standing facing the primary
18   school. In terms of the distance, he was ten metres away from them, he says. AF describes how the
19   refugees, in a bid to defend themselves, removed bricks at the church and started throwing them as
20   missiles to the attackers in the hope that they might dissuade or defeat them from attacking the
21   church. Having failed at their attempt, the attackers threw grenades and tear gas into the church, in
22   essence, overpowered the witnesses following which is substantial amount -- a substantial number of
23   them were killed.
24

25   Now, from paragraph 90 to 93, we draw the salient points from the evidence of these two witnesses.
26   First of all, the evidence came from two educated witnesses. I think there were perhaps two or four
27   educated witnesses that testified in this case. Both of them knew the Accused prior to the events.
28   Both of them saw the Accused at relatively short distances. Both sightings were during the day, clear
29   visibility, and they had no problems identifying him 10 years after the fact in this courtroom. The
30   Defence do not dispute that the Tutsi refugees gathered at the Mubuga parish church were attacked.
31   Paragraph 94 of my brief. But why would they? They actually brought witnesses here who claimed
32   and admit to having participated in the said attacks themselves. But, of course, they challenge the
33   fact that the Accused participated in the attack on the Tutsi refugees as we allege in the indictment at
34   paragraph 5(b)(iii) of the indictment. Interestingly enough, Your Honours, the Defence -- as we say in
35   paragraph 95 of our brief, page 29, the Defence do not dispute that the Accused participated in the
36   looting of food supplies meant for the refugees at the Mubuga parish church. In that regard, they
37   actually produced Witness DC who testified that the Accused was present, amongst other leaders, at

 1        the Mubuga church when the food supplies were looted.
 2   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 3        His mere presence would amount to looting?
 4   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
 5        I was just going to deal with that. And my submission was that we could draw the inference that at
 6        best he was an accomplice to the looting of the food supplies. Mere presence in his position as
 7        conseiller of Mubuga or Gishyita, pardon me, would have amounted and would have had a
 8        legitimising and encouraging effect on those who were looting the food. In any event, he shouldn't
 9        have been there. The Defence produced a staggering amount of witnesses to challenge the evidence
10        of two prosecution witnesses, and I wonder why. I think in total we heard nine, ten -- ten witnesses,
11        and those witnesses are identified in paragraph 96 of our brief. There are some things that are
12        interesting or that is of particular interest about this defence. Their witnesses agree that there were
13        Tutsis in that church. They agree that the food meant for the Tutsis were looted. They agree that the
14        accused was at least present when the looting was taking place. They agree that there was an attack
15        on Tutsis at the church, and the only point of contention really is whether or not the Accused was
16        there. Witness DA was their first witness and indeed their star witness, a Tutsi woman. She claims
17        she sought refuge inside the Mubuga parish. She confirms that the food was looted, all right. She
18        even confirms that girls were killed in the cemetery. She confirms the attack at the church. She
19        confirms the sort of weapons that were used to attack the church and the fact that grenades were
20        thrown into the church, but she says it was the bourgmestre and not the Accused. However, Witness
21        DA, a Defence witness, concedes that there were people amongst those attackers that she couldn't
22        recognise. A lot of her evidence was hearsay but nevertheless very interesting. We urge you to
23        reject it in its entirety.
24

25        Witness DD was another defence witness, another Tutsi, and he claimed to have sought refuge also
26        at the Mubuga church. He confirms that the food was looted; blames somebody else for it, of course;
27        confirms that there was an attack at the church but he says that no one was raped at the church, no
28        one was raped at the church. But how would he know? He wasn't there. Witness DD testified that
29        he fled from the area of the church on the morning of the 15th of April 1994. The testimony is
30        interesting. He says he escaped from the church around about the time that we say that the attack
31        commenced and he did so through the window. We say he is lying, and we say you should reject his
32        testimony in its entirety. No weapons were distributed, Witness DD says, but he wasn't there, so he
33        wouldn't know.
34

35        Witness DF was the first man to confess -- to having confessed in taking part in the attack at
36        Mubuga church. The witness himself confessed to taking part in the attack on the 14th, pardon me,
37        and not on the 15th. He actually accepts that he was not at the church, and he was not a witness to

 1   the attack on the 15th. We had problems with the credibility of this witness and we say so in
 2   paragraph 119 to 123 of our closing arguments, page 34. In essence, Witness DF wanted you to
 3   believe that he took part in the attack on the women at the presbytery, and that when the women were
 4   abducted from the presbytery and taken to the Mubuga cemetery, he was present, and was therefore
 5   able to provide an alibi for the Accused or at least a defence for him that he, the Accused, was not
 6   present during the attack on those said women. Why do we disbelieve him? Well, we disbelieve him
 7   because we believe that he has purposefully enhanced his role in that attack in order to provide a
 8   defence for the Accused, and we say so at paragraph 119. In describing the same event to the
 9   prosecutor in Rwanda on the 13th of July 2000, the witness said, I am unable to explain -- I'm not
10   quoting, but, in essence, he was unable to explain what happened at the cemetery because he had
11   not gone there himself, and then he turns up in Arusha and tells us that the Accused in this case was
12   not present during the attack at the cemetery. We make far reaching conclusions in relation to his
13   credibility at paragraph 212 and 123 of chapter 4. In essence, Witness DF has a problem with being
14   truthful, and even his own peers have made that judgement of him, and the evidence is before you,
15   Your Honours, Prosecution Exhibit 64.
16

17   Witness DL was the next Defence witness. He said his family was located at the Mubuga church.
18   They had gone there as refugees. His evidence was simply incredible. First of all, he tells us that
19   Defence Witnesses DF and DG have confessed to killing the women at the Mubuga cemetery. Well,
20   there is nothing further from the truth than that, because DF certainly did not confess to anybody
21   about that. It's not in his confession. The only conclusion we could draw from DL's evidence is that
22   he has no direct knowledge of anything, and if he knows and said that DF and DG have confessed to
23   the killing of the women at the Mubuga cemetery, then it means that they colluded to make up that
24   testimony because it doesn't exist anyway. It doesn't exist in any confession statement produced
25   before this Court. We urge you to disregard the evidence of DL because he is not credible.
26

27   Witness DZ is the man who claims that he has several confession statements that do not exist in his
28   criminal file. He was one of a thousand attackers that took part in the attack on Tutsi at the
29   Mubuga parish, but he says he was ordered to do so by somebody else and diminishes his
30   responsibility substantially by saying that all he did was stand at a road several metres, 100 metres,
31   away to intercept fleeing Tutsis. Amongst 1,000 attackers, he didn't see the Accused. But
32   Prosecution Exhibit 70, Your Honours, shows you that he never confessed to taking part in the attack
33   at Mubuga. Having been cornered, he says, "Well, I have another confession statement. You don't
34   have it." We drew his attention to a document he wrote himself to the prosecutor in Kibuye dated the
35   19th of January 2004, entitled "Correction to confession statement of 23rd May 2002." We said, "Sir,
36   you still didn't mention being involved in Mubuga or any other attack." He says, "Well, there is still
37   one more confession statement somewhere else," and that is the confession statement that my

 1   learned friend has tried to introduce before this Courtroom today. In essence, Witness DZ constantly
 2   lied before Your Honours, changed his testimony by the hour. But what was most shocking about it
 3   was that he started off his testimony by telling Your Honours that "I can't read or write." Four hours
 4   into his testimony, having warmed up into the process of lying, he had forgotten his testimony. I gave
 5   him a document and he read it, Prosecution Exhibit 71. He read it and he even admitted that he wrote
 6   the document himself. So much for Witness DZ. We urge you to reject his testimony in its entirety.
 7

 8   Witness DAA: He was one of 6,000 attackers at the Mubuga church. Amazing. And he says
 9   Mika Muhimana was not present there on the 15th of April. He says, "I was recruited by other local
10   authorities but not the Accused." But the question is, how do you single Mubuga out of 6,000
11   attackers? However, whilst you disregard his testimony, one thing that is important about it, though, is
12   that he tells you how influential and the role played by the local authorities in Kibuye in all these
13   attacks, and he does that very eloquently. He did that very eloquently in his testimony. In that regard,
14   Witness DAA testified, referring to the local authorities, at paragraph 158 of my brief, "If those people
15   had not come to rally us, things would not have happened that way. We did not have any problems
16   with our neighbours, we were on good terms." The Defence then called Witness DG, and in essence,
17   he confirms the abduction story of the girls, but he says they were never raped before they were
18   killed. He implicates others, and in his defence, he says, "Well, I never saw the Accused between the
19   months of April and August 1994." Interestingly enough, when we look at his confession statement to
20   the Rwandan government, yet again, there is no mention of the abduction -- there is no mention of his
21   involvement in the abduction or the killing of any girls. Witness DG swears that he participated. But
22   why would anybody want to implicate themselves in what they didn't do? In this case, it's to provide a
23   defence for the Accused. Your Honours, Witness DC testified that there were refugees at the
24   Mubuga church. He is our good friend, the man who actually implicates the Accused in the looting or
25   at least in the looting of food by claiming that he was present; he confirms the killing of the girls at the
26   Mubuga cemetery and places Mika Muhimana in and around Mubuga church around about the
27   14th of April 1994. In essence, Your Honours, the evidence of DC, which is summarised on pages 42
28   and 43, destroys the evidence of five Defence witnesses. These five of them just have to die a
29   sudden death just based on DC's evidence. Everyone that says that Mika Muhimana was not at the
30   Mubuga church dies a sudden death; everyone that says that Mika Muhimana was not implicated in
31   the looting or was not present when the food was looted is simply incredible. We will suggest to you
32   that, in essence, the testimony of DG, DAA, DL, DD and DA, if for no other reason, have to be
33   discredited based on the evidence of DC.
34

35   Last, but not the least, the Defence called or relied on the evidence of TQ1, and his defence was very
36   simple: I know that the Accused was at home mourning his dead son between the 8th and the 16th of
37   April; therefore, he could have been nowhere else. It's as simple as that. So, in essence, we say at

                              LESLIE TODD - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 20
     MUHIMANA                                                                     TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   paragraph 180, so if any other defence witness comes and places the Accused outside his residence
 2   between the 8th and the 16th of April then there must be something wrong somewhere. For those
 3   reasons we say that Witness TQ1 is incredibly -- his evidence is incredible and unreliable.
 4

 5   So there you have it, Your Honours. We have gone through ten witnesses. With the exception of
 6   one, DC, most of them are incredible. And what does that one say? Well, the one implicates him in
 7   the looting of food. So much for a defence for the indictment, paragraph 5(b)(i), (ii), (iii). Simply no
 8   defence. Therefore, we urge you to consider the evidence of Witnesses AV and AF as proving
 9   beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused participated in the killing of Tutsi civilians gathered at
10   the Mubuga parish church between the 14th and 15th of April 1994.
11

12   Going to Mugonero complex, the allegation is at paragraph 187 of our brief, and it's simply that on one
13   day, about 6,000 civilians who were congregated at the Mugonero church -- Mugonero complex,
14   pardon me -- which is comprised of a church, a hospital, a nursing school were killed. We say that the
15   Accused, acting in concert with others named at paragraph 5(c) of the indictment, bear full
16   responsibility for this. In support of our allegation, we rely on the evidence of six prosecution
17   witnesses outlined at paragraph 188. Some of them are also witnesses that we rely on in relation to
18   the rape allegation which Mrs. Madenga will deal with at length in her submissions. It would suffice it
19   to say, Your Honours, that Witnesses BG, BI, BH and AU and BJ knew the Accused prior to the
20   16th of April. BG saw him leading attackers; he was armed and he was leading. She identified him in
21   court. BI, another educated witness, saw the Accused at the complex shooting at Tutsis. He was the
22   man who witnessed the Hutu women married to Tutsis being evacuated from the complex.

 2   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: (Continuing)
 3        BH saw the Accused conveying attackers to the complex in the Gishyita commune office vehicle.
 4        BH also saw the Accused shooting at refugees.
 5

 6        AU, Witness AU, he knew the Accused very well, Your Honours. He was located inside the surgical
 7        ward in the main hospital building, in the basement. She, pardon me. And she saw the Accused with
 8        other attackers, armed with a gun and a club.
 9

10        Witness BJ sought refuge in room number 3 of the main hospital building. She saw the Accused
11        carrying out an attack on women at the hospital. And my colleague will deal with that at length.
12

13        Witness AT, AT saw the Accused at the complex with other local authorities and he also sought
14        refuge in the surgical room in the basement of the main hospital building. She saw the Accused -- or
15        he saw the Accused and two other people enter the room. The other people were soldiers, and they
16        did very bad things to the three girls in that room. Again, that will be dealt with at length in a separate
17        submission.
18

19        My learned friends for the Defence do not dispute, Your Honours, that an attack took place at the
20        Mugonero complex. In fact, they relied on the evidence of some people who claim -- DI, Witness DI,
21        who claimed he participated in that attack. In essence, they rely also on the evidence of three other
22        witnesses: TQ1 -- AR1, TQ1 and 28, so there are four in total.
23

24        TQ1 is the man or the woman who said the Accused never left his house between the 8th and the
25        16th. We've dealt with that before in relation to Mubuga. There isn't much to say about him.
26

27        DI, for his part, confessed that -- or testified that he had participated in the attack. DI is at page 53 of
28        chapter 4, paragraphs 224 down. So he says, "Well, I was at Mugonero complex and I participated in
29        attacking those 6,000 people, but the Accused was not there." And he was not there because, like
30        TQ1, DK also said that the Accused was mourning his dead child. But what DI doesn't tell us is how
31        he came about to know that. There's no direct relationship with the Accused. It was not public
32        knowledge, as far as we are aware, that the Accused was in this position. And he testifies right after
33        TQ1 and says pretty much the same thing, that he couldn't have been there.

35        So how would he have come about this information? We suggest that he was briefed on this
36        evidence by the Defence. The confession statement of DI states that he participated at the Mugonero
37        complex attack, the attack at the Mugonero complex, all right. But having said that, the contents of

                                   KAREN HOLM - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 22
         MUHIMANA                                                                      TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1       the confession statement is at variance to the evidence before Your Honours. So what DI does is that
 2       he comes here and he diminishes his responsibility before Your Honours and says, "You know what?
 3       I just had a club and I didn't kill anyone with my club, even though I participated in this attack."
 4

 5       Unknown to DI, however, we have his confession statement from Rwanda which says, well, he killed
 6       six people and hence he's a Category 1 offender. Our position is, so what do we believe? "You've
 7       confessed to the Rwandan authorities that you've killed six people but then you came here and you
 8       said that you didn't kill anyone. So how can we rely on your evidence in relation to whether or not
 9       Mr. Muhimana was at the complex?" Based on that, we say he is not credible.
10

11       In any event, on the merit of the testimony that he provides, he says to you there were hundreds of
12       attackers at the complex, the first statement. Then he says, "Well, I myself did not enter any of the
13       buildings in the complex, so I stayed outside." Well, that being the case, he wouldn't have seen the
14       Accused because he was in the building for most of the time, doing bad things.
15

16       AR1 was not present at the complex. That's our position. And if he wasn't present at the complex, he
17       couldn't have had knowledge of anything that went on at the complex. And I'm not going to dwell on
18       his testimony at any great length but to say that it's on page 54 to 55, paragraphs 233 to 242 of our
19       closing brief. No, I'm sorry, 233 to 234 of our closing brief, just two paragraphs.
20

21       Then we have TQ28, who sought refuge at the complex and says he left the complex at 7 a.m. on the
22       16th of April 1994. So having left the complex, he says, "We went to the CCDFP building in Gishyita,
23       and whilst we were there, lo and behold the Accused walks up and visits us." This is on the 16th of
24       April, 1994. What TQ28 had forgotten is that he had testified in the Ntakirutimana trial, which this
25       same team handled several years ago, and we remembered him distinctly as telling us during that trial
26       that he had actually left the Mugonero complex several days before the 16th of April 1994, and that no
27       one, no local authority whatsoever, had visited them, he and his family, whilst they were at the
28       CCDFP building. That was three years before his evidence here. So in 2004 he says, "Well, actually,
29       I remained at the complex until the morning of the 16th so I have reason to know everything that
30       happened there, and then I also saw the Accused that morning in Gishyita. He came to visit us."
31

32       We have outlined those contradictions to Your Honours at 235, paragraph 235 to 242 of the
33       Prosecutor's closing brief at chapter 4. We say he is simply incredible.
34   MADAM PRESIDENT:
35       There is the evidence of Witness TQ28 that Mika visited -- welcomed them, rather, at CCDFP along
36       with the bourgmestre.

 1   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
 2        Yes, pretty much, that he had seen the Accused at the CCDFP that morning, yes.
 3   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 4        Along with Charles Sikubwabo?
 5   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
 6        Possibly, Your Honour. I didn't make that note, but it's possible. It's possible, Your Honour. I could
 7        check up on that, but I -- yes, yes, it's in paragraph 236. Yes, yes. Yes, it's paragraph 236 on
 8        page 55 of my brief. He does mention the bourgmestre, Your Honour.
 9   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
10        Do you contend we should -- in your paragraph 239, do you take into account what you state there in
11        assessing his credibility?
12   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
13        Your Honour, yes, I had actually, in my bid to speed up my presentation, I -- I think it goes to his
14        credibility, and for the record, we make a submission at paragraph 239 that the Witness TQ8 had
15        testified that he only met with members of his Defence team, or the Defence team in this case, for
16        more than a minute, during which he was asked to look very briefly at the paper. Well, we all know,
17        Your Honours, that witnesses don't meet with counsel for a minute, and I think that was -- that was a
18        very untrue statement. So the answer is yes, Your Honour.
19

20        Finally, the submissions that we make haven't gone through these four or five witnesses. Well, none
21        of these are credible and none of them really challenge the Prosecution's case in relation to what
22        went on at Mugonero. What is important about Mugonero is that it's a single event that occurred on a
23        single date, in a very -- in an area that is not extremely large. The evidence is direct. It's focused and
24        pointed, and when my colleague Miss Madenga makes her submissions in relation to the allegations
25        of sexual violence, you will see that the circumstances of those events mean that it is more likely than
26        not that those witnesses are speaking the truth and had very good reason to identify and implicate the
27        Accused in the attacks at Mugonero.
28

29        Finally, Your Honours, my submissions in relation to Bisesero and for the reasons that I've outlined,
30        Your Honours, at paragraphs -- at paragraphs 320 to 330 on pages 71 and 73, I am not going to dwell
31        terribly much on the Bisesero events and the reasons for this.
32

33        Bisesero, as we've stated in those paragraphs, is a very unique situation. There was nowhere else in
34        Rwanda where the attacks on Tutsis were resisted as much as Bisesero. The physical layout of
35        Bisesero is such that it's a combination of hills that span two communes. And the attacks in Bisesero
36        were sustained and spanned a three-month period. The only place in Rwanda where Tutsis were
37        being killed as late as June 1994 was Bisesero on such scale. Therefore, it's important to outline, as

                                  KAREN HOLM - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 24
     MUHIMANA                                                                      TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   we've done in paragraph 326, that it was particularly difficult for many Prosecution witnesses to
 2   remember with any degree of precision the dates and precise location of the attacks that were
 3   launched upon them in Bisesero.
 4

 5   Having said that, there were certain attacks that were large enough to remain in the mind, the dates of
 6   which remain in the minds of those witnesses, and such was the attack that was launched at Muyira
 7   on the 13th and 14th of May 1994 as alleged in paragraph 5D-6 of the indictment and as described by
 8   Prosecution witnesses AW and W.
 9

10   The submissions I've made in paragraph 326 also have to be seen in the context that many of the
11   Tutsi refugees that were gathered in Bisesero were not native to the Bisesero area and therefore not
12   familiar with that area itself. Of course, the attractiveness of Bisesero lay in the fact that the area
13   consisted of several hills with white summits and provided the refugees with a vantage point from
14   which they could see the attackers approaching. We have adduced and relied on the evidence of
15   some ten witnesses: BG, BI, W, AV, BB, BU, BC, BL and AP, and we would represent to
16   Your Honours that the evidence of these ten witnesses was extremely clear, direct, and was
17   convincing. These witnesses have provided you with a firsthand account of what they heard
18   throughout this period.
19

20   There are certain things that are consistent throughout the evidence. They all describe the Accused
21   as having led as the commander -- sorry, having acted as though he was a commander of an
22   armoury, encouraging his troops. The totality of the evidence of all the Prosecution witnesses who
23   have talked about sightings of the Accused in Bisesero describe a consistent pattern of criminal
24   conduct between the months of April and June.
25

26   I would represent, Your Honours, that the circumstances of the identification was good. Most of the
27   time, it was daylight, most of the witnesses at relatively short distances to the Accused. Most of them
28   had known him for several years prior to the events and therefore had no difficulty in identifying him
29   in -- before the Tribunal.
30

31   The tactics that were employed by the attackers is interesting, and it's spoken about by witnesses
32   AW, BB and BC. That consisted of luring Tutsis out of their hiding places with promises that medical
33   attention would be given to them. Three different witnesses talk about this. And they say that, more
34   often than not, the day after they saw the Accused and others trying to lure them out, there was often
35   a large-scale attack after such. We will represent to Your Honours that this indicated a consistent
36   pattern of conduct and these three witnesses just couldn't have made this up. This must have been
37   something that they actually experienced.

 1   The Defence do not dispute that these attacks took place at Bisesero. Many of their witnesses, at
 2   least four of them, DF, DY, DK and DL, all participated in attacks. Some of them, like Witness MN6,
 3   MN6, on page 34 of our brief, sought to provide him with an alibi. I'm not suggesting that MN6, by the
 4   way, is one of those who participated in the attack.
 5

 6   MN6 was an alibi witness who claims that he had seen the Accused no less than 15 times between
 7   the 8th and 27th of May 1994. Your Honours would not forget that witness in a hurry. It will suffice to
 8   say that as far as we are concerned, the evidence of this Witness MN6 does not provide the Accused
 9   with an alibi. He had no reason to keep a record of the important occasions when he claimed to have
10   seen the Accused, and his account of those meetings were, for the most part, inconsistent. We have
11   made those submissions at length at paragraphs 336 to 351.
12

13   Witness AH8, alpha-hotel-8, was another alibi witness. He was on holiday from teaching and was
14   bombing around with his brother, distributing goods during the genocide. It is our position and our
15   respectful submission, as indicated in paragraphs 357 to 359, that this witness is not a witness of
16   truth.
17

18   Witness DF, we encounter again, was one of the witnesses, and we have made submissions in
19   relation to him at paragraph 316 to 332. We also rely on the submissions that I made earlier in
20   relation to his testimony.
21

22   We also have Witness DY, who also claimed that he participated in attacks, and he's a witness who
23   deliberately enhances his role in the attacks so that he can provide some defence for the Accused.
24   We would refer Your Honours to our previous submissions on paragraphs -- at paragraphs 119 to 123
25   of this brief, and I have dealt with that earlier on in my testimony. That's for Witness DF.
26

27   Witness DK and DL all claim to have participated in the attacks at Bisesero and all claim that the
28   Accused, for one reason or the other, was not present at Bisesero.
29

30   Witness DL is interesting because he is the man who tells us that there was not a single Interahamwe
31   that participated in the attack at Bisesero for a three-month period. I think that sums up the sort of
32   person that Witness DL is, and we needn't say more on that.
33

34   Witness DK is the subject of the application by my learned friend, and again, of course, having been
35   confronted with the fact that his confession statement was at variance to his testimony before the
36   Tribunal, he then sought to invoke this story about having an additional confession and that is why we
37   have told you that he is -- his evidence is unreliable.

 1        Your Honours, if you believe any of the ten witnesses that we have called to support the variation
 2        allegations in Bisesero, and there are quite a number of them, we say that you should find the
 3        Accused guilty, just based on the evidence of a single witness at any location, of the crime of
 4        genocide, pursuant to Article 6.1 of the Statute.
 5

 6        Your Honours, I have taken up a little bit more than I planned to and I would now invite, with your
 7        leave, of course, my colleague Mrs. Madenga to address you in relation to the rape. Thank you for
 8        listening.
 9   MADAM PRESIDENT:
10        Thank you, Mr. Phillips. We still believe that you will be able to conclude the arguments today.
11   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
12        Your Honours took 45 minutes of my time listening to a motion, and I didn't incorporate that time in my
13        undertaking but we hope to, even if we just have to draw your attention to, like I did, towards the end.
14        We hope to.
15   MADAM PRESIDENT:
16        Yes, Ms. Madenga.
17   JUDGE SHORT:
18        Just one second.
19

20        Mr. Kapaya, before you sit down, you have led evidence about the Accused being involved in the
21        murder of specific individuals.
22   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
23        Yes, Your Honour.
24   JUDGE SHORT:
25        It has been submitted that in some of those cases, for example, the murder of AX's children, there is
26        nowhere in the indictment where mention is made of these murders. What's your response to this
27        submission by the Defence that, for that reason, the indictment is defective insofar as there isn't
28        specific mention in the indictment about the identity of the victims, the place of the crime, et cetera?
29   MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
30        Your Honour, not to take the wind out of Mr. Kapaya's submissions, these were matters that he was
31        going to deal with because they are part of murder as a crime against humanity. So I would ask him
32        to take specific note of your queries and to address those.
33

34        I'm grateful, Your Honour.
35   MADAM PRESIDENT:

 5   MS. MADENGA:
 6       Thank you. Afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours.
 7

 8       On the 29th of March of 2004, the Prosecutor submitted to the Honourable Chamber that what will
 9       distinguish the Accused Mika Muhimana from all the accused persons who have appeared before the
10       Honourable Chamber or who are going to appear before the Chamber is Mika Muhimana's hallmark.
11       Mika violated women. So the question this afternoon is: We have heard from Prosecution witnesses;
12       we have heard from survivors and eyewitnesses; this far, what has the Prosecution proved? The
13       Prosecution's evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that, in fact, Mika Muhimana raped brutally
14       and indiscriminately and that rape was perpetrated as a crime against humanity.
15

16       I'll dwell on four brief points and I'll be very brief. I'll just highlight one or two things on the law relating
17       to rape and also on the definition. I'll also make observations on the factual allegations supporting
18       various paragraphs of the instant brief. I'll talk from Mika Muhimana's home in Gishyita. I'll move on
19       to Mubuga parish, to Mugonero hospital. I'll end up with Bisesero. I'll also address the
20       Honourable Court on the evidence which has not been specifically pleaded in the instant indictment,
21       yet our witnesses credibly testified to those.
22

23       So with your leave, Your Honours, I'll move briefly to the law. Why are we saying the rape which Mika
24       perpetrated constituted a crime against humanity? Its inhumane nature, the character of the rape, the
25       great suffering, that is physically, psychologically, mentally, which the rape caused on the victims. It
26       was also committed in the content of a widespread and a very systematic attack which was targeted
27       on Tutsis. This was in Rwanda, in general, as has already been established by so many cases which
28       I'll refer to later. It also occurred in Kibuye préfecture. This attack was also targeted at some of the
29       women whom the Court will remember are Hutu. I'm referring in particular to AX and BJ. Why were
30       they targeted?
31

32       Firstly, I want to dwell on why civilian women were targeted. They were discriminated basically on
33       three grounds: They were raped by Mika Muhimana because of their ethnicity. They were Tutsi or
34       they were perceived to be Tutsi by association. For example, AX was married to a Tutsi. BJ was
35       working for a Tutsi household and she also sought refuge at Mugonero complex. They were also
36       discriminated on their perceived political orientation. They were perceived to be supporters of RPF.
37       This we infer from the language that was used during the rape when they were referred to as Inyenzi.

                                   KAREN HOLM - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 28

 1       They were also discriminated on the ground of gender. They were simply raped because they were
 2       women. I'm alive to the fact there were sexual mutilations of men, but the rape and its brutality was
 3       targeted at these women because of their gender. I want now to briefly look at the definition of rape in
 4       international law. In defining rape in international law, we are going to dwell on the statement of law
 5       which is authoritative as opposed to persuasive. This is as formulated in Akayesu. So in that regard,
 6       the Prosecutor will submit to the Honourable Court when we refer to rape at the national level, in the
 7       national law, we are referring to a physical invasion of a sexual nature which is committed on a person
 8       under circumstances which are coercive.
 9

10       We also look at sexual violence because it includes rape. This, in the formulation of Akayesu, is
11       considered to be an act of a sexual nature which is committed on a person under circumstances
12       which are coercive. Your Honours, in making this submission, I am aware of the development of
13       jurisprudence in ICTY. I am aware of the expounding legal pronunciations made by cases like
14       Furundzija and Kunarac , but I still submit humbly to the Court that our case Muhimana is
15       distinguished from those cases and falls within the four corners of parameters of Akayesu.
16

17       With your leave, Your Honour, I would move on to the factual allegations in support of rape.
18   MADAM PRESIDENT:
19       Before you move on to the -- to prove the crime of rape, four conditions are to be fulfilled. You must
20       not forget. That is the time of crime, the place of the event, and method of crime, identity of the victim.
21       So keep these conditions in mind when you argue your case.
22   MS. MADENGA:
23       Thank you, Your Honour, I'll keep that in mind when I do the specific submissions on the specific
24       rapes perpetrated on the victims.
25

26       I would like to invite the Honourable Chamber to come with me to the events in Gishyita. In our
27       closing brief, these are located in paragraphs 18 to 24. I'll not repeat in detail the allegations.
28

29       The first paragraph relates to a meeting which, in our view, started the killings and the rapes. I will
30       address the Court also in addition to that about the rape of the 7th of April 1994. I want to draw the
31       Court's attention to Prosecution brief on pages 89 to 92 which relates to the meeting in person and
32       also which talks about the rape which I'm going to address.
33

34       The meeting, we relied on the evidence of AP and AQ, and according to those witnesses, a meeting
35       was held on the 7th of April 1994, and the outcome of that meeting was that there were atrocities
36       which were perpetrated in Gishyita. Our witnesses credibly told the Court the agenda of the meeting.
37       I refer to the evidence of AQ.

 1   AQ actually indicated that she heard that the meeting was there to sensitise the Hutu population to
 2   exterminate the Tutsi. The question is, how did AQ know that that was the agenda of this meeting?
 3   AQ had the advantage of staying with Mika Muhimana. She was related to the Accused person so
 4   she actually heard because she had inside information, she was staying in the house. AP, on the
 5   other hand, was a neighbour, also living in Gishyita. She actually related that, even prior to events of
 6   April 1994, she had witnessed numerous meetings at Mika's place, but then she talked specifically of
 7   a meeting which took place a day after the death of the president. It's common cause that the
 8   president died on the 6th. So we can infer that she is talking of on or about the 7th. I'm aware that
 9   AQ put the meeting at the middle of April. I will address that later.
10

11   After this meeting, we now want to go and say what was the outcome of the meeting. Because for all
12   we know, none of our witnesses attended the meeting. AQ was from a seeing distance, identifying
13   some of the political figures who were there. Ruzindana was there. Charles Sikubwabo was there.
14

15   But what was the outcome of the meeting? The outcome of the meeting was on the 7th of April 1994
16   AP tells us that Mika Muhimana took the two girls, that is Gorreti and Languida Kamukina, from their
17   home. I will also address on the identity of the witness because I'm aware of the fact that, at one
18   stage, although it was relayed that it was Gorreti, our witness said that it was Immaculée who was
19   taken from the parents' home. On this fateful evening the witness saw Mika taking the girls.
20

21   I want to come to a stage where the girls were at Mika's house. Your Honours will remember that we
22   did not adduce evidence, direct evidence, as to what happened in Mika's house, but I want to highlight
23   the established facts.
24

25   It was established from AP that the girls walked freely and happily. They followed Mika because Mika
26   was a family friend. He was someone whom they knew. The witness AP also knew, as a matter of
27   fact, that when events unfolded in Gishyita, the girls' father had actually given a cow to Mika
28   Muhimana. Why did he do that? Because violence was imminent. Mika was a very influential person
29   and the father wanted Mika to protect the children.
30

31   Why did AP follow Mika to his house? AP was also a mother. Because of the same natural instincts,
32   she also wanted Mika to protect her own children. So she wanted to know what was going to happen
33   to these girls so that she would also ask Mika for protection.
34

35   What did she see? Arriving at Mika's house, she identified that there were many people there. She
36   identified one Charles Sikubwabo by voice. She did not enter Mika's house because she was
37   following from a distance. What happened? She heard from that distance where she was, the girls

 1   now screaming. She also heard the girls asking for Mika's pardon. She also heard the girls actually
 2   stating that whatever Mika was doing to the girls, the girls least expected it. All of a sudden, she did
 3   not hear anything.
 4

 5   The next thing she saw were naked girls, the same two girls, they were now shoved out of Mika's
 6   house. There were now Interahamwes around Mika's house. Mika himself said something to the
 7   effect that the Interahamwes and the young persons who were there should come and have a clear
 8   view of how Tutsi girls' vaginas looked like.
 9

10   AP also noted something which is very pertinent which I want to highlight. As the girls were being
11   shoved out of Mika's house and they were stark naked, something had happened to them in terms of
12   their physical demeanour. They were now not walking properly. In fact, they were staggering. Before
13   she could conclude as to what had happened, she actually saw one of the girls being attacked and
14   she ran away.
15

16   From the established facts, Your Honours, the only reasonable inference a reasonable Court can
17   draw is that the girls were sexually assaulted. This will go within the parameters of the formulation of
18   Akayesu.
19

20   I want to emphasise the fact that the witness at one stage referred to one of the victims as
21   Immaculée. She actually gave a reasonable explanation why she mistook Gorreti for Immaculée.
22   She explained that when people die or pass away, it's very easy to forget their names. To me, this is
23   a very plausible explanation given the fact that these events happened ten years ago. AP herself is a
24   survivor of very, very traumatic conditions and circumstances.
25

26   The other point I want to highlight is the fact indeed there was a young woman called Gorreti who
27   lived in Gishyita. This was actually buttressed by the Defence witness DQ, who is actually AQ's own
28   sister. She confirmed that, in fact, Languida and Gorreti were sisters. So when we referred to AP
29   mistaking Immaculée for Gorreti, she is not like fabricating a victim. There indeed existed in Gishyita
30   Gorreti, who was raped brutally by Mika Muhimana, and subsequently killed.
31

32   With your leave, Your Honours, I will not discuss in detail the Defence case because some of the
33   witnesses have already been discussed by my colleague. I just want to highlight those Defence
34   witnesses who stated that indeed there was no meeting which was held which actually oiled the
35   wheels of the genocide. Some of those witnesses include, and are not limited to, DI, NTI, and DS. I
36   want to indicate that under the circumstances we are talking about, violence had erupted.

 1   Mika Muhimana was the conseiller of Gishyita. Common sense will dictate that a meeting of some
 2   sort was supposed to be held. So for witnesses to come and insist that no meeting was held, at one
 3   stage, a Defence witness actually indicated that the other reason why a meeting was not held is that
 4   Charles Sikubwabo, the bourgmestre, and Mika Muhimana, the conseiller, were not in good books.
 5   But now we know as a matter of fact that they were participating together, as will be revealed during
 6   the course of the brief. So I'll not dwell on that.
 7

 8   I want now to move to another rape which was perpetrated in Gishyita. I want to refer Your Honours
 9   to paragraph 85 of the Prosecution brief. We are talking of the rape of AX. We have actually detailed
10   and summarised the evidence so I'll not repeat the evidence per se. But what I want to highlight is in
11   fact, firstly, as requested by Madam President, the venue of the rape.
12

13   Witness AX was very clear about the venue. It was an office which was adjacent to Mika Muhimana's
14   place of residence. She actually indicated it was Seth Bimenyimana’s house. This venue, she
15   identified it easily as Prosecution Exhibit P. 2E.
16

17   I also want to highlight one thing about AX. AX was also very consistent about the venue. I will refer
18   the Honourable Court to Prosecution Exhibit P2 again. This time, I will refer specifically to K-numbers,
19   K0286221. Your Honours will remember that the investigator made indications with AX, and AX, as
20   early as the 18th of March 2004, actually indicated the same place to the investigator. So when AX
21   came in Court, she gave the same consistency as to the venue.
22

23   I also want to highlight the identity of AX. AX was a Hutu woman who was targeted because her
24   family were Tutsi. The husband was Tutsi, so the children were automatically regarded as Tutsi.
25   That was their crime. Because of that, AX herself indicated that she considered Mika Muhimana a
26   brother by virtue of being Hutu. In that regard, there is no way AX could come and falsely indicate
27   Mika Muhimana. She credibly told the Court that she was raped twice at the secteur office, which she
28   clearly identified. She also described in detail how she was raped and what she perceived as rape,
29   and all this is included in the closing brief.
30

31   She added that she perceived herself that rape is when someone has sexual intercourse with you
32   without your consent, and she said this is what happened to her. She is an elderly woman who knows
33   what sexual intercourse is, and she told the Court that that is what Mika Muhimana did. She also
34   outlined the circumstances. There was violence. She was being targeted with her family. The
35   second rape actually happened when both the husband and the mother had actually been killed. Her
36   own children were killed, and this was actually corroborated in a very material way by none other than
37   a Defence witness, DU, a self-confessed genocidaire, came to tell the Court that he was responsible

 2   MS. MADENGA: (Continuing)
 3        If AX was so credible that the Defence witness corroborated what she was saying, Your Honour, we
 4        ask on what basis can we say a respectable Hutu would come and say, "My brother, who is also a
 5        Hutu, raped me twice in a secteur office"? AX would have no reason, absolutely no reason to lie
 6        against Mika.
 7

 8        Your Honour, with your leave, I now want to move to the events in Mubuga, but before I do so, I want
 9        to refer the Court to paragraphs 98 up to 104 of the Prosecution's closing brief, which deals with
10        Mika Muhimana's individual criminal responsibility, and I also want to indicate that both -- the three
11        witnesses, AQ, AP, AX, provided evidence that, in fact, Mika raped, and raped brutally. I am leaving
12        the address of AQ's rape to when I describe those incidents which are not specifically pleaded in the
13        indictment. In that regard, Mika participated in the meetings; Mika participated in the killings; Mika
14        participated in the rapes of these women. In that regard, he is responsible for the rape, and his mere
15        presence as an official gave a significantly legitimising effect on other perpetraters.
16

17        Now I move to the events which occurred in Mubuga parish. These are located and described in
18        detail on paragraph 105 to paragraph 117 of the Prosecution's brief. Your Honours would note that
19        the Prosecution is alleging that the Interahamwes and Mika raped three girls: Colette, Agnes
20        Mukagatare and Alphonsine. I would like, first of all, to start with the role which Mika played. As for
21        the others, the rapes are detailed on the cited paragraphs and I will not repeat them, but relating to
22        the rape of Agnes, I want to refer the Honourable Court to both the evidence of AV and AF. This has
23        been discussed in detail by my colleague here, Mr. Phillips, so what I now want to highlight is the
24        identity of the witnesses.
25

26        AF, basically, placed Mika Muhimana in Mubuga on the 14th or 15th of April 1994, when we allege
27        that Mika raped Agnes. AF also heard that women were raped, but it is the evidence of AV which I
28        want to dwell on. Her demeanour and credibility has already been alluded to by my colleague. I'll not
29        talk about demeanour, I'll not talk about her credibility, which is obvious, I will now talk about how
30        Mika perpetrated the rape on Agnes. This witness credibly told the Honourable Court that she knew
31        Agnes, she identified Agnes, she also knew Mika Muhimana. She was at the crime -- at the crime
32        scene, that is, at Mubuga massacre -- Mubuga cemetery, I beg your pardon. What did AV see Mika
33        doing? AV saw Mika, at a very close distance, shamelessly undressing, shamelessly giving his own
34        clothes to an Interahamwe, another man who was waiting, and then proceeded to get hold of Agnes,
35        to fall (sic) her down, and then rape her, and then the witness, who was within hearing distance,
36        actually heard Agnes crying with pain.

 1       Soon after the rape, Agnes saw Mika taking a bayonet; Mika was about to kill Agnes. At a point of
 2       desperation, Agnes pleaded and made an oral application to Mika. She was not asking that Mika
 3       should not kill her; she asked to be killed by a gun. I want to draw the attention of the Court to what
 4       Mika said, because it is not only what he was doing, but sometimes he was adding insult to injury.
 5       Mika loved to scorn -- that was Mika's response -- and further humiliated Agnes. Mika told -- in fact,
 6       he didn't tell her, Mika ordered Agnes to stand up and not to undress. He --
 7   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
 8       Not to undress or not to dress?
 9   MS. MADENGA:
10       Thank you, Your Honour. He ordered her not to dress. She then -- Agnes was ordered to stand up in
11       that state when she was stark naked. Mika then told the Interahamwe to continue with their work.
12       The witness also heard Mika saying to the Interahamwes, "They should not kill her before they saw --
13       see her guts." We asked the witness to explain, because we didn't want to speculate what she
14       understood by this. She understood that before being raped by the Interahamwes, they were
15       supposed to disembowel her. The witness confirmed that he then received a report from one Cum
16       spelt C-U-M, to the effect that, indeed, Agnes and the other girls were raped --
17   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
18       Before raping, Madam Madenga, she was to be disembowelled not before being raped but before
19       being killed.
20   MS. MADENGA:
21       Very well, Your Honour, it was before her death.
22

23       We had reached the stage where AV, our witness, then received a report to the effect that, indeed,
24       Agnes and the other girls were not only raped by the Interahamwes but they were also cut to pieces. I
25       will not go further on those details. I just wanted to emphasise the nature of the crime against
26       humanity, the inhumane part of it; I will leave the death and the killing to my colleague, Mr. Kapaya.
27

28       I also want to look at the Defence case. My colleague has done justice in terms of analysing the
29       Defence witnesses who were at Mubuga, so I am not going to repeat that. What I am going to
30       highlight is the evidence of DC. DC is a Defence witness who actually placed Mika Muhimana at
31       Mubuga on or about the 14th of April 1994. The relevant part of DC's evidence was that he also,
32       despite being a Defence witness, heard that women were raped. So DC corroborated the
33       Prosecution case in a very material way.
34

35       And I also want to highlight that DC was not impeached. The Defence did not apply that the
36       Honourable Court would actually declare him hostile, so I take it in good faith that this is what
37       happened. Mika Muhimana was at the site, the massacre site, and also we can infer from his

 1       reputation that he raped.
 2   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
 3       Sorry, we can infer from what?
 4   MS. MADENGA:
 5       Your Honour?
 6   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
 7       We are making an inference from what?
 8   MS. MADENGA:
 9       We are making an inference from his consistent pattern of conduct. If AV said Mika raped, raped
10       brutally, then we see a Defence witness coming to tell us that Mika was there at Mubuga and that
11       women were raped --
12   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
13       Does the Defence witness in fact tell us Mika was there or does she tell us that she knew women
14       were raped?
15   MS. MADENGA:
16       To my recollection, Your Honour, Witness DC told the Honourable Court that Mika was present
17       among the looters on the 14th or 15th of April. We are alleging that the rapes took place on the 15th,
18       so it's like, if Mika was there on the 14th, the other reason why Mika was not supposed to be there
19       was that it was mourning period, he was supposed to be mourning his own son; but if Mika can be
20       there for looting then we are inferring that he can also be there for raping. It was part of the broad
21       policy of genocide.
22   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
23       If you find that reference where this is said, "Mika was there," just let me know.
24   MS. MADENGA:
25       Very well, Your Worship, I will refer you to that part. Can I say ---
26   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
27       Go on now, but if you ever get that particular reference, just refer it to me.
28   MS. MADENGA:
29       Yes. I am actually referring to our Prosecution brief paragraph 127. It's Chapter 5; I am referring to
30       Chapter 5, and I am referring -- if I can read, Your Honour, with your leave.
31   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
32       One, two, seven; I can read for you. It doesn't say that he testified that Mika was there.
33   MS. MADENGA:
34       In fact, Your Honour, what I am saying is that we are inferring from his testimony, because DC
35       testified that while at the church, he had heard about girls who were killed in the cemetery, and that is
36       according to his testimony of the 17th of August 2004, page 6. Then if we go on to read
37       paragraph 127 of the closing brief, it says that the witness also heard that women were raped.

 1   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 2       Madam, do you think that inference is enough to qualify the commission of the offence -- commission
 3       of rape?
 4   MS. MADENGA:
 5       Your Honour, taken in isolation, it will be insufficient, but then I am taking the cumulative effect of the
 6       evidence. I am taking a bit of what the Defence told us about Mika, whom we thought and also
 7       sympathised with him that he could not leave Gishyita because the son had died. Now we get
 8       information -- so it is like we are putting all the bits and pieces together, what the Prosecution
 9       witnesses are saying, especially AF and AV, then we are actually cumulatively looking at what
10       Defence Witness DC is saying. So I am simply urging the Court that they could make that reasonable
11       inference, but I am alive to the fact that the Court for reasons which I respect, might actually decide
12       not to infer.
13   MADAM PRESIDENT:
14       Did Witness DC say that there were rapes committed?
15   MS. MADENGA:
16       To my recollection, that is what the witness said, that he heard that women were raped.
17   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
18       For my part, that is correct. What he didn't say is that "Mika was there", which is what you are asking
19       us to infer.
20   MS. MADENGA:
21       Thank you, Your Honour. What I am saying is, as a matter of fact, that DC said when he saw people
22       who were looting on the 14th of April 1994, he identified among the looters or people who were
23       present with the looters, Mika Muhimana. So, in my humble view, we are looking at the period on or
24       about the 14th or 15th. So I am saying, at least on the 14th --
25   MADAM PRESIDENT:
26       The looting was also on the 14th?
27   MS. MADENGA:
28       Yeah, he said "about the 14th", so I said it was on the 14th.
29   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
30       And you are saying if somebody can loot, he can rape; is that what you are saying?
31   JUDGE SHORT:
32       (Microphone not activated)
33   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
34       Then how does the looting lead to Mika being at the rape?
35   MS. MADENGA:
36       Your Honour, what I am saying is that the Defence presented to us in alibi that Mika Muhimana could
37       not be at the sites, he could not rape in Mubuga, because he was undergoing a mourning period for

 1       his son from the 8th to the 15th, but all a sudden, the same Defence presents to us a witness saying
 2       that Mika was there on the 14th. If Mika was there on the 14th, what would bar him from being there
 3       on the 15th?
 4   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
 5       I now follow your argument. "Being there" is being at Mubuga church. That's the place we now find
 6       Mika, as opposed to being on his veranda mourning his son?
 7   MS. MADENGA:
 8       Very well, Your Honour.
 9   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
10       Continue.
11   MS. MADENGA:
12       With your leave, I will continue.
13

14       Your Honours, I am now looking at the events at Mugonero complex. Mugonero complex is in
15       Gishyita commune, and these are dealt in detail in the Prosecution's closing brief, paragraphs 134 to
16       139. We are talking about the abduction and rape of three girls: Josiana, Mariana and Martha. Your
17       worship -- Your Honours, I would just like to highlight the events which we are alleging in paragraph 6,
18       subparagraph (c) of the instant brief. Witness BI, who was supporting the Prosecution case, actually
19       indicated that about the 14th -- the 13th or 14th, he identified Mika Muhimana came to Mugonero
20       complex.
21

22       My colleague has already described how many of the refugees were at Mugonera and why. I just
23       want to emphasise the anxiety, because we might ask why was BI so observant? Because you will
24       notice from his testimony that he was very fond of details. He was a very educated man. They were
25       there gathering and they did not know their fate. When the attackers initially approached, they
26       actually staged what I would call a mock attack, where the gendarmes pretended they were protecting
27       the refugees but then allowed Mika Muhimana and Charles Sikubwabo and an Interahamwe to go and
28       take three women to a house at Mugonero. They saw these women aboard a communal vehicle. BA
29       -- BI did not speculate as to what happened to the girls, but the next day, in the afternoon, he saw the
30       three girls come back. He knew them before the incidents -- before the incident. They were Josiana,
31       they were Mariana, Martha. He identified their identity because he was very familiar to them. When
32       they came back, like anyone else, he was anxious because everyone wanted to know their fate. He
33       got a report to the effect that Mika Muhimana, Charles Sikubwabo, Gisambo, had taken the three girls
34       to Mika Muhimana's house in Gishyita and they had been repeatedly raped.
35

36       When I deal with the evidence of AQ, Your Honours, I will refer to the portion where AQ also indicated
37       that during the course of the genocide, she would hear people screaming. So there is every

 1   possibility that the venue for this rape was at Mika's house. And I also want to highlight, why would BI
 2   tell the Honourable Court that it was the three women who were abducted and who went and were
 3   raped, if they were not? Because you will find that the gist of the Defence case is that these women
 4   were not raped. If you refer to the evidence of TQZ -- in fact, let me repeat that, it was TQ7. TQ7 was
 5   adamant that Martha was away during the material time; she was attending a course because she
 6   was in the nursing fraternity. She also indicated that Mariana could not have been raped; Mariana
 7   was away in Kigali staying with her brother. He also indicated that Josiana could not have been
 8   raped, although she was at Mugonero. TQ7 did not come to hear that she was raped. But we know
 9   from common experience that when there is a disaster, the first thing one person thinks about is
10   home. TQ7 was not there on or about the 14th to 16th of April 1994. He considered that he was not
11   there at Mugonera. So on what basis can he come and tell with audacity, the Honourable Court, that
12   the girls were not abducted? On what basis can he tell the Honourable Chamber that the girls were
13   not raped? The girls themselves gave a report to BI.
14

15   One of their colleagues, a Tutsi, who was also waiting for the same fate with them, who could identify
16   with their predicament; they were all desperate, there was no need to lie. The girls told the truth of
17   what happened. What happened was that they were taken to Mika's home where they were
18   repeatedly raped and they were brought back to Mugonero where they then faced their deaths.
19

20   All the other Defence witnesses, people like ARI, who claimed that he went with Martha and Mariana,
21   also stated that they were away, but ARI, for all we know, was not at Mugonero at that time, so how
22   would they know that the girls were not abducted and how would they know that the girls were not
23   raped. I can go on and on. AH8, who was a Defence witness, actually stated that when violence
24   erupted in Rwanda, even those people who were supposed to go back to school, did not. So, if those
25   people could not go to school, how can the Defence witness say they were away attending a training
26   course? Which training course are we talking about?
27

28   I can go on and on. I can talk about TQ8, a gendarme who also came to say, " No, no, Marie was in
29   Kigali." Yet by implication, if one carefully analyses his evidence, he was not in Mugonero during the
30   period of 18th to 19th of April. So on what basis can a gendarme come and tell us that the girls were
31   neither raped nor abducted?
32

33   Your Honours, I will move on to the rape of Mukasine, which is discussed in detail on paragraphs 169
34   to 174 of the Prosecution brief. The Prosecution witness who testified is AT. We have just got the
35   pronunciation in the Ntakirutimana judgement, where AT testified as GG. The Trial Chamber
36   considered that he was credible, and this was confirmed by the Court of Appeal. He was very good in
37   details. He mentioned the rape was perpetrated on the 16th of April 1994. He also stated why he

 1       was there. He also identified Mika Muhimana, a conseiller he had known for a long time. So identity
 2       was not in issue.
 3   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 4       Madam Madenga, are you telling us to convict the Accused on the basis of the evidence which was
 5       recorded in another case?
 6   MS. MADENGA:
 7       No, Madam President. What I am simply urging the Court is that the witness we presented, because
 8       it is the Defence contention if you look at the Defence draft brief, that Witness GG in Ntakirutimana
 9       who was Witness AT in Muhimana is not a credible witness. So, what I am saying is that that
10       credibility was tested and proved by the Trial Chamber in Ntakirutimana. It was further confirmed. So
11       I am actually saying, before I even tell the Honourable Court the highlights of AT's evidence --
12   MADAM PRESIDENT:
13       You are telling us that his credibility in another case should be taken into consideration while
14       assessing his evidence in this case?
15   MS. MADENGA:
16       Madam President, that per se cannot work for the Prosecution; I wish it could, but it is the Defence
17       contention because they are basically saying AT is not credible. So what I am saying is that if the
18       credibility was tested, we still have to test it, but we know where we are coming from; we know who
19       we are dealing with when we talk of AT. Because you will notice from his testimony that he is one of
20       the Prosecution witnesses who gave evidence in detail, even relating to the colour of the dress the
21       victim was wearing, the colour of the clothes Mika Muhimana was wearing when he was doing his bad
22       things.
23   MADAM PRESIDENT:
24       Go on.
25   MS. MADENGA:
26       Thank you, Your Honour. I will proceed.
27

28       I now just want us to focus on the rape of Mukasine as described by AT. AT related the rape of two
29       other victims by Interahamwes, but I just want to highlight for the purposes of this closing argument,
30       the rape of Mukasine by Mika Muhimana, especially the full description of the rape.
31

32       I just want to refer the Honourable Court to page 119 of the Prosecution’s brief, especially the footnote
33       written 658, where the witness gave a full description, and I just want to read briefly how Mika --
34   MADAM PRESIDENT:
35       Which page?
36   MS. MADENGA:
37       I am talking about page 119 of the Prosecution brief. I will cite the paragraph. My colleague is just

 1       assisting me. That one we quoted verbatim from the transcript of the 20th of April 2004. It's 172, I
 2       beg your pardon. It's paragraph 172, Your Honours.
 3   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 4       Yes.
 5   MS. MADENGA:
 6       And the footnote which says it's a description of how Mika Muhimana perpetrated the rape: "The
 7       Accused removed his trousers, removed his penis and introduced it in the vagina orifice of the
 8       woman, and while the Accused was doing this the young lady was crying, screaming, which means
 9       that she did not want to do what the Accused wanted her to do." This is just to highlight, in addition to
10       the coercive circumstances, what was also happening in terms of the victim and the response, which
11       was actually highlighted by Witness AT.
12

13       I want to move on to the Defence contentions, which are discussed in full on paragraphs 175 to 192 of
14       the Prosecution's brief. It is very clear that the Defence actually contended, like what they did with the
15       other witnesses, that Mukasine was at Butare University. I will not labour the Court with the same
16       argument. We are talking of a violence within a violence: There was no one at Butare University.
17       People were struggling to get to safety.
18

19       With your leave, Your Honours, I will now move to the rape of Mukasine, Murekatete, and BJ, which is
20       fully discussed by the Prosecutor on paragraphs 193 to 200 of the brief. I just want to remind the
21       Honourable Court about this Witness BJ. In doing so, I will make sure that I don't jeopardise her
22       safety, so I will not give further details but to say that she was a very beautiful Hutu (sic) girl. At the
23       material time, when she was exploited and raped by Mika Muhimana, she was only 15 years old. I
24       want to refer specifically to BJ's demeanour in Court. Your Honours will recollect that she had a very
25       forgiving spirit. She actually -- she actually looked at the Accused person, she smiled and said, "God
26       should help us, because now Mika is a Muslim." It's like she did not have that bitterness.
27

28       Her evidence had a distinct ring of truth. She identified Mika Muhimana. She also saw these two
29       girls. She also gave detail of how these two girls were raped. On her part, she actually describes
30       how Mika raped her, for three minutes. She had no reason to falsely implicate Mika. She identified
31       Mika positively in court, and I have already said she knew Mika before. The defence here, the
32       contention was generally that Mika Muhimana was not in Mugonero, that this girl was not there: "Why
33       would she be there? She was a Tutsi" That is basically the Defence contention in their draft brief.
34       But this girl, in inferring from her evidence, she had a very sharp sense of equality; she did not talk in
35       terms of Hutu or Tutsi. One might call it naiveté, but I would call it civilisation. She did not even know
36       it was the Tutsi who were targeted. She just regarded herself as a Rwandan girl working for a
37       Rwandan family. There was violence. She went to Mugonero. Then Mika, who was a bad law unto

 1   himself, raped the girl.
 2

 3   I would move on, with your leave, Your Honours, to look at the rape of Johaneta, Theresa
 4   Mukabutera, and Eugenia, contained in paragraph 202 to 210. By virtue of the details given by
 5   Prosecution Witness BH, I would not like to add a lot but just to highlight that the same company who
 6   has identified Mika Muhimana was in the company of Alphonsine and Muyaimana (sic), the
 7   perpetraters were known to the witness, and also BH knew the victims. So if we talk in terms of
 8   identifying the victims as part of an element, BH did that to all satisfaction.
 9

10   I also want to highlight how SF already said Mika would add insult to injury. BH told us that when the
11   girls were approached by Mika, Mika started addressing them, calling them arrogant, and the victims
12   were very distressed. These utterances, why am I referring to them? It also shows that the rapes
13   were not perpetrated in isolation. Mika was advancing a broader policy of a crime against humanity
14   towards Tutsi civilian women. And, also, besides the details given by BH, I would not want to
15   comment in detail because I know my colleague is going to dwell on that and, basically, the Defence
16   contention was the same in relation to the victims: They could not be there at Mugonero. Yet what
17   we know as a matter of fact is that the same Defence witnesses were not there at the time of the rape,
18   so they can't, actually, credibly, tell us of what happened in their absence.
19

20   With your leave, Your Honours, I am now moving to the rape of AU, which is discussed in paragraphs
21   215 to 218 of the Prosecution brief. Your Honours will remember AU as someone who was extremely
22   traumatised. The rationale is very easy to understand: She had testified her entire family were killed
23   on this day, her parents, her children. She subsequently heard that even her husband who was
24   outside the complex was killed. So when she was approached by Mika Muhimana, she actually was
25   already traumatised and she described in detail how Mika raped her and that during the process, Mika
26   was also, like, hitting her head against the wall. All these circumstances were very coercive, very
27   traumatising. I know the Defence dwelt at length about the venue, the small room, but in essence she
28   acquitted herself very well. She described the way she was raped, how she was raped. And we
29   know why she was raped: She was raped because she was Tutsi.
30

31   With your leave, Your Honours, I am now moving to address the Court on the allegation contained in
32   paragraph 635 of the instant indictment, which is on paragraph 342 of the Prosecution brief. The
33   Honourable Court will recall that this charge relating to the rape of Elaina Drocelle (phonetic) was not
34   actually proved by the state. It was subject to a Rule 92 bis application, since the witnesses in this
35   case were either dead or could not be located. In that regard, I will not submit anything further. I will
36   just wish to say that the Prosecution will actually withdraw that charge for lack of evidence.

 1   The individual criminal responsibility of the Accused person in relation to Mugonero has been well
 2   discussed in paragraphs 224 to 229, so I will only add that as conseiller, Mika Muhimana's presence
 3   authorised other attackers to rape; Mika Muhimana himself raped.
 4

 5   With your leave, Your Honours, I am moving now to the last part of the submission which deals with
 6   the Bisesero rapes. This is documented in the brief -- the Prosecution brief starting from
 7   paragraph 230. Your Honours, I will start with the rape of BG, which is described in full on paragraph
 8   230. We will recall from her testimony that BG herself said she cannot forget the 22nd of April 1994.
 9   She cannot forget the specific time, that it was 3:30 p.m., the darkest day in her life, when Mika
10   Muhimana authorised a big Interahamwe by the name Mugonero to go and rape her. One would like
11   to actually carefully scrutinise the witness statement and say, how did Mika Muhimana authorise
12   Mugonero to go and rape BG?
13

14   BG actually stated that Mika Muhimana acted like he was the commander of an army. So the big
15   Interahamwe was under his command, as it were. So when the big Interahamwe asked to go and
16   smell the body of a Tutsi woman, we specifically asked the witness what she understood. She
17   actually stated that she understood that Mugonero was asking from the chief, Mika Muhimana, to go
18   and rape her. It is our humble submission that we have now come very far with Mika Muhimana, from
19   Gishyita, from Mubuga, from Mugonero. So if an Interahamwe told Mika Muhimana that he wanted to
20   smell the body of a Tutsi woman, it can be inferred that Mika Muhimana must have known what the
21   Interahamwe meant, judging from his consistent pattern of conduct and his own sexual appetite, how
22   he violated women, and how he raped.
23

24   The Defence called numerous witnesses. I just want to dwell on DAC, who gave testimony, and in the
25   course of doing that, there were glaring contradictions in his own testimony. This witness would want
26   the Court to believe that BG, from the attack at Mugonero, came to his place of residence, met this
27   Hutu man, Mugonero -- I am sorry about the coincidence of names, but there is Mugonero complex
28   where BG was attacked and then Mugonero, the big Interahamwe. So DAC, the Defence witness,
29   gave an impression that the two fell in love, there was a marriage, so in actual fact BG consented to
30   whatever happened between her and Mugonero.
31

32   I just want to refer the Honourable Court to the provisions of Rule 96. Although the Defence tried,
33   like, to cross-examine BG inferring that she had actually consented, procedurally they did not follow
34   the regulations, they did not even establish an air of reality that BG had consented. In fact, when one
35   carefully analyses their Defence, it was based on the witness statement of the 14th of -- it was of
36   1995, where the witness herself actually indicated that from Mugonero complex she did not go straight
37   to Bisesero but passed through Ngoma or Gishyita. The Witness BG actually explained the

                         JUDITH BAVERSTOCK - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 43
     MUHIMANA                                                                    TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   inconsistency in her statement. She stated that when she gave that statement, she was so
 2   traumatised that she cannot even recall the contents of that statement. She testified in the
 3   Ntakirutimana case. She gave the same consistent explanation.
 4

 5   Seeing this loophole, the Defence brought DAC. It was clear that DAC had been thoroughly briefed.
 6   He was trying to use that loophole as an explanation. But then, there were so many other glaring
 7   contradictions: DAC could not even remember how many children BG had, yet he was claiming that
 8   she was a very close friend; when Mugonero was attacked they were very concerned, they went to
 9   look for her, when she came home she found a Hutu boyfriend. But from all we know from her
10   evidence, she had actually left her own children with another lady. If the Defence contention was
11   reasonable and true, one would imagine that the first discussion would focus around the wellbeing of
12   the children, but DAC as a matter of fact said, "We did not discuss those issues." It's very, very
13   obvious, crystal clear, that DAC was not talking of an encounter with BG; BG never went to DAC's
14   house.
15

16   Even another witness, DAB, who purportedly accompanied BG to Mugonero's house, gave evidence
17   which was stranger than fiction. We have a Hutu man, Mugonero. According to the Defence
18   contention, he has just married a Tutsi woman, the bridegroom is never at home; he is supposed to
19   be herding a cow or cattle, so he leaves DAB to take care of the bride during the supposed
20   honeymoon period. Even DAB and DAC were contradicting each other. Why did BG, who was well
21   loved by Mugonero, decide to leave Mugonero's place? According to DAC, he had discovered that
22   BG's parents or husband was not killed in Mugonero complex, so now BG was afraid that the
23   husband would discover that now she is having an affair with a Hutu man. According to the other
24   witness, the reason is that the Interahamwes were hunting Tutsi, so she was now unsafe. The
25   contradictions are so glaring that the only reasonable explanation is that there was never this
26   marriage between BG and Mugonero. It will actually buttress what BG herself said, that there were
27   Interahamwes who were guarding them. So whoever claims to have been at Mugonero's place, was
28   there not to look after a newly-wedded bride, but to make sure that she does not escape because she
29   was imprisoned for sexual favours. The reason why she could not be allowed to go out, the reason
30   why she truthfully testified that even Mugonero's own mother would feed her from the house; she was
31   not allowed to escape. She only escaped when she actually realised that the Interahamwes were
32   feasting on the lootings they had made, then she had an opportunity.
33

34   Your Honour, I also refer to the rape of Virginie Gasherebuka, which is in paragraph 257. The
35   Prosecutor, also like what I said in relation to the other count, did not lead evidence on this count, and
36   accordingly, the Prosecution will withdraw that charge and we are not going to make any submissions.

 1       We will now deal briefly with the rape of Pascasie Mukarema, which is contained in paragraph 259 to
 2       266 of the Prosecution brief. Madam President has already drawn my attention to specifically relate
 3       to the evidence of rape. This is a case where I actually want to highlight the elements, because we
 4       have a situation described credibly by Prosecution Witness AW from where he is hiding; he actually
 5       saw Mika Muhimana and the Interahamwes approaching Mukarema. I just want to emphasise the
 6       condition of Mukarema: She was pregnant at that time. She was in Bisesero. My colleague has
 7       already told us why they were all in Bisesero; it was like the last point of war. Pregnant as she was,
 8       when Mika Muhimana saw her, Mika personally took a machete. Mika caused Pascasie to lie down.
 9       He proceeded to cut her from the breast right through her genitals. Mika then removed the baby. It is
10       AW's evidence that this baby cried for some time, then the Interahamwe proceeded to cut off
11       Pascasie's hands, then he sharpened objects and pierced the objects in the arms of the victim --
12   MADAM PRESIDENT:
13       Madam Madenga, how would you describe this incident as rape?
14   MS. MADENGA:
15       Thank you, Your Honour, because that is where I am coming to now. And before I even submit it is
16       rape, I just want to say I am (sic) the privilege of appearing before the Chambers which is like
17       making law, because my perception of this Trial Chamber is that although we have authoritative
18       jurisprudence from ICTR, although we have persuasive jurisprudence from ICTY, what the Court is
19       doing is actually making law, groundbreaking legal laws which are going to take us from Akayesu, so
20       that is where I am now going in trying to describe why we classify what happened to this woman as
21       rape.
22

23       In fact, in doing so, I will also start with the formulation in Akayesu. Basically, the formulation in
24       Akayesu emphasised that when we talk of rape we are emphasising its aggressive nature; we cannot
25       quantify it in terms of bodily organs. So in its broadest concept, we are looking at someone's sexual
26       integrity. There we have Mika Muhimana, he has a machete, he targeted the victim on the breast. I
27       have told the Court that women were raped because they were women. By targeting the breasts,
28       they are looking at the sexual organs of a woman, starting from the reproductive organs. So he cut
29       from the breast --
30   MADAM PRESIDENT:
31       Looking at the sexual organs of a woman would amount to --
32   MS. MADENGA:
33       I am still explaining, Your Honour. Because that per se might not amount to rape, but then that's what
34       I am trying to explain, all the actus rea and mens rea which constitute rape according to Akayesu. So
35       what I am saying is that while Mika is wielding the machete, cutting the woman from the breast to the
36       genitals, that machete obviously interfered with her sexual organs. Pascasie was cut from the breast
37       to the genitals. So what happened with Mika Muhimana's machete is that it actually interfered with

 2   MS. MADENGA: (Continuing)
 3        And according to the broad formulation in Akayesu, where someone's sexual integrity is being
 4        attacked, and I don't see a more relevant example than this, because the whole sexual anatomy of a
 5        woman should not be taken in isolation. When we say sexual integrity, what do we mean? We mean
 6        a whole being. So where a machete moves across her genitals, if that is not interference or an attack
 7        on a woman's sexual autonomy, then, Your Honours, I really don't know what it is.
 8   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
 9        The question the Court is grappling with is, is every such attack rape?
10   MS. MADENGA:
11        No, Your Honour. No, Your Honour, but I am saying in these circumstances because sometimes you
12        can have an act which can be described as rape; sometimes you have an act which can be described
13        as sexual assault or violence. Sometimes you have an act which can be described as an inhuman
14        act, outrageous or sexual on personal dignity, but I am saying during the course of the genocide, what
15        was happening, we don't have the best way to describe it, but it also -- looking at the mens rea and
16        actus reas can also be described as rape.
17

18        Of course, I will be guided by the Court. It was just a submission I was making so that the Court
19        would actually squarely look at the facts and guide me properly.
20   JUDGE SHORT:
21        Just give the definition in Akayesu and tell us how that definition fits the description here as to what
22        happened. What is the exact description or definition of rape in Akayesu?
23   MS. MADENGA:
24        Your Honour, I will just refer to the definition which I have already given, that rape as formulated in
25        Akayesu is a physical invasion. So the first thing which Akayesu is looking at is an invasion which is
26        physical. Then it also goes on to say it is of a sexual nature. And then --
27   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
28        That is the critical part.
29   MS. MADENGA:
30        Yes. Yes, because that is when now -- I was looking at the sexuality of it, that is when I started to
31        describe about the breasts; that is when I started to go according to his modus operandi because
32        when you cut up to the genitals -- that is where I was actually going.
33   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
34        Is the cutter being sexual?
35   MS. MADENGA:
36        That is also where I will revert back to Akayesu because Akayesu went on to describe that the objects
37        or the physical assault -- we are not talking of something which is intrinsically sexual, because the

                                  SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 47
         MUHIMANA                                                                       TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1       cutting itself is a physical invasion, but the sexual part of it -- I was now referring to targeting
 2       someone's genitals as sexual organs, that is where I was going to.
 3   JUDGE MUTHOGA:
 4       In other words, if I were to pick a machete and got hold of a young man and plucked out his genitals,
 5       would I have committed rape?
 6   MS. MADENGA:
 7       Your Honour, it depends on the facts because I don't want really to speculate on hypothetical case,
 8       but what I would say is, depending on where the Chamber is sitting now, because I have actually
 9       addressed the Chamber saying that from where I am sitting now, I see the Chamber as going into
10       ground-breaking legal directions. It's like you can actually describe -- if Your Honour actually
11       describes to me the incident you have just described, and then come with a legal pronouncement that
12       it is rape, then it depends on your reasons, just like Akayesu. Before Akayesu, we were depending on
13       national jurisdictions, and what do national jurisdictions say? Basically, when they talk of rape, they
14       are not even talking about man being raped, it's not gender neutral; they are talking of women. They
15       are talking of consent. They are talking of the penis being introduced into the vagina, however slight,
16       but the path-breaking case of Akayesu took us from those national jurisdictions and gave us an
17       international perspective, because when we deal with genocide, it is not something which we
18       experienced in our national jurisdictions. That is why I am squarely in the hands of the Court to guide
19       me because it's a ground-breaking case. What happened in Rwanda, I never saw in Zimbabwe. So
20       that's why I say the Court is making new law because what happened is new in Africa. The
21       magnitude of that genocide, the widespread and systematic rape of women indiscriminately, brutally,
22       we don't have experience in that.
23

24       Thank you, Your Honours.
25   MADAM PRESIDENT:
26       Yes, please go on.
27   MS. MADENGA:
28       Thank you, Your Honours.
29

30       I will go to describe also briefly the Defence contentions. They just gave a general defence that Mika
31       was not there in Bisesero. So after describing this rape, I will move quickly to the rape of
32       Felicité Kankuyu which is described in full at paragraph 269 to 275 of the closing brief.
33

34       Felicité, when we want to talk in terms of identifying the victim, was described by AU. He knew her
35       before, she was a school teacher in Nyarutovu. She was a married person with children. What
36       happened? She was also in the place of last hope in Bisesero, but when Mika Muhimana came all
37       hell broke loose. Mika Muhimana undressed, had sexual intercourse with Felicité and then the

                                SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 48
     MUHIMANA                                                                     TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   Interahamwes who were in the company of Mika Muhimana then took pieces of wood, they thrust
 2   them into Felicité's vagina. As a result of this, they inflicted grievous bodily harm which led to
 3   Felicité's death. So this -- we have already seen the circumstances why they were there, these
 4   women in Bisesero, and now the witness has described how Mika perpetrated the rape.
 5

 6   The Defence also, as I have said, have depended on the general allegation that Mika was not there,
 7   yet AU knew Mika as a conseiller and also identified him positively. So when Witness AU says Mika
 8   was there, he knows what he is talking about. He is a very credible witness; his credibility will be
 9   talked at length by my colleague when he addresses the Honourable Court on murder.
10

11   Lastly, I want to talk about the additional evidence of rape not specifically pleaded in the indictment. I
12   have talked at length about respecting jurisprudence. We have heard the pronouncements in
13   Ntakirutimana Appeals Chambers. Your Honours will remember that we submitted our brief before
14   the Ntakirutimana pronouncements. But when we wanted also to keep abreast with the law, we read
15   thoroughly that judgment, and in view of what the Court said, we are no longer maintaining the view
16   that all the charges which are not specifically pleaded in the indictment should be considered by the
17   Honourable Court for purposes of convicting the accused person. What we are saying now is that
18   those instances highlight the persistent pattern of conduct on Mika Muhimana. They only go a long
19   way to enhance who we are talking of. That is why BJ added that she also got a report from Evelyn
20   telling her that whilst in Bisesero, she was gang-raped by Interahamwes and Mika Muhimana. This is
21   not pleaded, but it should actually buttress what other witnesses were saying. The same applies to
22   what BI, when she talked about Mukasine being raped and also describing the rape because the
23   witness actually said Accused tore Mukasine's clothes, proceeded to have sexual intercourse with
24   her. The witness was well positioned to see what was happening. So, it is very clear, it is proven
25   beyond reasonable doubt that Mika Muhimana actually raped Mukasine.
26

27   The same applies with BU. We are now in Bisesero. We just see Mika Muhimana's brutality when he
28   rapes, because this witness actually told the Court that Mika Muhimana has acquired for himself a
29   very extraordinary reputation. He was now very notorious. So when he met this woman Josephine,
30   Josephine pleaded with Mika not to kill her. Mika referred to her as a first lady who was arrogant.
31   That is buttressing what we were saying that Mika was perpetrating the rapes as part of a broader
32   policy. Accused proceeded to have sexual intercourse with Josephine, and true to Mika Muhimana's
33   reputation, he abandoned Josephine to the Interahamwes, and what did the Interahamwes do to her?
34   They cut off her legs and her arms and they left her to die slowly, that is after the rape.
35

36   And lastly, we have another rape which was not pleaded, that is the rape of BB in Bisesero. Here the
37   rape which was described by BB -- I beg your pardon, is the rape of Theresa Mukabutera. Theresa,

                           SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 49
         MUHIMANA                                                                    TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1       Your Honours will remember how she was raped and also what happened to her after the rape. In
 2       fact, after the rape, they actually placed the child -- because this woman had a child, they placed the
 3       child as though the child was having sexual intercourse with its mother. So this is typically
 4       Mika Muhimana. So it only goes to show what kind of brutality we are talking about.
 5

 6       I would lastly talk about AQ. I had actually emphasised that I would also address the additional rapes
 7       perpetrated on AQ when I talk of the rapes not pleaded in the indictment. The rapes perpetrated on
 8       AQ were not pleaded in the indictment. The witness herself explained why to the Court she only
 9       opened up a few weeks before trial, and that is when the Defence were notified about the additional
10       rape allegations. Those allegations were omitted in all her statements. When this happened, she
11       was only 15 years old. Tutsis were being killed. Her sister Esperance, who was living with her, had
12       been raped consistently and persistently by Mika Muhimana. She was then abducted and was killed.
13       So when this rape happened to her, she stated that she did not tell anyone. She did not even tell
14       Mika's wife, who was her aunt. She only opened up after some counselling. This is very
15       understandable given her age, given the mother (sic) of all violence which had erupted; she was very
16       vulnerable. So it shows that she was very credible, but it also shows that Mika started raping at his
17       own home, to Mubuga, to Mugonero, then to the last place of hope, Bisesero. And what all these
18       rapes have shown is that he raped brutally and indiscriminately.
19

20       In a few seconds, Your Honours, I will sit down and leave it to the collective wisdom of the Bench. We
21       have seen the pain. The Prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt who caused the pain; it is
22       Mika Muhimana.
23

24       Thank you, Your Honours.
25   MADAM PRESIDENT:
26       Madam Madenga, before you sit down, I have a question for you.
27   MS. MADENGA:
28       Thank you, Madam President.
29   MADAM PRESIDENT:
30       There appears to be some confusion on the identification or in the names of some of the victims who
31       had been raped by Mika.
32   MS. MADENGA:
33       Yes, Your Honour.
34   MADAM PRESIDENT:
35       In paragraph 6C(i) of the indictment, you referred to a lady named Murekatete.
36   MS. MADENGA:
37       Murekatete, yes, Madam President.

                              SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 50
         MUHIMANA                                                                     TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 2       Whereas in paragraph 6C(ii) she is referred to as Eugenia, this is the evidence of some of the
 3       witnesses. We suggest that Eugenia Murekatete is the same person, the same witness as the person
 4       who had been raped by the Accused.
 5

 6       Again in paragraph 6C, it refers to a victim named Josiana, while in paragraph No. 6C she is referred
 7       to as Johaneta. According to the evidence of some of the witnesses, she is the same person; it is the
 8       name of the same person, Josiana or Johaneta.
 9

10       Again there is a name in paragraph 6C(i) which refers to Mukasine Kajongi, and then in paragraph
11       No. 6C(ii) there is reference only to Mukasine. How would you qualify this confusion in the names of
12       the victims?
13   MS. MADENGA:
14       Thank you, Madam President. Maybe I start with the last name Mukasine. We have Mukasine who is
15       specifically mentioned on 6C(i) and is given like a surname like Mukasine Kajongi.
16   MADAM PRESIDENT:
17       And then in 26C(ii) she is only referred to as Mukasine.
18   MS. MADENGA:
19       Your Honour, Mukasine as referred to on 6C(i) is referred to as Mukasine Kajongi, and the Court will
20       remember Witness AT actually describing that she was the daughter of one Isaac Kajongi who was
21       employed at Mugonero complex.
22

23       When we look at the other Mukasine, now I am referring to 6C(ii), Your Honours will recall our witness
24       BJ stating that when she was at Mugonero complex she met two girls. She could identify one
25       because one actually said -- one was a maid, they were working together, but the other one she could
26       not identify but had the name Mukasine.
27

28       It is our humble submission that we are talking of two different persons. It is only the similarities of
29       names relating to maybe how Rwandans give names, what is popular. But when we talk of the
30       Mukasine in the first instance, we are talking of a totally different person. The reason why even their
31       circumstances when it came to rape are totally different.
32

33       Then I would go to Josiana and Johaneta. The Defence contention at length was to the effect that
34       Josiana at that stage changed her name because she had failed and she was now Johaneta. But
35       what we went on to show through our witnesses is that we are talking of different instances. When we
36       talk of the first Josiana we are talking of a child to Karera; that is how the witness put it. But when we
37       talk in terms of Johaneta, we are talking of a different person. So when we led evidence from the

                               SITHEMBISO MOYO - ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III - page 51
         MUHIMANA                                                                     TUESDAY, 18 JANUARY 2005

 1       Prosecution witness, it was clear that we are talking of totally different victims who were raped in total
 2       -- although the circumstances were more or less the same, they were raped differently and they were
 3       even in different rooms; they were not one and the same persons. Josiana is Josiana who was living
 4       with Marianna and Martha, but it is not the same Johaneta who was raped together with Theresa and
 5       Eugenia.
 6   MADAM PRESIDENT:
 7       Thank you, Madam Madenga.
 8

 9       We stop for the day today here. And I have been informed that this courtroom will be available
10       tomorrow so we will start the hearing tomorrow morning at 10:30 and resume with the arguments of
11       Mr. Kapaya. Thank you.
