 1                    Mr. Wallace Kapaya, will be presenting
 2                    that motion on behalf of the Prosecutor.
 3                    I am grateful.
 4      MR. KAPAYA:
 5                    Good afternoon, Mr. President, good
 6                    afternoon, your Honours.
 7
 8                    Your Honours, this motion is pegged under
 9                    the provisions of Articles 21, 19(1) of
10                    the Statute, Rules 69 and 75 of the Rules
11                    of Procedure and Evidence.   The
12                    protection sought is for witnesses and
13                    victims as stipulated on paragraphs 2(A),
14                    (B) and (C) of the motion.   The
15                    Prosecutor requests the Chamber to issue
16                    the measures as outlined in paragraphs
17                    3(A) to (K) of the same motion.    Now, in
18                    support of the motion, the Prosecutor has
19                    filed a brief in which arguments in
20                    support of the motion are advanced, and
21                    to that end, there are also documents
22                    annexed to the said brief.
23
24                    Your Honour, as we all know, the ability
25                    of the Tribunal to effectively fulfill


                      SHANNON L FLEMING - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

 1              its mandate depends on the availability
 2              of witnesses to come and testify.     We are
 3              saying this because immediately after the
 4              genocide in Rwanda, the few records that
 5              were there were either destroyed or went
 6              missing.    So it's on these grounds that,
 7              your Honour, it is important that
 8              witnesses be procured for purposes of
 9              coming to give evidence in this Tribunal.
10              The availability of witnesses may not be
11              a problem if their security is
12              guaranteed.
13
14              Now, the need for the provision of
15              guarantees for their security arise from
16              several factors.    One of them relates to
17              the unique situation that obtains in
18              Rwanda.    Under paragraph 12 of the brief
19              which we filed in support of this motion,
20              that unique situation is well explained,
21              and with leave of your Lordship, I would
22              like to read it.
23
24              The conditions that obtain cases of
25              genocide in Rwanda being tried by the

 1              Tribunal are unique and unparalleled in
 2              history.   The perpetrators and victims
 3              and witnesses are not separated in time
 4              and space.    They are mutually inclusive
 5              cohabitants who inhabit same special
 6              enclosures in communities.    They live in
 7              such a closed limited setting that they
 8              are in absolute proximity with each
 9              other.   They cannot be separated one from
10              another in their enclosed geographical
11              contiguity.    In all similar occurrences
12              in history, distinct and identifiable
13              ethnic or geographical separation of
14              perpetrators away from the victims and
15              witnesses is possible.    In the case of
16              Rwanda, this is impossible.    And this
17              phenomenon is significant in cases that
18              an acceptable level as well as the
19              likelihood of risk and harm.
20
21              Your Honours, in this connection, I would
22              also like to draw your attention to the
23              fact that the declaration of the
24              commander of the investigation of the
25              ICTR and that of the Chief of Security of

 1                       the ICTR show that there is a real and
 2                       substantial danger that victims and
 3                       potential prosecution witnesses will be
 4                       threatened, assaulted or killed.

 7                       that are attached to the motion -- but
 8                       today we received an update of the
 9                       declaration of the Chief of Security of

11                       89(C) and (D), I would crave for your
12                       Lordships' indulgence to and request that

 1      THE PRESIDENT:
 2                       Leave is granted.
 3      MR. KAPAYA:
 4                       Thank you, very much.

 6                       Your Honour, the relevance of this
 7                       affidavit or declaration is that it
 8                       updates the annexures with we filed in
 9                       support of this motion.   If we refer to
10                       paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, it shows the
11                       current insecurity that is obtaining in
12                       Rwanda at present.   And it's for this
13                       reason that we believe that the measures
14                       applied for will save the day.
15
16                       Again, your Honour, victims and other
17                       potential witnesses living outside Rwanda
18                       are at risk from members of the former
19                       Rwandan army and the Interahamwe groups
20                       as well as members of the former civilian
21                       government of Rwanda and other
22                       corroborators who corroborated with these
23                       people.
24
25                       Thirdly, your Honour, the ICTR, as we all


                         SHANNON L FLEMING - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
                                 ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III

 1              know, has no enforcement agents of its
 2              own.   Before witnesses are brought here
 3              and after they are returned to their
 4              homes, they are not under the protection
 5              of the Tribunal.   In other words, they
 6              are under no protection.   Their safety is
 7              guaranteed only between the time they are
 8              here in Arusha, when they testify, and
 9              when they are ready to go back home.
10              Except for the protection by the national
11              government that is extended to all
12              citizens generally, witnesses and victims
13              are, so to speak, left to defend for
14              themselves.   This, your Honour, is the
15              more reason why the witnesses and victims
16              need protection.
17
18              The other reason stems from the unique
19              nature of the Kibuye indictment.   Now,
20              your Honour, as you -- it's discernible
21              from the first amended indictment that
22              the accused person, Mr. Mikaeli Muhimana,
23              is one of eight accused persons who are
24              jointly charged in this indictment.
25              Others have been tried; others are still

 1              at large; and others, like the accused
 2              person, are already in the custody of the
 3              Tribunal awaiting trial.    It's an open
 4              secret that many of the witnesses who
 5              testified in Kayishema and Ruzindana and
 6              Bagilishema cases will testify again in
 7              this case and in the other pending cases.
 8              The frequent trips that these witnesses
 9              and victims will make to Arusha will tend
10              to put them at great risk of exposure to
11              sympathizers of perpetrators of the
12              genocide.    In the Kayishema and Ruzindana
13              and Bagilishema cases, the witnesses, my
14              Lords, were protected.    Now, to
15              facilitate a risk-free availability to
16              testify in this case, we pray for the
17              measures applied for be granted.
18
19              Again, your Honour, I wish to make
20              reference to the fact that I happen to
21              have personal experience of security
22              concerns expressed by victims and
23              witnesses.   In the Bagilishema trial in
24              which I took part, witnesses literally
25              expressed fears of reprisal.    Some

 1              expressed their concerns to the Tribunal,
 2              and despite the fact that these witnesses
 3              were protected in those cases where the
 4              Tribunal had to conduct closed sessions.
 5
 6              Finally, your Honours, it's the desire of
 7              the Prosecutor to make it standard
 8              procedure that following initial
 9              appearance, she files a motion to protect
10              the identity of victims and witnesses and
11              the confidentiality of the information in
12              the witness statements that will be made
13              available during disclosure.   Now, I am
14              fortified in this desire by the
15              construction we place on the provisions
16              of Articles 19(1), Rule 66(C), Rules 69,
17              75 and 79 of the Rules of Procedure which
18              lean towards the granting of these
19              measures.
20
21              It is for these reasons, your Honours,
22              that we request that the Trial Chamber
23              grant the measures applied for, because
24              there is real and substantial danger to
25              victims and potential prosecution

 4                       Yes, Professor Songa.
 5      MR. SONGA:

 7                       if you can correct the pronunciation of
 8                       the name by pronouncing Songa instead of
 9                       Songo.
10      THE PRESIDENT:

14
15                       Mr. President, your Honours, I would like
16                       to bring to your attention the fact that
17                       Defence did not have sufficient time to
18                       file before this Tribunal and the parties

20                       would wish to make the following oral
21                       submission, which, in any case, has no
22                       fundamental objection to the requests of
23                       the Prosecutor regarding all the

 2
 3                       If you allow me, Mr. President, I can
 4                       continue with my submissions.
 5      THE PRESIDENT:
 6                       Yes, certainly, you are permitted.
 7      MR. SONGA:
 8                       Thank you, Mr. President.    The motion of
 9                       the Prosecutor is based on Article 21 of
10                       the Statute relating to protection of
11                       victims and witnesses which provides that
12                       protective measures include, without
13                       being limited to, closed sessions and the
14                       protection of identity of victims.     It is
15                       further based on Rules 69 and 71 of the
16                       Rules of Procedure.    This is why we say
17                       we have no fundamental objection to the
18                       Prosecutor's requests, for as long as
19                       this is within the confines of the Rules
20                       and the law.
21
22                       However, taking into account the
23                       interests of the victims and witnesses,
24                       there are also the rights of the accused,
25                       which are also stated in the Statute as


                         SHANNON L FLEMING - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
                                 ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER III

     MUHIMANA                                 2 MARCH 2000

 1              well as the Rules.   The Statute, first of
 2              all, talks about the rights of the
 3              accused in Article 20 and the rights of
 4              the victims one Article further on, that
 5              is Article 21.   It is also not by chance
 6              that the Article on suspects precede
 7              Articles 69 and 75 on the rights of
 8              victims and witnesses.    These are not
 9              just a simple succession of provisions.
10              This has to do with a certain hierarchy
11              of rights, those of the accused coming
12              before the victims and witnesses.    Those
13              of the accused constitute the Rules and
14              those of victims and witnesses consisting
15              of being exceptions.
16
17              Therefore, Mr. President, your Honours,
18              in examining the request of the
19              Prosecutor, should absolutely ensure that
20              while granting the requests of the
21              Prosecutor, the Accused will continue to
22              benefit from his rights to a public
23              session and a fair trial.    One of the
24              rights that the Tribunal may focus on is
25              the rights of the Accused to be able to

 1              examine the witness and to be able to
 2              understand what the witness is saying as
 3              well as to be able to evaluate and
 4              challenge his evidence.   This is only
 5              possible if questions that the witnesses
 6              are going to put are not limited and if
 7              the Accused can prepare correctly to
 8              examine witnesses.   The identity of
 9              witnesses, it should, therefore, be
10              divulged not only before the trial but at
11              a reasonable date that would enable the
12              Accused to prepare his defence to ensure
13              a fair trial.
14
15              This is why, Mr. President, your Honours,
16              I had made that the Prosecutor has to
17              disclose to Defence information likely to
18              reveal the identity of a witness or
19              victim more than seven days before the
20              presentation of this statement of the
21              witness before the Court.
22
23              Finally, Mr. President, your Honours, I
24              would like to, right from today, ensure a
25              measure of reciprocity for prosecution

 1                       witnesses as well as defence witnesses.
 2                       The time will come where it will be
 3                       necessary to bring forward defence
 4                       witnesses and who will also ask for
 5                       protective measures for them.   At that
 6                       stage, while examining the request of the
 7                       Accused, we need to ensure whether the
 8                       Prosecutor will have the same concerns
 9                       regarding the security of defence
10                       witnesses and whether they will have the
11                       same attitude of goodwill which I am
12                       showing today, even towards the belated
13                       presentation of some documents.
14
15                       Mr. President, your Honours, at the
16                       beginning of my statement I deplored the
17                       fact that I had very little time to
18                       prepare the defence of the Accused.    I
19                       would, therefore, respectively request
20                       your Tribunal to ensure all parties to
21                       produce documents which might be
22                       confidential and which might affect the
23                       requests of the Prosecutor.   Thank you,

 7      THE PRESIDENT:
 8                       We just wonder how you justify that
 9                       requirement.    We have had problems with

12                       Yes, your Honour.    Paragraph F applies,
13                       basically, to the supporting staff of the
14                       defence team, so sometimes they tend to
15                       sort of changing the investigators and
16                       what not, so we thought it would be a
17                       good idea to have their particulars.
18      THE PRESIDENT:
19                       Yes, but if they make a change, they have
20                       to report to the Registrar, wouldn't
21                       they, because the Registrar has to
22                       approve it?
23      MR. KAPAYA:
24                       Yes, your Honour.

 1                       So one would then have knowledge of the
 2                       of the change.
 3      MR. KAPAYA:
 4                       In that respect, your Honour, then I
 5                       think it can be modified as the Trial
 6                       Chamber deems fit.   Paragraph F may be
 7                       modified in the manner that the Trial
 8                       Chamber deems fit.
 9      THE PRESIDENT:
10                       Should that information be given to the
11                       Trial Chamber?   Is that the point you are
12                       making?
13      MR. KAPAYA:
14                       Yes, that is what I am saying, yes.
15      THE PRESIDENT:
16                       We can see the latter part of the
17                       sentence requiring them to hand over any
18                       documents and so forth that they might
19                       have in their possession, but we have
20                       some concerns with the earlier part.
21      MR. KAPAYA:
22                       Which portion in particular, your Honour?

 2                       above, and requiring Defence counsel to
 3                       advise the Chamber in writing of any
 4                       changes in the composition of this team.
 5     MR. KAPAYA:
 6                       Maybe, your Honour, we can substitute
 7                       "Chamber" with "Registrar", so that at
 8                       least we have a record of who is doing
 9                       what on that team.
10      THE PRESIDENT:
11                       All right.   Very well.   And your seven
12                       days seem a bit short here in paragraph
13                       H.
14      MR. KAPAYA:
15                       Maybe we can enlarge it to 21 days, your
16                       Honour.
17      THE PRESIDENT:
18                       Very well.   Yes, thank you, very much.
19      MR. KAPAYA:
20                       Thank you, my Lords.
21      THE PRESIDENT:
22                       Professor Songa, the Prosecution has
23                       agreed to amend the seven days to 21

 2      THE PRESIDENT:
 3                       Thank you, very much.    The Chamber will
 4                       reserve its decision, and the parties

13                       Mr. President, your Honours, the Accused
14                       has filed a motion for the annulment of
15                       the initial appearance which took place
16                       on the 24th of November 1999.
17                       Respectfully, through me, I wish to
18                       submit the following facts.    Mr. Mikaeli
19                       Muhimana, on 26 October 1996, was the
20                       receiver of a warrant of arrest and an
21                       order for the transfer and detention to
22                       the government of the United Republic of
23                       Tanzania.   The warrant was executed on
24                       the 8th November 1999, the date on which
25                       Muhimana was arrested in Dar Es Salaam

 8              Prosecutor of the International Criminal
 9              Tribunal for Rwanda and including other
10              accused persons, namely, Clement

12              Sikubwabo, Aloys Ndimbati, Vincent
13              Rutaganira, Ryandikayo, and Obed
14              Ruzindana charges my client with the
15              following:   Conspiracy to kill all
16              Tutsis, count one; massacres in the
17              region of Bisesero, counts 20 to 25;
18              crimes allegedly committed between the
19              1st of January and the 31th of December,
20              1994, in Kibuye, Rwanda.

22              On Wednesday, 24th November 1999, the

 1              Rwanda, pursuant to Rule 62 of the Rules
 2              of Procedure and Evidence.    At the
 3              appearance of the parties, Mr. Kiritta
 4              stood as duty counsel for the Accused.
 5              After the reading of the charges against
 6              Muhimana, the Presiding Judge asked the
 7              following question:    "We understand that
 8              you have received a copy of the
 9              indictment in Kinyarwandan".
10
11              This will be at page 20 of the
12              transcripts of the initial appearance.
13              The Accused answered as follows:       "Yes, I
14              received the indictment, your Honour, but
15              I do not quite understand the situation.
16              I never received the names of those who"
17              -- and the sentence is incomplete.
18
19              The dialogue continues as follows:      The
20              President said, "I wish you to give me a
21              direct answer to the question I put to
22              you, not to give me a statement.    You
23              said that you have received the
24              indictment in Kinyarwandan.    That is a
25              language you say you understand; is that

 1              correct"?
 2
 3              The Accused responded, "Yes, I received a
 4              document, an indictment in Kinyarwanda".
 5              And the President continues, "Did you
 6              read it"?
 7
 8              Muhimana responded, "Yes, I read it, but
 9              I was not able to have counsel with whom
10              I should have examined the document
11              because I did not quite understand it".
12
13              And, of course, the President asked, "You
14              do not understand Kinyarwandan"?
15
16              Muhimana responded, "I understand the
17              Kinyarwandan language, but since these
18              matters relate to law, I did not have
19              someone with whom to examine the points
20              of law contained in the document.     I do
21              not know whether I can continue to
22              express my opinion".
23
24              The President said, "The issue we are
25              dealing with today is merely the issue of

 1              your plea as to whether you are pleading
 2              guilty or not guilty.    There is nothing
 3              really complicated about that".
 4
 5              Muhimana said, "I do not understand the
 6              points in the indictment because they are
 7              legal matters, and I did not have anyone
 8              to explain them to me".
 9
10              The President said, "Just a moment.
11              Mr. Kiritta, did you have an opportunity
12              to discuss the issues with the Accused"?
13
14              And the counsel responded, "I did.    But I
15              think that the problem arises from the
16              fact that the indictment, as it stands,
17              is very complex.   It gives the background
18              of the problems in Rwanda.    It gives
19              particulars of certain instances.     But
20              what I think should be done, each count
21              should be put to him and ask him to plead
22              to it".
23
24              The President said, "Yes.    Well, we are
25              coming to that, but we are trying to see

 2              took place".
 3
 4              Counsel said, "I am not his defence
 5              counsel; I am just a duty counsel.     I did
 6              advise him that if you go to court and
 7              the indictment is read to you, you should
 8              just say not guilty".
 9
10              The President said, "But he would like to
11              understand the exact meaning of the
12              indictment".
13
14              Mr. Kiritta says, "Yes, but I would
15              suggest that it can't be put to him".
16
17              Muhimana said, "I am not in a position to
18              enter a plea in the absence of my
19              counsel.   I would request that I be
20              assigned counsel, and that I should be
21              able to examine the indictment together
22              with my counsel.   Mr. Kiritta, who is
23              present, is not my counsel, and we did
24              not have the opportunity to examine
25              together the indictment in the manner

 2
 3              The President asked him, "Would you ask
 4              him to come forward, and ask him to
 5              stand, please".    And he asked, "Did you
 6              have a discussion with the Registry with
 7              regard to the selection of your counsel
 8              for your trial?"
 9
10              The Accused responded, "I wrote, I wrote
11              to ask for the list of counsel to be
12              given to me, so that I could be in a
13              position to choose counsel, but this was
14              not done".
15
16              The President asked the Registrar, "Can
17              you help us here, because our information
18              is that he was given a list of counsel
19              about a week ago.    Can you help us?"
20
21              The Registrar responded, "Thank you,
22              Mr. President.    The information I had is
23              that the Accused was ready to enter a

 2              assignment of counsel can only be given
 3              by Mr. Caldarone, who is charged for
 4              that".
 5
 6              The President said, "Mr. Muhimana, today
 7              we are not dealing with any complicated
 8              legal issues.   We are simply dealing with
 9              your plea.   If you are pleading not
10              guilty, then there is no issue that
11              arises".
12
13              The Accused said, "I cannot plead guilty
14              or not guilty because I do not understand
15              the indictment.   I would consequently ask

19              understand the indictment".
20
21              The President insisted by saying that,
22              "Well, you have had benefit of duty
23              counsel, and I feel it is important that
24              we move the process forward, so we are

 1              what you want to do.      If you won't plead,
 2              then we will enter a plea of not guilty
 3              with respect to the counts".
 4
 5              And the Accused said, "As far as the duty
 6              counsel is concerned, I must confess that
 7              we never had the opportunity of studying
 8              the indictment per se.      I have always
 9              insisted and requested that counsel be
10              assigned to me, but in vain".
11
12              The President said, "Mr. Kiritta, can you
13              assist us because we have been informed
14              that he had been provided with a list
15              about a week ago.    Can you assist us on
16              that?"
17
18              Mr. Kiritta answered, "That I'm not aware
19              of, Mr. President.    I was only asked to
20              appear, and I did explain to him that we
21              only wanted this morning for the plea to
22              be taken.   And all he had to do, if he
23              did not even understand the indictment,
24              was just to say, I am not guilty".

 3    MR. SONGA:
 4
 5                    The President invariably received in
 6                    substance the same answer from the Accused,
 7                    according to which Mr. Muhimana could not
 8                    enter a plea because he had not been
 9                    assisted by counsel of his choice and could,
10                    therefore, not understand the Indictment.
11                    The references are there.
12
13                    Invariably at the end, after having in the
14                    meantime reminded the Accused of the
15                    provisions of Rule 62, the presiding judge
16                    systematically entered a plea of not guilty
17                    on his behalf on the following charges each
18                    time the Accused invoked his right to be
19                     assisted, and this was done at least ten
20                    times.   References are included in the
21                    documents disclosed to the parties.
22
23                     Those are the facts, Mr. President, Your
24                    Honours, and we should look at them under
25                    the clear light of law.   I would believe

 1                      that basically that Rule 62(iii) was invoked
 2                      in error.    Secondly, to the contrary, to the
 3                      contrary Rule 62(i) was a violation of the
 4                      Rule.   Thirdly, the same decision was made
 5                      in violation of other provisions, the
 6                      provisions governing the ICTR, your
 7                      Tribunal.    May I be allowed to develop these
 8                      submissions in turn, Mr. President?   Do I
 9                      have your leave?
10
11     MR. PRESIDENT:
12                      Certainly.
13     MR. SONGA:
14                      My first point, therefore, Mr. President, is
15                      that Rule 62(iii) of the Rules was invoked
16                      in error.    We respectfully submit that this
17                      provision cannot and could not have been
18                      applied unless the initial appearance was
19                      properly conducted; in other words, in
20                      conformity with Rule 62 in its entirety.
21
22                      Refusal by the accused to enter a plea in
23                      the absence of counsel of his own choosing
24                      is not covered by Rule 62(iii) of the Rules
25                      of Procedure and Evidence which merely

 1                     provides that "The Trial Chamber shall call
 2                    upon the accused to enter a plea of guilty
 3                    or not guilty on each count; should the
 4                    accused fail to do so, enter a plea of not
 5                    guilty on his behalf."
 6
 7                    The essential Rule, the same as the primary
 8                    requirement should the accused fail to
 9                     plead, is for the Trial Chamber to satisfy
10                    itself that the right of the accused, of
11                    counsel, is respected.   This comes under
12                    Rule 62(i), to ensure that the accused has
13                    right to counsel, and that that right is
14                    respected.
15
16                    Now, if we were to go backwards a little,
17                     let's imagine that there was a hearing where
18                    the Chamber, the judges, the judges were to
19                    ensure that the rights of the defence had
20                    been respected.   What would be the exact
21                    situation at that point in time?    After
22                    having asked all the questions necessary and
23                    having found the information required, the
24                    Chamber would ensure, would be informed that
25                    the accused was not allowed a choice of

 1                    counsel.    The Chamber should ensure that the
 2                    accused does indeed benefit from the
 3                    assistance of counsel.
 4
 5                    Now, the Chamber should have had to have a
 6                    plea, have recourse to a Rule which made it
 7                     known that the accused did not in fact
 8                    benefit from counsel of his choice.
 9                    Furthermore, Mr. President, Your Honours, it
10                    would not be proper to trivialize the act of
11                    entering a plea by considering it a mere
12                    formality, which could proceed in the
13                    absence of counsel not chosen by the
14                     accused.
15
16                    Entering a plea is a critical moment, both
17                    for the accused and for the outcome of the
18                    trial given its legal implications and
19                    consequences.   Without an understanding of
20                    the spirit and the letter, as well as the
21                    consequences of an indictment, an act which
22                     can be performed inter alia with the
23                    assistance of counsel chosen, or at least
24                    accepted by the accused, a plea of guilty or
25                    not guilty cannot be taken lightly.

 2                    Failure to plead cannot be invoked when
 3                    through the doing of the Tribunal itself an
 4                    accused is not -- the accused is from the
 5                    outset not allowed assistance by counsel to
 6                    which he is legally entitled, and the Trial
 7                    Chamber cannot and should not, therefore,
 8                    have entered a plea of guilty or not guilty
 9                    on behalf of the accused.
10
11                    Indeed, with due respect, it is obvious that
12                    the Trial Chamber had violated Rule 62(i).
13                    Rule 62(i) of the Rules of Procedure
14                    stipulates that, "Upon his transfer to the
15                    Tribunal, the accused shall be brought
16                     before a Trial Chamber without delay, and
17                    shall be formally charged.   The Trial
18                    Chamber shall satisfy itself that the right
19                    of the accused to counsel is respected."
20
21                    This was not done in consideration of the
22                    fact that the hearing which took place on
23                    the 24th November 1999 did not, made it that
24                    the Trial Chamber applied, that it not be
25                    applied at that stage and that the accused

 1                    merely had to be assisted by duty counsel,
 2                     and a plea of not guilty (sic) or not guilty
 3                    entered.
 4
 5                    The respect of the rights of the defence is
 6                    a requirement enshrined in the basic tenets
 7                    of law, and is provided for formally and
 8                    expressly at all stages of the proceedings
 9                    by provisions governing the International
10                     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.   Ignorance of
11                    this basic requirement resulted in the
12                    violation of the ICTR provisions.    It was in
13                    that manner that the provisions of Article
14                    19(1) and (3) of the Statute were violated
15                    as they provide, Para.(1), that "The Trial
16                    Chambers shall ensure that a trial is fair
17                    and expeditious", and so on and on forth.
18                    Paragraph (3), "The Trial Chamber shall read
19                    the indictment, satisfy itself that the
20                    rights of the accused are respected, these
21                    are still the basic rights, confirm that the
22                    accused understands the indictment and
23                    instruct the accused to enter a plea.    The
24                    Trial Chamber shall then set the date for

 2                    The entire conduct of the initial appearance
 3                    of the 24th November 1999 was a total
 4                    negation of the above provision.    Not only
 5                    did the Trial Chamber fail to ascertain
 6                    whether the accused had understood the
 7                     content of the Indictment, but it also
 8                    indeed had evidence on several occasions
 9                    through the accused' answer, as well as
10                    statements made by duty counsel, that the
11                    accused did not understand the contents of

13
14                    The same Trial Chamber violated Article
15                     20(4)(b) and (d) which provide,
16                    respectively, "In the determination of any

 5                    Finally, deciding that the accused had
 6                    pleaded not guilty in the absence of counsel
 7                    of his own choosing was a violation of
 8                    Article 2 of the Directive on the Assignment
 9                     of Counsel which provides, "Without
10                    prejudice to the right of an accused to
11                    conduct his own Defence, a suspect who is to
12                    be questioned by the Prosecutor during an
13                    investigation, and an accused upon whom
14                    personal service of the indictment has been
15                    effected, shall have the right to be
16                     assisted by Counsel provided that he has not
17                    expressly waived his right to Counsel."
18
19                    General consideration:   The general right of
20                     the accused to present a full and unfettered
21                    defence is one of the basic tenets of law,
22                    and assistance by counsel chosen by the
23                    accused is part and parcel of such a right.

25                    itself that such right had been observed

 2                    of the rights of the accused without it
 3                    being necessary to prove the existence of an
 4                    additional prejudice, because the violation
 5                    of this principle is fundamental justice,
 6                    according to Chief Judge Lamer in the Tran
 7                    decision, and is harmful in itself.

 9                    Furthermore, the annulment of the initial
10                    appearance which is the purpose of the
11                    instance motion, will, as far as the Accused
12                    is concerned, serve as a guarantee that in
13                    future his rights will be fully and strictly
14                    respected.

18                    grant his request, and to declare that the
19                    initial appearance was unlawful, given the

 4     MR. PRESIDENT:
 5                      Judge Ostrovsky wishes to put a question to
 6                      you, and after that I have a few questions
 7                      myself.
 8     JUDGE OSTROVSKY:
 9                      Counsel, what I do not understand, and I
10                      wish you to explain to me, is the starting
11                      point of your motion is that the accused at
12                      that point in time was not represented by
13                      counsel, and he says that "I am unable to
14                      plea, to plead for the time being in the
15                      absence of my counsel," and you repeated
16                      several times that the rights of the accused
17                      were not respected because he did not have
18                      counsel of his choosing.
19
20                      But at the same time, the accused
21                      recognized, and you confirmed this yourself,
22                      that from the beginning the accused did have
23                      access to duty counsel.    Can you please
24                      explain to me where you find the indication
25                      in the Statute, or possibly in the Rules of

 1                    Procedure and Evidence, that the initial
 2                    appearance of the accused could have only
 3                    happened in the presence of counsel chosen
 4                    by the accused.   Because the practice is
 5                    different, because Rule 62(ii) says that
 6                    "Upon his transfer to the Tribunal the
 7                    accused shall be brought before a Trial
 8                    Chamber without delay."   At that time, there
 9                    was no counsel who was assigned to him, and
10                    the one assigned was the duty counsel who
11                    was to represent and assist the accused, and
12                    this is the provision made by Rule 62(i).
13                     In other words, satisfy itself, the Trial
14                    Chamber must satisfy itself that the right
15                    of the accused to counsel is respected.     It
16                    is not necessarily a matter of counsel of
17                    choice of the accused.
18
19                    So, we need to find out what you can tell
20                    us, on what basis did you build up this
21                    submission that he may not enter any plea in
22                    the absence of counsel of his choosing?
23                    Maybe we should not go into the issue of
24                    counsel of his choice or not, because an
25                    indigent accused does not have any choice.

 1                    A person who is not indigent may have rights
 2                    to choose counsel.
 3
 4                    But in any event, it is not clear to me if
 5                    in the event that there is a duty counsel
 6                    one cannot then, therefore, refer to the
 7                    fact that Rule 62(ii) was not respected;
 8                    whereas, there was duty counsel right from
 9                    the outset.    This is why any representation
10                    necessary was provided to the accused.
11
12                    Maybe you could quote to me some provisions
13                    of our instrument, our Statutes or our Rules
14                    in order to justify your stand.
15     MR. SONGA:
16                    Thank you, Your Honour.   I have followed you
17                    closely, indeed, and I do not know whether
18                    you would allow me to speak about my
19                     impression.   You are not really asking me a
20                    question of clarification as such, but you
21                    are already making a judgment, and this
22                    would be a prejudgment.
23
24                    What I would like to say is, that in any
25                    event once the rights of the accused have

 1                    been defined, it has been said that his
 2                     rights are recognized throughout the whole
 3                    trial.   That's one thing.   Now, secondly,
 4                    representation cannot be imposed upon an
 5                    accused person.   Even if assignment is being
 6                    made, even if one is indigent, the least, in
 7                    order to ensure that rights of the accused
 8                    are respected, the accused himself must
 9                     agree, and I think I said this earlier, the
10                    least that one should expect is to agree,
11                    and this argument is drawn from the article
12                    referred to here, doesn't refer to choice,
13                    but the general rights of the defence of the
14                    accused is to be assisted by counsel.
15
16                    Furthermore, I think the trial that we are
17                    undergoing is a criminal trial.    We have a
18                    Trial Chamber which should have a strict, a
19                    strict interpretation and not fall back on,
20                    and I am saying this very respectfully,
21                    practice.   I would say that practice in
22                    criminal matters should be fallen back on as
23                    least as possible, because we have
24                    instruments whose interpretation should be
25                    strict, unless they are favourable to the

 2
 3                    I do not expect any further question, but
 4                    this is my position.
 5     JUDGE OSTROVSKY:
 6                    Counsel, it is not only the practice, it's
 7                    also the interpretation of Rule 62(i).     You
 8                    are not answering my question.     Are there
 9                    any provisions which justify your stand,
10                    your position, because you say that duty
11                     counsel is not sufficient, that this is a
12                    violation.   Why is this?   Because you
13                    maintain that Rule 62(i) and (ii) do not
14                    only deal with the practice, but the fact
15                    that the accused has right to counsel.    This
16                    could be duty counsel or someone whom he
17                    chooses himself.   This could also be done by
18                    the Registrar.
19
20                    But the principle in both cases is not that
21                    the rights of the accused are not respected
22                    when he does not have counsel.     What I was
23                    saying is, that whether the duty counsel is
24                    assigned by the Registrar or somebody who is
25                    paid by the accused in the instance of

 2                      that from your motion I do not see where you
 3                      indicate that it is indeed Rule 62(i) which
 4                      should be interpreted in such a manner that
 5                      only when the initial appearance takes place
 6                      within -- with the presence of counsel of
 7                      his choosing.   Is it correct?   All I'm

16                      will allow him to be taken to where he ought

 3                      Yes, Professor Songa, we can proceed now.     I
 4                      see the accused is back.
 5     MR. SONGA:
 6                      I wish to respond to the question put to me
 7                      by the judges.   As I believe we understand
 8                      one another, it would seem that we have two
 9                      interpretations of the rights provided to
10                      the Accused.   I say what I submitted, but
11                      the defence right from the outset, right up
12                      to now, should be with the counsel of
13                      choice.   I wish to say that this counsel be
14                      assigned formally, even that assignment
15                      should be accepted at the very least.     I
16                      really do not understand how counsel would
17                      be attached to an accused, and that we have
18                      an accused saying that his rights were
19                      respected.
20
21                      In this particular instance, I have heard,
22                      and I quoted the dialogue that took place
23                      between the President and the Accused, it
24                      would seem that the Accused did not accept
25                      counsel at his disposal.   I'm saying that,

 7                    situations which have not been covered by
 8                    our instruments, and what do we do in
 9                    criminal proceedings when the instruments we
10                    have are silent on a particular issue?    We
11                    need to look at what interpretation is
12                    favourable to the Accused.   This is what I
13                    wish to say, but I must stand by what I had
14                    said earlier that we seem to be having a
15                    situation which is irreconcilable.
16
17                    I am trying to answer the question by the
18                    Honourable Judge, and I wish to say is the
19                    definition of defence, representation by the
20                    defence, does that include the whole
21                    proceedings, the trial in toto, or would the
22                    Accused have to determine whether he accepts
23                    counsel assigned to him or not?    Those are
24                    my questions, Mr. President, Your Honours.

 1     MR. PRESIDENT:
 2                      There are a couple of questions I want to
 3                      raise with you.   Rule 62 requires that the
 4                      accused be brought before the Trial Chamber
 5                      without delay.    So you will understand the
 6                      significance of that, that once he is
 7                      brought to the Tribunal then we cannot wait
 8                      for a long time before he is brought before
 9                      the Tribunal.    And also, if you look at 44
10                      bis, Rule 44 bis (D), you will see the
11                      provision there with regard to duty counsel.
12     MR. SONGA:
13                      Is it 44, Your Honour?
14     MR. PRESIDENT:
15                      44 bis, letter (D), and the other point I
16                      wish to make is, that neither in this
17                      Tribunal or any jurisdiction is an indigent
18                      allowed counsel of his choice.   An indigent
19                      is allowed to have counsel assigned to him,
20                      not counsel of his choice.   Not even the
21                      European Court of Human Rights have agreed
22                      with that proposition.   Every jurisdiction
23                      in which one looks at the law, it is never a
24                      question of an indigent having counsel of
25                      his choice.   It's a question of the indigent

 1                      being provided with counsel.     So, if you
 2                      will address your mind to those issues I
 3                      will be grateful.
 4     MR. SONGA:
 5                      I believe the last point sufficiently
 6                      summarizes your questions.     I would like to
 7                      emphasize a certain concept which might not
 8                      tally with your idea of indigent, but I'm
 9                      saying the following: Is it because one is
10                      indigent you can be assisted by the person
11                      that you refuse?    That is my understanding.
12                      I observed during the entire hearing that he
13                      did not even accept the idea of the presence
14                      of counsel.   He never accepted the fact that
15                      he was being represented by counsel.    What
16                      do we do?
17     MR. PRESIDENT:
18                      In some jurisdictions the accused is not
19                      even asked any question.    The Court says
20                      John Brown is assigned to represent you in
21                      your case, when you are an indigent, and
22                      that's the end of the story.    If you don't
23                      want John Brown then you can go and get your
24                      own counsel which you pay for, or you can
25                      defend yourself.    Very often that is the

 2
 3                      So, it's not a question of whether he
 4                      rejects or he doesn't reject.     The indigent
 5                      doesn't have the luxury of determining who
 6                      his counsel is to be.
 7     MR. SONGA:
 8                      I cannot develop this argument further with
 9                      the risk that my client may have to be
10                      constrained to pay my fees.
11     MR. PRESIDENT:
12                      Well, I just want to look at a few practical
13                      areas.    Let us assume for the moment that we
14                      agreed to annul the plea.   What would be the
15                      next stage?    Is he going to change his plea?
16                      Is he going to come back and plead not
17                      guilty?   What is the position?   Maybe you
18                      can help us with that.
19     MR. SONGA:
20                      Mr. President, don't you think that an
21                      answer to this question might preclude the
22                      next hearing, which you might have to deal
23                      with the issue of pleading guilty or not
24                      guilty?

 1     MR. PRESIDENT:
 2                      It doesn't preclude it.    He has his rights,
 3                      and by his rights he can decide whether he
 4                      pleads guilty or not guilty.    We are not
 5                      precluding anything.    I am looking at the
 6                      situation from a realistic point of view as
 7                      to where this is taking us.    Where do we go
 8                      from here?    Does your client intend to
 9                      change his plea, or does he still maintain a
10                      not guilty plea?    That is what I am trying
11                      to understand.    I take it that you have
12                      explained to him the situation and he now
13                      understands the Indictment.    Is that the
14                      position?
15     MR. SONGA:
16                      I will not be able to say if the Accused
17                      already has a position.    But it is our
18                      belief that if the initial appearance is
19                      annulled then we will be given an
20                      opportunity to plead.
21     MR. PRESIDENT:
22                      Do I understand you to say that you haven't
23                      explained the Indictment to him as yet?       Is
24                      that your answer?    I mean, let us not play
25                      games here.    Let us be frank with each

 2                      Indictment to him and what the charges are?
 3                      You haven't done that yet?

 5                      Yes, Your Honour.   Yes, Your Honour.     That
 6                      is what we are constantly doing.
 7     MR. PRESIDENT:
 8                      And I wish to ask you if, is there any
 9                      intention of him changing his plea?
10     MR. SONGA:
11                      At the current stage, Mr. President, I
12                      cannot say anything.
13     MR. PRESIDENT:
14                      All right.   I will leave that for the
15                      moment.   Maybe you can tell me, in your
16                      motion here you said, "to render any
17                      decision as required by law."   What do you
18                      mean by that?   Maybe you can develop it.
19                      What is meant by "to render any decision as
20                      required by law"?
21     MR. SONGA:
22                      Mr. President, by that I mean that once if
23                      you examined, based on your conviction the
24                      facts that have been submitted to you, once

 1                      have submitted, that you go ahead to grant
 2                      what we have requested.
 3     MR. PRESIDENT:
 4                      It's not necessary for us to annul the plea
 5                      that was entered.    He can plead right now,
 6                      and he can plead whatever he wishes.     It
 7                      doesn't matter if an accused pleads two or
 8                      three times.   It makes no difference,
 9                      particularly if he is entering the same
10                      plea.   So he could very well plead right
11                      now, if that is required.   We don't have to
12                      go and annul anything.

14                      Mr. President, you are sovereign.

 1     MR. KAPAYA:
 2                    Thank you, My Lord.   As regards this motion,
 3                    we filed a reply to it on the 24th of
 4                    February and we stand by what we stated
 5                     therein.
 6
 7                    Now, in addition to what is stated there, we
 8                    wish only to recapitulate a few facts.    The
 9                    accused person was arrested on the 8th of
10                    November and was brought before the Tribunal
11                    on the 24th.   That was hardly 16 days.   So,
12                    in our submission we find that the accused
13                     person was brought to the Tribunal without
14                    undue delay.
15
16                    On arrival at the Tribunal it's now the
17                    function of the Chamber to perform certain
18                    functions which are enumerated under Rule 62
19                    (i) and (ii), and these functions are for
20                    the Chamber to satisfy itself that the right
21                     to counsel is respected.
22
23                    Now, going through the proceedings we find
24                    that immediately the accused person was

 2                    proceedings show that Mr. Kiritta visited
 3                    him about three times at the UN Detention
 4                     Unit, and not only that, there is also the
 5                    fact that the Indictment was handed to the
 6                    accused person in the language in which he
 7                    understands, which is Kinyarwanda.
 8
 9                    At no stage is it indicated in those
10                    proceedings that the accused person did not
11                    want to be represented by Mr. Kiritta.    So
12                    we take it that Mr. Kiritta explained to the
13                    accused person what was expected of him
14                    during the initial appearance.     The
15                    proceedings also show that the Trial Chamber
16                    took the trouble to ascertain from the
17                    accused person whether he understood what
18                    was before him or what was required before
19                    him.
20
21                    In our submission, Your Honour, the purpose
22                    of initial appearance is just to require the
23                    accused to know what is before him and to
24                    plead, whether to make him plead guilty or
25                    not guilty.   In this instant, the accused

 2                     counsel that he should plead not guilty.
 3
 4                    In the course of these proceedings, Your
 5                    Lordships pointed to the provisions of Rule
 6                     44 bis.   Under those Rules it is clear that
 7                    one of the functions of duty counsel is to
 8                    advise, to advise an accused person, to
 9                    provide initial legal advice and assistance
10                    during the initial appearance.     So this was
11                    done in this case and we don't see that the
12                    accused person can validly say that he was
13                    not duly represented.
14
15                    Again, we understand, Your Honour, that from
16                    the time the accused person was arrested to
17                     the time he was brought to court he had duty
18                    counsel.   Now, the role of duty counsel is
19                    to fill the lacuna before the time when
20                    counsel gets, when an accused person gets
21                    counsel of his own choosing.   Now, in this
22                    regard, Mr. Muhimana did not have counsel of
23                    his own, so he depended on the appointment
24                     of counsel, by assignment of counsel by the
25                    Registrar.

 2                      Now, under the provisions of 5-12 of the
 3                      Directive of the Assignment of Counsel there
 4                      is an elaborate procedure that is shown
 5                      there on how an accused person is finally
 6                      allocated counsel. Now, before that is done,
 7                      this is where the duty counsel comes in, now
 8                      his role is to fill that vacuum and make
 9                      sure that the process of justice takes its
10                      course.
11
12                      Now, under the circumstances, Your Honours,
13                      we are of the view that the rights of the
14                      accused person were respected and we do not
15                      see the basis of this application, either in
16                      law or in fact.   Thank you very much.

18     MR. PRESIDENT:
19                      Judge Ostrovsky has a question for you.
20     JUDGE OSTROVSKY:
21                      Counsel, I would like to ask you what is
22                      your opinion.   Rule 44 bis (D) provides for
23                      "If an accused, or suspect transferred under
24                      Rule 40 bis, is unrepresented at any time
25                      after being transferred to the Tribunal, the

 1                    Registrar shall as soon as practicable
 2                    summon duty counsel to represent the accused
 3                    or suspect until counsel is engaged by the
 4                    accused or suspect, or assigned under Rule
 5                    45."
 6
 7                    What is your understanding of this Rule 44
 8                    bis (D) in the case if the accused at
 9                    initial appearance is represented by the
10                    duty counsel could be, whether it could be
11                    considered as a violation of the rights of
12                    the accused, whether this Rule doesn't mean
13                    that it's enough if the duty counsel
14                    represent the accused, or it could be
15                    understood the situation in such a way as
16                    the defence is saying if there is no
17                    assigned counsel, or the counsel at the
18                    choice of the accused; therefore, we can say
19                    that the rights of the accused have not been
20                    respected?
21     MR. KAPAYA:
22                    Thank you, Your Honour.
23
24                    Our view, my view of these provisions is
25                    that they are intended to fill a lacuna.

 1                    This is an instance where duty counsel is
 2                    assigned to an accused person.     This is
 3                    pending the provision of counsel of his
 4                    choice or a proper assignment of the usual
 5                     investigations are done by the Registrar.
 6                    So, in my view, Your Honour, the appearance
 7                    by duty counsel as provided for under Rule
 8                    44 bis (D) is proper appearance before the
 9                    Tribunal.

 2   MR. PRESIDENT:
 3                    Professor Songa, is there anything further
 4                    you wish to add?
 5   MR. SONGA:
 6                    Mr. President, I followed you already
 7                    through the transcripts of the initial
 8                    appearance of 24th November, 1999.   I also
 9                    listened to you today through your
10                    interventions, your statements and
11                    questions, and I believe I've clearly
12                    understood when on 24th November, 1999 and
13                    2nd March, 2000 there has not been any
14                    evolution or any movement in the
15                    understanding of the issue of the Tribunal
16                    and the judges composing it.
17
18                    A while ago, you did say that we should
19                    not engage ourselves in a game that would
20                    not be fruitful, such that seeing what
21                    might happen or trying to guess what might
22                    happen, and also knowing that you are very
23                    busy and responsible people, it would not
24                    be proper for me to attempt to impose
25                    something which in your opinion which, on

 1                    the basis of your understanding of the
 2                    initial appearance, would appear to be a
 3                    distraction but a while ago, when you
 4                    asked a question on the possibility of a
 5                    reconfirmation of the initial appearance
 6                    during which today and now the Accused
 7                    will be able to reply, I said you were
 8                    severing, but if you want me to give an
 9                    assistance or to lend my assistance to
10                    your sovereignty, I have no objection to
11                    the entering of a plea of guilty or not
12                    guilty.
13   MR. PRESIDENT:
14                    Professor Songa, is there any intention of
15                    changing the plea that was originally
16                    given -- or that was originally entered, I
17                    should say?
18   MR. SONGA:
19                    Can I refer to the -- can I consult with
20                    the Accused?
21
22                    Mr. President, for the first time, and
23                    freely, he tells me that he's pleading not
24                    guilty.
