MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon to everyone present here.  The Court is in session now.  

May we have the appearances for the parties starting with the Prosecution?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honour.  Charles Adeogun-Phillips, Wallace Kapaya, Ms. Medenga and 
Ms. Kabasinga represent the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

For the Defence, please.
MR. SONGA:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon to my colleagues of the Prosecution.  

For the Defence we will have Professor Songa, Richard Kazadi Kabimba, and Mr. Mathias Sahinkuye, the legal assistant.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.

Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, in these proceedings, we will not call you by your name.  

Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to crave your indulgence for disrupting your statement, but I would like to have a position once and for all on the matter relating to the testimonies of witnesses whose statements must be sent to the defence.  Today we have a second statement to add to what we have in the Prosecution file, and it so happens that this statement says that the witness has already been heard twice by the investigators of the ICTR.  

What this means is that today there are two statements, one is found in the Prosecution's file, but we don't have one of them.  The Defence doesn't have one of them, and I think yesterday we had the same problem, and your reply thereto was that so long as the Prosecution doesn't intend to use the statement, it was needless for it to be sent to us, but we think that in the interests of the defence of our client, any statement made by the client -- by the witness, should be put at our disposal.  

So, Madam President, we would like that all statements, at least for witnesses that will be appearing before the Court, for instance the witness of today, should be disclosed to us at least 21 days prior to the proceedings.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  Professor we believe this is the second statement.  The first statement is available in the bundle, that is the statement of 30 August 1999, and this second statement, which was delivered to us just now, is of 19 October 2002. 

Mr. Phillips, what do you have to say? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful, Your Honour, for the opportunity.  Your Honours, my learned friend is indeed correct in part in relation to the representation he's made to you as far as Witness AQ is concerned.  The statement of 9 October 2002 was brought to my attention this afternoon by my learned friend, himself, and the origin of it is as follows.  We had disclosed this statement under a different pseudonym to my learned friend in redacted form.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which statement?  The statement of --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Nine October 2002.  The reason for that is very simple.  The name on that statement differs slightly from the name of the witness which is in your bundle at page 48.  If you look at the name on the statement of 9 October 2002 and you look at the name on the statement of August 1999, there is a slight variation in the way the name is written.  Therefore, our computer did not pick it up as belonging to this witness.  In fact, we never discovered it until they were reading through their disclosure and found that the contents were remarkably similar to that of this witness and the moment he brought it to my attention --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the correct name?  The name on the statement of October 2002?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Incidently, as we would find out from the witness, the name on 9 October 2002 is the correct spelling, and the first name -- there is also an alias which is used together with the name on the 1999 statement.  So that is the origin of the confusion.  It was not a wilful neglect on the part of the Prosecutor to withhold the statement, but rather the fact that we actually thought it was somebody entirely different and we had disclosed it accordingly under a different pseudonym.  

We have rectified that problem.  In essence, the statement of 9 October 2002 does not contain anything that is different from that of 1999, so there no prejudice whatsoever.  In fact, it contains less information than the 1999 statement, so there is absolutely no prejudice, and I do sincerely apologise to my learned friend and I take the point that we do owe him an obligation to present him with the statement of witnesses well in advance, and we apologise for this on this instance.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.  

Professor, I hope you are satisfied now.
MR. SONGA:
Not quite, Madam President, for the simple reason that while understanding him that the statement of 9 October 2002 was disclosed to the Defence only today, we need, however, to find the second statement, because we have two statements that came prior to 9 October 2002.  We have one in the bundle, but there is another that is lacking which is mentioned by the witness, itself, in the statement of 9 October 2002.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For which Mr. Phillips has apologised and you should accept that.  Is there another statement?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes, I think I understand my learned friend's points and if I can be of assistance to the court, on page 3 of the statement of 9 October 2002, you will see the first line there says, "I was interviewed twice by ICTR investigators last year in  connection with the Mika Muhimana case."  Well, these are all the statements in our custody.  We don't have anything else in our bag, and I have asked the witness, and she confirms that these are the two statements, to the best of her knowledge, that she has given to our office.  So, again, I'm none the wiser as to where the statement came from, but that's all we have.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, is that clear?  These are the only two statements the Prosecutor has, and there is no other statement.
MR. SONGA:
I do not know, Madam President, but the witness states that -- said on 9 October 2002 that she had already been questioned twice, so before the statement of 9 October, there are two statements, one of which we have, but we don't have the second one, and that's where our problem lies.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That can be clarified during the course of examination.  So can we proceed now?
MR. SONGA:
If such is your decision, Madam President, we can only adhere to it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.
MR. SONGA: 
In any case, Madam President, if you can take account of an aspect of the motion that I have just raised, that is for witnesses that appear before the Court, that the Prosecution should be directed to give me -- to forward to us all the statements as conducted by the investigators of the ICTR.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

So, Mr. Prosecutor, please make sure that all the statements of the witnesses are disclosed to the Defence.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So we proceed.

Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you will be referred to as Witness AQ in days proceedings.  You are a protected witness and we are sitting in open session, so please don't disclose your name, name of your parents, name of your neighbours, place of residence or any other information which may lead to your identification.  

You shall now take a solemn declaration to speak the truth.

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness.  
(Declaration made by Witness AQ in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips, you have the floor for examination.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
Your Honour, can I make an application under Rule 79(A)(ii) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of this Tribunal in relation to the first set of questions, that would last approximately five or six minutes, which I seek to put to this witness, questions which may seek to reveal her identity and to clarify matters concerning her personal particulars, Your Honour.  It will last only five minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, what do you have to say? 
MR. SONGA:
We do not have any objection to that, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please arrange for closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 6 to 12] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, we are now back in open session.  You no longer have to give those identifying details and we will refer to people by your relationship with them and not by their names.  Do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you recall providing a statement to investigators from my office at some stage after the war?
A.	Yes, I do recall that.
Q.	Do you recall when you provided the very first statement to investigators from my office after the war -- the period?
A.	I do remember that it was in 1999.
Q.	Do you remember, Madam Witness, what you told those investigators when you provided that statement?
A.	Yes, I remember the contents of my statement.
Q.	Can you tell me what you told them, very briefly?
A.	I remember telling them of a meeting that was held.  I also recall talking to them about the arrest of my elder sister.
Q.	Let's talk about the meeting that you have talked about.  When was this meeting held that you talked about in your statement?  Do you recall when this meeting was held?
A.	I do not recall the date on which that meeting was held, but I remember that that meeting was held in mid-April during the war.
Q.	When you say "during the war", would I be correct in saying that you refer to April 1994?
A.	That is correct.  It was in April 1994.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She said mid-April.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, it was the year when she said mid-April.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, where was this meeting held, Madam Witness?  Where was the location of the meeting?
A.	That meeting was held in front of Mika Muhimana's house in a courtyard in front of that house.
Q.	Do you recall if anyone was present at that meeting?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I fear, Counsel, you want to ask who was present, because if there is a meeting, then someone must be present.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes. 

BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, who was present at the meeting?
A.	That meeting was held by Mika, Ruzindana and Sikubwabo.  Those were three people I recognised.  I could not recognise the other participants at that meeting.
Q.	Who was Sikubwabo?
A.	He was the bourgmestre of that commune.
Q.	And who was Ruzindana, or who is Ruzindana?
A.	He was a trader in Mugonero.
Q.	Had you known the person you described as Sikubwabo and the person you described as Ruzindana?  Had you known these two people before you saw them on this day?
A.	I knew them because they used to visit Mika in his house, and that is where I met them.
Q.	Madam Witness, where were you located when you saw this meeting taking place?
A.	I was in the back courtyard of Mika's house.  That is the house in the back courtyard.
Q.	From your location, were you able to hear what was being said at this meeting?
A.	I could see the participants at that meeting.  However, I could not hear what was said because I was in the house.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you recall the number of participants -- how many people participated in the meeting, besides Ruzindana, Sikubwabo and Mika Muhimana?
THE WITNESS: 
There was a large number of people from the population, but I couldn't know exactly how many participants there were.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips.  Please proceed.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know why this meeting had been convened on this day?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Can you tell us why the meeting was convened?
A.	Before that meeting was held, I heard Mika say that he was going to convene a meeting to sensitise members of the population and to encourage them to go out and kill Tutsis.
Q.	The person you describe as Sikubwabo and Ruzindana -- the persons you describe as Sikubwabo and Ruzindana, do you know what ethnic group or groups they belonged to?
A.	Yes, I know.
Q.	Can you tell us, please?
A.	I know that they are Hutu.
Q.	What about the other people who participated in this meeting, the people you describe as the population?  Are you able to tell us whether or not they came from a particular ethnic group or whether or not they came from different ethnic groups?  Were you able to ascertain that at the time?
A.	I knew that the participants at that meeting were from the same ethnic group.
Q.	Do you know what ethnic group that was, please?
A.	The participants at that meeting were Hutu, and their leaders were sensitising them to go out and attack Tutsis and kill them because the Tutsis were the target.
Q.	Very well.  Madam Witness, I want to talk to you about the second thing you said you told investigators during your interview with them, and this, as you say, concerns your sister.  Do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I understand you.
Q.	Can you tell us what you told the investigators had happened to your sister and when and where?
A.	My elder sister was raped in Mika's house.  She was raped by Mika Muhimana.
Q.	Did you see for yourself Mika Muhimana raping your sister?
A.	Yes, I saw him do that.
Q.	How many times did you see Mika Muhimana raping your sister?
A.	I was able to witness four occasions during which rape was committed by Mika Muhimana, rapes of my sister by Mika Muhimana.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this was before the war or after the war or during the war? 
THE WITNESS:
That was a week after the war had started.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, I want to talk to you about the first time that you witnessed -- you say you witnessed your sister being raped; do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I do understand.
Q.	How old was your sister when she was first raped by Mika Muhimana?
A.	If I were to make an estimate, she was aged 25.
Q.	When did you first see Mika Muhimana rape your sister?
A.	Do you mean the date?  The first time I saw Mika Muhimana rape my sister, he came and took her in the room in which we were.  He pulled her with all his strength, dragged her into his room, and I followed them and I found them together.  My sister was fighting to release herself from his grip.  Mika was stronger than her.  He pushed her down on the bed, undressed her and started taking advantage of her.
Q.	Madam Witness, I had asked you for the period in which this event had happened.  Do you recall when you saw the first rape of your sister -- in which month, perhaps?
A.	It was in the month of April, a week after the war had started.
Q.	Can you tell us where you had seen Mika Muhimana rape your sister?
A.	He raped her in his room.
Q.	How were you able to observe what you observed at the time, Madam Witness?
A.	When Mika dragged my sister like a goat, I followed them stealthily, and Mika did not close the door behind him.  I was therefore able to see what he was doing without being seen, myself.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And where was your aunt? 
THE WITNESS:
My aunt was around.  She was hiding in the bushes, in the surrounding bushes, given that she was Tutsi.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She was not present in the house? 
THE WITNESS:
No, she was not present in that house.  My sister screamed, and my aunt was not able to hear the screams of my elder sister to come to her aid.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And what time of day was it, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
It was between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock.
JUDGE SHORT:
In the morning or in the evening? 
THE WITNESS:
It was in the evening.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Witness, can you describe to the Court, in as much detail as you possibly can, what it was that you were able to observe Mika do to your sister on that occasion?
A.	Yes, I can tell you.  The first time Mika came, he took my elder sister.  He forcefully dragged her.  My sister was trying to struggle and Mika dragged her to his room.  He immediately dragged her onto the bed and undressed her.  He also undressed and he began to have sexual intercourse with her.  

On the second occasion he came, he took her by force.  He dragged her and my elder sister was screaming a lot.  There, once more, he took her into his room.  He dragged her to the bed, he undressed her and also began to have sexual intercourse with her.  

On the third occasion, my sister did not scream because, for her, it was the same thing.  It was therefore useless to scream.  This was the same on the fourth occasion.
Q.	Madam Witness, how long after the first rape that you witnessed did the second rape occur?  How long after?  What was the period between the two rapes?
A.	Two or three days passed between the two rapes.
Q.	And the third and fourth time -- how long was the third time from the second time?  How long passed between the second and the third time; do you recall?
A.	All these rapes occurred within one or two days of each other.
Q.	Did you ever discuss what you had seen with your sister at the time?
A.	She tried to talk to me about it, but I could not help her in any way.
Q.	Do you know why you and your sister -- 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I withdraw that because it might identify the witness, Your Honour.  
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, your sister ever discuss what had happened to her with ******************?
A.	Once she talked to her about it, but the aunt did nothing.
Q.	Did you discuss what you had seen with************?
A.	No, I did not discuss this -- what happened to my elder sister ************************.
Q.	You described how during the third and fourth times, your sister, in your words, did not scream.  Can you tell us what you meant by saying that?  What did you observe when you said that she didn't scream?
A.	The third and the fourth time -- the first two times she screamed, she struggled.  However, she was not stronger than he was.
Q.	So did you see her struggle on the third and fourth time, Madam Witness?
A.	Those times she didn't struggle because, to her, it was no use considering that she was not as strong as he was.
Q.	Apart from your sister, do you know if Mika Muhimana raped anybody else in that house?
A.	What happened in Mika's house was I could hear people scream, others crying, but I was not able to determine who these people were, but I heard about it.
Q.	Is your sister still alive, Madam Witness?
A.	No, she's dead.
Q.	Do you know how she died and when she died?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Can you tell us, please?
A.	One day Mika and Ruzindana, as well as other Interahamwe who were in a vehicle and who were very many, were coming back from an attack.  The vehicle came and parked in front of Mika's house.  On board this vehicle there was Mika and Ruzindana.  They sent two Interahamwe.  They arrested my sister and they took her to a vehicle and left.  From that day, I never saw my sister again.
Q.	Do you know when this event occurred, Madam Witness; the month?
A.	It was around mid-April, but I do not remember the exact date.
Q.	Apart from Mika Muhimana, do you know if anyone else raped your sister?
A.	Yes, I know someone.
Q.	Can you tell me about that, please?
A.	Another person who raped my elder sister is called Gisambo -- G-I-S-A-M-B-O.  It is an Interahamwe who often visited Mika's residence during the war, and it is therefore this person who raped my sister twice.
Q.	Did you witness the person called Gisambo raping your sister?
A.	I saw this person drag my elder sister.  He took her into the house, but given that he shut the door behind him, I was not able to see what happened.
Q.	How, then, were you able to conclude that Gisambo raped your sister?
A.	He dragged her by force.  My sister tried to struggle in vain and he took her into the house and he shut the door behind him, and during this time my sister was screaming, but it was in vain. 
Q.	Did the person who you described as Gisambo, did he kill your sister?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is a leading question.  Mr. Phillips, rephrase your question, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Actually, Your Honour, I'll leave it because it's not --
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you know who killed your sister, Madam Witness?
A.	My elder sister was taken away in a vehicle.  As I said before, she was taken away.  I told you about the people who were on board this vehicle.  They were Mika and Ruzindana who were returning from an attack.  On board this vehicle there were also a large number of Interahamwe.  They took her away and afterwards, Mika returned at about 9 p.m., ************************** my elder sister, and since then I have not seen her.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, who took your sister out of the house on that day? 
THE WITNESS:
It is these Interahamwe, two Interahamwe who came down from the vehicle, and they took away my elder sister and put her on board this vehicle.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
They came to your house -- that is to **********************, and took her away?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, they took her away with them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your sister was inside the house.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, she was inside the house, *******************.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Would I be correct in saying, Madam Witness, that you did not actually see the person who killed your sister, did you?
A.	In this case we would have made a mistake because I did not see her.  They took her away with them in any case, and I never saw her again.
Q.	Therefore, would I be correct in saying that if your witness statement makes reference to you seeing or having seen Mika Muhimana shoot your sister, that information is incorrect, isn't it?
A.	Do you mean to say whether I saw him shoot at her? 
Q.	No, I'm saying -- I'm putting it to you, Madam Witness, that if your witness statement says that you did see Mika shoot your sister, that information is not correct; is that not correct?  You didn't say that?
A.	If he did not shoot her, would she not still be alive?
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, why don't you ask her whether she ever told the investigator that Mika shot her sister?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
That will be much clearer to the witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Perhaps, Counsel, even as you go along, as she's your witness, you cannot really cross-examine her.  Perhaps you can tell her, "Is it correct where it is written that she said that -- is that correct?"  Because there it is written, in fact.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, it is, yes. 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, it does state in your witness statement of August 1999 that Mika Muhimana shot your sister dead.  Is this correct?
A.	My elder sister was taken away from **************, and if he had not killed her, if he had not shot at her, I would have seen her again.
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness, but you didn't see this, yourself, did you?
A.	I did not witness this fact in person, but he took her away and I never saw her again.
Q.	Thank you.  Madam Witness, were you a victim of rape, yourself?
A.	Yes, that happened.
Q.	Who raped you, Madam Witness?
A.	It is Muhimana, Mika.
Q.	When did that happen, Madam Witness?
A.	This happened after my elder sister was raped and killed.
Q.	In terms of the period, the month and the year, can you help us with a period when you were raped by Mika?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, this has not been given in her statements, in either of her statements.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It has, Your Honour.  The witness has -- in the pre-trial brief, there is a column there that states the reconfirmation of additional evidence that was given and disclosed pursuance to the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  It's in the pre-trial brief, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In a will-say statement? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's a will-say, statement, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do we have copies?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well, it's a two paragraph will-say statement, but we had included it in the pre-trial brief.  The will-say statement is in your pre-trial brief under annex A.  That's why we have divided it into columns for will-say statements.  I see my learned friend is on his feet.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
It is to raise an objection, Madam President.  I do not remember that this case appears in the indictment, and I think that in the pre-trial briefs it does not appear either.  Nor does it appear in any written statement.  Perhaps it would be well to give us a little time or perhaps the Prosecutor could provide precise references.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, my learned friend was provided with will-say statements pursuant to Rule 67(D) over two months ago, and it is in the pre-trial brief, annex A.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this is given in the pre-trial brief.
MR. SONGA:
With your leave, Madam President, I shall verify this.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Prosecutor, in your pre-trial brief you have stated -- you made a statement that the witness added that Muhimana raped her twice after Esperance never returned.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where did you get that from? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
If you look at page 1 of that annex, Your Honour, the column, itself is titled -- the column at the beginning of part 4 where Your Honour has just read from,  the beginning is titled, "Reconfirmations -- notice of new evidence and discrepancies."  What we seek that is in itself derived from the will-say statement that was disclosed to the Defence.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That will-say statement.  Do we have a copy of it?  May we have a look?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
They are just making copies of it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And that was disclosed to Professor.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, you did get a will-say statement disclosed to you, as Counsel states, containing that information? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  We have the pre-trial brief document, but we have never seen in annex any document as a witness statement that bears the signature.  We have never seen that.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Have you seen a statement stated to be derived from the witness containing information summarised in the pre-trial brief?

Professor, did you hear me?
MR. SONGA:
I did hear you, Your Honour.  We did not receive it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, what do you have to say about this? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I've got the notice of service, Your Honour.  My learned friend is probably seriously mistaken, but every witness that has appeared in this courtroom has had a will-say statement, and I have copies of all of them here.  They were all disclosed to him.  Whether or not -- we have them here.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Can you just show Counsel the one you have?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The particular one for this witness, I have just given it to my assistant to photocopy, but generally all the other witness statements are here.  I have just pulled it out of my file, and they are all aware of both the discrepancies where the witness adds things and remove things from their statement, and that is how we have proceeded.  There is no difference with this witness.

Your Honours, I have the proof of service here that was signed for by my learned friend on 26 March.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, the will-say statement of this witness has not been forwarded to us.  We never received a copy of the statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, we never sent you copies, Your Honour.  What we did for Your Honours, rather than give you 
will-say statements, we included the will-say statement in the pre-trial brief, and that is what I just read to Your Honours in that column.  We simply put it there as the will-say statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But that statement has been disclosed to the defence.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, I have the proof of service in my hand dated 26 March 2004 signed by my learned friend.  The proof of service is right here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we have a copy?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm just handing the will-say statements to Your Honours, of this particular witness.  It's just been photocopied.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA: 
I repeat what I said, Madam President.  That the document, which is the pre-trial brief and its annexures, we did receive, but I state that we have no additional statement which bears the signature of the witness in question.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, can I, in that regard, then hand you the proof of service which my learned friend signed on 26 March which clearly says that he received the will-say statements.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Issa, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can you hand this to Their Honours.  It's the original, and can I have it back.
MR. SONGA:
I maintain my objection, Madam President, because I state that we did not acknowledge proof of receipt of any document bearing the witness's signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any will-say statement of this witness bearing her signature?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
There is no requirement, Your Honour, that the will-say statement should bear the witness's signature.  The Rules of Procedure of Evidence, Rule 67(D) simply states that "If either party discovers additional evidence or information or material which should have been produced earlier pursuant to the Rules, the party shall promptly notify the other party and the Trial Chamber of the existence of the additional evidence or information."  And that is precisely what a will-say statement is, and that's what we have done.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you confirm receipt of will-say statement of this witness, a copy of which has been provided to you just now? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I received it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If you did, then you have had sufficient notice of the fact that these additional facts would be stated by the witness.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, I do not think, however, that we can amend the indictment in the prior briefs.  This doesn't concern only evidence, but the facts, and therefore amends the indictment, so we cannot only have had a non-signed document and to give it a cheap value.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Songa, this additional information which you admit you received, does it comply with Rule 67(D)? 
MR. SONGA:
Grant me leave so that I can consult it, Your Honours.

Your Honours, a cursory look at that provision talks about evidence or information or additional material on condition that there be evidence that relates to the indictment.  No party can take advantage of the additional evidence to amend the counts on the indictment.

JUDGE SHORT:
We are not dealing with the indictment at the moment, are we?  The objection was that you have not had notice of this additional evidence.  Is that not what we are dealing with at the moment?  And I'm asking you whether what you admit as having received does not comply with Rule 67(D).
MR. SONGA:
I would like to maintain my reasons.  On the occasion of prior briefs, if the Prosecution could modify anything, it will make it impossible for the Defence to defend its case because things would change every day and I would like to maintain my objection, Your Honours.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor what exactly is your objection?  Can you re-state your objection?
MR. SONGA:
The nature of my objection is that if we accepted to receive this type of evidence that wouldn't have been signed by the authors thereof, the indictment would be amended any time the Prosecution so wishes, in which case it would be difficult to ensure the defence of our client.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It is not the understanding of the Chamber that the Prosecution is seeking to amend the indictment.  It is merely seeking to lead the evidence in full.  

Prosecutor, is there an intention on your basis to seek to amend the indictment? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, no.  We just want the witness to give her evidence in full.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And, Mr. Prosecutor, you concede that even regarding the rape of this witness by Muhimana is not mentioned in the indictment.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, it's not, Your Honour.  We accept that.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor what prejudice would be made to you if this evidence were led to your case? 
MR. SONGA:
The prejudice is obvious, Madam President.  What this would mean is that we will have to answer for all the assassinations and other rapes, et cetera.  How can't we see the prejudice that this would cause?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Let me tell you why it shouldn't cause you any prejudice.  You were informed some time back that the witness, AQ, when she gives her evidence, will include in her evidence these matters.  Therefore, you had occasion to seek instructions from your client on these matters.  Now, as long as the Prosecution is not seeking to amend the indictment so that you need to respond to that amendment, this evidence can't possibly cause you prejudice because you have had it for quite some time and you have had occasion to take instructions on it.  It is not something new that has just been thrown on your face this afternoon.  It is something that you have known for some time, at least on your own admission, and therefore something you are quite able to cross-examine the witness on, and, therefore, it cannot in any way inhibit your capacity to defend your client.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Professor, it has been confirmed by the Prosecutor that they are not seeking an amendment in the indictment, and since we have prior notice of this evidence, this will-say statement, your objection is overruled.  

Mr. Phillips, please proceed.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, I had just started to ask you who raped you, and you testified that Mika Muhimana had raped you, and I was asking you about the period, if you could help us with the period that this rape occurred.  Can you help us with that, please?
A.	That took place in April.  It was during the month of April that Mika Muhimana started raping me after my elder sister had passed on.  That same sister, herself, had been raped by Mika.
Q.	Can you tell us the location where Mika had raped you?
A.	He raped me *******************************.
Q.	How many times, Madam Witness, did Mika Muhimana rape you?
A.	He did so three times.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you describe what happened -- first of all, can you tell the Court, Madam Witness, exactly how old you were in April 1994?
A.	I was about 15 years of age, a little over 15 years of age.
Q.	Can you tell the Court if all the rapes took place at the same location?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Phillips, what do you mean by "all the rapes".
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Because she testified that she was raped three times, Your Honour.  I can go back to it.  Maybe you missed that.  The initial question was how many times, and she said three times.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Sorry Madam Witness, can you confirm all the rapes --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why don't you ask her where the rapes took place?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Because there are issues concerning her identity and I have to be careful how I deal with this without exactly blowing her cover, and I don't want to go into closed session, so I am being very careful as to the location of the rapes in the understanding that we all understand where the witness was located throughout the genocide, and I don't really have to go into those particular details, but if Your Honour wants me to do that, then I will have to close the session.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, you don't have to close the session.  You have already asked where the first one took place.  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I don't recall that, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Her evidence was that in the house where***********************.  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In the room.
JUDGE MUTHOGA: 
In the room ************************, so the next question would be, "Did the second one happen in the same room, and the third one in the same room?" and we'll have the answer.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And that is precisely what I was trying to avoid, Your Honour, drawing the reference of the room, because then that does connote ********************, and that is exactly what I didn't want to do.  I didn't want to allude to *******************, because that is what Your Honour has just done, and I would ask for it to be struck off the record.
JUDGE SHORT:
Does that disclose *******************? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It does, Your Honour, if you consider the evidence in its entirety, and the comments that His Honour has just repeated, which I'm not going to repeat, because I don't want to draw attention to it.  Considered in the entirety of this witness's testimony, it leaves very little doubt where she was located in 1994, that particular location, and maybe, Your Honours, I need to make an application under Rule 79 so that I don't actually compromise the evidence of my own witness at the expense of the public actually being able to follow what we are doing, but it is now of a sensitive nature that if we can't all agree on certain parameters, then I would have to close the session.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have deliberated and we will go into closed session.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm grateful, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please, go into closed session.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are now in open session, so avoid mentioning the name of your place of residence or any other information that may lead to your identification.  

Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I will still crave your indulgence because a while ago, the Prosecutor craved your indulgence.  I don't remember having expressly stated that I accepted.  All I see on the other side is friends and I accept his indulgence and I would like that to feature in the records.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which, the sketch of the courtroom? 
MR. SONGA:
The Prosecutor craved your indulgence at the beginning when we were talking about problems relating to disclosure of documents. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, he did.  Are you accepting his apology?  Let the record reflect that the Professor accepts the Prosecutor's apology for failure to disclose adequately, which was inadvertent, not deliberate. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you should be thankful.  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful to my learned friend. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you.  May we proceed?   
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, how can you explain how you could have been two metres away from where the meeting was being held and yet you could not hear what was being said? 
A.	I did not hear what was being said because I was inside the house, the doors were shut.  I was looking through chinks in the door but I could not hear what was being said at that meeting. 
Q.	However, Witness, you state that in your statement -- in your statement of the 30th of August 1999, that while you were inside the house, you heard Muhimana say that the population had refused to take part in the genocide; is that correct? 
A.	Before that meeting was convened, yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Were you able to determine the objective of that meeting?  
A.	I thought that before that meeting was convened, I heard that members of the population were not motivated to commit the genocide, and it was necessary to convene the meeting to rally them and to sensitise them in order to encourage them to go out and kill people. 
Q.	When you state, Witness, that Mika made a statement, to whom was Mika speaking? 
A.	I do not know to whom he was speaking, but I heard him say what he said.  He did not know that I had heard him.  Subsequently, that meeting was held in that location. 
Q.	When you heard him speak, were you able to retain the words he used? 
A.	I stated that I heard him say that members of the population were not motivated to commit massacres, and it was necessary to convene a meeting to sensitise them so that they should go out and kill people.
Q.	Witness, how did you know that Mika, Sikubwabo and Ruzindana spoke during that meeting? 
A.	I saw them while the meeting was being held.  I did not state that I heard them say anything in particular, but I stated that I saw them in the company of Mika and members of the population. 
Q.	You state that you saw Ruzindana, Sikubwabo and Mika about seven times -- five times, sitting in Mika's room; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did you know Ruzindana? 
A.	I knew him when he started ******************.
Q.	When did he start **************************?
A.	In the month of April, during the war.  It was during that period that I saw him. 
Q.	Do you confirm that he usually ******************************? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that.
Q.	Every morning, from what date, please? 
A.	It was two days after the president's death.  That was the period during which I started seeing him there.
Q.	Do you confirm that you saw Ruzindana's vehicle?
A.	Yes, I saw his vehicle.
Q.	Would you also confirm the make of that vehicle? 
A.	It would appear that it was a vehicle with two seats in front and behind was a large space. 
Q.	In your statement of the 9th of October 2002, you make mention of a Daihatsu car, do you confirm that information? 
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Was Mika always returning in that same vehicle? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And who is Sikubwabo, Witness? 
A.	Sikubwabo was the bourgmestre of that commune during that period. 
Q.	For how long did Sikubwabo and Ruzindana usually stay i*****************************? 
A.	They stayed for a long period of time inside the house.
Q.	At what time of the day or the night was it? 
A.	I used to see them in the morning and I would see them again between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. 
Q.	Do you mean that before leaving they always met inside the room? 
A.	That is where they were. 
Q.	Please I want you to clarify one thing, Witness.  When you state that you saw them five times, should we take it that they left together only those five times? 
A.	I am only giving an estimate.  I do not remember the other times I met them.
Q.	You make mention of Interahamwe who regularly accompanied Sikubwabo and Ruzindana.  How do you know you are dealing with Interahamwe?
A.	I saw them armed with machetes and spears; some of them were even carrying guns but it wasn't everybody, of course.
Q.	Do you confirm that you saw them from your room where you were? 
A.	Yes, it is from there that I saw them. 
	(Pages 46 to 48 by Sithembiso Moyo)


























	1745H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I don't know whether the numbers have been retained.  Was that from the same room where you could see the meeting being held? 
A.	Yes, it was the same room.
Q.	And when were you in room No. 8?
A.	You mean during the war in April? 
Q.	It's possible that the question wasn't clear.  I'll try to repeat it.  When you saw the Interahamwe accompanying Sikubwabo and Ruzindana, was it always from the same room, that is the room from which you saw the meeting being held?   
A.	Yes, it was from there.
Q.	Thank you.  You also state, Witness, that the Interahamwe were not authorised to enter ***************; is that correct? 
A.	Whenever they wanted to, those Interahamwe went in.
Q.	May I quote a passage from your statement?  In your statement of 1999, you state that "Most of the time, Ruzindana and Sikubwabo came to the house accompanied by Interahamwe.  Those Interahamwe *******************************************.  They used to wait outside the house.  I could see them through the chinks in the door."  Do you confirm that statement? 
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Can we therefore take it that you meant they did *************************? 
A.	It depended on the mood of the master of the house.  Whenever he didn't want them to get in, they did not get in.  Whenever he didn't want them to get in, they did not get in.
Q.	Did you ever see them enter the house at one time or the other? 
A.	************************************************************************.  On that occasion, ****************** house, and there were two Interahamwes.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We take it, therefore, that you saw Interahamwe enter the house only once and there were two of them.  That was the day they *****************************; isn't that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you state that you could see the Interahamwe through chinks in the door, can you tell us which door that was? 
A.	It was the front door.  I had left the room in which I usually stayed and I went to the front door and that was where I could see.
Q.	Thank you.  When Mika, Sikubwabo and Ruzindana were in one of **************************, was the ********************************? 
A.	The ********************.
Q.	Thank you.  Could you please tell us the exact date of the meeting? 
A.	I did not write the dates of their meetings.
Q.	Thank you.  Let us now talk about the rape of your sister in his room.  Do you confirm that you witnessed that rape? 
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Witness, where were you during the rape? 
A.	I was there where he took her, and I could tip-toe and follow him to where I could see him rape her.
Q.	Do you continue to say that the rapes occurred on four occasions? 
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	At what time was the first rape committed? 
A.	It was between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Q.	What was the duration of the rape? 
A.	It lasted a short time, but I cannot tell exactly how long it lasted, because I did not have a watch, but I know it lasted quite some time.  I wasn't wearing a watch in order to be in a position to say for how long he was with my sister.
Q.	Was it once or several times?  I mean, on the first occasion he raped her, did he do it once or several times? 
A.	I stated to you that he raped her on four occasions.
Q.	Let me rephrase my question to make it clearer, Witness.  It's possible that it was not very clear.  I have also understood that the rapes occurred on four different occasions, that is four different days, but my question to you is whether, on that day, that is on the first occasion, he raped her in several rounds. 
A.	He raped her in one round, and on another occasion he again raped her.
Q.	We take it, therefore, that on the first occasion, the rape was only in one round?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is her answer. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Where were you, Witness? 
A.	I have stated to you that I was first of all in the room from which my sister was taken away.
Q.	How was the rape done?  What particular acts did you witness? 
A.	I saw the man forcefully drag my sister away, brutally.  My sister was screaming.  He really dragged her right into his room.  And while he was dragging her, my sister was screaming and struggling with him.  He made her to lie on his bed, and then he started raping her.
Q.	Witness, did you see with your own eyes Mika raping her? 
A.	Yes.  I saw him.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, what do you mean by "rape"?  What act are you describing as rape?  What did you see that you describe as rape? 

THE WITNESS:
This is what I saw.  He brutally dragged my sister while she was screaming, and Mika dragged her to his room, put her on his bed, undressed her, and then he himself undressed and started raping her. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you have spoken of these rapes, stating that you could see what was happening because the doors were open; is that correct?
A.	That is exactly what I have stated.  I stated that the doors were open, the doors were not shut, they were open.
Q.	You were, however, outside the house, Madam Witness, and not inside?
A.	I was on the threshold and I could see what was happening.
Q.	Why do you talk of open doors, whereas in your statement with regard to this rape, that is your written statement, you state as follows:  "I witnessed those rapes only four times because on some occasions, he left the door open."  Why are you now talking of doors? 
A.	There were two doors.  There is a first door and then a second door, that is the door into his room.
Q.	If we were to look at the sketch or to show you the sketch, would you be in a position to show us that those doors are in a straight line, parallel to the wall, or in another position?  If you haven't understood me clearly, I will rephrase my question. 
A.	The doors were opposite one another.  When you left the first door, you could walk straight to the next door, the second door.
Q.	Witness, you did not leave the first door, did you?
A.	I did not leave the first door.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President --
JUDGE SHORT:
Sorry, I didn't hear your question -- I didn't hear the translation of your question.  Would you kindly repeat your question? 
MR. SONGA:
I will try to repeat that question, Your Honour.  With regard to the witness's statement, this is the question I put to her:  "Witness, while you were standing outside, if you looked at the two doors, are they on the same line?" 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Those doors are on a straight line, one after the other. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	And once the door leading into the second room is opened, does it immediately reveal or hide or conceal the bed? 
A.	The door was open and the bed was visible.

MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I crave your indulgence, but I would like us to come back to this diagram so that the witness can indicate how the doors open in relation to the location of the bed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please, take the diagram and put it on the projector. 

Do you want the witness to be near the projector? 
MR. SONGA:
If she wishes, Madam President.  I do, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you go to the projector again, please? 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you confirm the statement that you made a while ago that the doors are in a straight line?  The door of room 6 and the door of room 7, do these two doors -- are these two doors in a straight line, according to this diagram? 
A.	In my view, these doors are in a straight line.
Q.	And if this line were not straight, what would one surmise?  If you find that this is straight, then what would one say that the lines are not straight?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Objection, Your Honour, that question has been asked and answered.   That's her evidence.
JUDGE SHORT:
And more important, Professor, you are the one who drew the sketch.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor it depends on how you draw the straight line.  She is looking at the straight line probably from the point of where she was standing. 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, if I remember my elementary geometry, she might be right in saying that it's a straight line, but the idea that I would like to express and I hope I will be able to do so is this -- 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, if one were to draw a line between the first door and the second door, might one see that this line -- how can I say it?  Might I say that this line is parallel? 
MR. SONGA:
I think it is difficult for the witness. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It's very difficult for anyone.  Any two points are on a straight line.  There have to be three before a straight line issue comes up.

MR. SONGA:
The problem is a real one, in the sense that I realise that there will be no parallel.  So one cannot see that one sees straight ahead, but, Your Honours, this is a difficult bit of geometry.  I am going to ask the second question regarding this diagram. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Where is the lock of the first door? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, the lock of the door?  Do you see it on the sketch? 
MR. SONGA:
I am continuing to make some effort, Your Honours, to make myself understood.  If your patient with me, perhaps I might succeed.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If you really want to succeed, Professor, you would have to establish the position of the bed so that you have three positions. 
MR. SONGA:
I am going to try a mode of expression, Your Honours. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How do the doors open?  Do they open towards the left or towards the right?  The first door, for example, does it open to the left or to the right? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Right of what? 
MR. SONGA:
In relation to the person who is entering, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this question is put to you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you understand the question? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not understand this question very well. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, when you enter the house through the door of room No. 6, you push the door.  Does it go to the left or to the right? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We have to object to that, Your Honour.  There is nowhere in this witness's evidence that she said you pushed the door.  The door can either be pushed or pulled.  Now, I don't recall her ever saying you pushed the door.  So the question should be rephrased.

JUDGE SHORT:
I think what's --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Open the door.
JUDGE SHORT:
I think what the Professor means is when you open the door, does it open to the left or to the right?  Am I correct? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
That is exactly the good interpretation, even if I took sometime to get my idea across. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, have you understood the question? 
THE WITNESS:
I have understood the question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please answer it, then. 
THE WITNESS:
I have answered you that you can use your right hand to open this door. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, the problem is not which hand you will use.  You may use your left hand or your right hand.  That is not the issue.  But how does the door move?  Does it move to the left or does it move to the right?
A.	When you open the door, it moves to the right. 
Q.	You're referring to the first door in this case.  So how does the second door, which opens into room No. 7, open? 
A.	It opens in the same way as that of room No. 6.  It opens to the right. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You state that door No. 7 opens towards the right.  Madam Witness, can you now describe to us the location of the bed? 
A.	The bed was in room No. 7. 
Q.	Would you describe the location of this bed?  For example, was it along the wall on the right? 
A.	There were -- the room was in the middle of the -- the bed, sorry, was in the middle of the room.
Q.	It did not touch any wall, Madam Witness?
A.	No.  The bed did not touch the wall.  It did not have any links with the wall.
Q.	What was the position of the head of the bed? 
A.	The head of the bed was on the north side. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, you may authorise the witness to go back to the witness box for the time being.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you specify the north side?  Madam Witness, please go to the projector once again.  Madam Witness, can you specify which side is the north side of room No. 7? 
THE WITNESS:
The north is on that side. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, take your seat, please. 

Professor, you may proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	We were talking about the first rape.  Let us now talk about the second rape.  At what time did this rape take place? 
A.	This happened also between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	And on that day, was your sister taken still from room No. 8? 
A.	Yes.  It was in this room that -- it is from this room that she was dragged.
Q.	And you followed stealthily your sister and Mika? 
A.	I followed them.
Q.	And you stayed at the same place as on the previous occasion? 
A.	I stayed at the same place.
Q.	For how long? 
A.	I stayed there for quite a while.
Q.	Thirty minutes, one hour? 
A.	Perhaps 30 minutes.
Q.	Did the act last for this time?
A.	That's an estimate on my part, yes.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter did not hear the question by the Professor. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, the interpreter didn't hear your question.  Please repeat your question, and maintain a pause between the question and the answer. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I was asking how much time, Madam Witness, did you stay at that spot.  I heard your answer.  I believe you said 30 minutes.  The following question was this:  Did this 30 minutes correspond to the actual duration of the act of rape?  And lastly, I asked you, Madam Witness, while the rape was taking place, what were you doing at that place?  Would you answer the Court so that we could make some progress? 
A.	If I were to make an estimate, I would say that the act lasted 30 minutes, and -- and it was during this time that I observed the rape that was being perpetrated on my sister. 
Q.	On this second occasion, Madam Witness, what did the rape consist of?  What did Mika do exactly? 
A.	He came, he dragged her once more, and while he was dragging her, he was doing so fairly roughly and my sister was screaming.  When he dragged her into his room, my sister continued to scream.  She was struggling but she was not able to resist the physical force of Mika.  Mika threw her onto the bed, undressed her, he undressed himself and began to rape her. 
Q.	What did he do at that time? 
A.	What did he do?  He undressed her and had sexual intercourse by force with my sister, and during this act my sister was screaming a lot, but unfortunately nobody came to her aid.
Q.	Madam Witness, could you describe to us what happened on the third occasion? 
A.	On the third occasion, he came, he dragged my sister off.  My sister did not resist, because she had realised that resistance or screaming did not help her at all.  And on the fourth occasion --
Q.	Please go on, Madam Witness.  On the third occasion, what -- at what time of the day was it? 
A.	This happened between 7 -- 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Q.	As on the first and second occasions; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you still followed the movement? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you stood still at the same place? 
A.	Yes, still at the same place.
Q.	And Mika did the same thing? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And how long did this last? 
A.	This lasted quite a while, but if I were to make an estimate, I would say between 30 minutes and one hour.
Q.	And what did this act consist of, on the third occasion? 
A.	On the third occasion, he came, he dragged her, he dragged my sister, but, in fact, on the third occasion, my sister did not scream because, before, she had screamed and nobody had come to save her.  She accepted to go.  He took her by the hand and led her up to his bed and raped her as he had done before.
Q.	You say that she had not been saved.  Concretely speaking, who could have saved her? 
A.	But nobody came to her aid.  If somebody had come to her aid --
Q.	When did you leave the place where you were standing to observe the rape? 
A.	I do not know at what time I left this place, but I was standing there, I observed the scene, and when I had enough of it, I went away.
Q.	Madam Witness, when you say that you had had enough, it means that you left the place during the rape?
A.	I left the place during the time when Mika was carrying out his rape.
Q.	And this was on the third occasion? 
A.	Yes, on the third occasion.
Q.	What happened on the fourth occasion? 
A.	On the fourth occasion also, he came, he seized her from the room where we were.  He took her to his room, put her on the bed, undressed her, undressed himself, and began to rape her.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  And on that day, did you leave before, during or after the act? 
A.	I left this place during -- while Mika was continuing the rape.
Q.	You stated that on the third occasion, you also left while Mika was raping her.  How were you able to answer the question regarding how much time the rape lasted?  How could you know the time that the rape took? 
A.	I told you also that I was giving you an estimate that could have been between 30 minutes and one hour.
Q.	So you do not know the exact duration of the act on the third occasion?
A.	I can make an estimate, given that I was not wearing a watch.
Q.	Especially given the fact that you were not there until the end.  Were the two doors always open? 
A.	They were open.
Q.	When Mika undressed, did he undress completely or only in part? 
A.	I used to see him completely naked.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, I hope you will oblige us today again by finishing before we rise. 
MR. SONGA:
Since I have been in contact with you, I have been trained in the school of speed, and I think that I have become an increasingly better student.  You can count on me.  At seven o'clock, I will have finished. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I see. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, when we read your statement of the 30th of August 1999, on page 5, last paragraph, we see the following:  "Afterwards, he pushed her on to her bed.  At that time he told her that if she continued to resist, he would kill her, or rather, he would give her over to the Interahamwe to be killed.  He took off his shirt and his shorts.  He put down the zip of his trousers and he raped her."  What can we surmise regarding the undressing of Mika? 

Would you please answer the question? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, would you please clarify that?  You're referring to first time, second time, third time or fourth time? 
MR. SONGA:
We were still discussing the third time, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The portion of the evidence you have read to the witness was with respect to the first time when she said he himself unzipped his trouser and then he raped her.  This is in respect of the first time. 
MR. SONGA:
You are very correct, Madam President, but this is the first time that we are raising the issue of Mika's undressing himself.  I think I've -- I asked the witness the following question:  Madam Witness, what happened on the first occasion?  Did Mika remove all his clothes or part thereof?
THE WITNESS:
He removed his clothes completely.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	And now I will go back to your statement in the last paragraph thereof where we read the following:  "He removed his shirt and his shorts.  He brought down the zipper of his trousers and raped her."  Now, what do you confirm as the true version? 
A.	The truth is that he removed all his clothes.  That is the truth that I am repeating here.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You state the following on the 30th of August 1999, that at a point -- at that time, Mrs. Mika was hiding in a neighbouring bush because she was a Tutsi, and that is one of the reasons wherefore -- one of the reasons why the population refused to take part in the genocide is that his wife was a Tutsi and that she should have been the first to be killed.  Is that correct? 
A.	I did not allude to Habyarimana's wife.
Q.	I don't know if you heard the word "Habyarimana," or if there is an error on my part, but I was referring to Muhimana's wife. 
A.	Can you please repeat the question to me? 
Q.	Well, you stated on the 30th of August 1999, that at that point or at that time Mika's wife was hiding in a neighbouring bush because she was a Tutsi, and that one of the reasons wherefore the population had refused to take part in the genocide was that Muhimana's wife was Tutsi and that she was supposed to have been the first to be killed.  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	For how much -- for how long did Mika's wife remain hidden in the bush? 
A.	She hid there throughout the period during which the war lasted.
Q.	I think I heard she was hidden in the bush throughout the duration of the war?
A.	Yes.  You heard right. 
Q.	You say that she was hiding in the bush because she was Tutsi.  What about yourself?  What is your ethnic group? 
A.	I am equally a Tutsi. 
Q.	So why didn't you go to hide in the bush ***************************? 
A.	I used to hide also in the vicinity of the house but I didn't, you know, come out in public.
Q.	Do you want to say that you used to hide in the bush or in the neighbourhood? 
A.	I used to hide in the neighbourhood.
Q.	Madam, we would like to understand this.  On the one hand, you stayed in the house up until the end of the genocide.  On the other hand, you were in the bushes.  Now what are we to retain? 
A.	I wasn't hiding in bushes.  I used to hide inside the fence.  I was in the courtyard and therefore I couldn't go beyond the gates in order to reveal myself.
Q.	So you were not hiding in the bushes? 
A.	No.  I didn't hide in any distant bush.
Q.	Madam Witness, you have just stated that Mrs. Mika was hiding in a bush but today, before this courtroom and when you were -- when we were presenting the sketch, you said that Mrs. Mika was hiding in room No. 10 in the outhouse behind the house, the main house.  Is that what you stated?
A.	I stated that Mika's wife was hiding in the house that was behind the main house, but that house wasn't quite completed.  I'm talking about the construction thereof.
Q.	Now, enlighten us further.  Was she hiding in a bush or in the uncompleted house? 
A.	She was in that house.
Q.	So you lie when you say that she was in the bush? 
A.	Sometimes, she used to leave that house, and she would go to hide in bushes near those houses, and she could hide in those bushes, but she used to leave that -- the house to go and hide in the surrounding bushes.
Q.	Which place was safer between Mika's house and the bush?   
A.	Where she could hide very safely is where she couldn't be easily noticed or discovered, to be killed.
Q.	And which is that place?
A.	What I wanted to say is that it is in the house or in the surroundings of the house.
Q.	You state, Madam Witness, that Esperance was also raped by a certain Gisambo; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Who is Gisambo, Madam Witness? 
A.	Gisambo was an Interahamwe who **********************************.
Q.	Can you describe Esperance's rape by Gisambo?
A.	Gisambo came, took my elder sister, took him (sic) away forcibly into the house, and then he shut the door behind him.  In the meantime, my sister was screaming out loud but nobody came to her assistance. 
Q.	Do you confirm the statement made before this courtroom that you didn't see the rape with your own eyes? 
A.	I saw Gisambo drag her into the house.  And in the meantime, my sister was screaming aloud and she didn't have any assistance, but since the door was closed, I couldn't see exactly what was happening.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You say in the statement of August 1999, in the -- on the last page thereof that after the second rape by Gisambo, Muhimana shot him down.  But today, in this Chamber, you have stated that two Interahamwes came, abducted her, put her in a vehicle and you never saw her again.  So what is -- what are the facts?  What actually happened on that day?  What is the truth today? 
A.	The truth is that I have stated that Interahamwes came, sent by Mika and Ruzindana.  They took her along in a vehicle, and since that day, I haven't seen her again.
Q.	So in August 1999, you lied to the investigators of the ICTR? 
A.	I didn't lie in any way. 
Q.	Before this Chamber, you said that Mika raped you, isn't it?
A.	Yes, that's true.
Q.	Do you recognise that in your statement of August 1999, just as in that of 9 October 2002, you never mentioned this fact? 
A.	I talked about it.
Q.	We have the two statements here, Madam Witness.  Can you point out the portions of the statement relating to Mika's raping you in the statements? 
A.	Do you want me to show those portions to you in my statements? 
Q.	Yes, Madam Witness.  
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I asked a question as to whether she can point out the portions of the statement which talk about the rape by Muhimana.  And it may be well for the registry to show her. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	And if, Madam Witness, you cannot, please tell us and we can proceed, because there are other questions. 
A.	I stated that Mika started raping me after my elder sister had been killed and who has also been raped before.
Q.	You are not addressing the question, Madam Witness.  Can you indicate to us the parts of your statement where you're talking about the rape by Mika Muhimana?  I am ready. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, when did you tell the investigators about your rape by Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
Do you want me to tell you the date? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you made two statements before the investigators, one in August 1999, and second, October 2002.  Did you mention your rape by Mika in any of those two statements? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I talked about the rape. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But none of the two statements mentioned the rape, your rape by Mika.  Can you read or -- write or read? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Madam President. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, how many times were you interviewed by the investigators of the Tribunal? 
THE WITNESS:
I was questioned by the Tribunal investigators three times. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And on what occasion did you tell them about your rape by Mika?  The first, second or third time? 
THE WITNESS:
It was on the third occasion. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know when that third occasion was? 
THE WITNESS:
I think it was in year 2002.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you give us the month? 

THE WITNESS:
I cannot remember the month. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, Mr. Phillips, in your reconfirmation statement of this witness, can you please give us the date of that? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It was this year, Your Honour, sometime in March.  But I --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
2004.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, certainly it was this year.  It was March.  It was only last month.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thanks. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, we note that there is no mention of it in the two statements that we have.  You can just proceed.  
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like to read a portion of your statement of 9 October 2002.  On the last page, and we read as follows:  "Although" -- and that's the last page, first paragraph.  "Although being a Tutsi, ********* myself were never worried during the war.  It is certainly because we were l************  *******************, because all the other Tutsis of the secteur had fled to find refuge in the hills where they were attacked all the time by the Hutus."  Do you recognise that portion of your statement? 
A.	I had a problem because I was raped.  So at least I had a problem. 
Q.	Is that your statement? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, this is a statement of? 
MR. SONGA:
The statement of 9 October 2002, Your Honour, and referring to the last page thereof. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Okay. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, please answer the question. 

Professor, can you repeat your question, please? 
MR. SONGA:
With pleasure, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, and I am reading your statement of 9 October 2002, and this is where we read therein, "Though  *******************Tutsis, we had never been bothered during the war.  This was certainly because *************************, for all the other Tutsis of the secteur had fled and taken refuge in the hills where they were always attacked by the Hutus."  Do you confirm that statement? 
A.	How I could have said that I was never bothered, whereas I had some problems at Mika's home?
Q.	Madam Witness, in your statement of August 1999, on the last page, we read as follows:  "Esperance had ******************************************************* nothing."  And the sentence that is of concern here is the following:  "In spite of that, I was neither a witness of any other rape or killing perpetrated by Muhimana."  Do you confirm that statement? 
A.	I confirm what I said with respect to the rape of my sister.
Q.	The question, Madam Witness, doesn't have to do with the rape of your sister, on which I questioned you at length.  My question is as follows:  Do you confirm the following statement?  "Besides that I was not witness to any other rape or killing perpetrated by Muhimana." 
A.	How can I confirm that when he raped my sister?  I cannot confirm that. 
Q.	Madam Witness, still in the same statement, you say that you remained in that house until the end of the genocide.  Do you confirm that?
A.	I confirm it.
Q.	I will put to you your statement of 9 October 2002.  On the last page:  "******************************* that I go and -- that I go and meet the other refugees at Bisesero before leaving.  I went there alone.  I left at night alone and only reached in the morning, and I stayed there until the French arrived."  Now, do you confirm that statement?
A.	I confirm it. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have -- I made a firm commitment to say that I was going to wrap up the 
cross-examination at 7 p.m., and I would like to stick to that, and I'd like to thank Madam Witness for her availability, and I would like to thank the President for this session.  I will simply like to tender some exhibits. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  What are the documents, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
We would like to tender the declaration of 30 August 1999, the statement of 9 October 2002, in both the French and English versions. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
The written statement of this witness dated 9 October 2002 is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 18, D. 18F, the French version, and Exhibit D. 18E for the English, under seal. 
	(Exhibit Nos. D. 18F and D. 18E admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the statement of 30th of August 1999 is entered as Exhibit D. 19F for the French version and Exhibit D. 19E for the English version, both under seal. 
	(Exhibit Nos. D. 19F and D. 19E admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips, do you have any re-examination? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, just one question.  Probably last five minutes. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, can I ask you, when you gave your statement of August 1999, and your second statement of October 2002, you didn't mention in those statements that you had, in fact, been raped yourself.  However, you mentioned to us in March or February this year that you had.  My question to you is:  Why did you wait until February this year to tell us what you say Mika had, in fact, done to you personally, not your sister?  Do you have a reason for that? 
A.	I had reasons which compelled me not to say so.
Q.	Now, can you tell me what those reasons were, why you had not mentioned on the two previous occasions, to investigators, that you had been raped?  Can you tell me what those reasons are, or tell the Court? 
A.	Yes.  I can give you the reasons.  The reason that made me not to mention my rape is that I was thinking that I could talk about the rape of my sister and not talk about mine, because for me it was something shameful and I couldn't talk about it.  Subsequently, other victims of rape told me what had happened to them and we compared notes, and subsequently I realised or understood that I could also talk about my rape to the investigators of the Tribunal.  And it was after I had noticed that I realised that I must talk about it, but before, for me it was something very shameful and I did not have the courage to talk about it.  It was really a burden on my chest. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have no further questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you see Mika in the court today? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I can see him.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you please identify him? 
THE WITNESS:
I recognised him. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you tell us where is he? 
THE WITNESS:
He is on the back row.  He is wearing a skullcap and a black jacket, as well as a tie. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you stand up and point towards him? 
THE WITNESS:
I can see him there at the back of the hall, of the courtroom. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We observe that the witness has identified and recognised the Accused. 

Madam Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for your having come to Arusha to testify before this Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.  
	(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before we stop for the day, we may inform you that tomorrow we will start the hearing in the morning in Court No. III.  It's this courtroom?  In this courtroom.  We resume at 9:30 a.m. until 5 p.m., with a short break at eleven and -- short break at eleven and lunch break at one, one-hour lunch break at one. 

Yes, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  My client has instructed me to tell you that because of his health, it will be difficult for him to withstand such a long hearing.  If you can revisit the timetable for tomorrow's hearing, he will be grateful. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, what revision are you asking for? 
MR. SONGA:
The state of health of my client, Madam, is what I'm referring to, but if you want me to give you further details, I think you'll have to consult my client himself. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What you're being asked, Professor, you have asked that we revise our timetable.  What is the revision you want?  Is it to extend the break or is it to extend the time or is it to narrow it down?  What is the revision you're asking for?  Noting that there is need to -- we have lost quite a lot of time, as you know, in the trial.  We have the fortune of having courtroom space in the morning.  We are trying to make the best of that situation.  We are asking you to tell us what it is -- what modification you would want in the timetable to accommodate your position so that we are able to deliberate on it. 
MR. SONGA:
I will apply for leave, Your Honour, so to consult my client, after which I'll be able to answer your questions.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  My client is saying that he is ready to be part of the proceedings from nine to 2 p.m. because he is taking medicines that weaken him, and I think we are pleading with you and stating that he can with stand the proceedings from nine to 2 p.m.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, at one we will have a lunch break for one hour, so he can have medicine at one or in between one and two.  There doesn't seem to be any reason why can't he have medicine. 

Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
I think I have said all I can say on the state of health of my client, Madam President.  I can only wait to hear the wise decision that you will have taken on the matter.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we have deliberated and we have revised our schedule.  We will resume the hearing at 9:30 a.m. until 3 p.m. without any lunch break; however, a short break of 15 minutes at one.  Is it okay with you now? 
MR. SONGA:
I am most obliged, Madam President, for that compromise solution.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So we adjourn for the day and resume tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m..  
	(Court adjourned at 1918H)
