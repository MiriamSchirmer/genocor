MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon to all present here.  The Court is in session now.  We believe the appearances for the parties are the same.

Thank you.  

Appearance for the Defence?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
How are you today?
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President, I am feeling fine. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That is good.

Madam Witness, you are a protected witness.  We will not call you by your name.  We will record your evidence under your pseudonym, AU.  So you don't have to disclose your identity.  I mean, don't reveal your name, name of your parents, your place of residence, or any other information that may lead to your identification.  You should speak the truth, and for that you have to take solemn declaration.  

Mr. Issa, please swear in the witness.
(Declaration made by Witness AU in Kinyarwanda)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before we proceed, we may inform you that today the Court session would be up to 5 p.m. because of the anniversary of the genocide, which is being held in the building of the Tribunal, and we the judges are also to attend the commemoration ceremony.  Thank you.  

Madam Prosecutor, please proceed.
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Before I deal with this witness I wanted to make a point of correction.  This exhibit, Defence Exhibit No. 10, which we indicated is a signed copy of the witness statement of Witness BJ, in French.  We note that we do not have a signed copy.  The copy which we indicated was signed, was signed by the person who carried out an interview.  So we just wanted to make a correction so that the record will reflect that the copy tendered in the exhibit is not signed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's noted. 
WITNESS AU,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor, please proceed.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, when did you first hear about the death of the president?
A.	We were at the hospital in Ngoma, in a church.
Q.	Do you recall the month?
A.	It was in 1994.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Why were you in the church?
A.	We were with many refugees.  We were with many refugees.  When we arrived inside the church, we were told that the president was dead.  There were two gendarmes who were guarding us.  At around 9 a.m. on Saturday, the war began.  They began to kill people.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I want to know why you decided to go to the church.
A.	We went to Ngoma to take refuge after the death of the president.
Q.	Can you describe to the Court the security situation which led you to go to the church after the death of the president?
A.	We saw people running away.  We went towards the church.  When we arrived at the church, the president was dead.  We learnt of this when we reached the hospital.  There were gendarmes who were guarding us, and there were also Interahamwe who were present at this place.  

And one Saturday at around 9 a.m., they began to kill people.  And it is, in fact, under these conditions that we heard of the death of the president.  The Hutu immediately began to kill the Tutsi who were at this place. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You are referring to "we," were you in the company of other people when you went to this complex?
A.	Yes, I was with many people.
Q.	Among the "many people," did you also go with your family members?
A.	Yes, many members of my family were with us; my parents, the children in my family, almost the entire family had gathered in Ngoma. 
Q.	You referred to your parents.  What's the ethnic background of your parents?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	You also referred to your children.  How old were your children?
A.	One of them was five years' old, and the second one was three years' old.
Q.	Your children, what were their ethnic group?
A.	They were Tutsi.  Their father is dead.
Q.	You referred to their father.  Do you know which ethnic group did the father belong to?
A.	I had gone to my parents to visit them.  I was married in Rusinyi (phonetic).  When arrived in the house, the war began, and I went towards the hospital with two of my children to seek refuge.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  What ethnic group did your husband belong to?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	What happened to your husband?  Do you know what happened to your husband?
A.	In Ngoma, where I had sought refuge, I learnt that he had been killed, but I do not know under what conditions he was killed.
Q.	Did you, at any stage, manage to bury your husband?
A.	I couldn't do it because everybody was trying to save their own life.  I was with my parents in Ngoma and -- as well as my two children, but I was not with my husband.  I was in Ngoma hospital.  I do not know under what conditions he died, and I was not able to bury him.  I can only talk about the conditions under which the persons who were with me died. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness; I am sorry for that.  Let's move on and talk about your children.  Your children, you said one was five years' old, the other one was three years' old.  What happened to your children?
A.	When we arrived inside the church, they were killed.  And after killing 40 persons, we left the church.  I went to the hospital surgery in a small room to hide.  And while I was there, the Interahamwe went here and there killing people. 

It is a certain Mika who got me out and pushed me to the ground.  He took a knife.  I screamed.  He climbed on me.  He used the knife he had to tear the trousers that I was wearing.  I was also wearing two items of underwear; he also tore them up with his trousers (sic).  He climbed on me and had sexual intercourse with me, while he was banging my head on the floor.  Afterwards I remained lying amongst the bodies that were at this place.  It was around 2 a.m. that I got out of that place, and I went towards the lake, where I took a small canoe that took me right to Zaire. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  I want to thank you for your strength for sharing that with us.  

I also want to tell you that it is very important for the Court to know what happened step by step.  So I want to take you back and just refresh your memory on what you have just told the Court.  You indicated that when the complex was attacked, you went to what you refer to as the surgical room. 
A.	We first took refuge in the church.  When 40 people were killed, I decided to go and hide in the theatre in the house -- in the basement.  Many Interahamwe arrived.  Amongst them, I was able to identify Mika, who was carrying a gun, a club called mpongano (phonetic), and a knife.  

He pulled down my trousers.  I was wearing two articles of underwear.  He pushed me onto the ground and had sexual intercourse with me.  I stayed under the bodies, and I got out from under the bodies at around two o'clock in the morning.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  In this room when you say "Mika" -- in fact, can you first clarify when you say "Mika," who is Mika?
A.	He was a conseiller, and on that day he was accompanied by many Interahamwe.
Q.	Did you know Mika before this day when he came to the surgical room?
A.	It's a long time ago, but in any case, I knew him.  He lived in Gishyita.
Q.	For how long had you known Mika Muhimana, that is, before this incident which you described which happened in the surgical room?
A.	I had known him for a long time because when I was getting married I was 16 years' old.  I knew him.  I used to see him at Gishyita.  During the massacres, he used to say that Tutsis should be killed.  He was accompanied by other Interahamwe.  I saw him bearing a knife, a gun, and it was with the aid of his knife that he undressed me. I was wearing a pair of trousers and two articles of underwear. He tore my two articles of underwear with his knife.  He had sexual relations with me twice, and while he was doing that, he was beating me.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  While Mika Muhimana was having sexual intercourse with you and was beating you, did you see what the Interahamwes were doing?
A.	I saw many young girls, women, and I saw these Interahamwe maltreat these persons.  I know three of these young women.  And these other Interahamwe were also armed with guns and clubs.  I was not able to discover the names of all these girls and women.  After having raped the young girls and women, they were killed.  There is also a certain Ezekia Ntakirutimana, who was accompanying these Interahamwe.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  We will come to Ezekia Ntakirutimana to whom you have referred.  

You said the Interahamwes were maltreating these girls and raping them.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	It was -- and you also indicated this is the same room where Mika Muhimana had sexual intercourse with you.
A.	Yes, these other people were lying down on the ground in the church.  I was able to identify some of these people.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, may the witness be requested to come closer to the microphone because we are having trouble hearing her.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, could you please come closer to the microphone?  

Push the microphone towards the witness, Mr. Issa.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  We were talking about the Interahamwes who were raping the girls, and as a follow-up to that, I want to ask a question whether Mika Muhimana was present when these Interahamwes were raping the girls.
A.	He was present, and when he came in he was accompanied by a large crowd of Interahamwe.  We were on the floor in the church, and afterwards we went to the surgical room.  I was wearing trousers, he pulled down my trousers.  He had a -- was carrying a knife.  He pushed me to the ground, tore my underwear, and I screamed, and he had sexual intercourse with me twice.  

Afterwards, after his departure, I hid under the bodies that were there.  And after that, I went towards the lake at two o'clock in the morning.  I found a canoe which took me to the other side in Congo, and, also, when I returned to Rwanda I came in via the lake.  My parents, my sisters, my children, were killed at this place. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Now I just want to clarify a couple of aspects from your evidence. You indicated that Mika Muhimana had sexual intercourse with you twice.  Can you please tell the Court the interval of those acts of sexual intercourse?  Let's start with the first time Mika Muhimana had sexual intercourse with you.  Did you notice what Mika Muhimana was wearing?
A.	Yes, he was wearing trousers -- a pair of jeans and a white shirt.  Inside his trousers, he was wearing white underwear.   He pushed me to the ground; he tore my panties with a knife and he had sexual intercourse with me.  I begged him.  He did not listen to me; instead, he threatened to kill me. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Do you still recall the words Mika used when he threatened to kill you?
A.	He pushed me to the ground.  He climbed on my body; he tore my panties using a knife; he hit my head against the floor and had sexual intercourse by force with me twice.  I lay down under the bodies that were gathered at this place. I stayed there till two o'clock in the morning.
Q.	Thank you very much, madam.  Did Mika Muhimana say anything during the course of the sexual intercourse?
A.	When he took advantage of me, he promised taking me out of that area where the victims were; and he was saying that Tutsis had been handed over to them and that they should kill them.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Can you now describe to the Court how the second rape took place?  You said Mika Muhimana had sexual intercourse with you twice.
A.	The first time he had sexual intercourse with me, I thought he was going to take me out of that place where the victims were, but he instead had sexual intercourse with me again, a second time.  And while he was taking advantage of me, he hit my head against the floor.  Subsequently, I hid under the corpses, the bodies of the people who had been killed in that place.  I left at about 2 a.m.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness. You referred to a person by the name Ezekia Ntakirutimana?
A.	Yes, I referred to him.
Q.	Can you please -- thank you, madam.  Can you please tell the Court who Ezekia Ntakirutimana is?
A.	He was a trader who had a business in Kigarama.
Q.	How did you come to know about Ezekia Ntakirutimana?
A.	He resided in Kigarama.  He was a trader, and we met him whenever we went to fetch food while we were in Ngoma church.  When we met him, he was carrying a club, a big club.  And when I encountered him, he had pushed me to the ground and had sexual intercourse with me.  He asked me to go back.  I was crying, and I went back to the church, and I related to my parents and the other women who were there what had happened to me.
It was when the situation deteriorated that I saw him again.  When he and other people were abducting other young girls to go and rape them, he was with a group of people, a large number of people.  That was the only person I could identify in that group. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness. I want to take you back to the girls you referred to who were also in the surgical room.  Do you know any of those girls whom you say the Interahamwes were raping?
A.	I only knew them facially because they were my neighbours.  However, I do not remember their names.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know anyone by the name Immaculee Mukabarore?
A.	Yes, I knew her.
MR. SONGA:
Objection, Madam President.  The Prosecutor has put a question to the witness as to whether she knew the persons who were victims of acts of rape, and the witness answered by saying she only knew them facially.  I believe it is unnecessary to ask any further questions regarding their names.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, rephrase your question. 
MS. MADENGA:
Obliged, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Let's go back to the surgical room.  You indicated that Mika Muhimana was armed.  Can you describe to the Court how armed Mika Muhimana was on this day?
A.	He was carrying a gun.
Q.	How close to you was Mika when you saw that Mika was carrying a gun?
A.	There was a short distance between the church and the place where I was.
Q.	Let's now focus on this incident which took place in the surgical room.
A.	The incident occurred very close to the church, and the people who were there went towards the surgical ward where we were.  I, myself, was in the surgical ward with other persons.  We were all inside that room, and those persons left the church to come and hide with us.  At that time, each person was trying to save his life, his or her life.
Q.	Can you also tell the Court the circumstances under which you undressed or, as you indicated, part of it, that Mika undressed you?
A.	I believe I have described that to you, Prosecutor.  I can repeat it, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. I just wanted to know whether you actually wanted to undress, or how did it happen?
A.	He undressed me using a knife.  He cut my underwear and forced me to sleep on the floor.  I cried out asking him to -- excuse me, but he didn't want to hear what I was saying.  While he was raping me he was promising to take me out of that place, but he didn't do so.  And I left that room at 2 a.m. and I went towards the lake, and there I found a boat that took me to Zaire. 
Q.	Thank you very, Madam Witness.  You were referring to Mika Muhimana.  You also indicated that you had known Mika Muhimana before.  Can you identify the person you are referring to as Mika Muhimana?
A.	Although it is a long time since last saw him, I can still identify him.  As you know, you can never forget somebody who has hurt you.
Q.	Can you identify Mika Muhimana today?
A.	Yes, I can identify him.
MS. MADENGA:
You want to -- Your Honour, with your leave  --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Ask the witness whether she can see him.
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, that is what I wanted to --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Give her an opportunity to do so. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, from where you are sitting, can you see Mika Muhimana?
A.	He is that person sitting at the other end and who is dressed like a Muslim --
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
A.	-- and who has chubby jaws.  He is sitting there on the other side.  I see he is in good health, and he is looking plump.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Do you want to point exactly to which person  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness, please stand up and point towards the Accused, if you could identify him.  Yes, point towards Mika Muhimana. 
THE WITNESS:
He is there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you describe his clothes, what he is wearing? 
THE WITNESS:
He is wearing a dark jacket, a white shirt and a white cap. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has identified the Accused.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 

BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	In conclusion, Madam Witness, I want to take you back to the surgical room.  You indicated, before Mika Muhimana came, you were hiding with three girls.  Who were the three girls you were hiding with?
A.	The three girls are dead.  They were raped by other Interahamwe who were present; they were not raped by Mika.  But after they were raped, they were killed.  I am relating to you what happened to me.  

While Mika was raping me, he was telling me that he was going to take me out of that place.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness. Do you know the names of the three girls whom you say were killed?
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. SONGA:
Objection, Madam President.  
THE WITNESS:
That happened a long time ago.  I can't remember their names.
MR. SONGA:
The witness has already answered that question.  I don't know why the Prosecutor is insisting. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this is a different question.  He is asking the names of the girls who were killed in the presence of the witness. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you very much, Madam President.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Do you know who killed the girls, the three girls you were hiding with? 
A.	I identified among the executioners Ezekia Ntakirutimana, otherwise, I do not remember the other assailants; there were many of them.  By the way, Ezekia Ntakirutimana is still in exile.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you remember the names of the girls who were raped in your presence and were killed in your presence?
THE WITNESS:
One of them was called Mukabarore, Immaculee, the other was Josephine Mukangwiro, and the other I can only remember her first name, Bernadette; I don't remember her family name.  As you know, that happened a long time ago. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, please proceed.

BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  After this incident, did you at any stage see Mika Muhimana?
A.	I never saw him again. I left immediately.  I moved towards the lake, and there I found a small boat that took me to Zaire.  And on my return, I still came back to the country via the lake.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness, for your strength and for your testimony.  

I just want to ask you the very last question.  The lady you described as Bernadette, do you also know her surname?
A.	That was a long time ago.  I don't remember her name. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Your Honour, with your leave, the witness has indicated that she cannot recall the name.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She has done it three times, in fact. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  

Now, I am applying that the witness be allowed to refresh her memory. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  I have no further questions in examination-in-chief.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We may seek clarification from the witness.  

Madam Witness, the names which you mentioned just now, the names of three ladies, were they killed in your presence?  When you said they were raped in your presence, were they killed in your presence too?
THE WITNESS:
They were killed where I was hiding.  By the way, many other people -- 40 other people had been shot dead.  Assailants came and shot them dead.  There were many attackers, and among them was Ezekia Ntakirutimana.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Professor, please proceed with your cross-examinations. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Madam Witness, throughout the events that occurred in Rwanda from April to July 1994  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed with your cross-examination.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I was saying, Witness, that if you -- I was asking whether you stayed in the country or you left the country between the 6th of April and the 31st of July 1994?
A.	When I left the Mugonero complex, I went to Zaire, Ijwi Island, and I returned later.
Q.	Do you remember when you left the country?
A.	The date on which I left Ngoma, is that what you want to know? 
Q.	When you left Ngoma for Zaire. 
A.	I left Ngoma on that night at 2 a.m., and when I got to Lake Kivu I found a small boat that took me to Zaire.
Q.	Did you know Mika's family?
A.	Are you referring to his family? His family in Gishyita?
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I knew Mika, but as regards his family  --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness did not complete her answer; she stopped there. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us the various cellule that were in Mara secteur.

A.	Yes, I can do so.
Q.	Please do so.
A.	I lived in Mara secteur.
Q.	My question has to do with the cellules, Madam Witness.
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, I am going to ask that since the witness has indicated part of the protected information, it be kept under seal.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The protected information be kept under seal.  

Yes, professor, please proceed.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can you please answer my question?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you repeat your question, please? 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q. Witness, you stated that you could name the cellules that are in Mara secteur.  Could you please do so for the Chamber?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you want the names of all the cellules in Mara secteur.

MR. SONGA:
That is exactly what I mean, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, if you know the names of the cellules, please name them; and if you don't know, say that you don't know.  Answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
I knew there was Mara secteur.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Could Musenyi be one of those cellules?
A.	Yes.  There is a Kigarama cellule in Ngoma secteur.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, if we are referring to Musenyi cellule, it is because it is found in the 1999 statement.  In the documents disclosed to us by the Prosecutor, that cellule is not mentioned.  That is why I wanted the witness to confirm such information.  In the documents that were filed at the beginning of the trial, it is on page 223.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which document, the statement of the witness? 
MR. SONGA:
On the one hand, the declaration of witness on paragraph 2, mention is made of the Musenyi cellule and somewhere else in the document that was tendered at the beginning of the trial by the Prosecution, that's on page 223, we find a list of secteurs and cellules in the Gishyita commune, but that cellule does not appear there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, professor, proceed. 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May the counsel be requested to light his microphone. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, we take it you cannot give the name of any cellule where you lived?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Hold on, Witness.  

Professor, do you want to know the name of her cellule where she used to live?
MR. SONGA: 
I wanted to get to that, but if this will put her safety at risk, she can always write that down on a piece of paper. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you know the name of your cellule?  Don't tell the name of the cellule.  Do you know the name of your cellule?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know the name of my cellule.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you write it down for us?  Can you write it down for us?  
MS. MADENGA:
If I can assist the Court, the witness can neither write nor read.  Maybe what we can suggest is that if Defence counsel can indicate if the information is different from what we have already tendered as Prosecution Exhibit No. 10 -- it's Prosecution No. 10, then we suggest that maybe the witness get the assistance of a Kinyarwanda interpreter. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of her cellule is given in the protected information sheet at No. 10.  If you still want further clarification, we can ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to assist the witness.

Interpreter, please hold on for a while.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, you want to add something?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I am grateful, Your Honour.  I think that this matter -- my learned friend can handle this matter a lot more skilfully than he is doing.  There is clearly a discrepancy between what is contained in the witness statement of this lady and in the Prosecution Exhibit No. 10.  What he needs to do is simply ask her whether or not the information -- put the information to the witness and ask her to confirm whether or not that information is right or wrong.  I mean, that's what he's driving at.  He's driving at the second paragraph of her witness statement which contains information that is contrary to that in No. 10 of Prosecution Exhibit 10.  What he needs to do, simply, is to put that information to her and ask her to confirm whether or not he is right or wrong. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But before Professor Songa does that, let me point out that in the witness statement she says -- the witness statement was taken in 1999, and the particulars given in Exhibit 10 mentions residence in 1994.  So I think we need to get some clarity about the time we are speaking about. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And also that there is a reference to both where she lived and where her parents lived. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The first line of the witness statement in 1999, Your Honour, says, "I was residing --" at the location indicated there.  So we are taking that to assume that she was residing there in the period in question, which was in April 1994, Your Honour.  Based on that, that information contradicts with No. 10 in Prosecution Exhibit 10.  And that's what he should be doing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, professor. 
MR. SONGA:
I think, Mr. (Sic) President, that the honourable Judge has given the situation as it is, that is, there are discrepancies between the document that was made available to us, and we would like to find out the truth.  And the fact that the witness is illiterate would compel us to ask the interpreters to help us.  

What I am not comfortable with is the statement which talks about cellule, which is different from what we have in the sheet that was tendered to us.  And there is a name that does not appear on the list of cellules that we have in the Gishyita commune, so we need to find out the truth.  Where -- that is, where the witness was living in April 1994?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you know the name of your cellule where you lived in 1994?  Don't give the name. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know the name of my cellule of the time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you tell the interpreter, who could write it down for us?  

And switch off the -- interpreter, please switch off the mike.  

This name of the cellule is entered and admitted as exhibit -- and be kept under seal. 
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, I notice that the name written on the piece of paper by the witness is the same as written on Prosecution Exhibit No. 10, line 10. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you are right. 
MS. MADENGA: 
So I don't know the basis on which the Defence wants to tender that as a Defence exhibit. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That was written by the witness so we don't see any harm in that. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Indebted, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, how many times did you live in your cellule?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, the question is not clear.
MR. SONGA:
I would like to make it clearer, Madam President.
MR. SONGA:
On the 6th of April 1994, how many times had she come to live in her cellule as her residence?
THE WITNESS:
I had spent three months there.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What -- thank you, Madam Witness.  What was the distance between your residence and that of your parents?
A.	I had just spent four months in my residence.  At home, I was ill and I had to go to my parents' residence.  And then the war broke out at a time that I had just spent three months there. 
Q.	I will take over the question.  What was the distance separating your area -- your residence and that of your parents?
A.	When I left my residence -- when I left my parents' home in the morning, I reached my residence at about 11 a.m., at about 11 o'clock.
Q.	Would that have been in the morning?  When did you leave in the morning, what hour?
A.	Say at seven o'clock.
Q.	Madam Witness, were all your parents alive?
A.	They were both alive, but they died in Ngoma.
Q.	Was that during the events?
A.	Yes, during the events.
Q.	Did they die on the same day?
A.	Yes, on the same day.
Q.	Do you recall the date or the approximate date on which they died?
A.	They were killed very early in the morning, at about 9 a.m. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you spent about two weeks at your parents' residence, according to your statement.  This would be at about what date?
A.	We sought refuge together in Ngoma in 1994; that is where they died, my father and my mother, and my brothers and sisters, as well as other members of my family.
Q.	My question was meant to know if, after the two weeks that you spent at your parents' home you were still in the month of March or you were already in April?
A.	I spent the two weeks in my parents' home in March, and we sought refuge together in Ngoma, where they died. 
Q.	You must have realised, Madam Witness, that -- you and your parents, that Hutus were becoming very aggressive towards the Tutsis, and that is how you decided to flee to seek your future in the Mugonero complex with your two children; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did you have Hutu neighbours?
A.	Many of our neighbours were Tutsis, and all we have are ruins.  That Tutsis were living below -- the Hutus were living below.  As for us, we moved towards Ngoma.  There weren't many survivors.  We only have one here and one there. 
Q.	Why, Madam Witness -- or how did you notice that the Hutus were becoming very aggressive?
A.	People came up.  We, ourselves, we went -- we learnt that the president had died.  Many people came up.  There were soldiers, two soldiers that were keeping watch over us.  The Hutus came up; some came with spears, others with guns and started killing people in the church.  There were others who were bringing out of the church, members of their families, and there are some who would -- some who came and took the children that they had had with other women, and we felt that the war wasn't as serious as that.  They killed old women, old men and children.  I left the church when my mother and father had died, as well as other people.  There were so many corpses that were just lying there.
Q.	Madam Witness, you have spoken well in advance.  My question concerned the moment or the time during which you were with your parents and you noticed that the Hutus were becoming very aggressive.  I want to know the signs that showed the Hutus had become very aggressive. 
A.	They burnt down two houses and we saw very many people who were fleeing.  We ourselves, we fled, and when we reached the church, we learnt that the president had died.  We could come out only to look for something to eat.  But we ourselves we went up by ourselves.  It is on Saturday at about nine o'clock that they started killing, and they were only killing Tutsis.
Q.	Madam Witness, thank you.  What was the distance between the home of your parents and the Mugonero complex?
A.	To cover that distance, you needed 20 hours (sic).
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter will correct: "To cover that distance, you needed two hours."  
MR. SONGA:
I think the first translation was the good one.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Ask the witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, what was the distance between the residence of your parents and the Mugonero complex? 
A.	Well, when you are in a car, you use 20 hours to cover that distance.  So, when you leave my parents' home, you can cover that distance in 20 hours if you are in a car.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you mean to say 20, two zero hours? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, when you are in a car, you can cover that distance in 20 hours.  It will take you 20 hours to cover that distance. 
JUDGE SHORT:
When you are walking, how long would it take? 
THE WITNESS:
You would cover that distance in 30 minutes; it's very short distance. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, you have the answer. 
MR. SONGA:
The problem is there, indeed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How, Madam Witness, did you cover that distance?  How did you move from your parents' residence to the Mugonero complex? 
A.	You mean when I went to Ngoma?
Q.	When you and your parents and your children left your home to find refuge at the Mugonero complex, what was the means of transport that you used?
MADAM PRESIDENT.
Professor, we need to clarify a certain answer.  

Madam Witness, you said 20 hours if you go by car, 30 minutes if you go by foot.  Is it --
THE WITNESS:
Since I was with old persons, we couldn't cover that distance in 30 minutes.  I am talking about 30 minutes for persons who are healthy, who are young.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And what about 20, if you go by car; it is 20 hours or minutes? 
THE WITNESS:
I am talking about 20 minutes, if you are in a car. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You state that you didn't have time to go and inform your husband; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Why couldn't you afford the time?
A.	I was at my parents' home, and I wasn't well when the events occurred.  So when they did, I had to leave with my parents and the children.
Q.	Did you know the Mugonero complex before?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What did you realise when you reached the complex?
A.	Do you mean, Counsel, where we sought refuge?  We were with many other refugees and we went to the church with -- and other refugees joined us there.  Two soldiers who were guarding us also came.
Q.	Can you describe the Mugonero complex to us?  How is it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How can you describe the Mugonero complex?
A.	Before you arrived at the market square, you cross a piece of land and you go up.
Q.	You state that you were in the church where you found many refugees; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Was it your choice to go to the church rather than elsewhere?
A.	There were many other people.  We were in this church.  And after people were killed, we left the church to go to other rooms.  They killed very early in the morning.  People who had not yet taken their breakfast.
Q.	Why did you go to the chapel and not elsewhere?
A.	It is because many people were going to the church, other people were with many other corpses.  After 40 people were shot, the bodies were taken to the hospital, and everyone was trying to  save their own skin. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that the yard was full of refugees whose number you cannot estimate; is that correct?  Can you locate this yard?
A.	It is in front of the hospital.
Q.	And does this mean that all the hospital rooms were full?
A.	That is correct.  Some people came from Bisesero and other places.
Q.	You state that it is only upon your arrival at this complex in the Mugonero complex that you understood the reason for the aggressiveness of Hutus towards the Tutsi; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And what was this reason? 
A.	It was said that the president was dead, so the Hutu came and began to kill.  They killed old people, young people, children and young girls.
Q.	Do you confirm that it is also at that -- on that date that you learnt of the death of the president?
A.	We knew it on the following day when we were in the church, when people were running away.  They said that we were guarded.
Q.	Who told you of the death of the president?
A.	We heard of it when we arrived at the church.
Q.	You state that you spent two weeks in that church before the attacks began;  is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	In your opinion, Madam Witness, how many days are there in two weeks?
A.	Twenty days.
Q.	And in your view, when did the attacks take place?
A.	At about nine o'clock.
Q.	On what day, Madam Witness?
A.	It was Saturday.
Q.	Would you be able to tell us the date of the month?
A.	The day when the killing took place?  It was 1994, it was Saturday morning at 9 a.m.  That is when the war began.
Q.	You state that two gendarmes guarded the refugees.  Did you see these two -- for how long -- how many days did you see these two gendarmes?
A.	They had spent some days and they reassured us.  Even the son of Gerard came and he didn't tell us anything.
Q.	Now, how long were you able to see these gendarmes; one week, ten days?
A.	When we arrived in Ngoma, they guarded us for one week. And when the assailants came to kill, they were still there.
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that on a Saturday of the month of April, the medical complex where you had taken refuge suffered a violent attack; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	From what positions did you see the assailants?  Where were you when you saw the assailants come?
A.	We were in the church.
Q.	Could all those in the church see the assailants come?
A.	They came in large numbers in an attack.  They came singing.  People were making porridge and others were cooking food.  We had not yet eaten.  They started killing at nine o'clock, and at 10 o'clock there were many bodies.  Those who could come out -- and those who could be taken from the church were taken to the hospital.  They had come with clubs, nail-studded clubs which are called mpongano; they had guns and spears; they looted and killed.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You state that the assailants came with the aid of the following authorities:  Ruzindana, Obed; Mika Muhimana; Kayishema; Sikubwabo; and many others, all of them armed with guns; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Why do you call Ruzindana an authority?  In what way was he an authority?
A.	He had a trade in Mugonero, but when the events happened he came on board a vehicle which also carried many Interahamwe, amongst other persons.
Q.	In your view, a trader is an authority?
A.	But this person was an authority.  He was a conseiller.  He saw the assailants come, and these people were attacking an ethnic group.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you said "this person," who are you referring to?
THE WITNESS:
I am accusing Mika.  It is this person that I saw, and he did bad things against me.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Who was the leader of this group of persons that you have referred to?  Who was leading them?
A.	Mika was accompanied by Ezekia Ntakirutimana.  These young persons were carrying clubs.  He was carrying a gun.  I think I explained this to you. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you have named names.  I would like to know why these names are supposed to be authorities.  You referred to Ruzindana.  I believe I understood that you said that he was a conseiller as well. 
A.	No, it is Mika who was the conseiller.  Ruzindana, I knew him, but I do not know what he was doing.  But I saw him on board a vehicle in Ngoma; and in this vehicle there were many Interahamwe.  Probably if these Interahamwe were not there, some people would have escaped.
Q.	And who was Kayishema?
A.	I don't know whether he was an authority.  He was there with other people.  I didn't understand very clearly who they were, and if the assailants had not come there to select people to kill -- listen, if when we arrived, the premise is that we understood all of that.  When we were going to get something to eat, we came up face to face with the assailants in front of the hospital.  These assailants killed everybody, and the people who were there were unable to save anyone whatsoever.
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I saw him in Ngoma.  I am only citing the names of the people whom I knew.
Q.	Who was Sikubwabo? 
A.	Whom did you say?  There was Ntakirutimana and other people.  These people made up the attackers, and we thought that we were protected.  I am only telling you the events that I witnessed and what I went through.  I saw these people killing people. 
Q.	Madam Witness, did you know Sikubwabo?
A.	I did not know him, but I saw him coming to Ngoma with other people, and I was still young at that time.
Q.	When did you know him?
A.	What did you say?
Q.	When did you know Sikubwabo?
A.	When we were inside the church, it was said that the Tutsi had been given over to be killed, and it is at this time that we saw these people at that place.
Q.	Were you able to identify the weapon that was carried by each of the persons whose name you have called?
A.	Some of these people were armed with big clubs which are called mpongano and which are studded with nails.  Some of these people also had grenades.  I don't know what other weapons were used against the refugees.  And when they used that weapon, the refugees began to sneeze.
Q.	Were you able to identify the weapon carried by Mika? 
A.	He had a gun and a knife.
Q.	Only that?
A.	I am only referring to the weapons I saw him bearing.  He was accompanied by people who were carrying spears and most had Mpongano clubs, but he had a gun, and a knife that he used to abuse me. 
Q.	Did I understand you wrongly when I heard you say that there was also a club, when you stated so in this Court?  
A.	No, he was only carrying a gun and a knife, which I saw when he was in the room, and it was with this knife that he tore my panties.  I told you that I was wearing trouser, a wrapper and two sets of underwear.
Q.	You state that you went to take refuge in the theatre.
A.	That is exact; that is correct.
Q.	Did you know this room before?
A.	I knew the building, but I knew the upper part of the building.  When provisions were brought to sick people  -- when we came to visit the sick with provisions, we could see this building, but during this event everyone was trying to save his or her life and some assailants could lie to you and abuse you and go away.  
Q.	Madam Witness, are you able to describe this room to us?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Please do so.
A.	When you go towards the house, in the basement it is the second room on the left.
Q.	Can you tell us about the size, the length, the width, so that we can know the size of the room?
A.	It is a fairly small room.  There were some people above, there were some below. We went into this room and we lay down, and we did not close the door well.  In fact, we just pushed it to.  And when he abused me, I screamed a lot.  He threw me to the ground and until today I have headaches, and he said to me, "Do not be afraid, I am going to save you."  And it is with a knife that he tore my two sets of underwear, and it is towards 2 a.m. that I left this place to move towards the lake where I took a small canoe that carried me to Zaire, and I only returned recently to Rwanda.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  If you could help us by talking some more about this room.  Is there any way for you to indicate how wide it was, for instance?
A.	It is a room in which eight people could sleep if they put mattresses on the floor.
Q.	You mean that eight mattresses could get in or one mattress for two persons?  Please try to be more precise, Madam Witness?
A.	You know how mattresses can be placed on the floor without using beds.
Q.	We take it that eight persons can lie in this room.  Was the room full of refugees?
A.	There were many refugees in the upper house and in the basement, and me, I and other persons entered this little room, but in the upper house there were many people.  Some of these people were killed. It is only their bodies that were taken to this building. 
Q.	Madam Witness, if you would continue to make an effort to focus still on the surgery room. How many refugees were there in the surgery room?
A.	I was not able to count the refugees.  I did not count the people who were lying in the house of the basement and those who were in the house above.
Q.	Madam Witness, could you please just tell us about the surgery room without resorting to the building up or to the left?  Could we just remain in the room where you found the hiding place?  
A.	All right. 
Q.	Thank you.  In this small room, how many refugees were there?
A.	In the room next door, there were about eight people.
Q.	In your hiding place?
A.	No, I went to the small room, but I am telling you that a little further from us there were eight persons; there were other persons in the building above.
Q.	You promised me that you would only talk about the small room.
A.	Yes.  Regarding the small room, if you spread -- put the mattresses on the floor, two mattresses can fit, and on the each mattress four persons can lie and four persons can lie on the other mattress, and this is the small room that comes after the second.
Q.	It is in the small room that you were, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, after the church I went towards the small room of the basement in the surgery.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You state that while you were running away you abandoned your children and your parents; is that correct?
A.	I was with them in the church.  They were killed and they died.
Q.	On that day, did you attempt to find your parents and children?
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You state that just after you arrived in the surgery room, Mika arrived, accompanied by several assailants; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Was it in the small room where you can put two mattresses on the floor?
A.	After the church, I went to the small room, and in the small room you can put two mattresses and on each mattress four persons can lie, but I did not really pay attention to what was happening in the building above.  The situation was not conducive to this.
Q.	Excuse me, Madam Witness, I was a bit distracted.  Please, forgive me, but I would like to hear your answer well.  It was in the little room that Mika arrived?
A.	Yes, it was in this small room that he found me when I had left the church, and it is in this room that he did what he did.
Q.	Several attackers, you say; were you able to count them?
A.	No.  The assailants were very many.  I told you that when they killed 40 persons I ran -- I went directly to the small room.  Everybody was trying to save their life.  I left my parents in the church, and when I survived I saw no one at all.
Q.	Madam Witness, "several assailants", perhaps you did not count, but could there have been 10, 15 or 20?
A.	They were very many.  The group of assailants that attacked was very large, and if you saw the bodies that were lying  there, nobody survived.
Q.	"Much more," so you mean that there were more than 20 who accompanied Mika in the small room?
A.	No.  Those that I saw come into the room, I have said that there was Ezekia Ntakirutimana, Alphonse Kanyabungu, and other Interahamwe who were with them.  They were about six in number, but at the church there were many assailants.  It is these people who came and seized the young girls to rape them, and for some young girls were -- in the case of some young girls, bonbons were distributed. 
Q.	In the case of some young girls, sweets were distributed?  You say that when Mika arrived in the small room he was accompanied by six people. 
A.	In the room where I was there was only Mika, but I saw these other persons attack the other young girls, and Mika was armed with a knife.  And when Mika did that, he promised to save me, but he did not do it after he raped me, with the knife that he used to tear my underwear, I lay on the floor.  And afterwards I hid on the bodies.  In the meantime, other assailants were killing people and looting.

1600H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	When Mika arrived, did you recognise him?
A.	I recognised him.
Q.	Did he give you the impression that he was looking for you?
A.	No.  When he arrived, we begged him to help us.  He promised to save us and he said that we would go back to our homes afterwards.  When he abused me, I screamed and wept.
Q.	During this time, how many people were in the small room?
A.	I was in the small room.  I had locked myself in there, and I hid.  After leaving the building next door, the other persons were in a corridor and the other refugees were in the upper building.  Forty people had been shot, and the assailants had arrived at a time when we were preparing porridge.  Before we ate it, we thought that the war would not be so serious.
Q.	Madam Witness, if we take your statement of November 1999, that is your statement of 14 November 1999, on page 4, last but one paragraph, you state that you found other refugees in this room -- men, women, old men and children.
A.	Yes.
Q.	And now before this Court, you are telling us that in the small room you were alone and others were in the corridor and that Mika found you alone.  Could you clarify this to the Court, that is, regarding the truth that happened in that place?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, did she say that she was alone in the room? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you about the small room.  Do you think I'm lying?
MR. SONGA:
I see that my colleague wishes to take the floor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, I was waiting because I thought you were addressing my learned colleague.  That is why I had not addressed the Court.  I don't recollect the witness at any stage in the evidence-in-chief stating that she was alone in this room.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is what I'm asking Defence counsel.
MR. SONGA:
I believe, Madam President, that you have observed that whenever I state that the witness has said something, the Prosecutor challenges it and the next day it is confirmed.  This has just happened.  A few minutes ago, the witness said that in the small room she was alone and Mika met her there and that the others were in the corridor.  This will be confirmed by the transcript, that is certain.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you repeat your question, please?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am referring to the statement of 14 November 1999, page 4, last but one paragraph where we read,  contrary to what the witness has just stated ten minutes ago, hardly ten minutes ago.  She stated therein that she found other refugees in that room, women, men, old men and children.  That is why I'm asking that the truth should be confirmed, that the witness being here now, we should be told the truth.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which page and paragraph?
MR. SONGA:
I'll try to assist you, Madam President, so that we can find that page in the English version.  Maybe the registrar could come and take a photocopy of the right page.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  We've got the English.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Maybe the interpreters would also like to have that page, Madam President.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President, I was asking the witness a question regarding her own statement.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, what do you think of this passage in your statement of November 14th, 1999? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you show the passage to the witness? 
MR. SONGA:
We are trying to underline the passage in Kinyarwanda, Madam President.  I would request that the registrar should take the document in Kinyarwanda and show it to the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can she read? 
MS. MADENGA:
I think we have indicated to the Court --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But, Professor, we have to clarify as to what room she is referring to in this passage.
MR. SONGA:
There aren't two rooms, Madam President.  In this particular context, there aren't two rooms which would lead to confusion.  She, herself, states that she found refuge in the room, not two rooms, and we have been asking as many as ten questions, asking her to describe that room, so that is the room in which she found refuge, and it's the same room into which Mika burst with many assailants.  There can't be any confusion between this room and another room, Madam President.  And if the witness is unable to read, I'm sure the interpreters can assist her, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you located the sentence in the Kinyarwanda version? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Songa, why don't you put the question to the witness and tell her what she stated in the statement and see what her response is?
MR. SONGA:
That question has already been put to the witness, Your Honour.  All we are expecting now is the answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat your question, please?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, in your statement, an extract of which I'm reading to you, it is stated that, "I found other refugees in the room, women, men, the elderly and children," but a while ago, still during my cross-examination, I asked you who were in the room, and you stated that you were alone and Mika met you there.  What we want to know is what is the truth.  I've already asked this question before.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, reply to the question asked by Defence counsel.
THE WITNESS:
I told that you it was a room which was room No. 2 after the surgery room, and it is in that room that I found myself after leaving the church.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	The question remains unanswered, Witness.  Were you alone, or you were accompanied by other people?
A.	The other people were a little withdrawn.  That is what I said to you.
Q.	Were you alone, Madam Witness?
A.	I was alone in that small room, but there were many other rooms in which were people.
Q.	I've been asking you for more than 20 minutes, and I've been asking you to remain in that room where you were.
MR. SONGA:
There aren't any other rooms, so for purposes of the record, it should be clearly noted that she was alone in her hideout.  The other refugees were elsewhere, and this contradicts her own statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did she say that the other refugees were elsewhere? 

MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, my learned friend cannot be allowed to misstate the evidence of this witness.  My recollection is that others were withdrawn.  I never heard her say that they were elsewhere.  He has to relate her testimony as accurately as he can.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is what we heard, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
I haven't quite understood what you said, Madam President.  Could you please repeat it?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
She said that she was not alone, that other persons were there, but they were withdrawn.  She didn't say that the other refugees were elsewhere.  She said the other refugees were withdrawn.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
As you can see, Professor, in her statement, she said Mika called her out in front of all the refugees.  I mean, there must be a meaning to be attached to these things, and I'm sure this point has been more than made.  You could proceed now to some other question, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
I wish I could, Your Honours, but it would be good for us to know exactly what happened in the room in which she sought refuge, that is what we want to know.  The room was described as a small room.  We should know how many people could fit into that room.  How can we overlook such a situation, such a phase in our cross-examination? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Don't overlook it.  Just make sure that it is properly presented so that we understand your dilemma and the witness's dilemma, and then move on to the next thing.
MR. SONGA:
If you will allow me, Your Honours, I would like to go back on the questions I asked regarding the room, and let us get the witness to assist us by talking only about the room in which she found refuge, so I am obliged to ask a certain number of questions again.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you can clarify it further.
MR. SONGA:
By putting questions to the witness, Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, I have been asking you to assist us for a long time now by answering the questions put to you.  This will allow us to progress.  You stated that the moment you arrived in the surgery room, Mika suddenly appeared accompanied by several attackers; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Could you please, Witness, describe that surgery room to us?
A.	It was a small room.  It was the second room on the left.
Q.	Witness, you arrived in this surgery room from the chapel; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You state that there was a small room?
A.	Yes, it was a small room in the basement.
Q.	Can you confirm what you have just said, that two mattresses could fit into that room and on each mattress four people could lie?
A.	Are you referring to the room in which I was?  Haven't you understood what I said?  If you put two mattresses in that room, four people could sleep.
Q.	When Mika suddenly arrived in that surgery room, were you alone or accompanied by other people?
A.	The other people were on the side.  I was in that room hoping that he would take me out of that room, but he raped me.
Q.	Please, Witness, you would understand that it is in our interests to go slowly.  We are still talking about that room, so are you in a position to confirm that you were alone and the others were elsewhere, outside the surgery room?
A.	That is it.  Yes, there were -- on the side of the surgery room, the others were in the building above, and I was in the surgery room.
Q.	Madam Witness, I want us to remain in that room.  We take it that the others were outside that room?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	So I want to relate -- to refer to your statement of the 14th November 1999, a passage of which I read and which I consider as contrary to what you are telling us. 
MR. SONGA:
I would request that the registrar should take the document to the witness and have an interpreter read it to the witness.  I've also handed the English version to the Judges.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you read out this sentence to the witness?
MR. SONGA:
This is the passage: "I found other refugees in the room; women, men, the elderly and children.  Immediately after I arrived, Mika burst into the room with several attackers."  

Let us stop there, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this is the statement which you gave to the investigators in 1999.  Do you accept this statement as a correct statement?  Do you admit that is your statement?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is indeed my statement.
MR. SONGA:
I believe, Madam President, that it is clear to all of us now.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, move on to another thing. 
JUDGE SHORT:
It's not very clear to me.  

Madam Witness, when you say in your statement that you found other refugees in the room -- women, men, the elderly and the children -- are you referring to the same room in which you said you were alone? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am referring to the same room which was in the basement.  That is where those people I'm referring to were.  There were other refugees, a large number of them, in the upper part of the building.
JUDGE SHORT:
No, but when Mika arrived in that room in which you said you were alone, where were the other refugees you are referring to, the women, men, elderly and the children? 
THE WITNESS:
Those refugees who were inside the church, they had been fired at and they came out.  By the way, some of them died, others were wounded.  Other Interahamwe raped them and killed them, and that is what I saw.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Still in the same statement, Witness, we would like you to clarify one matter.  What do you mean when you refer to several assailants?
A.	There were a large number of people who were committing killings and massacring people.
Q.	Did all of them enter that room in which you were hiding?
A.	No, they were in the corridor.
Q.	When you state, Witness, that, "Mika called me out in front of all the refugees, hit me and ordered me to undress," are we in the room or outside the room?
A.	It was in the same room, and on that occasion he promised to take me out of that place.  He had a knife and he used that knife to tear my clothes, and he hit my head against the floor.
Q.	We will get there, Witness.  It was still in the same room.  And what words did he use when he called you out?
A.	He promised to take me out of that place and that he would go with me.
Q.	Were there two of you, or there were other people?
A.	There were many people, but when he was raping me, we were in that room and he tore my clothes with his knife and he hit my head against the floor.
Q.	You're going too fast, madam.  I want us to be a little slower.  In your statement, you state that you were called out in front of all the refugees.  Did he tell you to come out of the room or to stay inside the room?
A.	I did not come out.  We went into the small room.
Q.	Please, can you explain to the Chamber what you mean by saying that, "He called me out in front of all the refugees"?
A.	He took me to the small room and after that, on that occasion, he had a knife and a gun.
Q.	Witness, why do you state that it was in front of all the refugees?
A.	I say so because there were many refugees and some of them were lying on the floor.  They had been grievously wounded because they had been fired at, but I was the only person who entered that room.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, could you not assist me by asking the witness to specify whether she was alone with Mika in that room while the others were outside, or whether everything was happening in front of the refugees in that room.  We are having a hard time understanding the witness and putting the right questions to her.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I don't see the confusion.  I think my learned friend should actually take it upon himself to ascertain the evidence of the witness by himself and not by Your Honour's help.  

My learned friend has to make a clear distinction between who was present in the room during the rape and who was present in the room before the rape.  I don't think he has made that distinction to this witness.   I don't think he has made that distinction to this witness, and it's one thing for those people to be present during the rape; it's another thing for them to be present before the rape, and I think he knows exactly what I'm talking about and he should make that distinction to this witness.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I believe I'm getting to a point where I do not at all understand the purpose of the Prosecutor's statement.  I am not talking about the rape yet.  I'm trying to understand the witness's description of the room and to know who were the people inside the room and who were not inside the room.  I know what I'm doing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you have asked enough questions about the room and she has answered you.  If you seek further clarification, please ask the witness.
MR. SONGA:
That's understood, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, when you stated that Mika hit you in front of all the refugees, can you explain to us how the scene looks like?
A.	I have told you that he hit me and that I fell on the ground and that he used his knife to tear off the dress that I was wearing, in particular a pair of shorts and two underwears as well as a loincloth, and when he was raping me he told me that he was going to go away with me, but he didn't do that.  It was towards 2 a.m. in the morning that I left that room to go towards the lake and it's therefrom that I went to Zaire.
Q.	He hit you with an instrument, or how?
A.	He was hitting me -- he was banging my head against the floor.  As for the knife, he used it to tear off my shorts or my drawers.
Q.	Please, Madam Witness, can you give answers to the questions that I ask you.  With what did he hit you in front of the refugees?
A.	He had a knife and he used it to tear off my underwear.  He also had a gun.  As for my head, he banged it against the floor, and after having raped me, he went out and I hid myself under corpses in a pool of blood, and around 2 a.m. I went towards the lake from which I took a small boat to Zaire.
Q.	Do you want to say that he hit you with his knife?
A.	No, he was banging my head against the floor.  As for the knife, he used it to tear off my clothes.
MR. SONGA:
Isn't it possible to make available to the witness her own statement?
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, I assume you are experienced counsel.  You must evaluate the witness you are dealing with, you see, and assess the kind of person the witness is.  If you have asked a lot of questions on one particular issue and you find you are not making progress, you must know when you should move on and maybe reserve your comments for the address stage.  It's your responsibility to try and know the kind of witness you are dealing with.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not only that, Professor, you also must know there is only one point you can make, and even if you make it 20 times, it remains the same one point.  And a cross-examiner always has some objectives, and I know you have the objectives.  You should be able to assess when they have been achieved and you get on, otherwise you spend the next two or six hours on the one paragraph.  We don't really have the time to do that to achieve the same objective which you probably achieved with the first two questions of your cross-examination.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  We are going to try to overcome this rather particular difficulty.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	When you state, Madam Witness, that he ordered you to undress yourself, what did he exactly tell you?
A.	I asked him for mercy.  He refused -- he refused to heed my outcries.  He used his knife to undress me and hit my head against the floor, and while he was raping me he was promising me that he was going to take me out of that situation, but he didn't do that, so I hid under the corpses and there was a pool of blood, and towards 2 a.m. I moved towards the lake and that is how I fled.  I cried, you know, to appeal for his mercy, but he refused to take heed.
Q.	How were you dressed, Madam Witness?
A.	I was wearing a skirt, a loincloth, a pair of trousers under the skirt and loincloth.
Q.	You state, Madam Witness, that in the meantime, the Interahamwes were hitting the other refugees; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Besides, amongst the Interahamwes, you had Ezekia Ntakirutimana and others.  Are we still inside the surgery room?
A.	No.  Those Interahamwes were, you know, taking care of the young girls, and they were promising them that they were going to take them away.  They were equipped with nail-studded clubs and guns.
Q.	Where were we?  Where were they, please?
A.	That was at Ngoma.
Q.	Those Interahamwes you are talking about, who are they?
A.	Well, they were assailants who were -- who carried different types of weapons, grenades, clubs embedded with nails, and cudgels, et cetera.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we may remind you that you have to conclude your cross-examination by 5 p.m.
MR. SONGA:
I believe that I will achieve that, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. SONGA:
I am also indebted.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Those Interahamwes, did they enter the surgery room; yes or no?
A.	Ezekia and the others were in the hall where the young women were lying down.  There was also a small child that he killed later, and that was also a young girl.
Q.	Madam Witness, tell us what happened when Mika ordered you to remove your dress.  Did you comply with his orders or not?
A.	I did not comply.  He's the one who undressed me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, she has repeatedly said that her clothes were torn off by the Accused with a knife.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President, and that is why I am asking the question.  You know I have to make use of all that we have.  We have a statement where the witness is saying the following: "I complied taking off my loincloth, my trousers and one of my shorts."  That is the statement of 14 November 1999.  That is the last but one paragraph of page 3 in the English.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have a contradiction, if you so believe.
MR. SONGA:
Exactly.
THE WITNESS:
That is not true what you are saying.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is what the witness has said.
THE WITNESS:
That is not true what you are saying.  I'm not the one who undressed myself.  It is rather the Accused who undressed me using his knife.
MR. SONGA:
May I show the witness her statement?
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, you notice that she later on in her statement goes on to say, that, "Noticing that I was still wearing my second pair of shorts, Mika tore them with his dagger and pulled off my pants." 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, I do understand you, but why should you expect me to escape passages, especially the one where she says, "I complied taking off my loincloth, my trousers and one of my shorts"?  Why do you think that we should ignore that passage?
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm not saying you should ignore it, I'm saying you should read both together.  You should read the early part of her statement and look at the latter part of her statement and put the two together so you can understand better what she is saying.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, what is being said to you arises from the use of language.  If "undress" means going to nakedness, then she is right, she did not go to nakedness.  If "undress" means removing clothes, then she is wrong because she removed some, so it's a matter of language.  According to her, she was undressed by the Accused because of the Accused who went to nakedness.  She complied undressing by removing some items of her clothing.  That is how it would be understood.  It's a difficult point on which to place a contradiction.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, the witness needs to assume or defend her statement, and I think we have a statement, a version here that is in Kinyarwanda, and there is no way we would mess around with the terms or be confused about the terms.  I do not understand why she can't have a look at her own declaration -- at her own statement, I beg your pardon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Professor, I didn't hear you, the last point.  I didn't hear what you said last, finally.
MR. SONGA:
I said that I do not know why you don't want to give the possibility to the witness to have access to her own statement.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, we are not denying her access, but if she is not literate, it can only be read to her, she can't read it herself, and all she can say is, "This is" or "is not what I said."
MS. MADENGA:
And Your Honours, in addition to that, what we are also saying is that if anything is going to be put which is in her statement, then it has to be in context, because if you put a portion of a sentence, then it's actually misstating it because it should actually reflect the fullness of what she deposed in her statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, ask the witness the entire -- read out this entire portion to the witness and then ask the question.
MR. SONGA:
We will give the document to an interpreter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the interpreter from the Kinyarwandan booth come to the witness stand and assist the witness?

Mr. Interpreter, read out that sentence in Kinyarwanda so that it can be translated to us in English.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
"I found other refugees, children, old men, women.  Mika called me in front of all those refugees.  He hit me.  He asked me to undress.  I took off my dress, I removed my loincloth, my trousers and one of the shorts that I was wearing.  Meanwhile, the Interahamwe were hitting the other refugees and when he noticed that I was wearing another underwear, he tore it using his knife and he took off my pants." 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, now you can ask the question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you have just heard your own statement, and please help us to know the truth what happened.  Did Mika tear off all your clothes to undress you, or, following orders, you complied by undressing yourself, at least taking off most of the clothes that you were wearing?
A.	He brought down his trousers and he remained with his white underwear.  He held me and I cried.  I begged him and he promised that he will take me out of that place, but he didn't do that.  I remained with those corpses.  I had a pool of blood, and towards 2 a.m., I went to the lake.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, listen to the question before answering it.  The question you are being asked is this.  Did Mika remove your dresses or did you remove some of your dresses?  That's what you are being asked.
THE WITNESS:
He removed my clothes -- he, himself.  He even tore off my underwear with his knife.  He was wearing a white shirt and he threw me to the ground.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, now we have the answer.  Please move on to another area.
THE WITNESS:
He made me lie down and he raped me.  He raped me while hitting my head against the floor.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  How much time did the action take?
A.	Some hours.
Q.	How much time went by between the first rape and the second rape?
A.	When they came, he said he was going to take me out of that place, but didn't do that.  Another second after, he left, and I was sitting in blood, and later I went to the lake.
Q.	Madam Witness, you mentioned the names of a few girls who were raped and killed on that same day by Mika's men.  You gave a few names.  How did you know Bernardette?
A.	They were neighbours, but she was raped by all the Interahamwes including Ezekia's, these Interahamwes that had come with Mika.
Q.	After the rape by Mika, did he go away from you?
A.	He went away promising that he was going to make me come out of that place, that he was going to take me along with him, but when he came he didn't do that, and later I left the place myself.
Q.	Did he tell you where he had gone?
A.	No, he did not tell me.  He went out with many others to kill.  While I had confidence in him, I thought I was going to take me along.  The others had died and I thought he was going to take me with him.  He was capable of taking somebody out of that place.
Q.	You state, Madam Witness, that after the rape, Mika and his men started massacring the girls and the other refugees; is that correct?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, did she say Mika?  Did she state the Mika name? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  If you look at the statement on page 5, second paragraph, that is, "After the rape Mika and his men," that would be page 4 of the English text, so, "Mika and his men started to massacre the girls and the other refugees."
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can I ask the question once again.  So you declared, you stated that after the rape, Mika and his men started to massacre the girls and the other refugees; is that correct, Madam Witness?
A.	That is correct.  They spared nobody.
Q.	Do you mean that in the meantime, Mika came back?
A.	To that place?  Those Interahamwes who killed people there were there.  In the meantime, well, they haven't come back from exile.
Q.	When the massacres began, was it daytime or nighttime?
A.	It was during the day.  It was 9 o'clock on Saturday.
Q.	When you state that you were soaked in blood, was it your own blood or the blood of other people or of another person?
A.	Where I took refuge there was the blood of all the people.  There were many corpses.
Q.	You state, Madam Witness, that it was late in the night that you left the surgery room that was full of corpses and went to Lake Kivu where you found a boat to flee; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	When you were leaving the surgery room, were you alone or with others, or accompanied?
A.	When I left the surgery room, I went alone.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, I know you know you have only five minutes left, yes? 
MR. SONGA:
I am aware, Your Honours, but I think you are all witness to the problems that we are facing. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	At what level, Madam Witness, in Lake Kivu, did you find a means of transport?
A.	When you leave the hospital, it is below the Mugonero complex.
Q.	Madam Witness, how much time did you take to reach that boat?
A.	We left at about 3 a.m. in the morning, and it is the same boat that brought others.  There were three of us, and when we reached our destination, he came back.  I, myself, I came back later.
Q.	You mean there were three of you who took the boat?
A.	Yes.  It was a well-meaning person who made us cross the lake.
Q.	Was he a Tutsi or a Hutu?
A.	He was Hutu and he was married to a Tutsi woman.
Q.	In the Ijwi Island, where did you go down?
A.	Do not know.  It's the first time that I was going there.
Q.	Who welcomed you on the Ijwi Island, madam?
A.	The person who made us cross the lake entrusted us to a friend of his, and we remained there, and the other refugees were coming and they were building makeshift shelters.  We were at a neighbour's.
Q.	Did you remain in the same place on the island for the whole time that you were in Zaire?
A.	I remained on the same location and I only left when I returned when the people were returning.
Q.	Can you put on a piece of paper the Ijwi address in the event that this might be necessary to ensure your safety?
A.	I do not know the localities of Ijwi.  That was the first time for me to go there.
Q.	How much time did you spend on that island, Madam Witness?
A.	I spent much time, and when people survived, I returned, and when I returned, I was at a neighbour's who had survived the events.  She was an aged person.
Q.	According to the information you had, were Rwandans in security?  Were they safe on the Ijwi Island?
A.	Those who were coming were safe.  They came with their families.  As for me, I remained there as a person who was hidden in that household and I was made to go through there, through that place, and when I was going back, there were security forces on the other side of the lake, so we preferred to remain where we were.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I will wrap up this very painful cross-examination.  I would like to thank the witness for her availability, and if you will give me leave, I would like to tender some exhibits.

If you will give me leave, Madam President, we would like to tender the English version of the statement, the Kinyarwanda version and the French version.

Once again, Madam President, I'm very obliged.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  The statement of the witness of 14 November 1999, the English version, is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 12E, and Kinyarwanda as Exhibit D. 12K, and we don't have a French version.
(Exhibit No. D. 12E and D. 12K admitted, under seal)
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I wish simply to submit to you a problem concerning the health of my client.  He is unwell and it would be necessary for him to see his doctor tomorrow.  He forwarded a letter to you to that effect.  I wonder if you have received the letter, and I would like to know the response that you want to grant him.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we have not received any letter from the Accused so far.  

The French version is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 12F.  All these exhibits be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 12F admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have any questions in re-examination?
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, very much, Madam President.  I do have a couple of questions for re-examination, but in view of the time and what the Court had indicated about the memorial service, with your leave, I can do it tomorrow.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we have not, as I told you before, we have not received any application on behalf of the Accused about his ill health.
MR. SONGA:
The Accused, Madam President, has a told me that he sent a letter to the medical officer of the prison unit, and I think that is why you have not yet received a letter to that effect.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What's the problem with him? 
MR. SONGA:
You want to know what his illness is?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We want to know, Professor, what it is your client wants.  Is it an emergency?  Is it something that can be treated in the morning? 
MR. SONGA:
He has told me that he is in great pain, that it is urgent, and that he would like to see his doctor as a matter of urgency.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That he can do in the morning.  We are sitting in the afternoon tomorrow.
MR. SONGA:
May I have leave to ask him that question right away, Your Honours?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
My client has just told me that the doctors only come in the afternoon at 3 p.m.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He can be examined in the morning.  We direct the registry to ask the supervisor of the detention facility to ask the doctor to examine the Accused in the morning.
MR. SONGA:
I think that would be a good remedy to the situation, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we will continue with your remaining evidence tomorrow, tomorrow afternoon at 
2 p.m.  

We will adjourn and resume tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m.
(Court adjourned at 1708H)
