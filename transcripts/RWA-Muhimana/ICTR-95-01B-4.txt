MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now we open the session and proceed to commence the trial.  

Will the registry introduce the matter commencing before us today?
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Khalida Rachid Khan, presiding, Judge Lee Muthoga, and Judge Emile Francis Short, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday 29th March 2004, for the commencement of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Mika Muhimana.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor for the opening statement, please. 
MR. JALLOW:
May it please this Honourable Court, the Prosecutor appears in person, and together with the team from the Office of the Prosecutor, as listed by senior trial attorney, Mr. Charles Phillips.  

My Lords, in the space of barely a hundred days, that is, between April and July -- of June of 1994, the world witnessed in Rwanda an organised atrocity that most men had, until then, considered to be unimaginable.  During this fateful period, tens of thousands of civilians were mown down by the guns of government troops and those of Hutu militia.  A far greater number, however, were butchered with machetes, with nail-studded clubs, with hoes, and with other instruments.  

The pretext for all this killing was the death on April 6th 1994, of Rwanda's then president, President Habyarimana, in a plane crash over Kigali.  Within hours of the news of his death, a radio station which was controlled by Hutu extremists was blaming Tutsis for the attack and also crying for vengeance against what it called Inyenzi or the cockroaches and what we know meant, specifically, the Tutsi population.  We saw it was a pretext because the planning and the preparation for the genocide had already been accomplished; the groundwork had already been laid.  

The slaughter started with prominent Tutsis and politically-moderate Hutus in the nation's capital and then spread to the rural areas, to these beautiful hills and to the beautiful countryside of Rwanda.  And it was here that some of the worst atrocities took place as men and women began killing friends and neighbours, even members of their own families, always under the watchful eyes, under the exhortation, under the encouragement and direct participation of local government administrators, such as the Accused here today, Mr. Mika Muhimana.  

Mobs of the Hutu militia known as the Interahamwe roamed the streets in search of victims, and they found them in locations which previously had been regarded as safe havens, in the schools, in the churches, in the hospitals. This time around, however, these places of sanctuary became killing fields.  Men, women and children, young and old, they were killed in these locations and in other places in their hundreds of thousands.  

The tragedy of those days was not a spontaneous reaction to the events of the 6th or to any other event, it was a genocide.  It was a genocide that was consciously, meticulously planned and orchestrated at the highest official levels.  It was impossible for the disaster which occurred in Rwanda to have been a spontaneous event, with up to a million people recorded as having been killed during that short period of time.  

Local state officials, such as the Accused here, Mr. Mika Muhimana in this case, and many of his accomplices as well, called meetings where peasants were ordered to kill and carry out various acts of savagery and cruelty, which were to astound civilised people everywhere.  Those who refused to carry out such acts were themselves killed.  Those who showed enthusiasm and participated were rewarded.  And all this went to show that what happened was an orchestrated and planned tragedy.  

The Accused, Mr. Muhimana, was one of those who encouraged, who directed ordinary people in Rwanda to sink to the level of killing their neighbours, of killing their friends and of killing other Rwandans for no reason other than that their victims belonged to a different group, a group which he and others were determined to exterminate.  He is one of those who actively participated in those atrocities.  

Mika Muhimana was born some 43 years ago in Gishyita secteur, Gishyita commune, Kibuye prefecture, and lived most of his adult life there, prior to being appointed to the position of conseiller of the Gishyita secteur.  He was a prominent member of that community.  Although in rank, as conseiller, he ranked below its préfet and the bourgmestre, in the administrative structure of Rwanda at the time, the conseiller exercised more immediate and pervasive and persuasive power over ordinary people than did some of his superiors.  He was closest to the population at the cellule level and, therefore, the most important in mobilising them to participate in attacks against Tutsi people.  He was, in effect, the bridge between the ordinary people and the political structure.  

Kibuye préfecture in western Rwanda, which is where the events covered by this indictment in the present case occurred, was the préfecture in the country which had the highest concentration of Tutsis, and consequently, therefore, the préfecture which suffered the highest number of Tutsi casualties during the genocide of 1994.  According to the 1991 census, 12.4 per cent of the population of Kibuye was killed in the genocide, meaning approximately 80 per cent of Tutsi population in that préfecture was exterminated.  

Ten years after the genocide, and nine years after the ICTR issued its first indictment, which, coincidentally, was against Mr. Muhimana together with others for crimes they committed in Kibuye préfecture, we have prosecuted in seven separate trials a total of nine Accused persons for what happened in Kibuye.  By the time of the trial of Mr. Muhimana is completed -- by the time the trial is completed in July 2004, we believe we would not only have covered all the media massacre sites in Kibuye préfecture but would also have succeeded in bringing to justice the ringleaders in the killing of Tutsi civilians committed in various parts of that préfecture.  

The Accused, himself, played a prominent role in the atrocities which occurred.  He killed, and he got others to kill.  He raped, he violated, and he sexually assaulted women in furtherance of his genocidal intentions, and he got others to do the same.  By the instruments of murder, of rape, of sexual violence and sexual abuse, he promoted the genocidal plan to destroy the Tutsis as a group, and that is why he stands before this Tribunal here today.  

He is charged with genocide and rape and murder as crimes against humanity.  With respect to his criminal activities at the Mubuga parish church in Gishyita commune, the Mugonero complex, also in Gishyita commune, and in the area of Bisesero, which spans the communes of Gisovu and Gishyita; and all these four locations are in the préfecture of Kibuye.  

I shall proceed to outline in greater detail what the Prosecution's case is against the Accused person.  I'll start, first, with regard to the attacks in Gishyita secteur, Gishyita commune.  

It is our case that as early as 7th April 1994, Mika Muhimana held a meeting at his residence in Gishyita town, Gishyita secteur with Bourgmestre Charles Sikubwabo and a businessman called Obed Ruzindana.  Shortly thereafter, killings, rape and other atrocities commenced in Gishyita commune.  In that respect, witnesses will testify -- Witness AP will testify how on 7th April 1992 (sic), the Accused raped two Tutsi women at his residence in Gishyita secteur.  The women were later killed by militiamen.  Similarly, a Prosecution witness will also testify how on or about 14th April 1994, the Accused raped Esperance Mukagasana, a Tutsi woman, and then offered her to the Interahamwe for the same purpose.  Said Interahamwe proceeded to rape Esperance Mukagasana at Mika Muhimana's residence. The Accused then directed the Interahamwe to kill Esperance.  

It is also the Prosecutor's case that towards the end of April 1994, the Accused, Mika Muhimana, raped Prosecution Witness AKK --AXK, sorry, a Tutsi woman, on two occasions at Rutuma commune in Gishyita town.  

With regard to the attacks at the Mubuga Catholic church, the case for the Prosecution is as follows:   The Catholic church in Muguba, like other places of worship in Rwanda, was regarded historically as a safe haven in times of unrest.  This was also the case in 1994, as I indicated earlier.  So, as a result, many persons seeking refuge took to the church and sought -- sought refuge there.  Several of our witnesses will testify as to how, when the killings started on the 7th of April 1994, they fled from surrounding areas to seek refuge in that church at that commune.  

The knowledge that that church and the Mugonero hospital complex, only a kilometre away, had proved a haven during anti-Tutsi violence in 1959 and 1973 encouraged Tutsis to seek their refuge there in April.  And it is our case that in April there were thousands of such people in those localities.  And it is our case that on the 15th of April 1994, Mika Muhimana, acting in concert with others, including the then préfet, Kayishema, and the then bourgmestre, Charles Sikubwabo, participated in attacks on Tutsi civilians who had sought sanctuary inside the Mubuga Catholic church.  Our witnesses will testify also as to how the Accused and other attackers came and tossed hand grenades into the church.  You will see from your photo file that dots of sunlight still peep through little shrapnel holes in the corrugated iron roof of the said church.  The attackers then, having thrown in the hand grenades, finished the job of killing with machetes.  

Our Prosecution witnesses will also testify how, on 15 April 1994, they saw Mika Muhimana rape a Tutsi woman called Agnes near the Mubuga cemetery.  Prosecution Witness BG also heard the Accused order three Interahamwe militiamen to rape two Tutsi women in his presence.  

That's as far as the incidents at the Mubuga Catholic church are concerned.  But that wasn't all.  They again were attacked at the Mugonero complex, in which the Accused was directly involved.  That complex is the headquarters of the west Rwanda association of the Seventh Day Adventist Church.  The complex comprises a church, a hospital, built by American missionaries in 1939, a nursing college, and two secondary schools. 

A total of 52 pictures of various buildings within the complex can be found in your photo file and in the video recording of the sites, which will be introduced by the investigator.  Here, several witnesses for the Prosecution will testify as to how, when the killings started, they fled again from surrounding areas to seek refuge at this complex.  Some of them had experienced attacks in their own home, others were distressed by the sight of the homes of Tutsis burning all over the hills of Kibuye.  Although a large number of the residents of Gishyita commune fled directly to the area of Bisesero, large numbers of Tutsi refugees began to arrive at the complex as early as 8th April 1994.  
At around 9 a.m. on Saturday, 16th April 1994, which was the day of the Adventist Sabbath, the refugees gathered at the complex were attacked, and it is our case that the Accused, Mika Muhimana, was amongst those who led the attack against those refugees, against those Tutsi civilians who were in the complex.  Acting in concert with others, including Pasteur Elizaphan and Dr. Gérard Ntakirutimana, Muhimana and others -- other attackers, inflicted unimaginable pain and slaughter which lasted well into the night of that day.  

Few were left to explain what happened, but some did survive.  Many of the witnesses you hear will testify that they only survived by covering themselves with the bodies and the blood of their loved ones.  They pretended to be one of the  corpses.  About 3,000 - 5,000 people, sorry, were thought to have died at that complex on a single day, that is, on the 16th of April 1994.  This included at least 50 pastors, Adventist pastors, killed together with their families.  The few survivors, soon to be witnesses before this Court, will describe to this Honourable Court how they lost their entire families on that day due to the direct involvement, participation and encouragement of others by the Accused, Mikaeli Muhimana.  

Witnesses BJ and A will testify as to how the Accused raped them at that complex, both in the presence of other attackers in two separate attacks.  Another witness will also testify seeing the Accused and others rape six women -- six other women at the same complex during the said attack.  

What about Bisesero?  What was it that happened at Bisesero?  It is our case here that, terrified by the escalating violence in Gishyita and other neighbouring communes, many Tutsi civilians, having again survived attacks in other areas, scrambled to the summit -- summits of the many hills which dot Bisesero.  It is our case that the Tutsi refugees gathered on the hills of Bisesero came from all over the region of Kibuye, realising that they would have to unite in order to be able to survive.  

Many of the initial refugees who sought refuge at Bisesero were survivors of the 15th April massacres at the Catholic parish of Mubuga.  They were subsequently joined by survivors of the 16th April attack at the Mugonero complex, the 17th April attack at the Catholic parish of Kibuye and the nearby Home St. Jean complex, as well as the 18th April attacks at the Gatwaro stadium in Gitesi, Kibuye.  So, therefore, we had gathered here people who had already been subjected to vicious attacks in different locations, and this was their final refugee.  They had all run again and came to seek refugee in Bisesero.  

The killings of the Tutsis in Bisesero have a unique place in the history of the genocide.  In that regard, a well-organised and brief resistance by the Tutsis kept soldiers, gendarmes, militiamen and local government officials at bay for about a month while the refugees fought for survival.  They were armed only with traditional weapons, but better still, they were armed with the will not to die without a fight, and they fought pitched battles against their would-be killers, who were all armed to the teeth, some of them militia, some of them Interahamwe, some of them military.  

When news of the resistance by the refugees spread, as it undoubtedly would, it became a principle of almost national significance, a principle of those who were orchestrating and organising the genocide, that they should all be killed because they had resisted.  Some of the most ruthless killers in the region and beyond were summoned to Bisesero by Mika Muhimana and his colleagues and his accomplices to eliminate these brave men and women whose only fault was that they were fighting to survive.  As courageous as they were, however, they were no match for Mr. Muhimana and his accomplices, and ultimately, most of them were wiped out.  

Determined to wipe out every Tutsi in that commune, Mika Muhimana, the Accused, and others followed the survivors to the several hills of Bisesero.  We will be calling over 10 Prosecution witnesses who saw the Accused and other local government officials, between April and June 1994, leading and participating in several attacks against Tutsi civilians in the many hills of Bisesero.  Two Prosecution witnesses will testify as to how the Accused and others raped several Tutsi women who sought refuge in and around the area of Bisesero during this period.  

It is, however, important to point out to the Trial Chamber that many of the Tutsi refugees who gathered on the hills of Bisesero were, indeed, not native to the Bisesero area and, therefore, were not very familiar with that area.  The attractiveness of Bisesero was the fact that the area consisted of several hills with wide summits, and which, therefore, provided the refugees with a vantage point from which they could watch out for their attackers.  And this will be evident also from the pictures this honourable Court will see in the photo files.  

The area of Bisesero was clearly the last outpost of hope in Kibuye, but it proved to be the burial ground for thousands and thousands of those who had been seeking sanctuary there.  Up to 50,000 Tutsis are believed to have gathered on the hills of Bisesero, but less than a thousand of them survived; the rest were massacred.  They were killed, and it is our case that the Accused, Mika Muhimana, was one of several local officials who joined forces to seal the fate of these refugees.  Some of those officials have already been before this Tribunal and have been convicted for their offences.

The Prosecutor would demonstrate to this Court that the actions of Muhimana throughout the months of April, May and June 1994, namely, the raping of women and his participation in the systematic killings by leading convoys and transporting attackers to massacre sites at the Mugonero church at the Mugonero complex, and in the Bisesero region, demonstrate his intent, beyond all reasonable doubt, to destroy in whole or in part, the Tutsi as a group.  Indeed, the statements and directives made and issued by the Accused, Mr. Muhimana, during that period provide direct evidence of his genocidal intent.  The Prosecution will be leading evidence of those directives and statements.  

The Prosecution -- the Prosecutor will also present to this Court that there are striking similarities between the killings of Tutsi civilians in Gishyita secteur in Mubuga church, in Mugonero complex in Bisesero, and those against Tutsis in other parts of Kibuye prefecture, and in Rwanda as a whole during the same period.  It is our case that the mass killings and all the other particulars of offences specified in the current indictment occurred as part of a wider genocidal plan and policy to exterminate Tutsis throughout Rwanda between April and June of 1994.  Indeed, the evidence which we will adduce in this case regarding the raping of women and the sexual violation of women by the Accused, clearly indicates a consistent pattern of conduct at all four massacre sites charged in the indictment.  

If there is anything that distinguishes this Accused from many who have appeared or may appear hereafter, it is that he was not just content with killing and with other acts of brutality, but violation of women, rape, and harassment of women was his hallmark.  

I urge Your Honours, this Honourable Court, not to assess the facts against the Accused in this in isolation, but rather to consider these allegations in the context of the overall events that occurred in Rwanda, which in April and June 1994, and more specifically in Kibuye préfecture during the same period.  

As regards the presentation of our case, Your Honours, we will rely on the evidence of 20 witnesses, including an investigator and an expert witness.  Eighteen of the said witnesses are protected as they are survivors of either the Gishyita secteur, Mubuga, Mugonero or Bisesero attacks.  In particular, Prosecution witnesses AX, BJ, AU -- BJ, are all victims of rape and sexual abuse and violation committed by either the Accused or by his accomplices with his direct encouragement or exhortation.  The evidence of these four witnesses will be particularly painful and difficult.  We ask for the understanding and sensitivity of all who have to deal with them.  

The expert witness is a former Rwandan journalist who is now the director of Profam, an NGO that specialises in working with and counselling victims of rape.  She has wide-ranging experience in this area and has done significant research on the subject, and you may -- I submit, you will, as a matter of fact, find that her testimony is relevant and invaluable in enabling the Court to understand the plight of victims of rape and sexual violence who will appear before you as witnesses during the course of the trial.  
The investigator from the Office of the Prosecutor is Mr. Anthony Lucassen.  He has gained several years experience of investigations in Kibuye préfecture itself, and he has compiled the illustrative bundle now before you based on his work at various locations charged in the indictment.  In some instances, he has spoken to witnesses in relation to evidence before this Court.  As is customary with this team being led by Charles Phillips, senior trial attorney, I expect that the Prosecution will complete the prosecution of -- the presentation, I am sorry, of his case within four weeks.  This timetable is based on the premise that we will be able to present five witnesses every week, subject, of course, to Your Honour's discretion and the time needed by the Defence for cross-examination.  

My Lords, this is the case we will seek to prove against the Accused, Mr. Muhimana, and unless there is anything else the Court would wish me to address it on, I will rest my own statement at this point.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

Q.	Where did you say you got this map from?
A.	Both this map and the following map, I received them from the UNDP office, United Nations Development Programme in Kigali.
Q.	Is it drawn to scale?
A.	Yes, it is drawn to scale, and the way they describe the scale is by showing a line of 40 kilometres, sir.
Q.	What are the small geographical divisions that are shown in that particular map?
A.	In this map, the country borders are shown, the préfecture borders or province borders, as it is called now, and the commune borders, or district borders as it is called now.
Q.	Thank you, could we turn to the next map?
A.	Yes, the next map will show Kibuye préfecture, will show this part in more detail. 
Q.	On what page is the next map, please?
A.	The next map is on page 146.
Q.	And what did you say was your source for this particular map?  Where did you get it from?
A.	Again, I received it from the UNDP office in Kigali.
Q.	And what geographical divisions does it show?
A.	In the top corner, it shows the map of the whole of Rwanda and the Kibuye part.  This is this Kibuye part.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Administrative divisions you mean, and not geographical?
MR. KAPAYA: 
They are administrative, Your Honour.  Thank you, Your Honour, for that. 
THE WITNESS:
What is shown is the préfecture border.  This -- the whole contents of the map is one préfecture.  Inside the préfecture, there are the commune borders, which are shown in blue, and within each commune, there are the secteur borders, which are shown in a kind of orange colour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you point out the geographic -- the administrative locations of Kibuye -- of Gishyita commune and the secteurs that they are in?
A.	Yes.  Now, I zoomed in on Gishyita commune.  Gishyita is written in blue, and in black one can see the names of the secteurs within Gishyita commune; that is, if I start here Mpembe, Mara, Muramgara, Gishyita, Mubuga, Musenyi, Ngoma and Bisesero.
Q.	Thank you, and can we now come to the next map, the map on page 147; and could you tell us what this map is? 
A.	This is another kind of map.  It comes from a big map.  I have it here, if you want me to show it.  It comes from a big map, and I tried to photocopy that part that seems to me relevant, which means that the locations mentioned in the indictment are on this map, and also on the very top, Kibuye town is in the map, which can serve as a reference point for those people who have actually been to the area. 
Q.	Could you tell us whether it is drawn to scale, and your source of this map?
A.	The scale is 1:50,000.  And 1:50,000 means that two centimetres on the map represents one kilometre in the fields.  So a distance of two centimetres here is one kilometre in the area.  This photocopy is a direct colour photocopy, so it is the same scale, and maybe a few percent margin because of the processes of the photocopying.  And the map, I got it from evidence unit, and on the following pages are the legends of this map.
Q.	Could you identify the -- some salient features on this particular map, Mr. Lucassen, which are relevant to this trial?
A.	Yes, I can.  I will limit myself because there are many.  On the top side, one can see the word Gitesi.  Gitesi is the commune with Kibuye town in it, and the circle that I draw with No. 16 indicates Kibuye town.  Then, if one goes more south -- I would like to draw Your Honours' attention to four places, one is Mubuga area, No. 17; one is Gishyita town, No. 9, 13 and 11, it is rather spread out; one area is No. 18, Mugonero complex; and one area, I indicated it with this line that I draw, I gave it No. 40, which I call Bisesero area.
Q.	Right and --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which area is the Bisesero area?
THE WITNESS:
No. 40.  The number is written here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
And it indicates this area. Bisesero area is not an official area.  I use it for the area that witnesses in general refer to when they talk about Bisesero. That is why the line, I could just draw it with my own pen. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, this map has a key  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, the circled area is the Bisesero area?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  The circle area with No. 40; it is a rather big area.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this map has a key which is on page 148; is that correct?
A.	Yes, sir, that's correct.  On page 148 is the key of the numbers that I wrote on the map.  They are numbered 1 to 40.  We have just seen them on the colour map, and here I give descriptions of what is meant by each number.
Q.	Thank you.  And pages 149 to 151 are but part and parcel of that key to that very map? 
A.	Yes, exactly.  This is the official legend that is on the down parts of the full map.
Q.	But can you now briefly tell us what is contained on pages 152 to 157 of the binder you prepared?
A.	Yes, I can.  From page 152 to 157 is one document that has been prepared by myself and my colleague last year for general purposes.  I thought that the document would be relevant for this trial, so I put the whole six-page document into this binder, and that's why it has the old numbers that it has already, starting with L00, plus the K-numbers in red, of the current document.  I mainly think this area is relevant for you because at least one of the witnesses describes being here.
Q.	Now, what is depicted on page 156 of your document?
A.	One fifty-six is the essential page of this six-page document; it is a map that I drew.  It is approximately to scale, as you see right here that the distance of this arrow is approximately 500 metres and it shows what I can call Mugonero area.  That is the church; No. 11 is Mubuga church.  This is the school, and this is the market centre, the real centre of Mubuga.
Q.	Now  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Investigator, this sketch is prepared by you?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And is it drawn to scale, Witness?
A.	Yes, it is drawn to scale.  I indicated it this way.  Even I write it here, yes, 12:50,000.  Thank you, sir.
Q.	Now, can you locate that place on page 157 of your binder on the map which you referred to previously as 157?  What point is represented by that sketch?
A.	Yes, I can.  This sketch of Mubuga area is in here in No. 17 on the map of page 147.
Q.	Now, let's turn to page 157 again.  Now, on top of that page, there are letters A, B and C in which you make certain allegations or assertions.  Now, what is the basis for the information which you provide under A, B, C?
A.	This month I have been to Mubuga, together with this witness, AVK, and she showed me where she was hiding and where she saw the Accused.  I gave a short summary of that and the locations A, B and C are here, sir, next to the cemetery of Mubuga Catholic church. 
Q.	Now, what you have just said, is there any relationship between what you have said, on page 143 of your document and page 218 to 221?  Firstly, tell us what is on page 143, page 218 to 221, and try to relate it to what you describe in A, B, C?
A.	Yes, sir.  In the beginning of my document, on page 143, I describe some of my experiences with Rwandan witnesses, especially if it comes to estimating distances and working with maps.  For instance, the witness -- to give you an example, I was here on this spot, together with AVK.  She showed me these places; that was very clear.  I can mark it very clearly on this map. I don't know if she or if this witness, herself, can show it on this map.  So I tried to describe in the beginning of my documents that my experience with Rwandan witnesses, with especially illiterate Rwandan witnesses, is that often they have very limited map reading skills, and I describe also how I try to work within that -- in that situation, myself.  This is at the beginning of the document.  

Apart from this, what AVK told me, I showed it here, but I give a short summary of what she told me later in the document, in the part that is called "Witness locations". 
Q.	And is that between pages 218 to 221 of your binder?  And would you kindly locate this exact location of what those witnesses told you, as indicated in your bundle?
A.	Yes, sir, it is like you tell me.  And the example that we are using now, AVK, who showed me these places, my reports of her -- of my visit with her to the crime scene is written on page 219.
Q.	All right. 
A.	If you look at page 219, this paragraph, I give a summary of what she showed me, and I say also that these characters, that is, A, B, and C, are indicative of the sketch of Mubuga area.  The sketch of Mubuga is that six-page document that we were just looking at. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Lucassen.  

Can we now move to page 158 of your bundle, and quickly tell us your source of information for this one or whether you prepared it yourself?
A.	One fifty-eight is a sketch of Mubuga church.  So that it is kind of zoomed in on the earlier document which covered Mubuga area.  Now, I just take the church and the neighbouring buildings.  I prepared this document myself last year, together with a colleague, and I thought it was relevant because of what again AVK told me.  AVK told me that at some stage she was at the point marked B here, and she saw the Accused on point A.
Q.	Would you locate this particular place on the map, on page 147; what number it represents; what area it represents, that page? 
A.	We are still in the same area, No. 17.
Q.	All right.  Now, there are areas marked with -- let's go back to page 158.  There are areas marked with an X and A, B and C; all right, and when you go to page 159, and that's the key to this map, you find some certain assertions or allegations you make?
A.	That is correct, sir.  This is a description of A, B and C.  I want to repeat again that I have no knowledge of what happened there in '94.  AVK was with me, and this description of A ,B and C is what she told to me. 
Q.	Now, let's move to pages 160 and 161.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, what do these little crosses under A, B, C suggest?
THE WITNESS:
That is just the exact place, Your Honour.  So the little cross next to A is a place, and A indicates to the legend to explain what happened to that place.  So the crosses indicate the place; the character next to it is used to refer to the legends, to the key.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Right.  What do you show on page 160 of your sketch -- of your witness bundle? 
A.	This is a sketch of the house of the Accused that I prepared last week.  This is the street, these are entrance doors, this is an alley. 
Q.	And when you say the Accused, you mean Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	Now, what is the source of the information that you put in this document?
A.	I was walking there myself and I have seen where the rooms, the doors and the windows were.  Apart from that, on the next page, one can see that the source of information that is not directly visible.    So the source of the information of what happened in 1994 is Witness AQK.
Q.	Can you please explain further that information contained on item 10 -- item 11 on page 161?
A.	Item 11 refers to a room, to this room, which is a kind of -- this is the house on the side of the street, and this is a house behind the house on the street, which is more recently constructed.  And a room behind in this house, I have been there, together with AQK, and she told me what was written here on No. 11.  She told me that the wife of Mr. Muhimana has been buried in this room.  I did not see any body, but I saw that part of the floor is just ground, is not cemented.
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you aware that the wife of Mr. Muhimana was a prospective witness or short listed for trial, that following her death, the Prosecution has filed a motion under 2 bis for the admission of her written statement as evidence?
A.	Yes, sir, I have heard so.
Q.	Now, could you locate this sketch, page -- on page 160 to the map, the general map of Mubuga area on page 147?  Just very quickly, and them we will move on. 
A.	Yes.  The map of Mika's house, or I should say Mika's house is located in this circle with No.  11, which is the south-eastern part of Gishyita town.
Q.	Right.  Let's now move to pages 163 to 168, and these relate to the Mugonero complex sketches.  Can you tell us what this is, and what is your source of information for those sketches?
A.	This is -- these are five sketches plus an annexe; the annexe is kind of the key to the five sketches.  They have been prepared by a colleague of mine for the purpose of another trial, the Ntakirutimana trial, but it is of Mugonero complex, Mugonero hospital-church complex.  I know this complex well.  I have seen the material of my colleague, and I thought that it would be relevant to use it to give Your Honours an idea of the complex.
Q.	Now, where did you get this sketch from?
A.	It is Prosecution Exhibit P. 2 in the Ntakirutimana trial.  If you want, I have the K-numbers for you, but they are also visible here.  I did not delete them; I just edited in red the K-numbers of the current document. 
Q.	Now, could you now tell us -- let's turn to page 163 -- tell us the general layout of this place and whether it is in any way connected to the diagram of the following page, that is, page 164?
A.	Yes, these two pages are connected.  If one enters the Mugonero complex by car, then the usual roads that branch off the main road Kibuye-Cyangugu, the usual road will go up here.  On the left-hand side, there is the office of the president of the Seventh Day -- of the association; there is a genocide memorial, and then the road goes up towards the actual hospital complex.  And this actual hospital complex is on the next page, which means that these two pages are kind of continuous. 
Q.	Right.  Now, on page 163 there are areas marked with an X followed by pseudonyms, BJK and BI, and there is also a phrase you say, "house of girls", below which there is an X.  Further down, there is the name "Mika", also marked with an X.  Now, can you shed some light to Their Honours on these particular markings on this sketch?
A.	Yes, sir.   I have been to this area with two of your witnesses, with BIK and with BGK.  I marked these places on the map because BGK was here when BGK saw the Accused, Mr. Mika, here, the car park in front of the office of the president.  And also, BIK has seen the Accused, Mr. Muhimana, on this same place.  Apart from that, BIK told me that BIK has also seen the Accused walking -- walking from this place along the valley to what I call here a "house of girls", and Witness BIK saw Mr. Muhimana returning from this house with several girls.  That's why I marked these places on the map, sir. 
Q.	Now, can you identify the sum of that information on pages 218 to 221 where you talk about witness locations in your binder?
A.	Yes, I can.  What I just told you has been written there.  Let me go to BIK and look it up.  

BIK, the notes of what BIK told me are on page 218.  I was with BIK on 16th of March of this year.  BIK told me she had seen Mika several times. 
Q.	I think a general reference would be sufficient for our purposes.  Could you please identify the other source of information, BGK?
A.	BGK is on the same page, page 217, the notes of what BGK told me. 
Q.	Right.  Could we now move to page 165, and tell us what that sketch represents?
A.	One sixty-five represents the hospital main building, which is in the previous sketch this building, HI.  This building has two floors, a first floor and a basement.  I have been to this building, together with several witnesses, and I have marked the places that they showed to me where the offence that they talk about took place. 
Q.	Now, you refer to several potential Prosecution witnesses in that sketch who are BGK, BHK, AUK and ATK, right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And could you -- can you tell us whether the information that they provided you is contained in your binder between pages 218 to -- and 221?
A.	Exactly.  This is just the location in the pages that you just mentioned is -- are my notes of what they told me what happened in this location.  

I made one mistake last week when I compiled this binder; I exchanged two witness codes, which means it is written BHK, but it should be ATK.  I corrected it already.  And ATK that is written here, should be BHK.  So, if possible, I would ask the people who have a version of this binder in front of them to correct this mistake, and I apology for it -- I apologise.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It was an inadvertent mistake. 
THE WITNESS:
It was not intentional.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And when did you discover that you made it, Mr. Witness -- made this mistake?
A.	I was happy to discover it. I discovered it when I was re-reading my documents during lunch time today.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Lead us to the mistake so we can pick it up and correct it. 
THE WITNESS:
It is page K0286165.  On the top part of the sketch, on the first floor, I refer to a room, No. 3.  Written there was ATK alpha, tango, kilo; that is wrong.  That should be BHK, bravo, hotel, kilo.  

And the wrong exchange that I did was with this one; this refers to the maternity room in the basement.  The witness who observed the Accused here is not BHK, it's not bravo, hotel, kilo, but it is ATK, alpha, tango, kilo.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Right.  Pages 166 to 168 of your sketch refer to what you call -- you refer to as mass graves, and what is your source of information for this sketch?
A.	My colleague, Mr. Baghel and me, we have been walking around, and various people, amongst whom, hospital authorities have shown us mass grave sites which are on these three pages.  By the way, they are also on this page.  These dark spots are mass grave locations.  Here they are just in more detail.  Some of them have been exhumed, then the bodies have been transferred to the current genocide memorial.  Some bodies, like in the septic tank, were at moment of this sketch still there, and some places we were not sure if there were bodies or not.  That's where we wrote, "Suspected to be mass grave sites". 
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, according to your investigations, what is the connection, the relevance of these mass graves to the trial at hand?
A.	We have been told that a massacre took place in this hospital in which very many people were killed, just very few managed to escape.  Most of the bodies have afterwards been dumped in mass graves.  At a later phase some of these bodies have been exhumed so that they could be reburied in dignity.
Q.	Let's turn to page 169 of your bundle, where you give measurements of distances.  Again, leaving apart those places you visited, what was your source of information, as against what you term as "direct distance"?
A.	Direct distance, I measured it on the map that we constantly refer to on page 147.  I found that to be a very accurate map. Like I told you, two centimetres refers to say one kilometre, so I simply measured the direct distance on that map.  The distance by car, I drove it last week.
Q.	Now, do you go with any of the witnesses?  Do you check these places, these distances, with the witnesses ... (inaudible)? 
A.	No, sir. I checked the distances by car myself with the mileage of the car with what was for me the most logical route, and the direct distance, I measured it.  I am not sure if I would ask witnesses which answers they would give.  My experience is that witnesses in a rural place like Gishyita do not always have an objective sense of distance, which means that they can say three kilometres, whereas it has six, or something like that.  So I prefer even not to ask that question, and I mainly use it when the witness comes out with it spontaneously; then it is more often true, but I try to check it.  So the distances are my distances.  They are not told by witnesses, and maybe witnesses tell you something else.   But then I think that you should regard what I say also.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, what do these numbers suggest, distance, five, seven, 12, six? 
THE WITNESS:
Those are the kilometres, Your Honour.  All distances are indicated in kilometres, and I didn't write it behind every number. So, for example, Mubuga church to Gishyita town, if one drives it, it is seven kilometres, and as the crow flies, the direct distance, it's three-and-a-half kilometres.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And why did you pick this --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What about Bisesero area, Gishyita town, "seven to 12"; what is that?
THE WITNESS:
I wrote "seven to 12" because, as you may remember from the map on page 147, Bisesero is an area, it is not a centre or a building; it is an area with vague borders.  So, if I say "seven to 12" I would say that from Gishyita town, if one drives seven kilometres in the direction of Bisesero area, one arrives there, and if one continues driving, after about 12 kilometres, one will leave it. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Those are axiom points, then. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So do you suggest that Bisesero area is covered by five kilometres?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, why did you pick these particular -- the distance between these particular places?  Why did you choose the distance between these particular places?
A.	Because these places are landmarks in the area, and because I read in the indictment that some of these places are relevant for the trial.  So I picked out those locations that seem most relevant to me for this trial, and I measured the distances between them.
Q.	Thank you.  Let's now move to page 173, and briefly, what is your source of the information that you provided the Chamber here?
A.	The source of information is, basically, my own knowledge and experience.  This part of the binder, before the next green page, describes four massacre sites; it describes them in words and in photographs.  The words, I wrote them.  Part of it is just objective information, part of it is my experience as an investigator who has been in this area often, and who has talked to many witnesses about this area and about what happened here in '94.
Q.	Right.  Let's move to pages 175 to 179.  Can you tell us what these photographs depict and where you got them?
A.	These are photos that give a good impression of Bisesero area.  They have been taken by ICTR colleagues in 1995, and they have been used as evidence in several previous trials, for instance, in the Ntakirutimana trial.  They have also been used in the Kayishema case.
Q.	All right.  What do these Bisesero photographs show?
A.	I selected a couple of them, I think there are eight or 10, to give the Judges a good idea of how the Bisesero landscape looks like.
Q.	For instance, can you tell us something about the -- what appears to be a road on page 175?
A.	That is, indeed, a road, and I have not been there when the photo was taken, but I have quite good idea of exactly which hill it might be; and there are hardly any roads in the area.  Probably this is the main road from Gishyita to Gisovu, what I call in these documents, the main Bisesero road, where according to what the witnesses told me, attackers from the Gishyita side came up -- down, attackers came from the Gisovu side came from the tea factory side.  They met somewhere on this road and prepared for their attack.  So this is how the road looked like in '95.
Q.	Now, do you know when these Bisesero photographs were taken, how long after the genocide of '94?
A.	They were taken in October '95, which is about over a year, just over a year after the genocide, sir.
Q.	Right, let's turn to pages 181 to 187.  Can you tell us what this is, and your source of information?
A.	The photographs have been taken by ICTR investigators in October 1995, and they show Mubuga church.  This is an aerial photograph showing Mubuga church here, and the following pictures are photographs of the church itself as it was there in '95.  At that moment, it was not yet in use after what had happened in this church.
Q.	All right.  Can you relate any of the photos to the sketch on page 158, for instance?
A.	Yes, 158 is the sketch of Mubuga church, and all of these photographs can be related to the sketch.  The aerial photograph, this one, covers the whole area, plus even more, and the other photographs, like this one, are photographs of outside or inside the church.
Q.	Right.  Now, there are six photographs showing the Mubuga church, and  ---
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, No. 5 on page 156 is the main building of the church; No. 5 on page 158?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, that is the main building of the church.  And I wrote that also in the legend on the next page, No. 5 is the main hall of Mubuga church.  And the inside of this main hall of Mubuga church of this main hall can, for instance, be seen on one of the photos we were looking at, like this one, 186, that is inside that main hall. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, photos 1 to 6, the key to those photos is on page 180, right?
A.	Yes, I think it is photo 1 to 7 and the key is on page 180, yes.
Q.	Can you just, very quickly, point out those pictures which are shown on the photographs 1 to 6 as indicated on page 180 on the key running through the photographs? 
A.	Yes.  So this is the short description.  From this aerial photograph, one sees the whole complex.  Even from this distance, one can see a hole in the roof, and kind of the same image, it is also on one of the videos that I presented as evidence.  Page 2 is the church the way one sees it when one approaches it over the car road; and photo No. 3 is the same side of the church, but one can see now the main entrance.  Witnesses have told me that during the events the main entrance was cold -- closed with a fence, and this broken fence was still there in '95.

Photo No. 4 is if you go around the church and one looks into the other side, this is the same main entrance.  The annexe to the main building is the sacristy.  And the brick parts that one sees here is the wall to the courtyard of the priest's house.  In fact, at some stage, one of our witnesses was inside this church and saw the Accused close to this brick wall; I think it was AVK, I've told you before, based on the sketch.  No. 5 shows the same area in more detail.  No.  6 is inside the church.  One can see damage even on this far distance, a hole, possibly caused by grenades; small holes, possibly grenade splinters or bullet holes; these small holes are everywhere.  Close to the altar, also, there is a big hole in the roof.  

And photo No. 7 is an overview of the main hall of the church taken from the altar.  So, one sees the main building, one sees the side doors, and one sees the front door with the, in 1995, broken entrance grille.  And what one sees on the ground is water that came in through the holes in the roof. 
Q.	Now, when were these photographs taken?
A.	As you see on page 170, the photographs have been taken by ICTR investigators, Heuts and Eekma, between 24 and 26 October 1995.
Q.	Right.  And, to your knowledge, have they been tendered as exhibits in any particular trial before this Tribunal?
A.	Yes, they have.  I have to refer to my note to say whether it was Musema or Kayishema, I am not sure.
Q.	Right.  Now, let's turn to pages 189 to 192, and tell us your source for the information that is provided below each of those photographs?
A.	These are photographs that I took myself two weeks ago in Gishyita town.  Several witnesses have shown me that this house belongs to Mr. Mika.  To be specific, for instance, AQK showed me.  Nobody showed me this room, I was just allowed to go in.  It is -- there is an open door here on the left side of Mika's house.  I went in there with permission of the owner -- the current inhabitant, and I took this photograph.  On this page, one sees the back side of Mika's house, and one can see also on the left that a newer house has been built.  With your permission, I'll refer quickly to the sketch.
Q.	Yes, please.
A.	This photo has been taken from here, which means one is on the street, one goes to the door, one passes in the alley next to Mika's front house.
Q.	Just a minute, Mr. Witness, when you talk of the sketch, you mean the one on page 160 of the witness bundle right?
A.	Yes, that is correct, based on 160 of the sketch of Mika's house.  I passed through this door, through this alley, then I walked in between the new house and I stopped here, where my finger is now, very close to No. 9, and from there I took this photo.  So the wall that one sees is the back side of Mika's main house, the house on the street.  And what one sees on the left is the new house that was, as I have been told, under construction in '94.
Q.	Mm'mh.
A.	The photo down here on page 190, shows this window. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, when did you take these photographs?
THE WITNESS:
Sorry, Your Honour?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
When did you take these photographs? 
THE WITNESS:
Two weeks ago; the date is on it.  I took them on 17 March 2004.   The photo down here shows this window, but taken from inside room No. 10 on the sketch of page 160.  So the photo is taken from here, through the door, and shows this window.  I took it to show Your Honours that the windows in this house are small, and that a lot can happen without somebody in there -- in the behind house, in the new house noticing it.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you move to the next page, please?
A.	These are two photographs of more or less the same buildings in Gishyita centre, one house away from Mika's house.  It shows two photographs -- two commercial houses; it shows an electricity pole.  And I took two photographs of this which are more or less the same; I just walked a little bit closer, because several witnesses told me that they saw terrible things there; and I'm never sure if the witness will recognise the photo when he or she sees it because my experience is that if I give a photo to a witness they sometimes hold it upside down or they have trouble indicating, especially buildings on it.  So that's why I took two photos that are more or less the same, to give other witnesses that come after me the opportunity to show Your Honours what they saw there. 
Q.	That house where there are some posts, according to your investigations, did you -- could you determine whose house that was?
A.	I have been told that the house belongs to Kabanda, Assiel, a man who has been killed during the genocide.
Q.	All right.  Let's move to  --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are referring to which house, the house with open door? 
THE WITNESS:
All of these white complexes; all of these white houses, I didn't go into details about it.  I have been told that all these houses belong to Kabanda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Kabanda has been killed during genocide?
THE WITNESS:
That is what I have been told, yes. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	All right, let's move to the photo on the next page. 
A.	This photo.
Q.	Yes, 192?
A.	Yeah, 192.  This photo, I walked more close.  It is this part, this part -- this part of the building with a green door with some white spot on it.  This is that green door with the white spot on it.  And again, I took this photograph another time to give your factual witnesses a real good opportunity to recognise the place and tell you what happened.  

I took this photo.  After that, I turned around, and from the same place I took this photo, which gives an idea of the square in front of Mika's house or the roads as one can call it.  Mika's house, that you saw on the earlier photographs, is this one.  Mika's house is this one, and this is the square, the road, the open place in front of his house.

1600H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Yes.  On page 193, there are two photographs, one of a man squatting.  Could you tell us what this photograph depicts and your source of information for it?
A.	The man squatting is myself.  Two weeks ago I am here, and I'm also standing here.  I was here with witness AXK, alpha, x-ray, kilo.  She told me that this house is the same as this house, was the house of her parents.  She told me that her children have been killed and buried on this place.  She told me that she, herself, she was standing here between the house and the place where the children was killed and she was forced to watch the killing of her children.  

Here I am standing on that position where she was forced to stand.  She told me that her hands were tied behind her back.  She had been beaten up because she refused -- well, she had been beaten.  This is the place where the children were killed.  It's not clear on this photo, and this is the road.  You see part of our car.
Q.	Can you look at that place on page 147 of the bundle, that is the Mubuga map?
A.	On page 147, there is in No. 10, which is, as you see, from Gishyita town, about two kilometres in the direction of Lake Kivu, the north-western direction, No. 10.
Q.	Okay, Mr. Lucassen, let's turn now to pages 195 to 216.  Can you tell us what that is and your source of information again?
A.	The photographs have been taken in Mugonero complex by my colleague, but I know the area well and I found them to be correct.  They have been taken in September 2000 and my colleague walked there together with the administrator of the complex, who told him certain facts.  Apart from it, the main things that one can see here are just obvious.
Q.	According to your investigation, Mr. Lucassen, would you like to highlight some photographs and tell us why they are more important than others?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, is it an appropriate time to take a short break?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  If it suits, it's okay.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will adjourn for 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1602H to 1620H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed. 

Mr. Kapaya, please proceed. 

MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, we were about to start talking about the Mugonero complex photographs, but before we do that, could we backtrack a bit to page 191 and to the photographs on page 191.  Could you tell us briefly in the course of your investigations whether you found out any anything significant about the posts that appear there in relation to this man's house.
A.	Yes, I have been told that at a certain stage the head of Mr. Kabanda was fixed on his own door, and I have been told that the sexual organs of a man who had been killed have been fixed on one of these wooden electricity poles in front of Kabanda's house.
Q.	Let's now go to pages 195 to 216 in your bundle, and let's deal with photographs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 together. 
A.	Shall I come to the overhead projector, sir?
Q.	Yes, with Their Honours' permission.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  

Mr. Kapaya, could you identify the numbers of the photographs?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, they are photographs numbers 1 to 6 on pages 195 to 197 of the witness's bundle.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, can I explain them?  They are photos of Mugonero complex, a big church and hospital complex in Gishyita, taken by a colleague in 2000.  I checked the photos.  I found them correct.  There are quite some photos, and part of it will be shown also in a video.  One that I could point out to you is photo No. 5 on page 197.  This photo is taken from the road in front of the president's office.  One sees the genocide memorial, and here one sees the church, the church of the hospital.  As Your Honours can see, in 2000 when these photos were taken, there  were buildings here.  These building were not there in '94, so in '94 the view from the area around this hospital, school, church towards this area with the parking yards in front of the office of the president, this view was direct.  There were no buildings.  I know that because witnesses have told me and it can also be seen on the video of '95.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What are you calling the office of the president? 
THE WITNESS:
The office of the president is not in this photo.  I can show it to you on a sketch, if you like.  Shown on this photo, it is somewhere here, to the left.  The photo is taken on the road in front of the office of the president.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, could we go to photographs numbers 8 and 9 and 10.  What is the significant -- firstly, what is that, and what is the significance of those three photos in this trial?
A.	Photos 8, 9 and 10 show the school church, the church that was attached to the Mugonero hospital and school complex, and during the genocide, mainly on one particular day, many, many people have been massacred in this building, according to what witnesses told me.  As a symbol of that, some coffins with bones of victims are still inside this church, and some damage probably done by firearms or grenades can still be seen.  I talk about the year 2000.
Q.	All right.  What is the significance of the photographs on page 201 and 202?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it 201 or is it 301?
MR. KAPAYA:
201, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
For your information, Your Honours, we used the numbers that are stamped in red on the top of the pages.  There are also other numbers down which refer to the numbers in another trial, the Ntakirutimana trial.  The photo that I show now on page 201 is a example of the inside of the church that you have just seen and it shows some damage that is probably caused by, like I said, firearms, grenades.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Let's turn to pages 204 to 213 of the bundle, and tell us what these photographs depict?
A.	These are all photos of the hospital main building, the big building with two floors that was indicated also on the sketches.  The photo shows several corridors, several rooms, both on the first floor and in the basement.  If I can give you an example, maybe you can look at this one.  This is a photo taken in the basement.  When one comes from outside and one walks down the stairs, it's like seven stairs down, something like that, a little bit more.  When you are down, this photo is taken, and one sees the building right in front of the entrance, which is the maternity room.  One witness mentions this maternity room.  This Witness ATK, alpha tango kilo, so that is the room behind this door and wall.  And here is the entrance to the surgical theatre or the surgical wards, which is a complex with two operating rooms and maybe eight supporting rooms on this side.  Since '94, some construction has been done in this corner.  I remember, myself, having seen that people were working on it, and witnesses may tell you that this photo does not 100 per cent represent the situation in '94.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, what is the importance of this photo?  Is this all of the crime scene? 
THE WITNESS:
This is a scene, a place where Witness ATK tells me that he saw the Accused, yes, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Are you able, Mr. Witness, to relate some of these photographs to the sketch plan on page 165, the hospital buildings?
A.	Yes, I think all of these photographs can be related to that sketch, but as we are looking at photo 36, let me go to that sketch and show you where it has been taken.  This is the sketch of page 165.  The photograph you just saw, I told you the photographer went down the stairs, enters here the basement, and took the photographs from here.  So, what one sees on this photo is the maternity room in front, and it's here the entrance to the surgical theatre, and now you can also she why I choose to show this photo, because this is one of the photos that shows an area mentioned by the witness, in this case, ATK.
Q.	Are you able to tell us generally which of the photographs relate to the first floor of the hospital buildings and which are the photographs relate to the basement of the hospital buildings?
A.	That is easy.  The descriptions are written under it.  So on photo 30, the first floor starts, and that continues until photo 34.  On photo 35, one sees the entrance into the basement, and the basement photographs continue until photo 49, which shows a drainage hole in the corridor of the basement.
Q.	Right.  Should we best now turn to the documents that are annexed to your report, that is pages 223 and 224.  When was this document prepared, or where did you get this document from?
A.	ICTR received it 21 September 2000 officially from the Gishyita commune office.  It has been stored in our evidence unit and I retrieved it two weeks ago.
Q.	To your knowledge, has it been used in previous trials?
A.	It has, to my knowledge, certainly been used in the Ntakirutimana trial.
Q.	From the information we get from this document, how many secteurs would you say were in Gishyita commune in 1994?
A.	Gishyita commune in 1994, there were eight secteurs.
Q.	Are you aware of what the Accused person was doing in 1994?
A.	He was the councillor of secteur Gishyita in commune Gishyita.  His name is written here, although the spelling is not at all correct.
Q.	So, according to this document, what is the name of the secteur which he was responsible for?
A.	Mr. Muhimana was the councillor of Gishyita secteur.
Q.	How many cellules are in that secteur, according to this document?
A.	Gishyita secteur in '94 had seven cellules.
Q.	The next document is on page 225.  What is that document, Mr. Witness?
A.	It is a document in French containing part of the Rwandan law.  This is the law regarding the organisation of the commune from 23 November 1963, modified in 1974 and 1975.
Q.	Could you tell us the significant sections or articles that relate to the functions of the Accused person as a councillor?
A.	They are a little bit spread over these documents, but I could draw your attention to article No. 3, article No. 3 which says, in French, that the conseiller communal, the communal  -- well, I don't have a good word, but communal council, is composed of the bourgmestre and as many members as there are secteurs.  

Articles 6 to 8 describe how the councillors are elected by the inhabitants, how the councillors are elected by the inhabitants of the secteur.

Article 12 says that the councillor gets a monthly allowance.  

Article 13 states that the bourgmestre and the councillors have to meet twice a month.  

And I think article 37 kind of gives the tasks of a councillor.
Q.	I think that's enough.  You may now go back to the witness box, please.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours may have noticed that on page 171 of the bundle, there is reference to videos.  Now, I would request the witness, Your Honours, with your leave, to move to where a laptop is fixed here to be able to show you some relevant videos which relate to this particular trial.  Actually they are in video representation of most of the things we have seen on sketches and some which are on photographs.  

It's a long video, but we have just made clips of the parts which are relevant for this trial and both videos won't last more than 15 minutes, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  Please, go ahead.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, before you start, can you tell us where you got these videos from?
A.	Both videos have been recorded in 1995, and both videos have been used in several earlier trials, parts of it.  The first video is an aerial video and it is a helicopter that leaves from Kibuye town, it flies to Mubuga complex, then it goes up to Bisesero, to Karongi Hill and back to Kibuye town.  Most relevant parts it seems for me --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, we are not able to see the diagram.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	What's the page you are on?
A.	Sorry, this is page 147.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Who took those videos?
THE WITNESS:
ICTR investigator Hertz and colleagues in 1995.
BY MR. KAPAYA: 
Q.	And after they were taken, can you tell us where they were stored, how they were stored?
A.	The first video, that is the aerial video, has been in ICTR since it has been made, in the evidence unit.  The second video, KV000028, is a mix of a few videos that this investigator made.  This mix had been done in a police laboratory, a police studio in Rotterdam in the Netherlands in the presence of that investigator to be sure that no material was misused, that it is a real compilation of the original video.
Q.	So when you got these videos from the evidence unit, can you tell us what you did with them to be in the form they are now?
A.	I looked at several videos from the point of view of this trial to see what is most relevant for 
Your Honours to understand the situation.  Then I picked out two videos.  They are on two different CDs.  I asked the evidence unit to put them on CDs.  One is like 40 minutes, one is something like 20 minutes, and I picked out -- I marked the essential parts.  In my document, on page 171, I described which parts are relevant for this trial.  Nevertheless, the whole video is on the CD so that if somebody thinks that other parts are more relevant, it is easy to look at it, but I propose to show you only those relevant parts.
Q.	Right, Mr. Lucassen, can you now proceed and show us the first video, that is video KV000007?
A.	Yes, I will show it.  It will start here, then it will go up to Bisesero.  The video will stop somewhere here.
Q.	Do you require the services of a technician, perhaps?
A.	Maybe, but let me try.  This is because the computer has a standby period and then forgets things.  (Video played)
THE WITNESS:
This is a helicopter flying over Mubuga complex.  If I stop it here, one sees almost exactly the same picture as in the aerial photograph that you have seen earlier in the binder, and in the middle one sees clearly the big church.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness should speak directly into the microphone.
THE WITNESS:
On the overhead projector is the photograph now that covers the same area.  Can we see it quickly?  Okay, let's just continue.  We continue.
(Video played)  
THE WITNESS:
The helicopter is flying around the complex and now the helicopter will continue to Mubuga trading centre, just next to it.  This is Mubuga trading centre.  It's a good example of a centre in this part of Rwanda.  This is a rather big centre in this area.  A marketplace -- today there is no market -- where cars will park if there are any; some commercial houses around, some residences.  We continue.  

When we continue, Your Honours will be able to see the road that is the Kibuye-Cyangugu road, the main roads that lead along Lake Kivu.  Here one sees the road, the biggest road in the area.  One sees Lake Kivu in the background.  This is another trading centre.  And now the helicopter is flying away from Lake Kivu, up the hills towards Bisesero area.  These are the hills of Bisesero.  

This is Bisesero in '95.  Your Honours can see the scattered houses, the mixture of crops and small forests and the rolling hills with rounded tops.  Because many people have been killed here in '94, the situation may be a little bit different because this video was taken in '95.  Probably in '94 the crops were more organised than now, as now most farmers are dead.  The video continues, but it starts raining and the window of the helicopter gets wet, the image gets worse, so I propose to stop here.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can we now proceed with the second video?  Briefly, could you tell us what we are about to see in this second video?
A.	Yes, the second video will start again with Mubuga complex from the air, just a few seconds, and then it shows Mubuga church, Mubuga Catholic church on the ground in '95.  Then there are a few seconds black, and then the images continue with Mugonero complex, so it is two complexes.  There is Mubuga church and Mugonero hospital and church.  

I will try to start on the place indicated in the binder.  This is still another massacre site in Kibuye town.  This is again the same aerial image of Mubuga church.  This is the same church from the ground I have shown you also the photographs.  I have shown Your Honours also a photograph of this part, and I indicated that Witness AVK has seen the Accused near this brick wall on the left.  This is inside the church, the broken entrance gates.  This is a small room with a staircase leading up to a kind of verandah and to the clock tower.  These images are taken from the verandah.  Again one can see the damage that has been done to this church during the events.  Here there is even a star-like damage, probably caused by a kind of grenade launcher or something like that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, have you, yourself, visited these places?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour, I visited these places several times, but not in '95; more recently.  Currently most of the damage has been repaired and the church is again in use.  This is the sacristy building.  

This is the end of Mubuga, and now the video will continue with Mugonero.  It will start with the Mugonero church, of which I have shown you photographs.

This is inside the church.  I have seen, myself, those four coffins and the bodies of the people in it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
They are still there?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know today.  They were there recently, yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you visited these places very recently.
THE WITNESS:
The latest moment that I can account for that I saw it was 2000 when I was there with Mr. Baghel making the photographs.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So in 2000 these bodies were there.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.

I have been told that these are just a symbolical few bodies left inside, whereas the big numbers are dumped in mass graves outside.  

This is some damage to the church building.  And this is the church building again, but now we zoomed out and we are looking from the side where there is currently the genocide memorial.  So the grassy place on the down part of the picture that Your Honours can see is currently the genocide memorial, and it is a secondary mass grave.  It means that the people who have been dumped in primary mass graves, some of them have been exhumed and have been buried in dignity here, so what you see here is a secondary mass grave on the down part of the photo -- of the image.  And one can see also this video has been taken again from the roads or close to the roads in front of the office of the president, which means that one can see that in '95 when these videos were taken, there were no buildings obstructing the view, like currently.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	We also don't see the memorial building.  When was it erected, do you know?
A.	I'm not a hundred per cent sure.  Usually these buildings get erected in phases.  Every genocide memorial week, it becomes more sophisticated, but it is sure that at that stage in '95 it is still very basic.  I just see some kind of plants around it, and in 2000, the photographs that are in your binder, Your Honours can see that there is a decent fence and part of a wall.

This is really the hospital, itself, maybe 50, maximum 100 metres away from the church that we just saw.  This is the main building of the hospital.  

As you see, the cameraman is going down to the basement; inside the basement, and this is inside the surgical theatre or the surgical ward.  This is still the surgical theatre.  The toilet and shower in the surgical theatre.  All these rooms are also indicated in the sketches in your binder.  

This is the mass grave in and near the septic tank that is marked on your binder.  This is the hospital main building shown from this mass grave.  This is the end of this video of Mugonero complex.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, I pray to tender as Prosecution exhibit the exhibit bundle as Prosecution Exhibit P. 2, and the two videos as Prosecution Exhibit P. 3A and B respectively.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So tendered and admitted as Exhibit P.  2, the green bundle, and the videos as Exhibit P. 3 and P. 4
(Exhibit Nos. P. 2, P. 3, and P. 4 admitted)
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you very much.  

Your Honours, this is the end of my examination-in-chief of this witness.  Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, please proceed with your cross-examination.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, I have just read your CV, and in that regard, I have a few questions for you, questions for the purposes of clarification, of course.  

On the first page with regard to classification, you stated that in 1984 --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We still don't have the copies of the CV.  Mr. Kapaya, we have not received copies of the CV yet.
MR. KAPAYA:
Give me just a short period, Your Honour, to sort these things out.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you should have provided these copies.
MR. KAPAYA: 
Yes, Your Honour, actually we had made several copies, and some of them have been misplaced.  I don't know how.  We are just making copies, Your Honour, and they will be provided in due course.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, could you please hold on for a while so we can have copies of the CV.
MR. KAPAYA:
Maybe the professor can proceed to other areas and then revert to - I don't know what his plan of action is.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, what is your explanation for not having copies for the Court? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, actually we prepared copies.  Somehow they have been misplaced within the courtroom somewhere.  I don't know how, but we had actually prepared copies in the three languages, English, French and Kinyarwanda.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is a habit which must cease.  If things are getting lost in the courtroom, we don't know where we are going.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, we take note of that Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
All parties wishing to tender documents must ensure there are sufficient copies to go around.
MR. KAPAYA:
We will endeavour to do that, Your Honour.  Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Professor Songa, do you have the French copy with you?  Do you have the French copy of CV? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, I have a French copy, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So please proceed with your cross-examination now.  We have the English copies.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I started by greeting Mr. Lucassen, and then I was asking him a question regarding point No. 2, (inaudible) categorisation. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In 1984 it is indicated that you obtained a certificate for teaching at first level, level of post graduate diploma, but the university that awarded your certificate is not mentioned.  What do you have to say regarding that question?
A.	That teaching certificate was given by the same university as where I received my master's degree, the free university in Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
Q.	I thank you.  And when you write that you obtained a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in the science of movement, can you clarify very clearly what you mean by this discipline?
A.	Sciences of human movement is a study studying several aspects of human movement.  It is not directly related to the work that I am currently doing.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it migration?
THE WITNESS:
Sorry, I missed -- no, no.  Human movement is the body, anatomy, physiology, how people move.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not how populations move from place to place?
THE WITNESS:
No, it is not.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You mean movements of the parts of the body?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I mean parts of the body.  My specialisation was exercise physiology.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	And if I were to think about traditional disciplines, what does the science of human movement pertain to in particular?  Does it pertain to medicine, biology, anatomy?  We, of the Defence, would like to know.
A.	That's correct; medicine, physiology, anatomy.  My specialisation was exercise physiology, how the human body adapts itself to stressful circumstances under exercise.
Q.	And in which faculty of the Amsterdam free university is this particular discipline taught?
A.	It is an interfaculty which is in between two faculties, and I think it was between medicine and social sciences, which means that aspects of both these sciences were integrated in these studies of human movement.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What faculty graduated you?
THE WITNESS:
The interfaculty.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Are you referring to a very common university system in Holland, a system that is very common in Holland?
A.	No, it is not very common, but several studies are like this and hundreds of students obtained their master's degree in the studies that I followed, sir.
Q.	How do you call a specialist in this discipline compared to the specialist, for example, in medicine or law?  We refer to them as legal or medical experts.  How would you refer to a specialist in such a discipline?
A.	I'm sorry, if we are coming to details, it's difficult for me to translate it.  In Dutch I was called Doctorandus Lichamelijheopvoeding, and later this name of the studies has been changed in Doctorandus Bewegings-wetenschappen, and the translation of Doctorandus Bewegings-wetenschappen is master's degree in sciences of human movement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Investigator, why are you called doctor?  Have you done a Ph.D.?
THE WITNESS:
No, in Dutch we use the word Doctorandus to indicate a master's level.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, do you have counterparts in foreign lands, particularly in neighbouring countries?
A.	I'm not aware of that.  These studies are indeed rare.  I only know that after I graduated, similar studies started in Maastricht, but that is another part of the Netherlands, so if you don't know these studies, I understand it.  This is something one can study in the Netherlands.
Q.	Could we seize the opportunity to know whether there are any specialists in this area?  Do you know of any specialists in this area?
A.	Yes, I know many, like several professors who teached me.
Q.	My question was whether we can avail ourselves of this opportunity to know about them?
A.	Do you want names, sir? 
Q.	Names, works in the area, the doctrines in the area?
A.	Sir, there is no problem, but I have to refer to documents.  You can see in which year I obtained my degree, and from my CV one can see that I started doing another kind of work, and right here I'm afraid that I make mistakes if I start giving details about my studies.  Of course, I have my diploma -- I think it is in Kigali now, and it has been examined by the United Nations prior to my -- prior to being accepted for this job.
Q.	So we take it that, for the time being, you are not in a position to cite authors or works in this discipline which is your area of specialisation?
A.	If you give me a minute, I will set my mind to it and organise my thinking and I can give you some answers, sir.
Q.	I believe we can understand the difficulty and move on.

I can see that in Part 3 of your CV, relating to skills, particularly when you are referring to professional training, I find that in 2003 you had access to courses for Hague investigators, and you mentioned the name of the institution, but when we come to 1996 and 2002, or the period from 1991 to 1996, no reference is made to the institution which gave those courses.  We need clarification from you on those matters as well.
A.	Maybe I didn't write it down clearly.  In 2003, I followed a course at IICI in the Hague, in the Netherlands.  That course lasted two weeks, so that was only those two weeks that I was following that course, sir.
Q.	That was not the thrust of my question.  What I said was that on those points you were precise because you mentioned that you studied at the Hague, the International Institute for Criminal Investigation.  That is clear.  However, as regards the other years, whether we are dealing with the period 1996 to 2002 or 1991 to 1996, and we stop there, you do not say which institution gave the course.  That is the matter I expect clarification from you on.
A.	Yes, that is because it was minor courses that one follows, that I followed in the course of my normal job, and that are not worth mentioning in a CV.  An example is as a ICTR investigator.  From time to time, courses are offered to me in Kigali for a couple of hours, one, maybe two days.  I followed those.

	1730H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lucassen, you have not given the name of the courses for which you have taken, these courses from 1991 to 2002.
THE WITNESS:
Maybe I need also a copy of my CV to reply to the point.  Yeah, I gave it as evidence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Juma, will you?
THE WITNESS:
Can I have one in English?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English interpreters would also need a copy of that CV, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Juma, do you have an extra copy?
MR. JUMA:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are referencing, for the interpreters, part 3 of your CV, (unintelligible) and expertise.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, and I indeed did not specify it because it was just the usual courses that I followed in the course of my jobs; which means that between '96 and 2002 -- since I'm in ICTR in 1999, I have had some courses.  I have been in ICTR also in '98.  

As one can see in my CV, I have had some courses.  I have been in Kosovo in '99.  I have certainly had some courses there.  So sometimes the borderline between courses and briefings is not 100 percent clear, that's why I don't intend to say that these are university level courses, but they are relevant courses.
JUDGE SHORT:
I think you are not getting counsel's problem.  It is not what you study, it is what institutions gave the courses, and between what times and what times?  He would like to know, if he reaches - where he is able to challenge your competence in these matters.  He would like to know which university you would refer to or which institution you would refer to as having given the course that you refer to, so that he has an ability to understand your learning as an expert.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sorry, Your Honour. 

The courses between 1986 and 1990 have been organised by the Amsterdam city police and have been given either by people from the police or from external trainers hired by the Amsterdam city police.  

And the courses between '91 and '96, in those years I was a police school trainer, so --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Police school trainer where?
THE WITNESS:
A police school trainer in the Netherlands.  And for this purpose I have also been sent, usually within the building, to several courses to improve the quality of my work.  Either the courses were either given by the Amsterdam -- or maybe I should say Dutch police school organisation or by external trainers that have been hired by the Dutch police schools.  

Since I'm in ICTR, I think -- well, what comes to my mind is courses given by internal staff, by colleagues from ICTR.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, you said in the course of your evidence that you have given evidence in seven trials, in the ICTR.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, sir, in fact, in six trials.  This is the seventh one.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In those six trials, have you not submitted a CV?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir, I have submitted CVs in these trials.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Different from the one you have submitted for this trial?
THE WITNESS:
No different.  This one is the current version, but basically the same.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And nobody has sought to find out the content of this?
THE WITNESS:
Apparently, I wasn't prepared for the kinds of questions that I get now.  That is normally what is my experience with earlier cases, is that my CV is not studied into detail.  It shows a certain level of education and a certain experience within ICTR, and currently also, a certain experience in preparing documents for a trial. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Don't you -- in these courses which you participated in, didn't you get a certificate of participation?  Even if you didn't get a diploma or certificate, did you not have a certificate of participation, some document to show that you participated in these courses?
THE WITNESS:
I may have something, but I must have to look for it.  For instance, recently I obtained a diploma, a certificate within ICTR, a UN diploma, well, it is something like "handling responsibly under difficult circumstances, under dangerous circumstances."  As you see, I don't remember it, I just get it.  I get the diploma, I continue my work.  I don't see it as something to put on my CV.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Songa.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	The witness, perhaps, could be recalled at this stage of the cross-examination that you received your training in the police -- Amsterdam police school first and second in the ICTR?
A.	That is correct, sir.  Of course, from my CV one can see that before the police school I did things, and between the police and ICTR, I had some other jobs, also.
Q.	And to conclude with your training, could you tell us what is the level of the certificate issued by the Amsterdam police school?
A.	The diploma that I obtained in 1986, is as we call it in Dutch, police jaked (phonetic), police officer or police constable.
Q.	So, what does this actually correspond to, is it a primary school certificate, is it a (unintelligible) school certificate or degree or something else?
A.	I don't know to answer your question so specific, sir.  I obtained the diploma of the Dutch police school as a police officer, police jaked (phonetic) in Dutch, to avoid confusion, and I did this after my secondary school which is in English high school level.  In fact, I did it after my university  course, after my Master's Degree.
Q.	So what level would you say that the teaching you have received or the courses you have followed in the ICTR are?  At what level would those courses be?
A.	To the best of my knowledge, the courses in ICTR are not classified at a level of the high school, Bachelor's, Master's, Philosopher's, they are relevant for the job and adapted to the -- to me and my colleagues, to the group of people that we are following this course.
Q.	Looking at your CV, Mr. Lucassen, I realise that your professional experience is mainly within the United Nations system.  In your view, which certificate persuaded the United Nations to hire you, which of your certificates?
A.	To my knowledge, that's the culmination of my master's degree in science of movement, plus my diploma as a police officer; the culmination of those two, sir.
Q.	I thank you.  Your CV shows that you worked for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  What refugees would you be referring to in this case?
A.	In 1995-96 I was in Ngoma and Bukavu, not far from Rwanda.  At that moment there were big refugee camps, sir, of Rwandese refugees.
Q.	Thank you.  I see that you spent a certain amount of time in the search for crimes and within this action you participated in the training of Zairian military officers or Zairian soldiers.  Is that true?
A.	That is true, sir.
Q.	In your CV you write, in part 5, that is page 4 of the CV, that is regarding publications, that would be page 3 in the English version, you say that you have no significant publications.  So, please tell us what is the import of the fifth part of your CV?
A.	I made it along the guidelines of the United Nations, about how to compose a CV, and number five, in this proposal, is called "publications."
Q.	So, in your understanding, if there is a United Nations format for drafting CVs, even if you have nothing to say, you have to write down something?
A.	I write "no significant publications," sir.
Q.	The term that you used is "significant", not "important?"
A.	It is correct that I use "significant".  I'm not sure if I know the distinction if I would have used "important."
Q.	The opposite of "significant" or "real" would be "false" and the opposite of -- another opposite would be "lesser".  So are you saying that you do not have any publications or are you saying that you have publications of lesser importance?
A.	Sir, I think it depends on the definition of the word "publications." 

For instance, to get my master's degree I had to do an investigation, prepare a document about it and defend it.  I don't see that is a significant publication.  It is just something that comes in the course of my studies.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, Witness, have you published anything?  Published means notified the world at large, something you can say, pull up this on the web site or get this from the publishers, and it is not very important but it is published.  Or have you published nothing, so there is no question of "insignificant", "less significant" or whatever.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  Thank you for clarifying.  I have not published anything.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, at this point in the counter -- at this point in the cross-examination, I would like to raise the issue of the admissibility of his report.  

With the Court's permission, I would like to add this.   After looking at his curriculum vitae, I fail to see what qualification, what skill, would justify that any credit should be attached to this document, whatsoever.  I do not see which discipline gave him the necessary competence to carry out the tasks that he carried out and make the presentation that he has made this afternoon before this Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, what do you have to say about this?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  I think counsel for the Defence is confusing two issues, one -- three, actually; one is that one related to admissibility of the report; and the second one is the weight to be attached to the contents of that report.  

In regards to the first one, Your Honour, the witness has testified that he's trained in police work and that he has practical experience in these matters, investigative matters, for a period stretching over five or six years.  And issues of admissibility are not as (unintelligible) as the information that is contained in the report is very relevant and have probative information under that Rule 89(i), that document is admissible under the Rules. 

As regards qualifications, the witness does not purport today that he is an expert.  All he is saying, though, is that he is an investigator with the Office of the Prosecutor.  What he did was to gather evidence that is relevant for the purposes of this trial.

Now, in this respect the witness -- the CV shows that he is trained in matters of investigation, matters of photography and like things -- I mean, matters of making sketches and that kind of thing.  So it's on the basis of that knowledge which if he gained in training in schools and his practical knowledge, by virtue of his association with this Tribunal and the other institutions, that he gained the competence to compile the very report.  

So, Your Honour, I think that should not be confused, admissibility and weight, and also whether the witness is -- he is just an investigator and not an expert witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
This is not witness number 22?  He is not an expert?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, he is not an expert.  He is an investigator with the Office of the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, we have deliberated and he is not an expert, he is just an investigator, and we overrule your objection.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.  

This leads me to the substance of his work or his work.  We have a few questions, Mr. Lucassen.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	First, we would like to ask you to talk -- to tell us, very precisely, about the location of houses in Mika Muhimana's plot.  If I understood correctly, there are two houses, there is one in front and there is one behind.  Is that correct?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr, Songa, you are referring to which page of the Exhibit P2?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I think we are going to have some difficulties, since I am referring to a document in French, which was transmitted to me by the Prosecutor and which, from all indications, is different in format from the document that was broadcast on your screens.  This document is called a document on Mr. Mika Muhimana -- Document Relating to Mika Muhimana, but I am on page 32 of this document.  I don't know if that is the one that the Court has.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have the K-number?
MR. SONGA:
So we have before us a document called Document Concerning Mika Muhimana, that was compiled by the investigator Tony Lucassen, which was formalised on the 26th of March 2004.  We are on page 32 of the document which is entitled Place or Location of the Massacre.  

We have the photographs.  We have general information and photographs.  And amongst these photographs we have Mika's house.  The leaf of documents, we have in the document, Mika's house, at the left is the bar where Mika was selling beer; it was in the same building as this former secteur bureau.  So my question relates to Mika's house.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
K-number?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We don't have any numbers on the page.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have numbers on the top of the page, K-numbers, the 0286261 and so on and so forth?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I am using a document in French.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Assisting counsel, can you use the English one to read the document here and give us -- is it the same document, so we can follow?
MR. SONGA:
The figure that is indicated at the top of the page is K0286261.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, please, could you please read the number?
MR. SONGA:
K0286261.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President (sic).
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Let your assistant hold the English copy and tell us whatever page you refer to, he tells us the read number, the K-number, which is read on top of the English version, so that we'll be able to follow you.  We'll be able to see the same as you.  Show him the page and identify it here and tell us the number.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, my assistant has a document but he does not believe there is concordance between the English and the French document.

Madam President, I think that perhaps the Prosecutor is in a better position to help us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it possible, please, could you help us?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
What my learned friend needs to do is exactly what Your Honours suggested, he draws a parallel between the English and French.  I have no idea what he is referring to because I don't speak French.  He asked for the French and we made a copy for him.  He should be able to link the English and French together.  We have no idea what he's referring to. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The French copy isn't given the same K-numbers?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, the French copies were produced in the last 48 hours and the English copies were produced  ages ago.  He asked for the French and we then translated the English into French, just for his ease of reference.  So one would have thought that he would have drawn the natural link between to what he refers to in the original document and the translation.  I really wouldn't think that would be a terribly difficult exercise.

Actually, Your Honours, I've just  been informed that my office offered you the Kinyarwandan and English translations of this and your staff decided you didn't need them because you didn't speak either language.  So we actually offered you those copies.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
	We would be able to locate the document, in any case, the six --  K086161 is the legend of the scale of Mika's house.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  As I said, my document has the same serial number, so if we have been able to locate this in the English version, may I go on with my question?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, if I can be of assistance, my assistant, who speaks both English and French, has indicated that the page that my learned friend refers to in English is 188, and that's titled Massacre at Gishyita Town.  And then the photographs that are indicated on pages 189, 190 and 191, 192, and 193 are the same pictures.  But the narration in under those copies are what is listed in his French copy.  He should actually be using English and French, because we have not produced a separate document, we have just translated the narration into French.  So he's talking about K188 and beyond.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can, Mr. Songa -- can you please read the heading of the document?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  K0286261.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, I'm talking to the heading of the document, the topic of the document.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The title, the title of the page you are referring to, the heading on the page?
MR. SONGA:
The page is entitled Place or Location of the Massacre that happened in Gishyita town.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President (sic). 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	My question, Mr. Lucassen, was based on the observation that Mikaela had two houses, one in front and one behind.  Since you went to this site, who lives in these houses, at this present time?
A.	I have been informed that the current conseiller of Gishyita secteur lives in these houses at the present time.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now Mr. Lucassen, Mr. Muhima lived -- is that an official house?  Is it an official residence?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know, Madam, Your Honour, if it is an official residence or not.  It is close to the secteur office, but I'm not aware that conseillers have official residences.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Yes, Professor, proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q	And, Mr. Lucassen, tell us the name of the resident of that house, apart from his official function.
A.	I've seen him.  I've introduced myself.  But I don't remember his name.
Q.	Did you tell him your name?
A.	I don't think so.  I introduced myself as "ICTR investigator."
Q.	You made mention to this house, saying that it was used as a bar, if I understood you correctly; is that right?
A.	That is not right.  My source, AQK, told me that in the neighbouring building, the same building where the secteur office was, that from part of that building your client has been selling beer.  Apart from that, I took a photograph of one room on the front side and it can look like a bar, but I didn't enquire how it has been used.
Q.	If I understood what you said correctly, the secteur office was in another building, different from the house in which Mika lived?
A.	Yes, sir.  That is what my source told me.
Q.	What did you see, exactly?  Did you see a building that could be called Mika's house and another that could be called the secteur office?
A.	Yes, sir, I saw a building that was called Mika's house, and a neighbouring building, part of which has been described to me as the secteur office at the time.
Q.	What separates the two buildings?  What's the distance between the two buildings?
A.	The distance between the outer walls is maybe one metre.
Q.	Between two walls there is one metre?
A.	That is correct, sir.
Q.	Can you describe that plot that belonged to Mika?  Were there trees?  Were there fruit trees on it?
A.	I visited the plot that AWK told me was the plot of Mika with two houses, a house on the side of the street, of the square, and a house behind it.  There was hardly anyplace for trees there.  I don't remember having seen any.  I haven't been behind the second house.  I don't know what was there.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I will create further problems for you with regard to references.  In my document, I'm referring to page 38, specifically with regard to remarks made in regard to AWK.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How is it titled?
MR. SONGA:
All we have as a title is AQK. The title is Witness Locations.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We've got it.   Please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, my question is on roadblocks.  AWK allegedly told you where roadblocks were situated as related in her statement.  

Could you please tell us exactly where those roadblocks were or describe them as precisely as possible?
A.	Yes, in my notes on page 220, under the heading AWK, I wrote that I worked with AWK on 17 March this year and then I write, "AWK showed me a roadblock in Gishyita town on the main road."  I call it here the Mubuga-Mugonero road.  One can also call it the Kibuye-Cyangugu road, if you take further places on that road.  And then AWK showed me the roadblock in that road in the curve on the centre of Gishyita town where roads took off from the communal office and toward Mika's house.  And I indicated this place on the map, that is in the English version, on page 147, that has a scale of 1 to 50,000.
Q.	I will ask a question which relates to the previous page regarding the testimony of AQK.  AQK.  May I proceed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In this spot, Mr. Lucassen, this is what you said.  "Mika's house is indicated as number 11 on the one to 50,000 map.  AKQ showed Mr. Lucassen the room in Mr. Mika's house where a girl told AQK she had been raped by Mika.  AQK showed the room in Mika's house where Mika had raped AQK."  

 My question to you, Mr. Lucassen, is whether, Mr. Lucassen, you are referring to the same room or to two different rooms?
A.	Sir, I refer to two different rooms.  AQK told me where she herself said that she has been raped and AQK showed me another room where she told me that another girl had been raped.
Q.	Do you confirm that Mika's house is located on the Kibuye-Cyangugu road?
A.	Not far from it; I write about 200 metre's east of it, yes.
Q.	Right, thank you for the clarification. 

Who are Mika's neighbours, both to the right and to the left?  Who are those sharing a boundary wall with him, even though we don't have such a wall in this case?
A.	In '94 many people have been killed.  Do you want to know in '94 or do you want to know in the present situation, sir?
Q.	I believe you would be more at ease with the situation you witnessed yourself, that is today.
A.	That is true.  And today if one stands in front of Mika's house, the house to the left, which is a little bit down, doesn't look in use.  I remember three parts of that house.  One part AQK told me that your client sold beer from it.  The middle part, I have been told that it was the secteur office.  And the left, the most down part, I don't remember how it is today.  The other two parts are not in use, are either destroyed or for other reasons not in use.  That is the house down to the left. 

And if one stands in front of Mika's house, the house to the right, which is a little bit up, I did not enquire who lives there.  It looks like a normal house for the area.
Q.	Thank you.  You say that Gishyita is an important big commercial centre.  Why do you think it is an important commercial centre?
A.	It was important to the standards of the area, and to me that is quite obvious that the communal office was there and the communal court and, at some stage, I saw on the map, even a bank building has been there.
Q.	How many major traders did you identify there?
A.	That's why I say it was important to the area.  That is a difficult question for me to answer, important traders.  If I think of the number of commercial buildings that are really in the centre, maybe ten, something like this.
Q.	I thank you.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to find page 35 of my document in French, it has to do with the locations identified by the witness.  I am referring particularly to Witness BG, BJ (sic).  It is still under the title Witness Locations, BJ.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In the second paragraph under BJK, Mr. Lucassen, you write as follows:  "BJK told me that the Interahamwe in Mugonero and Gishyita secteurs, cellule Muranga, is a distance from Gishyita."  What is the distance from the house in Mugonero situated a distance from the Gishyita centre, according to your estimates, of course?
A.	I don't know, sir.  I have not been to that house.  She told me it was in Rwamba cellule and she told me it was a few kilometres from Gishyita town.  

My experience with witnesses is that to give you any estimation of how far it actually is I would have to go there myself.  This is what she told me.
Q.	So I take it that you did not go to the house in Mugonero?
A.	I did not go to the house of the Interahamwe called Mugonero, that is correct.  And I tried to make that clear in my notes she told me where it was.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lucassen, this Mugonero is the name of an Interahamwe?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's the name of an Interahamwe, not to be confused with the name Mugonero complex.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And we are referring to which place, B -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
BJK.
MR. SONGA:
I was referring to Witness BGK (sic) on page 38 of the French document.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That's okay, I found it.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Still under the title "Witness Locations," under AWK, Mr. Lucassen.  We are referring to the Kiziba commercial centre.  Have you visited Kiziba trading centre?
A.	Yes, sir, I have, as it is within the notes.  AWK showed me the location of Kiziba trading centre and I marked 14 on the maps and that is on the map page 147.
Q.	What is the size of that centre or the importance of that centre, please?
A.	It is very small.
Q.	Are there two or three houses in that centre?
A.	If I think of the houses that are immediately on the road, there are maybe six houses on either side of the road that form the heart of the centre.  

Generally, in Rwanda, people have a tendency to live scattered.
Q.	Thank you.  What is possibly the distance between Kiziba trading centre and Nyarutovu?
A.	Nyarutovu, that word is written on the map on page 147.  Then the distance from where this word is written, until Kiziba centre, is about two and a half or three kilometres.  One witness indicated to me, apart of  Nyarutovu where he was, which is closer to Kiziba trading centre, that is written as 
Witness AWK, which indicated to me a place marked with number 4 on map 147, which is one and a half kilometres from Kiziba trading centre.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us how many cellules there are in Bisesero secteur?
A.	That information is in the English document almost at the end at page 224, there it is written that Bisesero in '94 had eleven cellules.
Q.	Thank you.  And in which secteur is Gitwa?
A.	The word Gitwa, as I hear you pronouncing it now, sounds to me like the hill marked number 22 on the map 147.  And, if you want, I refer to another document to see if I can find the secteur.  I can find it in another document.  If I look on page 146, then it seems to be in Ngoma secteur, but I cannot confirm this and there may be confusion in this area, I remember, from borders changing, either before or after '94, which means that there may also be confusion amongst people from the area.  So I can't answer your question, sir.
Q.	Thank you.
MR. SONGA: 
Madam President, I am still dealing with the French document, on page 37, with regard to 
Witness AVK and we are still dealing with Witness Locations.  We are talking about AVK on page 37 in the French.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Lucassen, you are referring to the distance between the primary school and the cemetery.  My question to you is written, if any, there is a distance between the church and the dispensary, the distance between the church and the dispensary, if any?
A.	The distance between Mubuga church and the dispensary can best be seen on the sketch on page 156.  On page 156, number 11 is the church, and the circle, number 15, indicates the dispensary.  I estimate that distance at 200 metres, sir, as the crow flies.
Q.	Thank you.  By the way, could you please clarify to us whether Witness AV (sic) was illiterate?
A.	I don't know, sir.
Q.	It is possible that you did not understand my question.  I am referring to the fact that you state that Rwandan illiterate people are unable to indicate distances.  That is why I would like to know if AVK is considered as one of those that is capable of or incapable of estimating distances or giving clear distances.
A.	Generally speaking, it is hard to make 100 percent line between who is illiterate and who is literate.  Many people say that they are literate, but what they can actually read or write is minimal.  If I think of AVK, what I remember from her, she doesn't seem to be one of our most illiterate witnesses.  No, so she's probably literate, that's what I mean.
Q.	I thank you.  

Still within this area, in your introduction you said, generally, that Rwandans had difficulty estimating distances.  Could we conclude that this is a study based on dependable sources or this is the impression you received when you were in contact with these people?
A.	This is my experience by hearing an estimation from a witness and then going and checking it myself and then finding there can be a huge discrepancy. 

As an example, a witness can say, "My house, I think it's one kilometre away."  And when I go to check it, it can be three.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, how long would you take to finalise your cross-examination?
MR. SONGA:
It is a little difficult, Madam President.  May I advance a figure, an evaluation?  Another 30 minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you can ask a last question about distances.  Sorry.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Lucassen, are the distances you have mentioned under Witness Locations, are all of them distances which you measured yourself or some of them are distances which were given to you and others that you measured yourself?
THE WITNESS:
That should be very clear from my notes, Your Honour.  Basically I have been to these places and I have measured the distances myself, unless, like the example that we just had, BJK,  who told me that the house of Interahamwe Mugonero is over there a few kilometres away, but I have been to these places, unless it is clear.  So the distances are my distances.
JUDGE SHORT:
All right.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, we will stop for the day and continue tomorrow afternoon.  Is it okay?
MR. SONGA:
I believe you authorised me to ask one last question on distances.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you can ask one last question.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	The last question regarding distances is this, Mr. Lucassen.  During your contact with the witnesses, were you able to meet any who are able to evaluate distances objectively?
A.	Of course, some people estimate right.  A clear example or it comes to driving distance and they simply know the distance, that is the mileage the car shows.  So it is very well possible that people estimate accurately.  I just learned immediately not to trust it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The question counsel put to you is not the theory of it, it is did you come into contact with people who appeared to know the distance clearly?  That's the question.  Did you meet anyone who would knew the distance correctly?  That's what the question is.

THE WITNESS:
Yes, sir.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Mr. Lucassen.  Thank you Madam President.  Your Honours.  Tomorrow.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Lucassen, please do not communicate your evidence or testimony with anyone outside the Court.  We adjourn for the day and resume tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m.
	(Court adjourned at 1840H)
