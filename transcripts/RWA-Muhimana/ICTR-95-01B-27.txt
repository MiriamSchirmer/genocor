EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	When you learned of the death of President Habyarimana, were you at the address that is on the sheet before you?
A.	Yes, it is at that address that I was.
Q.	And did you remain at that address throughout the events of April, May, June and July 1994?
A.	Yes, I remained at that address.
Q.	On the day of the death of President Habyarimana, what was the situation like in your secteur, insofar as security is concerned?
A.	When we learnt about the death of President Habyarimana -- I presently learned of it on the 7th, during the night.  And after learning the news, we remained at home.  The next day, in the morning, I went to the Gishyita centre and I saw some people who were moving about.  Apparently, there was no problem, but people were saying that the head of state had died.  I passed by groups of people, but insofar as the behaviour of people -- well, I don't know what I can tell you.  We had no other choice. 
Q.	Can you say what distance separated where you were and from the Gishyita centre?
A.	As concerns the distance, I think I will tell you that there was a distance that could be covered in 20 to 25 minutes of trekking.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Did you know Mika Muhimana before the events of 1994?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	And what was he?
A.	He was the conseiller communal in the Gishyita commune and, besides, he was our neighbour.
Q.	During the events of April, May and June, did you see him?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	Do you recall on what occasions you saw him?
A.	When I saw him, he had lost a child, in April.  That was on the 8th of April.  From that period, I kept seeing him because he was our neighbour.
Q.	Madam Witness, did you know a place called Kiziba?
A.	I don't know Kiziba, but I heard people talk about it or mention the name.
Q.	Concerning what people used to say about Kiziba, can you locate it?
A.	I heard the name Kiziba, but I didn't know exactly where it was located because I had never gone there.
Q.	From what you heard, did you also hear that arms or weapons were being distributed at Kiziba?
A.	No, I wasn't a witness to that and I didn't hear people talk about that.
Q.	Now, let's talk about the death of Mika's child.  Who informed you that Mika had lost a child?
A.	There is a young girl that used to take care of that child.  That young girl was living at Mika's house, and that young girl told us that Mika's child had died.  And after we learned of this, we went to the Gishyita centre, and Mika had gone to see if indeed his child had died.  That was on the 8th.  He went and brought back the corpse, and the next day, on the 9th, the corpse remained there and was only buried the next day, on Sunday, the 9th. 
Q.	Do you -- are you actually saying the following Sunday?
A.	The child died on the 8th, the body remained there on Saturday, the 9th, and on the 10th, the child was buried.  And the mourning period continued through the 11th, the 12th, the 13th, the 14th and the 15th.  And it was on the 16th that we ended the mourning the period.  And during all that period I was present in his residence.  
Q.	What is the length of the mourning period for a child in Rwanda?
A.	The mourning lasts for a week, but somebody who has means, the period of mourning can last two weeks.  But for Mika's child, the mourning took place only for a period of a week.
Q.	Did I also hear you say that you were present at the burial for this child?
A.	Yes, I was present for the burial, in the company of my mother.
Q.	During the entire week of mourning, did you see Mika?
A.	Yes, I saw him.  He was present.  I mean, his child was dead, so he could only be present, and during that week, I saw him throughout the entire period.
Q.	Do you know about that Adventist religion or denomination in your region?
A.	Yes, the Adventist church exists in our region.
Q.	Do you also know the person (sic) called ****************?
A.	The **********************************************************************, and they used to be called the ******************* and later were referred to as *********
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is ************** (sic).
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	These ************, did they used to pray in a church or elsewhere?
A.	These people used to pray out of the church.  They had left the ***************** and prayed outside the church. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I am going to show you the name of a person and you will tell us if you know that person -- knew that person, or not.
MR. SONGA:
And may the registrar assist us in this. 

Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can you read the name in front of you?
A.	Yes, Counsel.
Q.	Do you know that person?
A.	I know that person.  The person used to live on the hill opposite ours.

Q.	Did it happen that you saw him at Mika's place?
A.	No, I never saw him at Mika Muhimana's house. 
Q.	Do you know a person called Robert Ruzindana?
A.	I know that person.  This is a man who used to buy and sell coffee in Rwanda.  He was a trader.
Q.	Did you see him at the Gishyita centre on the 7th of April?

A.	I do not know that one.
Q.	How about the person who used to be called Gorette Mukashyaka?
A.	I do not know her. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Try to wait for the end of the question before you answer.  Don't be in a hurry to answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, did you learn on the 7th of April --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, what was your last question?  Can you please repeat it.
MR. SONGA:
Is that the one I am asking or the one that came before, Madam President?  I would like to understand exactly what you want. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The one before, yes. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I asked you whether you knew the persons named Landiga, Kamukina and Gorette, Makashaka?
A.	I do not know those persons.
Q.	Did you perchance hear that on the 7th of April rapes were committed in Mika's house?
A.	That did not happen.  I never heard of that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor.

MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your question is in relation to a specific day?  You said 7th of April. 
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I am sure you are aware, Professor, that the witness got to hear about the death of the president on the night of the 7th of April. 
MR. SONGA:
If I understood what the witness said correctly, it was on the 7th of April.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In the night on the 7th of April. 
MR. SONGA:
Exactly, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you know any person by the name of Esperance Mukagasana?
A.	No, I do not know that person.
Q.	Thank you.  Madam Witness, I will once more have placed before you a paper containing names. 
MR. SONGA:
With the assistance of the registry. 
THE FRENCH INTERPRETER:
Can you please speak into your microphone. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, do you now have the names before you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you know that person? 
A.	I know that person.
Q.	Under what circumstances did you make that person's acquaintance?
A.	The relatives -- or the parents of that person were our neighbours, and I know where precisely that person was resident.
Q.	When you state that you knew her, did you also know her husband?
A.	I know her husband.
Q.	Did that couple have children?
A.	They had children.
Q.	Do you know what has become of those children?
A.	Are you referring to the children of that couple?  This is what happened to those children, the children of that couple.  I know that that couple had three children -- I think.  At least those are the ones I was able to see.  In May in our area a group of youngsters came, and since that woman had sought refuge in the home of her parents with the three children, some youngsters came to our area and abducted those children and killed them.  Amongst those youngsters was a certain Burabyo, Gasekwa, Mugonero, as well as Mutagana.  That is a group of people who killed those children, the three children.  

That group killed the children and Damascène's wife known as Anesie and the second wife of Damascène -- also killed Damascène's daughter-in-law known as Nyirahabimana.  They also killed the wife of Mpabuka, known as Tamar.  Those youngsters were armed with clubs and machetes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Could you give us the names of these youngsters again.
THE WITNESS:
The youngsters who killed (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s children were Burabyo, his junior brother, Gasekwa, a certain Mugonero, and another who was called Mutagana.  Those are the ones I could see.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You have just mentioned the names of the people who killed (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s children.  Is it possible that you forgot to make mention of Mika's name?
A.	Mika was not a member of that group.
Q.	And who killed (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s mother?
A.	It was the same group of youngsters.  I was unable to know the other members of that group.  All I could identify were those whose names I have just given.  It was the same group who killed (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s mother, the children, and another woman who was our neighbour. 
Q.	And what was the name of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s husband?
A.	I never saw (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s husband again.  He fled. 
Q.	Do I take it that you never heard about him again?
A.	I never heard about him again.  I could see his wife and children. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, what was the ethnicity of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)? 
THE WITNESS:
(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) was a Hutu. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
But she got married to a Tutsi. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you hear that that person was a victim of rape?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which person, Counsel? 
THE WITNESS:
That person was not raped. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which person? 
MR. SONGA:
I am referring to the person whose name is written on the paper that was given to the witness and whose children were murdered.
THE WITNESS:
(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) was not raped.  Since she was resident in our area, she was never raped.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I would suggest that the witness should not give the names of the person in question and that the name that was uttered be expunged from the records. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May the name of the person mentioned by the witness be expunged from the record.  

And, Madam Witness, do not mention the name of that lady again.  Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You state that that person was never raped.  Is that what you said, Witness, if I understood you correctly?
A.	She was never raped.
Q.	And if I were to put it to you that Mika raped her in the secteur office, what would you say to that?
A.	He never raped her.  There wasn't even a secteur office in Gishyita commune.
Q.	You state that there was never a secteur office.  Where then did Mika used to work?
A.	He worked in his house. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Did you never hear that during the events Mika committed acts of rape?
A.	He never raped any woman. 
Q.	Did you know Mika's wife?
A.	I knew her.  She was a teacher in our area.
Q.	During the events, did she used to live with her husband?
A.	Yes, she resided with her husband.
Q.	Thank you.  On the Sabbath day following the death of President Habyarimana, did you go for prayers?
A.	Yes, I went for prayers.  On the 9th, we went to pray.
Q.	Where did you go to pray?
A.	We went to pray in Kagano church.
Q.	Is that the same church that is known by the name of Adventist church of Gishyita?
A.	You are right.
Q.	Do you know an area known as Muyange?
A.	Yes, I know the area known as Muyange.
Q.	In what secteur is Muyange?
A.	Muyange is in Ngoma secteur.  When you go down, it is below Ngoma, specifically in Magarama.
Q.	Can you possibly remember the name of the cellule where Muyange is found?
A.	I do not recall the cellule, but all I know is that it is in Ngoma secteur.  Murange is situated across Mvumvero valley.
Q.	Are you in a position to give us an estimate of the distance between Muyange and your church?
A.	There is a great distance, because when you leave the church you go down a hill below which is a valley, and that is where Muyange is situated.  I do not know of the exact distance, but it's quite a lengthy distance.
Q.	When you are in Muyange, can you see the Gishyita Adventist church?
A.	When you are in Muyange, you cannot possibly see the Gishyita Adventist church.
Q.	Why, Madam Witness?
A.	When you are at our church, you can see Muyange forest, but you cannot see the houses.  All you can see are the trees because they are quite tall.
Q.	Are you stating that between Muyange and the church there are tall trees?
A.	The trees in Muyange and from Muyange to the church is a long distance -- as well as a valley.  Above it is a hill.  In Muyange you can't see what is happening in the church.  When you are in the church, you can see the trees and not the houses.
Q.	Do you confirm that on the Sabbath day of the 9th of April you went to pray at Gishyita Adventist church?
A.	Yes, I went there.
Q.	From what time to what time, roughly?
A.	The first persons arrived at the church at about 8 a.m.  We therefore could start at 9 a.m. and continue to 2 p.m.  We could therefore go to the church and come back at 6 p.m. 
Q.	On that day, were there any Tutsi refugees in that church?
A.	There were no Tutsi refugees.  On that day, we were praying.  There were no problems because every day we went to church and I never saw any refugees there. 
Q.	And if I were to put to you that a large-scale attack against Tutsis took place in that area on the 9th of April, what would you say to that?
A.	There was never an attack. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, was your question that there was an attack in the area or in the church?  What was the question? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  My question has to do with an attack that might have been carried out on the church.  And I believe the witness answered my question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, on that day, was there any attack in the vicinity, that is in your region, against the Tutsi?
A.	We did not witness any such attack.  That attack did not take place.
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Asiel Munyandinda?
A.	I know him.  He is our neighbour.
MR. SONGA:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
THE WITNESS:
That person is our neighbour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you stated that you learnt of the president's death in the night of the 7th of April. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you repeat the name, the full name of the person you mentioned in your last question.  Asiel --
MR. SONGA:
Asiel Munyandinda.  I was referring to Asiel Munyandinda.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  You may proceed now. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, let us refer to your question -- to your answer to a question regarding the date on which you learnt of the president's death.  You stated that you learnt about it on the night of the 7th of April.  We would therefore like to know whether it was in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April or the night of the 7th of April or on the night of the 8th of April.  That is clarification I would like you to make. 
A.	The president died on the 6th of April, but I learnt about it over the radio on the 7th of April, in the evening.  I do not remember the exact time.  I learnt about it over the radio.  It was said that 
President Habyarimana had died.  And after hearing that, the following day, that is the following morning, I went to Gishyita.  I saw people there, including Mika, who was opposite his house.  I went to buy beans and I went back to my home thereafter. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have no further questions for this witness in examination-in-chief.  

Madam Witness, I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Madam Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecutor on your right, to test the credibility of your statement given in evidence-in-chief.  

Madam Madenga, proceed with your cross-examination. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
            CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, a very good morning to you. 
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Madam Witness, I just want you to confirm a couple of things for me and to emphasise some of the things you have said in your evidence-in-chief.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ms. Madenga, before you proceed, shouldn't we enter the names of the person given on the pieces of paper? 
MR. SONGA:
Quite so, Madam President.  Thank you for reminding us. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The first name on the piece of paper is entered as Exhibit D. 51, to be kept under seal, and the second name would be Exhibit D. 52, under seal. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. 51 and D. 52 admitted, under seal)
   MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Madam Prosecutor, please proceed. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, in 1994, you said you knew Mika Muhimana as a conseiller de secteur and also as a neighbour. 
A.	I said that I knew Mika as a conseiller of Gishyita commune and as our neighbour.
Q.	Let's now talk about the sad events of the 8th of April 1994, the death of Mika's child.  Madam, you went to attend the funeral in your capacity as neighbour.  That is correct?
A.	When the child passed away, I went there because it was our neighbour and our conseiller.  The child passed away on the 8th and was buried on the 10th. 
Q.	Madam Witness, in that capacity were you there throughout the mourning period?  You indicated it was from the 8th of April 1994 to the 16th of April 1994. 
A.	I was present during the entire mourning period, up until the end.
Q.	Madam, is there any time when you left Mika's house during the mourning period?
A.	During the mourning period, we used to go there in the morning and return at 8 p.m. to go back there again the next morning.  So during the entire mourning period, I was present.  From the time the child died till the end of the mourning, I was present.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Now, I want you to assist me with this.  You indicated that on the 
7th of April 1994, you heard about the death --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry, Counsel, before you go on, I didn't get the answer to that question.  

Witness, you said you used to go in the morning and do what again?  Morning of the day?  What time did you say of the day you used to go there?
THE WITNESS:
Are you referring to when I used to go to Gishyita?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No.  When you used to go to Mika's house for mourning the death of his child. 
THE WITNESS:
I used to go to Mika's house during the mourning period from six o'clock in the morning, in the company of my mother.  We would arrive at six o'clock in the morning and we would return to our home at 8 p.m. or thereabouts. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, what did you do in 1994, April, from 8 to 16?  What was your profession during this period? 

THE WITNESS:
I did not have any occupation.  I was a student, but at some point in time, schools were closed.  I was not working.  I just went to buy things, and during the mourning period, we took part, as others did. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you say that you were a student? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter did not hear what Madam President said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you say you were a student during that period? 
THE WITNESS:
I said that I was in primary school in Rwanda. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And -- sorry, go ahead.  And you didn't do anything else apart from being a student.  You didn't engage in any other activity whilst you were a student?  
THE WITNESS:
I had no other occupation.  I told you that I used to go and buy things in the centre of Gishyita and that we took part in the funeral of Mika's child. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You used to go and buy things and then sell them or what?  Or you bought these things just for yourself? 
THE WITNESS:
I used to go and buy foodstuffs, such as beans or salt.  I did not buy to sell. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, please proceed. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honours. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Witness, you had just confirmed that the entire period of the mourning period you were at Mika's house; you did not leave Mika's place.  You are very religious.  You are said you went to attend the service on the 9th of April 1994; is that correct?
A.	This is not my statement.  I said that we used to go to Mika's place in the morning at about six and that we used to return at 8 p.m. to our home.  And I also said we went to church on the 9th.  And each day we used to pray.  We went to pray and we would go back home at about six p.m.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  I want you just to enlighten me on one thing.  You were a primary school pupil and you were spending the entire day at a funeral.  Is that part of the culture that also children of neighbours spend such time at funerals? 
A.	I told you that I went to the funeral in the company of my mother.
JUDGE SHORT:
Madam Witness, from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., what did you normally do in Mika's house? 
THE WITNESS:
We were in mourning.  We used to go to his house from six o'clock in the morning and we returned to our home at about 8 p.m.
JUDGE SHORT:
I mean during this period, did you just sit in one place or did you engage in any activity in the house?  What did you do in the house from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.?  What activities, if any, took place in the house during this entire period? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't do anything.  I was in the company of other people during this mourning period. 
JUDGE SHORT:
How many people were there during this period? 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot tell you how many people who were present, but I can say that there were many people. 
JUDGE SHORT:
How many people did you know who were present? 
THE WITNESS:
There were many people.  I cannot tell you whether such-and-such a person was there.  I cannot give you their names.  There were many people. 
JUDGE SHORT:
So there was no one there that you knew -- and you may want to write it on a piece of paper if you don't want to mention their names, but I want to know whether there was anyone there that you actually knew during this period. 
THE WITNESS:
I did not understand your question correctly. 
JUDGE SHORT:
My question was, from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., when you were in Mika's house, did you see anybody that you knew, and, if so, can you give us their name.  You could write the names on a piece of paper if you wish. 
THE WITNESS:
There were many people.  I did not seek to find out their names.  There were many people.  I was not able to find out their names.  There were very many people. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, were you a regular visitor to Mika's house before the death of his child? 
THE WITNESS:
When I was a pupil, I used to go and buy pens or candy in Mika's shop. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you ever visit his house? 
THE WITNESS:
I used to go to Mika's house either to buy exercise books, pens or candy.  Before the death of his son, I used to go to his house under the circumstances I have just indicated to you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you telling us that you never visited his house before the event of the death of his child? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that I used to go to his house, either to buy sweets or exercise books.  I was still a pupil. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, where was his shop? 
THE WITNESS:
He used to ply his trade near a Catholic church and next to this Catholic Church was his shop. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How far was his house from the church, Catholic Church? 
THE WITNESS:
It was a short distance, because from the church you would go up and get to this house where his shop was located. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you give us an estimate? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that the church was slightly above and from there you would arrive or reach the house where his shop was located.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And where was his home located; where he lived; where he slept? 
THE WITNESS:
His house was above his shop. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And were you mourning at the shop or mourning at the house? 
THE WITNESS:
The mourning was in his residence, his home. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you used to visit the residence before the death of the child? 
THE WITNESS:
I have stated that I used to go to his place to buy exercise books, candy and pens. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I've asked you whether you used to go to his residence before the time that the child died. 
THE WITNESS:
And I answered that I used to go to his home only to buy exercise books, pens and candy.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you telling us that you never visited his house? 
THE WITNESS:
I believe that I have given you all the necessary explanations.  I just used to go there to buy exercise books, pens or candy or sometimes beans and salt. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Madam Witness, did you used to go and buy these things from his shop or from his house? 
THE WITNESS:
I bought these things in his shop. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Madenga, please proceed. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you said at the funeral there were very many people. 
A.	Yes, there were many people during the funeral and during the mourning period.
Q.	Mika Muhimana was the conseiller of that secteur.  He was an influential person, so, naturally, other influential people attended the funeral. 
A.	I explained to you that he was conseiller of Gishyita secteur.  He knew the people he administered, so the people who were under his jurisdiction participated in his child's funeral. 
Q.	And on the same note, people like the bourgmestres of the commune, Charles Sikubwabo and Ruzindana, would also participate, wouldn't they?
A.	I did not see them there.
Q.	Let's move on to Mika's household.  You said you visited Mika, as a customer, buying from the shop and not going to the house, isn't it?
A.	I told you that I used to go to Mika's house or to Mika's place to buy foodstuffs and I also went to his home when his child died and during the mourning period. 
Q.	So before the mourning period, when you spent a week at Mika's place, you would not know exactly what was happening in Mika's household, would you?
A.	Before the period of mourning, I used to go to Gishyita to buy things.  I used to go to the market.  I could see what has happening in the market and in Gishyita because I went to the centre of Gishyita, and sometimes I went there when I was taking a walk. 
Q.	You indicated that you did not know Esperanza (sic).  So if it's alleged that Mika Muhimana raped Esperanza, you would not know because, one, you were not there, and, secondly, you did not know Esperanza, would you?
A.	How would I not have heard of that?  Because I used to go to the centre -- it did not take place, because I used to go to the centre of Gishyita.
Q.	At the centre did people discuss rape?
A.	I never heard about anybody raping anyone else and I was not a witness to that.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Let's move on to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s children.  You indicated that they were killed by, among other people, Mugonero, Burabyo, Mutagana and Gasigwa; is that correct?
A.	I said that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s children were killed by Burabyo, his younger brother, Gasigwa, Mugonero and Mutagana.  I do not know of any other people who participated in this murder.  It is only those whose names I gave you that I know about. 
Q.	Madam, did you personally witness the murder of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s children by the people you have indicated?
A.	I was witness. 
Q.	Which of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s children was killed first, since you were a personal witness to the murder?
A.	I can't tell you.  I could see the killers taking a child, killing him and throwing him into a common grave, but I cannot tell you who was killed first. 
Q.	Since you were then a small child, it was traumatising to personally witness people being killed; is that not correct?
A.	I was not a child.  I was 15 years old.  I could not be traumatised.  I was a witness to these events.  I saw these things.  It is not someone who told me about it.  I was witness to these events. 
Q.	Thank you, madam, for your bravery.  You can assist me.  You were there the entire murdering period when all the children were murdered?
A.	Yes, I was there.  I was a witness to the killing of all these children.
Q.	Whilst you were personally witnessing the murder of the children, did you have an opportunity to count and recognise every person who was present at the scene of the murder?
A.	I was not able to count all the persons who were there.  I have told you about the people that I recognised and who killed these children.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  You were not able to recognise or count people who were at the scene of the murder.  So if Mika Muhimana was there, you would not have recognised that he was there because you were personally looking at the details of the murder, isn't it?
A.	If Mika was present, I would have recognised because I knew him.  Also, he was the conseiller of our secteur.  I would have been able to recognise him because I know him.  I was able to recognise the people who were there because they were our neighbours, that is, those who killed these children.  I did not see Mika at that place.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, where was the killing done? 
THE WITNESS:
The killing of these children took place in our secteur.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where in your secteur?  At which point? 
THE WITNESS:
In Rutuna.  It took place in Rutuna.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Rutuna, where in Rutuna? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that these events, the killing of these children, took place in Rutuna cellule.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And I asked you where.  Where?  Inside the house?  In the forest?  In the field?  On the road, or where?
THE WITNESS:
Those children were killed at Damascène's place.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
At which place? 
THE WITNESS:
At Damascène's place.  Those children were killed in Damascène's house.  That is in the house of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)'s father.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Inside the house or outside the house? 
THE WITNESS:
They were killed outside the house.  Damascène's wife was killed inside the house because Damascène said, "Don't kill my wife outside the house.  Kill her inside."  As for the children, they were killed outside the house and they were thrown in a pit that was not far from the house.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, what --
THE WITNESS:
Their bodies were thrown into a pit. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were you alone or with somebody else? 
THE WITNESS:
When those children were killed, I wasn't alone at that place.  I was in the company of other persons. 

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which other persons? 
THE WITNESS:
I was there with my elder sister.  We were witness to the killing of those children.  There are many other people who had come to witness that. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What were you doing there?  Why had you gone there? 
THE WITNESS:
We heard screams, and the murderers were shouting, and we ran there to see what was happening.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And how long did it take? 
THE WITNESS:
After having killed the children, the murderers went up, killed the second wife of Damascène and then they killed Nyirabindamana's wife, Aphrodis's wife, called Nyirahabimana; they killed Mpabuka's wife, and Mpabuka shouted, "Don't kill my wife outside."  But they killed her outside.  And then they went up and I didn't follow them to know exactly what happened subsequently.  So after having killed Damascène's wife, Mpabuka's wife, I went back home.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
After how long -- how long did all this take?  One hour?  Ten minutes?  Half an hour?  Two days? 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot estimate the duration of those events, but they did quite take some time.  It would be impossible for me to tell how long it took them.  It didn't take days, but I cannot estimate the time.  It took some hours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you said that you were attracted to the site when you heard the screams.  How far was your house from the house of Damasinga (sic)?
THE WITNESS:
The distance was short.  A person could be at Damascène's place and call out to somebody from my house and you would understand, and vice versa.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you give us the estimated distance? 
THE WITNESS:
I can't tell the distance in terms of metres, but anybody at Damascène's place could call out to somebody at my place -- at my place, and vice versa.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And how far was Mika's place from your place? 

THE WITNESS:
There was a short distance that could be covered in 20 minutes trekking.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And could someone hear shouts from that house?  At Mika's house? 
THE WITNESS:
If you were at a higher distance, a higher place, say at Subukina (phonetic), you could hear the screams or shouts of the persons who were talking aloud. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And those people --
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that from Mika's place up to my place there was a distance that  could be covered in 20 minutes walking.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Those people who were there with you, were they men, children, women?  Or what kind of people were there with you? 
THE WITNESS:
Which place are you talking about, Your Honour?  Do you want to know where those children were killed or at Mika's place? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where the children were killed. 
THE WITNESS:
There were many people where those children were killed.  There were women; there were men; there were younger persons; there were very many people. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did any of them stop the killers or attempt to stop the killers? 
THE WITNESS:
Those assailants made themselves to be called Intigamba; they were armed with machetes and clubs, and nobody could stop them, you know, from killing the children, because they would be killed in turn, because those assailants had clubs and machetes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I am asking you, did anybody attempt to stop them? 
THE WITNESS:
And I answered that those killers were attacking just about anybody, and they would attack anybody that would try to stop them from killing the children because they were armed with clubs or machetes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, could you tell us with which arm the children were killed, whether it was machetes or a club? 
THE WITNESS:
The killers were equipped with machetes and clubs, so they killed the children with machetes and clubs.  That is the weapons that they had with them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you tell us which of the assailants struck the children first? 
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that those killers were armed with machetes and clubs, so they used those machetes and clubs to kill them. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you yourself not run away? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  We watched that event up until the end, that is after the children and the women had been killed, and then the killers went up and killed Mpabuka's wife, and it is after that killing that I went back home. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you not fear that you might be killed? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I wasn't scared, because the killers were attacking the children.  I wasn't a target.  We were there to see what they were doing, and I wasn't a child to be scared.  How can a child of 15 years of age be afraid of people?  I was witnessing what was being done. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You were not a target.  How did you know you were not a target? 
THE WITNESS:
They killed those children because they were the ones who were targeted.  If I were a target of the killers, they would have found me at home to kill me.  They killed those children, their mother, as well as Mpabuka's wife.  I went home, and if I had been a target, they would have followed me right to my house to kill me.  So I went home, and if I were a target, they would have followed me to kill me.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, how did you know you were not a target?  Did anybody tell you, "You are not a target; don't worry"?
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that I witnessed those killings, and if I had been a target, I would have been killed along with the children.  So after having killed the children and the women, they went up, so if I had been their target, they would have killed me immediately.  So I went home without being concerned. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I am asking you, how did you know that you were not a target so that you don't have to run away? 

JUDGE SHORT:
If I may add, do you know why those children were targets? 
THE WITNESS:
I have answered you that those children had been brought by their mother to their father's place, Damascène.  These were -- these young men who called themselves Intigamba came to Damascène's place, and they killed those children.  Having killed them, they killed their grandmother, Neza (phonetic); then they killed Damascène's second wife, and then killed Aphrodis's wife, and they killed Mpabuka's wife, whose name was Tamar.  I wasn't present there.  And if they had wanted to kill me, they would have killed me.
JUDGE SHORT:
Why did all these killings take place?  Do you or do you not know? 
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that those children were killed before my eyes.  Their grandmother was killed before me as well as the women in that area.  I was present. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Madenga, please proceed. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you were not a target during genocide, were you?
A.	I have told you that those children were killed as well as the women of that locality.  If I had been a target of the killer, they would have killed me because I was near them.  I was present.  I have explained to you several times, and I have told you the people who were killed and how the killers went away.  I explained all this to you. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  You were not targeted because you were Hutu; is that not so?
A.	That is what I have explained to you on several occasions.  I told you that I was near the killers and I was seeing all that they were doing, and I explained to you that those women were killed before me and the killers went up and went away and we went back home.  If they had wanted to kill me, or to kill us, they would have killed us, and I have explained this to you several times. 
Q.	And in addition to you being Hutu, you also did not have a close relative who was Tutsi, like your father or mother; is that not so?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam Prosecutor, can you repeat your question for the interpreter?
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you.  I will repeat the question.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	The question is, in addition to you being Hutu, your parents were also Hutu, so you were not specifically targeted during the genocide.
MS. MADENGA:
I did not get a response to that question.  Is it the translation? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't quite understand your question, Madam Prosecutor. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Let's move on.  I will ask another question.  If those people who were targeted say they were raped, for example, the mother of the children who were murdered, if that person says they were raped, would you deny that?
A.	I was never witness to a rape.
Q.	Madam, the fact that you did not personally witness the rape does not mean those who were targeted were not raped, does it?
A.	In our locality, I was never a witness to rape.  That never happened in the Gishyita commune.  I do not know any case of rape.  Nobody was raped. 
Q.	Let's move on, madam.  In terms of the time in relation to the death of the president, when were these children murdered? 
A.	The president died in April and those children were killed in May. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Let's move on to another area.  I have a couple of names I want you to identify and tell me the relationship.  But before we go to that area, I am interested to know how did you become a witness in this case? 
A.	This is how I became a witness in this trial.  There are people who came to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  I was living at (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) in my brother's house.  Two men came where I was and they asked me questions to which I answered, and I saw them taking down notes, and then later they went away.  I did not sign any statement whatsoever and I did not read the statement that I had made either.  So after taking down notes, those people went away and they said if they would need me, they were going to let me know.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the witness in the answer mentioned the name of a locality.  May that be expunged from the record. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Did the person subsequently come back to you?
A.	I saw those people only once.  They never came back to see me again.
Q.	You indicated that there was a person who was taking down notes.  Do you remember the name of that person?
A.	I am the person who was making a statement.  There was no other person near me, and those people took down notes.  I don't know what they wrote.  I didn't even read the statement.  There was a tall person, dark in colour, and near him was another person, but I don't know their names, but I see one of those persons on that side.  You can ask him his name.  I see on the other side, on the Defence bench, one of the persons.  You can ask him his name. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, I think the witness is referring to my colleague from the Defence team, Leopold. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam, just to confirm, could you actually identify the person you are referring to so that we have a correct record.
A.	I am seeing that person there.  He is the person wearing glasses.  He's quite big.  He is tall, and he is more or less light in complexion.  I don't know his name.  You can ask him his name.  That was the first time I was seeing that person.  So you can ask him to tell you his name.  It's the person I am seeing on that other side.  You can ask him the question because I don't know his name.  He didn't give me his name. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
Is it apparent?  I think the witness is not referring to the person I had indicated.  So maybe if the record can now reflect the proper person. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Who is the proper person?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who is the proper person?
JUDGE SHORT:
Can you get her to identify the person.  She said that the person is wearing spectacles in the first row.  And starting from her left, which one is it?
THE WITNESS:
I am seeing that person very well.  From the person who is right in front of me, the second person coming after the person closer to me is the person.  The person is laughing and looking at me, so he is the second person starting.  Well, the person I am seeing is the person who came with that other person. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it the person who was asking you questions? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he is the one who asked me the questions before, so he is the second person on the Defence bench.  If I am not mistaken, I think it is the same person.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, she is referring to you. 

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I am asking you, the person who has been asking you questions today, before the lady started asking questions, is he the one who spoke to you that time and wrote down whatever you have said he wrote down, or is it another person? 
THE WITNESS:
I am telling you that he is the person, the person who is second, second person on the Defence bench. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Overlapping microphones)
THE WITNESS:
I can see that person on the second row.  The person is wearing glasses.  He is dark in colour, and that is the person who came to see me in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), and he was in the company of another person. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that the person who was standing?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is that person who is standing now. 
MR. SONGA:
It is possible, Madam President, that I am the one she's referring to. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam Witness. 

With the assistance of registry, if I could just show the witness a name on this piece of paper.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you please look at that piece of paper.  I just want you to read it, but don't read it loudly, because it might jeopardise the security of that person.  Are you able to read the name which I have just written?  
A.	Yes, I have been able to read the name.
Q.	Do you know that person?
A.	I do not know the person who bears that name. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, with your leave, I would like to tender that name as the --
THE WITNESS:
But it is quite possible that I didn't read the name well.  I would request that somebody helps me read it.  I would like somebody to assist me in reading the name. 

MS. MADENGA:
Can we please have the assistance of the Kinyarwanda interpreter to help the witness in reading of the name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Interpreter, please assist the witness with the reading of the name. 
THE WITNESS:
I have a question I would like to ask you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you speak --
JUDGE SHORT:
Into the microphone.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The witness would like to go and ease herself. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Can she answer the question first? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Have you read the name to her? 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The witness would like, first of all, to ease herself before coming to answer the question.
JUDGE SHORT:
 Please, have you read the name to her?
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, what I understand the position to be --
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, I have read the name to her.
JUDGE SHORT:
Madam Witness, do you know that name? 
THE WITNESS:
I will answer that question after having putting herself at ease.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Answer the question.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Answer now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Say yes or no.  Just say yes or no. 
THE WITNESS:
I know a person who bears that name.  I know three persons who bear that name.  I know three persons who are called by that name.  I did not know which of the three you are alluding to, but before we proceed, I would like to go and ease myself.  I know about three persons who bear the same name.  But I would like, please, for you to let me go and ease myself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We'll take a short break for 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed at 1101H)
(Pages 1 to 27 by S. Eboe-Osuji)































58(Court resumed at 1137H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is resumed.  

Madam Madenga, please continue with your cross-examination.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Before I continue, I just want to advise Your Honours that I have placed before you three documents, and copies are given to the Defence, which I am likely to use during the course of the brief cross-examination.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, welcome back.  Before we left for the break, you had identified the name I had written on a piece of paper.  You had also indicated that you know about three people who bear the same first name and surname.  My question is, your brother is one of the three persons; is that correct?
A.	I have a brother who bears the same names.
Q.	Thank you, very much, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Madam President, I'd like to tender that name as the next Prosecution exhibit, which will be Prosecution exhibit No. 38.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is entered as Exhibit P.  38, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 38 admitted, under seal)
 BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can we go ahead and look at the next piece of paper.  It also bears two names.  It's written No. 2.  
MS. MADENGA:
     Can I please get the assistance of the Kinyarwandan interpreter?
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you will be assisted by a Kinyarwandan interpreter to read that name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, are you able to read the name on sheet No. 2? 
THE WITNESS:
I can read the name.  I've already read it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Do you know the person who appears to that piece of paper?
A.	I do not know this person because they are names that resemble each other, that are similar, so I do not know whom you are alluding to.  I know about ten people who bear this same name and I do not know to which of these persons you are referring.  I know many people who have this name.
Q.	It's possible, Madam Witness, but is one of those people, the 10 people, your own brother?
A.	I have the feeling that I know all of these names.  I do not have any brother who bears this name.  I told you about a brother who bears the name that we referred to earlier.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honours, I would like to tender that piece of paper with the name as the next Prosecution exhibit, which will be Prosecution exhibit 39.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So entered and admitted as Exhibit P. 39, to be kept under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 39 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, proceed.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, the last sheet of paper bears two names, the first name and the surname.  It's numbered three for ease of reference.  Since you are able to read, can you identify that person with that first name and the surname?  I just want you to confirm the relationship between that person and yourself.  How are you related to the person whose name is written on the piece of paper No. 3?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you read the name on paper No. 3? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have read the name.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	What is the relationship between you and the person who bears that name?
A.	There is no link between me and this person whose name appears on this document.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honours, with your leave, can I tender that piece of paper as Prosecution exhibit 40?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sheet No. 3 with the name of a person is entered as P. 40, to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 40 admitted, under seal)
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Lastly, Madam Witness, you come from a beautiful country, Rwanda.  It's beautiful; you agree?
A.	I did not understand your question.
Q.	I said Rwanda is a beautiful country and that is where you come from.
A.	Yes, beautiful country.  Yes, I come from there.  I know Rwanda.  That is where I come from.
Q.	Presently, why are you not staying in that beautiful country where you come from?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that a fair question? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know whether this country is still beautiful because I left it a long time ago.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please proceed.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honours.  I have no further questions.  

Thank you very much, Madam Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, any re-examination? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President, just for one matter.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like to put a question to you: when you told us about the children of somebody who were killed in your presence, do you have any knowledge of the ethnic group to which their father belonged?
A.	Regarding the father of these children, I believe he was said to be Tutsi.
Q.	Could the children also have been considered to be Tutsi?
A.	Considering that their father was -- is Tutsi, I cannot tell you whether these children were Tutsi or Hutu.  Their mother was Hutu; their father Tutsi, but tribal affiliation is transmitted through the father.
Q.	Thank you.  I believe I also understood that other women were killed.  Which women were killed, from which ethnic group?
A.	The women who were killed were the Tutsi women who were married to Hutus.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my re-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Madam Witness, I'd wish you to assist me with one or two questions.  You remember the mourning period between -- in respect of Mika Muhimana's child, which extended, as you say, from 8th of April to 15th April, do you remember that period -- 16th of April?
THE WITNESS:
I told you that Mika's child died on the 8th and that his remains were kept till Saturday.  Considering that Mika was an Adventist, he couldn't bury his child on Saturday, so they waited to the 10th to bury the child.  It was on the 10th.  The funeral began on the 11th -- the mourning began on the 11th, sorry, and it ended on the 16th of April.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, during that period, you and your mother went to Mika's home every day at 6 o'clock in the morning and left at 8 p.m. in the evening; is that your evidence?
THE WITNESS:
We used to go to his home each day from 8 o'clock in the morning to 6 p.m.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Apart from you, there were many other people; is that your evidence -- also attending the mourning? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that I used to go there with my mother and there were many other people that we found there.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The interpreter corrects.  The interpreter had said, or the witness had said before that she used to go to Mika's house between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
JUDGE MUTHOGA: 
6 p.m.? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
6 a.m. sorry, and 8 p.m., not 6 p.m. as was previously said.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
6 a.m. and 8 p.m., that is the period we are dealing with, the whole of the daytime period. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that we used to go to this family at 6:00 in the morning and we would leave at about 8 p.m. from the time that this child died to the time when the mourning period was over.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And that apart from you, there were a lot  -- many other people.
THE WITNESS: 
I met other people.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
During that period, did you hear of any attacks on anybody in Gishyita? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not witness any attacks and I didn't hear any talk of them and I was present in the centre of Gishyita every day.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you would be able to say -- to affirm conclusively that there were no people killed or attacked during that period in Gishyita centre or area. 
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that I was not a witness to any attacks in Gishyita and in our region.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you have also told us -- if it is not so, please correct -- that you knew Charles Sikubwabo.  You knew him?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, he was a bourgmestre of Gishyita commune.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you see him any time between the 8th and the 16th?
THE WITNESS:
I did not see him at the place where the funeral was taking place.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did you see Ruzindana? 
THE WITNESS:
I did not see him at this place.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You did not see him at this place.  That's all.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, was it tradition in the region that the entire period of mourning had to be attended by the neighbourhood?
THE WITNESS:
In Rwandan culture, when someone loses a child and he's your neighbour, the entire neighbourhood goes there to support the person, the bereaved family.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the entire neighbourhood of the area was present during that period, say, from 8th to 16th of April from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
I told you that my mother and I used to go there at 6 a.m. and we used to return home at 8 p.m., but I do not know when the other people came to and left that place.  I can only tell you about what my mother and I did.
JUDGE SHORT:
You didn't see whether any of the other people left the house during this period from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that my mother and I used to go to this place at 6 a.m. and we left it at 8 p.m..  I did not pay attention to the various times at which other people arrived and left.  We arrived at 6 a.m. and we left at -- 6 a.m., and we left at 8 p.m., so I have nothing to do -- no idea when people arrived and left this place.
JUDGE SHORT:
Between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m., did you ever return to your house and then come back, or you were continuously in Mika's house from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.?
THE WITNESS:
When we got there at 6 a.m. to leave at 8 p.m., I stayed at this place continuously.  We used to go there at 6 a.m. and we left at 8 p.m.  I didn't move and I just waited for the time to leave at 8 p.m.
JUDGE SHORT:
How did you eat?  Were you fed by Mika's family? 
THE WITNESS:
In Mika's house, when there was cooking, or when food was cooked, those who wished to eat would do so.  We didn't go back home to eat.  When there was food, we could eat and wait for the time when we would go back home.
JUDGE SHORT:
So who did the cooking for all these guests? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know who used to do the cooking.  When food was provided, I ate.  I didn't worry about who had done the cooking.  At some time or another I would see Mika's wife bring food or other women whom I did not know.  I just limited myself to eating, that's all.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you help with the cooking? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not help them.  I just ate.  I did not set the table and I did not cook.
JUDGE SHORT:
And this food was provided for all the guests? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't pay attention to whether everybody had eaten or everybody was eating.  I just minded my own business, but perhaps people found a way of eating.  When food was brought, I ate, and I waited for the time to go home.  I don't know whether the other people ate or not.
JUDGE SHORT:
How many rooms are there in Mika's house?
THE WITNESS:
I do not know how many rooms there were in Mika's house.  We were in the living room.  I don't know how many rooms there were in Mika's house.  You can not know the number of rooms in a person's house if you haven't visited it.  I did not visit the house to be able to determine how many rooms it had.  I just stayed sitting in the living room.
JUDGE SHORT:
All the guests were constantly in the living room throughout the period? 
THE WITNESS:
I used to meet people sitting in the living room.  If there were people who were sitting in the rooms, I do not know of it, but I stayed in the living room with the people whom I saw around me.
JUDGE SHORT:
Prior to this mourning period, did your family have any relationship whatsoever with the Mika family? 
THE WITNESS:
There was no relationship between my family and Mika's family.  I know Mika as our conseiller and as our neighbour.  There was no relationship between my mother, nor between he and my father.  He was just my neighbour.
JUDGE SHORT:
How many neighbours do you have? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't quite understand your question.
JUDGE SHORT:
You said all the neighbours -- it was a custom that all the neighbours would attend a funeral if someone had a funeral.  How many neighbours attended this funeral? 
THE WITNESS:
There were many neighbours.  I cannot say the exact number thereof.  There were many of them.
JUDGE SHORT:
And finally, is it still your evidence that you never recognised any of the neighbours at the funeral? 
THE WITNESS:
I used to go there with my mother.  I knew what was my business, and as for my mother, I can't tell if this or that person attended.
JUDGE SHORT:
Just one last question.  Now, all the evidence you have given to this Court today, did you tell the person who you identified in court this morning as the person who interviewed you and took down your statement, did you give all this evidence to that person? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that two men came to see me.  They looked for me, they found me, and after finding me they asked the questions to which I answered to the best of my knowledge.  I did not sign my statement.
JUDGE SHORT:
Madam Witness, that was not my question.  My question is: the evidence that you have given today, did you tell them everything that you have told us today? 
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that those men came, met me, asked me questions.  I provided the answers to the questions and I couldn't read what they were writing down, and I did not sign my statement.  I did not read the statement, either.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But did you -- when you talked to them, how long did you take talking to them?
THE WITNESS:
I can't say how many hours or how many minutes we took, but it took us quite a while.  They asked me questions and I answered, and then they left.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And, for example, did you tell them about your being at the mourning the whole time? 
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that he met me and committed to paper what I stated, but I didn't sign the statement.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you, did you tell them -- not whether you signed the statement.  Did you tell them, for example, that you were, for those eight days, you were in Mika's house?  Did you tell them that you were there when the children were killed?  Did you tell them that other women were also killed?  Did you tell them all those things? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that he came to see me, he asked me questions and he was writing down my answers.  I did not read what he had written.  I didn't even read the statement, nor sign it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is the fifth time you are answering that question.  That is not what I'm asking you.  I'm asking you, when you talked with them, did you tell them about Mika's child dying, about the mourning, the whole of that week, about the killing of the child in that house and that you were there and you saw it happen?  Did you tell them all those things?  That's what I'm asking you -- whether you told them, not whether they wrote it down, whether you told them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, just answer the question asked.
THE WITNESS:
The person who was asking me questions is here present and you can ask him what he asked me and have clarification as to the questions that he asked me.  I did not read my statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this brings us to the end of your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you a very safe journey home.

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness to the exit door.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please call in the next witness. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, can I crave your indulgence?  We believe that the name of the next witness is somewhat familiar to us.  

In that regard, can I ask my learned friend to confirm to the Court whether or not this person has indeed testified in a previous trial in this Tribunal, and if so, what his or her pseudonym was in that trial, and when this person testified, because we don't have that disclosure from them and we have reasons to believe that this person has, indeed, testified in the Ntakirutimana trial.  

I'm grateful, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, what's your response? 
MR. SONGA:
I also think that she testified in the Ntakirutimana case.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Under which pseudonym? 
MR. SONGA:
I will try to see if we can verify that, Madam President.

I have been told, Madam President, that she was witness No. 7 in the Ntakirutimana case.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Under which pseudonym? 
MR. SONGA:
From our available information, there was no pseudonym.  There were no pseudonyms, they only had numbers.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's correct, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, do you have transcripts of her testimony?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you have not disclosed the transcripts of the statement of the witness in the said case, neither to the Defence (sic), nor to the bench.
MR. SONGA:
No, we did not have them.  Probably they can be found in the computers, but we don't have them because we didn't intend to use them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, Professor.  Proceed, please, with your evidence-in-chief.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I wonder if you have already fulfilled the usual procedure for the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, Professor.  

Good morning, Madam Witness -- good afternoon.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you are a protected witness.  You will be referred to as Witness TQ7.  You also avoid mentioning your name, the name of your parents or the name of your locality.  

Now you will be sworn in to speak the truth.  
(Declaration made by Witness TQ7 in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you have a sheet called "Protected information" in front of you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the document before me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read the document?  Can you read the particulars mentioned in the document? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm that the personal information given in the sheet in front of you is correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do confirm it, only there is a typing error therein.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Typing error in which line? 
THE WITNESS:
Somewhere it is mentioned "******".  Rather it is ******.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's a spelling mistake.  It's only a spelling mistake.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that's the only mistake that I have taken note of.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you verify your signature at the bottom of the page? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it is my signature.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This document is entered and admitted as D. 53, to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 53 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please lead your witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
WITNESS TQ7,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	I'm going to ask you a number of questions, the first of which is as follows: under which circumstances did you learn of the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	I learnt the news from the radio.
Q.	What day was that?
A.	It was in the morning of 7th April.
Q.	Were you at the same address as the one that is found on the sheet of paper before you?
A.	Yes, I was at the same address.
Q.	Did you remain at the same address during the period of the events of Rwanda, that is from April to June 1994?
A.	Yes, I remained at the same address.
Q.	What was the security situation where you used to live?
A.	There was insecurity where I used to live, and sometimes security.  It is true that there wasn't enough security.
Q.	Were you carrying out any activity?
A.	Yes, I was working.
Q.	And during the month of April, May and June were you still working?
A.	I worked in the month of April and at a certain point I stopped working, and only took up duties again in May and June.
Q.	Do you recall the time at which you stopped working?
A.	I stopped working on the 11th of April and it was in the morning.
Q.	When you stopped working, did you move away from your place of work?
A.	Yes, that was the case.  I left my secteur to go to another, but I remained in the same commune.
Q.	Did you know Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances you knew him?
A.	I knew him because he has a small shop and he was the conseiller of the Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Did you know him for a long time prior to the April events?
A.	I had known him for a long time.
Q.	Did you have any family ties?
A.	No, there is no family relationship between us.
Q.	You mentioned the date of 11th April.  Is it true that it is on that date that you stopped work?
A.	Yes, as far as I'm concerned, I stopped working on that date, but subsequently I resumed work.
Q.	What was the situation prevailing in your place of work when you left it?
A.	When I left my place of work, things were still calm.  People were coming to take refuge at the ***************  There weren't many problems, but there wasn't much security either.
Q.	How many refugees were at ********** on that day of 11th April?
A.	I can't tell the number of refugees because there were many people there and they were dispersed here and there.  I wasn't in a position to know the number, but what I know is that there were many of them.
Q.	Can we say that ************* was crowded?
A.	When I left *****************, there were many people.  The rooms were full and there were people who were not working at ***********, but who were there.
MR. SONGA:
I hope, Madam President, that when we mention ************, there is no confusion, because it's the same ********** that is mentioned in the identification document, and the witness was working there in 1994.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In your region, did you know a person called Gafurafura?
A.	I knew a pastor who was called Gafurafura, but during the events, he died.
Q.	Did he die during the events or prior to the events?
A.	He died well before the events.
Q.	Can you also recall where he used to live?
A.	Yes, I do remember.  Before his death he used to live in the buildings that was housed -- that housed the pastors in the Ngoma area, but after his death the members of his family went to Gishyita where he had a house.
Q.	When you talk about the members of his family, who is it you are thinking of?
A.	I am thinking of his wife and of his children.
Q.	Did you know the name of his wife?
A.	I have forgotten his wife's name, but I think she was called Keziya.  I've forgotten the other name.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  What about his children?  Did you know how many of them were there?
A.	I knew his children who were of my age or others who were working.  As for the others, who did not live in the same circles as myself, I know either their first names, but not the others.
Q.	Can you tell us about them?
A.	I am going to begin with his daughters.  He had a daughter, an elder daughter who was called Nyirahabimana, Martha.  He has another daughter who was older than myself who was called Mukeshimana, Marie, and another, Nirere, Madeline.  

As concerns his sons, I know a certain Habimana, Jerome, who was the director of my school, the school I used to attend.  I also know Emmanuel.  I knew Pierre, and there is another who was older than the others and who was called Mathias.  As for the others, I don't quite remember their names exactly.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like you to grant me leave to ascertain something with my collaborators.  I will take just a minute, thank you.

Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you gave the names of the children of Gafurafura.  Did the children bear the name of their father?
A.	Each of those children had his or her own name.  In our region, it wasn't usual for children to bear the same name as their parents.
Q.	If I understand you well, and strictly speaking, there was, therefore, for instance, no Martha Gafurafura?
A.	No, there was no Martha Gafurafura.
Q.	And we can say the same in respect of Maria Gafurafura?
A.	No.  I gave you her name.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Martha  Nyirahabimana; what was her occupation in April 1994?
A.	In April 1994, Martha was a nurse in the Mugonero hospital, but during that month she wasn't present.
Q.	And why wasn't she?
A.	She had gone to take part at training in a place called Kabgayi.
Q.	How did you know that she had gone to Kabgayi?  K-A-B-G-A-Y-I.  How did you know that she had gone to Kabgayi?
A.	I learnt about this ****************************************************************************, and after each *****************************************, and there are some who used to give information.  For instance, they talked about **********************************************************, and we needed to see each of notices, and it is under these circumstances that I learnt that Martha had gone along with others for training in Kabgayi.
Q.	Before going for training in Kabgayi, what was she doing?
A.	She was a nurse in the hospital.
Q.	Can you recall what was her age in April 1994?
A.	I cannot remember her age then, but I can give an estimate of her age.  She was older than me.  Besides, she had taught me and she had children that were of a certain age, so if I do some calculations, she was approximately 40 years of age.
Q.	You state that she had children; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  She had two children.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, please, who are we talking about?  Sorry, I was slightly distracted.
MR. SONGA:
My pleasure, Your Honour.  I was asking her questions concerning Gafurafura's daughter who was called Martha Nyirahabimana, and so after asking her what she used to do, I asked her what was her age in April 1994.
JUDGE SHORT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can you confirm, Madam Witness, that at that time she was more or less 40 years of age?
A.	I can confirm that.  I made that estimate considering how I knew her and the children that she had and the age at which she got married.
Q.	Do you also confirm that she had two children?
A.	Yes, I so confirm she had two children.
Q.	Are you in a position to tell us the age of each of her children?
A.	It would be difficult for me to give you the exact age of each of the children, but I can give you an estimate.  Her elder child was about 12 years of age and the younger one was about 10 years of age or a little less than that.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Was she married?
A.	I never attended her marriage.  I never saw her husband, so I cannot state that she was married.
Q.	Thank you.  And if I were to put to you that in April 1994, Nyirahabimana, Martha, was raped, what would you say to that?
A.	Well, I don't know whether the response I'll give would be complete, but if we go by the way you have asked that question, I cannot state that she was a victim of an act of rape, and if that had been the case, she might have been raped outside of Mugonero and not in Mugonero.
Q.	Thank you, you're right.  My question was not as precise as I would have wished, and if I were to state to you that in April she was raped in Gishyita, what would be your reaction?
A.	I cannot confirm that either because I know that she was not in Mugonero.  She was not in Gishyita, either.
Q.	Could one -- and I'm rephrasing my question -- what was the distance between Gishyita and Kabgayi, roughly?
A.	There was several kilometres because you had to go from one préfecture to another.  I am not in a position to give you the exact number of kilometres between the two locations, but it was a long distance.
Q.	Could it be 50 kilometres?
A.	It is more than 50 kilometres because it is quite far.
Q.	Could it be 100 kilometres?
A.	It is more than 100 kilometres.
Q.	Could it be 150 kilometres?
A.	Well, if I were to take the risk of stating that it was 150 kilometres or more, I would be speculating.  What I know is that it was a distance of more than 150 kilometres -- more than 100 kilometres.
Q.	And if I were to put it to you that Martha Nyirahabimana was never raped in April in Gishyita, would you be ready to confirm that?
A.	I can confirm that.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I am not sure I heard your response in its entirety.  I believe you mentioned the name of another girl known as Gafurafura; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I mentioned that name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Is it Maria Mukeshimana that you made mention of?
A.	Yes, I mentioned that name.  You're right.
Q.	Was she indeed Gafurafura's second daughter?
A.	You are right.
Q.	Was she younger than Martha Nyirahabimana?
A.	You are right.
Q.	Do you have an idea as to her age in April 1994?
A.	If I were to make an estimate, I would say that she was roughly 29 years old.
Q.	Can you tell us what she did for a living?
A.	In my opinion, she wasn't working.
Q.	Could you tell us whether she was in Gishyita in April 1994?
A.	Since I did not see Maria in Gishyita in April, and she wasn't resident in Gishyita, but rather in Kigali with her brother, I cannot assert that she was in Gishyita in April 1994.
Q.	If I understood what you said, could you confirm that she lived with her brother in Kigali?  Can you confirm that fact?
A.	Yes, I can confirm that because I know that she was residing in her brother's house in Kigali, and since I did not see her in Gishyita during that period, I confirm that fact.
Q.	And if someone were to tell you that she was raped in Gishyita in April, that would be a lie?
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor --
THE WITNESS: 
As far as I'm concerned, I would say that it is a lie.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, this is your witness, and the way you are putting your questions, they are extremely leading, suggesting to her that if somebody were to say she was raped, "it would be a lie".  What kind of answer do you expect her to give? 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, I did not say "if a person".  I gave a name.  I named that person.
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, but you did suggest to her that it will be a lie if it was said that that person raped her.  Why don't you just ask her what her reaction would be if she heard -- if that statement was made?  Why suggest to her that it would be a lie? 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I believe the way you have phrased the question is better.  With your permission, I will rephrase it then.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, if someone were to state that Maria Mukeshimana was raped in Gishyita in April 1994, what would your reaction be?
A.	My first reaction is this: I would say that Maria was not there in Gishyita, and consequently, she could not have been raped in that area because she was not there.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I believe you also made mention of a third name, a girl, the daughter of Garurafura.  If I understood you correctly, was it Madeline Nirere?
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.
Q.	Thank you.  Very well, then.  Was she the youngest of the three children?
A.	Yes, she was the youngest child of the family.
Q.	What did she do for a living?
A.	She was unemployed.
Q.	Do you have an idea what her age was?
A.	She was roughly 26 years of age.
Q.	Do you know where she was in April 1994?
A.	She was living with her mother, as far as I know, and she lived in Gishyita very close to the commune office.  However, I didn't see her in April 1994.  As such, I am unable to say where she was during that period.
Q.	Very well, then.  Madam Witness, in your area did you, perchance, know a girl by the name of Josiane?
A.	In our region there were many girls by the name Josiane.  By the way, in the Mugonero school complex, there was a girl whose first name was Josiane.
Q.	Did you hear of that girl called Josiane in April 1994?
A.	Regarding the one I have made mention of who was in the Mugonero complex, in April 1994 she was in Mugonero.
Q.	Let us continue talking about that Josiane.  Do you know her other names?
A.	Josiane had two first names.  She also had a family name.  If my memory serves me right, her name was Josiane Mukeshimana at the time, but prior to that, she had another first name.
Q.	When you state that prior to that she had another first name, do you remember that other first name?
A.	Yes, I remember that first name.  She attended the same school with me.  The other first name was Janet, so her name was Janet Mukeshimana.
Q.	Did you know her parents?
A.	I knew her two parents.
Q.	Can you please give us their names?
A.	Her father's name was Amos Karera.  However, I cannot remember her mother's name, but I can very well remember her face, what she looked like.
Q.	Did you also make mention of her mother?
A.	I do not remember her name.  There is a mix-up in my mind with regard to her mother's name.
Q.	Thank you.  Madam Witness, when you state that she was called Janet, is that the same name that is referred to in Kinyarwanda as Johaneta?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Very well.  What did Johaneta's father, whom you refer to as Karera, do for a living?
A.	Johaneta's father, who was known as Karera, was in charge of the Mugonero hospital secretariat.
Q.	Did you know Karera's other children?
A.	Yes, I knew most of Karera's children.
Q.	Can you tell us about them?
A.	I can give you the names I remember.  There was -- Johaneta was the elder child.  Then there was Jean-Eugene Murekatete.  There was a younger daughter called Chantel.  Among the boys were Jean-Lee, Jean-Bosco and others names I do not remember.
Q.	Thank you.  Do you confirm that the Johaneta you have made mention of was the same person as Josiane?
A.	Yes, I would unequivocally confirm that.
Q.	Perhaps I was not paying attention to what you said, but under what circumstances did Johaneta change her first name?
A.	She changed her first name after the eighth year in Ngoma primary school.  Since she didn't pass the national exam into secondary school, and she was unable to repeat the eighth year, she took another name in order to attend another Adventist primary school located in Kanyinya.  Those were the circumstances under which she changed her first name.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So Johaneta's other sister was Eugenia Murekatete; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	And what did Eugenia Murekatete do in April 1994?  What was she doing in April 1994?
A.	In April 1994, I would not be able to tell you what Eugenia Murekatete did for a living, since she was resident in Kigali.
Q.	Can I therefore state, if I go by your statement, that Eugenia Murekatete was not  -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter didn't hear the question properly.
THE WITNESS:
She was driven from Esapan where she spent the first year.  She failed, and she could not go back to that school.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Do you know how old she was in April 1994?
A.	In April 1994 she was slightly above 26 years of age or thereabouts.
Q.	Thank you.  If someone were to tell you that Josiane was raped in April 1994 at the hospital, what would be your reaction to that?
A.	If someone were to state that to me, I wouldn't confirm that because in April 1994, from the time when I left Mugonero, there hadn't been any cases of rape, and when I returned to the hospital, no one made mention of cases of rape.  Given the prevailing situation, I cannot confirm that rapes -- acts of rape were committed in that area.
Q.	Are you ready to give us the same response with regard to Eugenia Murekatete?
A.	If one were to say that Eugenia Murekatete was raped, I would state that that could not have been possible because she was not there.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Do you know a person by the name of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) in Ngoma?
A.	In Ngoma secteur, there were many people by the name of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), but the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) I know very well used to work at the Adventist association and his first name was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), so his names were (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
Q.	When you state that you knew him well, are you ready to talk further to us about him and by talking also about (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) wife?
A.	His wife's first name was (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  I don't know her name because she was called by her child's name.
Q.	Did you know (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) children?
A.	Yes, I knew them very well.
Q.	Can you give us their respective names?
A.	I can give you their names beginning with the oldest.  The oldest was called (By order of the Court, the following words have been extracted and filed under seal).
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You therefore, can talk to us a little more about (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how long would you be with this witness? 
MR. SONGA:
More than half an hour, Madam President.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What happened to our 45 minutes declaration?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have already consumed two hours.
MR. SONGA:
I didn't keep count, but I really doubt that I have already taken two hours in leading this witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
This is an hour and 45 minutes since we started with her after the break.  Sorry, Professor, maybe it's shorter than two hours, I agree.  One hour and --
MR. SONGA:
Thank you.  We will make up for that with the next witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will then take a lunch break and resume at 2.30 p.m.
(Court adjourned at 1302H)
(Pages 28 to 46 by Trevor Gerbes)





	(Court resumed at 1440H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the Court are resumed.  

Professor, you have the floor for remaining examination-in-chief. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Before we go any further, Madam Witness, I would like to be sure about the particulars of certain -- of two people.  First, in regard to Martha Nyirahabimana, was she married or not?
A.	Martha Nyirahabimana was married. 
Q.	Are you in a position to give us her husband's name?
A.	Her husband's name was Emmanuel, but they were separated.
Q.	Thank you.  As for Maria Mukeshimana, was she married?
A.	Maria Mukeshimana, to the best of my knowledge, never married.
Q.	Did she have any children?
A.	No, I do not know that this person had any children.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  When we broke for lunch we were discussing the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) family.  I believe you answered the question regarding who her children were or who the children of this family were.  Amongst the daughters I noted (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal); is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Thank you.  Did (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) also bear her father's name?
A.	I know that she was called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  I do not know whether she took her father's name.
Q.	So from the information you have, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) is not known to you?
A.	No.
Q.	Now let us talk about (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  Where was she in April 1994?
A.	In April 1994, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) was in the university in Butare.
Q.	Do you mean that she was a student in Butare?
A.	That is correct, and she was studying public health, she was in the second year of her course in the University of Butare.
Q.	Thank you.  Before we go further, Madam Witness, I'd like to put a question to you that I should have put earlier on: if somebody were to say to you that in April 1994 this person saw a girl called Josiane in the company of Martha Nyirahabimana and Maria Mukeshimana, if someone were to say that to you, how would you react?
A.	I would say that in April, the person was in the Mugonero complex -- the person who was in the Mugonero complex was Josiane, and Martha and Marie were not there, so I cannot imagine how such a person could have seen these people together.
Q.	Thank you.  And do you know what happened to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
A.	I don't know what became of her.  From the last information that I received, she was in Butare.  I don't know what followed.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. Can you tell us whether you know other girls called Mukasine who were in Ngoma?
A.	In Ngoma secteur, I think there were two Mukasine known to me.  Let's say that I knew one Mukasine in Ngoma but who was not in the Mugonero complex.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know a person named Charles Ukobizaba?  It is U-K-O-B-I-Z-A-B-A, so Ukobizaba, Charles.
A.	I know somebody called Charles Ukobizaba.
Q.	Where did he live?
A.	Charles Ukobizaba lived in the buildings, in the hospital buildings, in the part which was referred to as Kanyinya.
Q.	What did he do for a living?
A.	He worked in the accounting section of the Mugonero hospital.
Q.	Did you know his family?
A.	I knew most of the members of his family.
Q.	Can you tell us the names of the members of his family?
A.	This person had three daughters.  I knew Charlotte, who was the eldest girl.  There was Véréne Nsabimana and Espérance, who was the youngest daughter.  Amongst the sons there was Joseph Rutaganda, Musonera and Usiel.
Q.	Did he have a daughter called Mukasine?
A.	No.  I know these girls very well.  I have given you their names.  There were no girls or daughters called Mukosine in the family.
Q.	And in April 1994, where was Charlotte?  Are you in a position to tell us that?
A.	In April, Charlotte was in Cyangugu.
Q.	What was she doing there in Cyangugu?
A.	She worked in the hospital as a nurse, but she did not have qualifications.  I don't know whether -- what she was doing in Cyangugu or whether she went to study there.  I know nothing about it.
Q.	Can you tell us about Véréne, the daughter of Ukobizabe?
A.	Véréne was called Nsabimana.  She was studying in the Mugonero nursing school, either in the fourth or fifth year of secondary school. 
Q.	Did you learn that she had been raped at the hospital?
A.	I didn't hear this.  Nobody told me that.
Q.	Madam Witness, did you have sufficient knowledge of the people who were working in the **** *********?
A.	Regarding the people who worked in the ************************************************************, I knew them.  I also knew people -- other people who worked in various positions in ********.
Q.	And amongst these people, could there have been a girl called Murekatete?
A.	Murekatete?  What is her first name?
Q.	Yes, unfortunately, I do not have her first name.
A.	I don't think I know that person.  Perhaps if you have given me the first name I would make an effort, because generally it is the first names that were used, otherwise I don't think I remember any Murekatete **********
Q.	Thank you. In the ************************* did you know a girl called Mukasine, other than a daughter of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)?
A.	In Mugonero, I did not know any other Mukasine.  The other Mukasine that I knew lived in other secteurs apart from Mugonero.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you by chance know anybody called Byumbe?
A.	I don't know this Byumbe name.  It's not even a Rwandan name, but I know a name that resembles that one.
Q.	I shall first spell Byumbe for the transcripts.  It is B-Y-U-M-B-E, Byumbe.  And, Madam Witness, you say that you know a name that is similar to this one?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Which name, for example?
A.	When you called Byumbe, I thought of Byumve.  This was a nickname given to a gentleman who lived in Mugonero.  And Byumve is spelt B-Y-U-M-V-E.
Q.	And you knew the person bearing the name Byumve quite well?
A.	Not very well, but I know this person.  I know his names, his father, his mother and his wife.
Q.	Could you give us the names of the various people whom you have referred to?
A.	Byumve, in fact, was called Samuel Singaye.  He was a teacher in Esapan.  He was a son of a pastor who was called Seth Rwanyabuto who was married to Anne-Marie.  I do not know her other name, but she worked in the Mugonero hospital. 
Q.	Did you give us his wife's name?
A.	The wife's name was Anne-Marie.
Q.	And it is only the first name that you know?
A.	I only know this first name.  She was called -- she was commonly referred to Mama Passe.
Q.	I don't know whether you gave us the number of children.
A.	This person did not have many children.  This couple only had one child which was -- who was called Pascasie, called Passe for short.
Q.	Did you see these persons during the events of 1994?
A.	Concerning Anne-Marie, I could see her up until the 11th.  Since ********************* work in the ************, I didn't see him.
Q.	Thank you.  Was there a medical school in Mugonero?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness asks if counsel can repeat his question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Was there a school of medicine in Mugonero?
A.	There was a school called Sciences infirmiére which is ESI, which is École des sciences infirmiére de Mugonero, that is Mugonero nursing school.  It was not a school of medicine.
Q.	In the Mugonero nursing school, were there operating theatres?
A.	No.  In the nursing school there were premises that were used for studies, but there was no operating theatre.
Q.	To the best of your knowledge of the premises, and taking account of the number of people who went to the hospital, was it possible for rapes to have been committed?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that a question or are you seeking her opinion or -- what is the question, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
I am seeking her opinion, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is she qualified to give you -- are we expected to take her opinion on the matter?
MR. SONGA:
If you say that her opinion is not to be taken, then I shall not try to do so, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, you don't.
MR. SONGA:
May I put the question differently?  I shall try to get the acquiescence of Your Honours. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	If somebody were to tell you, Madam Witness, that in this place that you know rapes were committed in April 1994, what -- how would you react?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you mean in Rwanda or you mean specifically -- you are referring to a specific area or Rwanda? 
MR. SONGA:
I am referring to the Mugonero hospital.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you heard the question.  I shall repeat it: if someone were to tell you that in April 1994, in Mugonero hospital, rapes were committed, how would you react?
A.	My personal reaction would be to say that considering the conditions under which I left the hospital, and the number of people that had rushed or gone there, the number of people who had overrun the hospital premises -- there were so many people right up to the entrance of the hospital and these people had come with their cattle and their property.  I would say that it was impossible to carry out rape.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have concluded my examination-in-chief. 

Madam Witness, thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Professor. 

Madam Witness, now you will be asked questions by the Prosecutor on your right.  Please understand the question and answer it very briefly.  

Mr. Phillips, you have the floor for cross-examination.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  We meet again, do we not?
A.	That is it.
Q.	Madam Witness, can I start off by asking you how long had you worked at the location that we've talked about in this courtroom today before the events of 1994?  How long had you been at that location where you worked?
A.	Probably mistaken.  I've never worked at the Tribunal.
Q.	I never said you did.  You've talked about *********.  Can you tell me how long before the events of 1994 that you started working at that location?
A.	It was in the month of January 1994 that I started working at ******.
Q.	And prior to January 1994, what did you do?
A.	Before January 1994, that is from September 1993, I was a *****************************************not far from the *******.
Q.	Very well.  Madam Witness, would I be correct in saying that you were not present at the Mugonero complex on the 16th of April, were you?
A.	You would be right in saying so.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that you were not present there from the 11th of April 1994; is that correct?
A.	If you state specifically from the afternoon of the 11th of April, you would be correct.
Q.	And when did you return to that location, or did you ever return to that location?
A.	I returned after -- after the 16th to ********.
Q.	(Overlapping microphones)
A.	That was in the month of April.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What date did you return, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
I went back towards Ngoma on the 17th, in the evening, but I went back to the complex of Mugonero a bit later.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
When?
THE WITNESS:
When I returned to the complex, in ******************, it was already the month of May.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And between the afternoon of the 11th of April to the 17th, when you returned to Ngoma, can you remind me as to your location, that one big period, where were you at?
A.	Yes, I can do that.  I was in the Mpembe secteur in the Gishyita commune. 
Q.	Now let me talk to you about ****************.  You were not working there at that location **********, were you?
A.	No, that's not correct.
Q.	So you were *********, were you?
A.	No, I was not **********.
Q.	So why did you say that wasn't correct?
A.	What are you talking about? 
Q.	You didn't **** ***********, did you, yes or no?  Can we establish that first?
A.	That is correct; I was *******.
Q.	And why did you stop working there on the 11th of April?  What made you leave the location from the 11th of April?
A.	I told you that in that region there was insecurity that was prevailing on that date.  I realised that my security was under threat so I ***************** and I went to where I mentioned to you.
Q.	So when you -- when your security, as you say, was under threat and you went away from the complex, did you leave other people inside the complex, or was the entire complex evacuated at the time you left on the 11th?  Was there anybody left in the complex when you left?
A.	Not everyone had left the complex.  I am going to explain things to you.  I wasn't residing at the complex.  I used to go there to work and I used to go home and there was quite a distance from the complex up to my home.
Q.	So who was left at the complex from the 11th of April, whether they resided there, or they worked there, or they were doing other things there?  As far as you know, when you left on the 11th of April, who did you leave at the complex?
A.	When I left the complex, there were *******************************.  Now those whom I left there in the morning continued ************.
Q.	Were there any people at the complex who had come there to seek refuge before you left on April the 11th?
A.	There were many people there.
Q.	And do you know if those people remained in the complex after the 11th of April?
A.	Yes, I learnt that those people remained at the complex.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, what did you at the complex?  If you think that this will reveal your identity, you can write it down on a piece of paper.  Mr. Issa, please, a piece of paper.  Can you ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to translate it for us?

Mr. Phillips, you can proceed. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Sorry, Madam Witness, I think I had asked you something about what those people were doing -- if you knew -- no, my question was: did you know if people remained in the complex seeking refuge after the 11th of April?  That's what I asked you.
A.	Certainly, those people remained in the complex and others came to join them.
Q.	Do you know why those people were at the complex?
A.	I can give you my opinion insofar as that question is concerned.  My view is that in regard to the events of April 1994, people thought that there was going to be insecurity given what had taken place in other regions.  They thought probably that if they assembled at one location, they would enjoy some protection.
Q.	So why didn't you assemble at that location to enjoy the same amount of protection?  You were leaving and they were coming in.  Why didn't you stay there to enjoy the same amount of protection?
A.	People thought differently.  Each person viewed his or her security in his or her own manner.  As far as I was concerned, I did not want to stay with many people.  There was even no water.  And I chose to go where I was living. 
Q.	Isn't it true, Madam Witness, that the people who were seeking refuge at the complex were of the Tutsi ethnic group and you knew that?
A.	I would say that that is not true because people from various ethnic groups took refuge there.
Q.	And is it also your testimony that people from various ethnic groups remained there until the 16th of April?
A.	I do confirm that.  Nobody told me that there was this ethnic relation.
Q.	Yes.  In fact, as far as you are concerned, Madam Witness, as many Hutus and Tutsis sought refuge until the 16th of April; is that not your position?  In fact, there was no difference, was there?
A.	Well, that is my view.
Q.	Very well.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, before you proceed, maybe enter this document as an exhibit.  

This is document with the occupation of the witness will be Exhibit P. 41, to be kept under seal. (Exhibit No. P. 41 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, if those who worked at the complex, ******************************, belonged to Tutsi ethnic group a lot more than they belonged to the Hutu ethnic group?  Was there a higher population of Tutsi employees at that location?  Do you know anything about that?
A.	Yes, I can confirm that, but that would only be an opinion.  I cannot say in absolute terms that that was the case.
Q.	When you came back to the location we've talked about in May 1994, how many of your Tutsi ************** were left?  Can you help me with that?  Ten, 20, 30, 40?  What kind of number?  How many of them **************** in May?
A.	When I ******************************, the people that I knew -- well, there are some that I had not seen again.
Q.	Some?  Did you see any of them again, the Tutsis that you knew before the 16th of April 1994?  Can you give me one name of someone you saw again, just one?
A.	There are some that I saw again, but the -- there were many more of them than there were before.  There were a few of them than there were before.
Q.	So in May 1994, when you returned to the complex, is it your testimony that you saw some Tutsis, ******************?  Is that your testimony as far as you're concerned?
A.	I can answer that question by saying that ************************************************************** service -- well, those ones I didn't see again.  Those I'm alluding to had been **************************** and I can't even recall their names again.
Q.	I see.  Madam Witness, do you know if Mr. Muhimana ever discriminated against Tutsis?  Did you ever hear anyone say that?
A.	I can't answer that question.  I know that he was the conseiller of the secteur and we had Hutus and Tutsi in that secteur.  If he had to depend on the ethnic lines for -- to be elected, he would not have been elected by those people.
Q.	So is your answer that you know that he has never discriminated, or that you don't know, or that you can't help us?  What is your position on that?
A.	That was my answer.
Q.	What?  What was your answer?
A.	My answer is that I know that he did not know segregate on ethnic lines.
Q.	Well, if it's not segregating, do you know if he discriminated on ethnic lines?
A.	I do not know of any discrimination on his part.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, did you ever hear, when you returned to the complex in May, that Mika Muhimana had been involved in attacks at that location on the 16th of April in any manner or form or even had been present there?  Did you hear anyone say that to you?
A.	I didn't hear anything about it.
Q.	I don't think you heard also that Charles Sikubwabo, the bourgmestre, had perhaps visited the complex on the 16th as well?  You never heard that, did you?
A.	No, I never heard anything about that.
JUDGE SHORT:
Sorry, Madam Witness, did you say that you did not hear that there was any attacks whatsoever on the 16th of April involving anybody at all?
THE WITNESS:
I heard about that.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you hear who were involved in that attack?  Who were the attackers and who were the victims? 
THE WITNESS:
I heard that people had launched attacks in Ngoma, coming from Rwamatanu secteur, and in the Gisovu secteur, as well as in the Magarama cellule in Ngoma secteur, and in the Kigarama cellule.  People talked about the leaders of the attacks, and if you want me to, I could write the names of the said leader or leaders on a piece of paper.
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, could you kindly do that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Again, this is in Kinyarwanda.  Get it translated from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
JUDGE SHORT:
While the translation is being done, did you hear who the victims of this attack were? 
(Pages 47 to 56 by Roxane Lane)

































	1530H
JUDGE SHORT:
And while the translation is being done, did you hear who the victims of this attack were?
THE WITNESS:
I do not know the names of the assailants, I was able to know their region of origin.  As concerns the victims, I was able to know -- or I knew three persons, but I didn't know the others.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Thank you, sir.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, is it your testimony that of all of the people that died on the Mugonero complex on 16th April you only knew three people?
A.	That is not what I said.  Many people died; with respect to those three persons, those are persons whose bodies were found.  As for others, I don't know if they died or if they had taken flight.
Q.	Very well.  Now, can you help me with this, were you informed that there had been an attack at the Mugonero complex when you returned, or did you come about this information in some other manner?  How did you come about the information regarding the attack at the complex?  Help me with that.
A.	I learned about the attack on the same day the attack was launched, but it wasn't information that I verified, and I was therein informed when I came back and I asked questions to people thereon that I found.
Q.	Isn't it true, Madam Witness that you, in fact, heard noise coming from Mugonero complex and you saw people carrying mattresses having been looted from that hospital on the 16th of April?
A.	I did not hear any shouts from where I was.  I heard deafening sounds, as if medal was being hit against one another.  As far as people who stole mattresses, I witnessed that on the same day and the following day.
Q.	And when you returned to the Ngoma area on the 17th, did you stop by at the Mugonero complex to find out what the state of affairs was on that occasion?  Did you go near the complex on the 17th of April?
A.	When I got back to Ngoma, I did not go to Mugonero immediately; I only went there later on.
Q.	And having heard all of those noises coming from the location where you were, weren't you, at least, interested to visit Mugonero complex when you returned?
A.	I was not interested -- I was not keen to do so because I had heard that people had been killed.  I didn't feel like going there.
Q.	I see.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Adeogun-Phillips, may I interrupt?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The written reply on a piece of paper given in response to the question posed by the Bench is 
Exhibit 42.  

Thank you, Mr. Adeogun-Phillips.  Please proceed.
	(Exhibit No. P. 42 admitted)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
	I'm grateful, Your Honour.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, I -- we are talking about those who were responsible for the attacks, and I was going through some names, you've written a name down here and we note that.  In addition to the name that you wrote down did you ever hear it being said, when you returned in May, that someone like Gerard Ntakirutimana and Elizaphan were involved in the attacks in Mugonero, did you ever hear that being mentioned?
A.	I did not hear about that.  I did not hear of that.
Q.	I didn't think so.  Now, madam, how did you come to be a witness in this case; and please, don't mention the country of your residence, just tell me in very broad terms, did somebody contact you, that sort of thing? 
A.	I became a witness in this case because I was contacted by certain persons.
Q.	Very well.  I'm going to come back to this and I'm going to show the name of somebody and I just need you to confirm if it was, indeed, him or her that contacted you, but we will come back to that; do you understand me? 

Now, you were asked during your examination-in-chief whether or not it was possible for the lady you described as Martha and Maria to have the son named Gafurafura; do you recall being asked that question?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	In response, you testified that in your region it was most unusual for people to bear the same surname as their father; do you recall testifying in those terms?
A.	I do recall.
Q.	Now, when you say, "your region", would that refer to Ngoma or Kibuye, or what do you mean by region?
A.	I even wanted to talk about the entire country.
Q.	Very well, thank you, that is what I thought you meant.  Now, you were a witness in the case of Gerard and Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, were you not?
A.	Yes, I was.
Q.	And to your knowledge, do you know if the members of the Ntakirutimana family shared the same surname as the pastor, as far as you are aware?
A.	Some of his children bear his name.
Q.	Do you know if all of his male children and female children bear his name or bore his name, Ntakirutimana?
A.	I know the first names of most of his children, but I don't know their family names.
Q.	But you know that Gerard is also called Ntakirutimana, don't you?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Why should Gafurafura be different?  In your opinion you told us the whole region, in fact, the whole country?
A.	I will explain matters to you at length if it is possible.  When a child bears his father's name or her father's name, no other name is added to that.  I know Martha as Nyirahabimana, I do not know Nyirahabimana Gafurafura.  In other countries naming is regulated, we don't have any law regulating names in our country.  Children are named by their parents depending on the circumstances or the objectives they have.  People who gave their names to their children were people who had been abroad and had come in contact with other cultures.
Q.	So, there are people in Rwanda who give their names to their children, are there not?
A.	What you say is correct.  I stated that it wasn't frequent but I didn't say that it was forbidden.  There was no law on that; it was not frequent. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you have testified in relation to Martha, that as far as you are aware she wasn't at Mugonero - or in Mugonero in April of 1994, that is what you say, she was attending some training course?
A.	That is what I stated.
Q.	How would you know that if you were not there yourself?  You were not there on the 16th of April, were you?  You were not there on the 12th, were you? 
A.	You are right.
Q.	Now, Maria the second daughter, you said -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Sorry, I didn't hear the last --
A.	I would like to explain something regarding Nyirahabimana.
Q.	We will come back to that when you finish answering my questions.  Let's talk about Marie, okay.  She lived in Kigali, that is what you tell us, and, therefore, she couldn't have been raped in Mugonero on the 16th of April, that's your evidence, isn't it?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Again, you were not at the Mugonero complex on the 16th of April, were you?
A.	That is true.
Q.	Now, Madeleine, the third daughter, you didn't see her in April 1994, did you?
A.	I did not see her at Mugonero complex.
Q.	On the 16th of April, did you?
A.	I did not see her either.
Q.	Josiane, Johaneta, whatever you choose to call her, Janet, you did not see her on the 16th of April 1994, did you?
A.	I did not see her.
Q.	(By order of the Court, these names have been extracted and filed under seal), you didn't see those two women on the 16th of April, did you, Madam Witness?
A.	I did not see them throughout the month of April.
Q.	And the same with Eugenia, you didn't see her either, did you?
A.	I did not see her either.
Q.	Very well.  Now, let's go back to how you became a witness in this case, shall we.  I'm going to have shown to you the name of someone, and I want you to tell me whether or not you know this person. 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And at the same time, can I have the registry to please give these names out.  Please, can you give this first to the Judges, one to my learned friend, one to the witness and one to yourself?

	Document No. 1 is the first of several documents that I am going to be referring to during the course of this afternoon, Your Honours.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, you can see the name on that document, can you not?
A.	Yes, I can see the name on this piece of paper.
Q.	Do you know that person?
A.	I know a person who bears that name.
Q.	Now, the person who you know that bears that name, was that the Defence investigator that came to see you at your location, your country of residence?
A.	Yes.
Q.	When was the first time that you met with that person, the first time you ever met that person in your life?
A.	The question you have just put to me is not clear, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	When was the first time you met that person?
A.	As part of my work, is that what you mean?
Q.	As part of this case.
A.	If my memory serves me right, I believe it was in 2000 -- in 2002.
Q.	Do you know him in any other way apart from in relation to this case, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
Q.	What is your relationship with him, Madam Witness?
A.	There is a relationship between that person and myself.
Q.	Can you tell me what that relationship is, and you can speak it into the microphone because we don't know who you are talking about, so there is no risk to you?
A.	He is *****************.
Q.	Do you *******************?
A.	Yes, **************.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

Q.	Madam Witness, do you see that document No. 2; do you see the name on there?
A.	Yes, I can see the name on that document.
Q.	Do you know that person?
A.	I know a person by that name.
Q.	And the person that you know by that name, is that person related to you?
A.	Yes, I am related to that person.
Q.	Now, how are you related to the person you know by this name?
A.	That person is my junior sister.
Q.	And if she is your junior sister would I be correct in saying that she is also the junior sister of the person in Prosecution Exhibit No. 43; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Now, do you know if that person is a witness in this case, No. 2?
A.	That, I am not aware of.
Q.	Very well.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, whilst I enter this as the next Prosecution Exhibit No. P. 43, I draw your attention to the pseudonym DR 2 on our witness list.

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honour, yes, I'm sorry, the Defence witness.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
DR 2.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
On your list it is number 30, Your Honour, let me just use the list that we all have so that it is easier. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Yes.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you see document No. 5 before you?
A.	Yes, I have that document before me.
Q.	Again, Madam Witness, do you know that person or a person by that name?
A.	Yes, I know that person.
Q.	How do you know that person, Madam Witness, or a person by that name?
A.	I know a person by that name and that person is a member of my family.
Q.	What is the relationship of that person to you, Madam Witness?
A.	That person is my junior sister.
Q.	Did you say sister, Madam Witness?
A.	I meant to say my junior brother.
Q.	Do you know if the person in document No. 5 is a witness or intends to be a witness in this case?

MADAM PRESIDENT:

MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 46 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, still talking about document No. 5 that you have before you, would I be correct in saying that the person in document No. 5 is also a brother of the person in document No. 1, the very first name I showed you?  And if you need to refresh your memory I'm quite happy to assist you?

Q.	Very well.  Now, let's go to document No. 3 now.  Now, do you know the person in document No. 3, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I know this person.
Q.	How do you know the person in document No. 3, Madam Witness?

Q.	And the person that you refer to as being in your family bearing this name has what relationship with you, Madam Witness?
A.	This is my older brother.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Can I have my document back?  

Would you also confirm that the person in document No. 3 is, indeed, the older brother in document No. 1 that I showed you earlier?
A.	It is true.
Q.	Thank you.  Now we will have the document back please?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, that again would be my next Prosecution Exhibit P. 46, in the order of things.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, admitted as Exhibit P. 46, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 47 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know if the person in the document No. 3 that we just talked about is a witness in this case?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
	Your Honours, can I refer you again to our Defence witness list, No. 34 on our list, N for November, and M for mother and No. 6.  Now, can I have document No. 6 shown to the witness please?  
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you know that person, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I know this person.
Q.	How do you know this person, Madam Witness?
A.	I know this person because I know her region of origin.
Q.	Isn't it true, Madam Witness, that you are, indeed, related to the person on document -- the name in document No. 6?
A.	To the best of my knowledge there is no relationship between these persons and myself -- between this person and myself.
Q.	I see.  Do you know if the person in document No. 1, the first document I showed you, do you know if the person on document No. 6 has any relationship with the person in document No. 1?
A.	To the best of my knowledge there is no relationship between these two persons.
Q.	Isn't it true, Madam Witness, that the person in document No. 6 is, indeed, your cousin and a cousin to the person in document No. 1?
A.	It is not true.
Q.	Very well.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Can I have my -- 
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Do you know if that person is a witness in this case?
A.	I believe that this person will be called to testify in this trial as a witness.
Q.	Very well.  Can I have my document back?

And can I enter that as the next Prosecution exhibit; I think it will be 47 now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Document No. 6 is entered as Exhibit P. 47, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 48 admitted, under seal)
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Briefly, Your Honour, and in relation to our list, No. 26 on our list. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, Witness, how did you get to know the person whose name is on document No. 6 will be testifying in this case?

THE WITNESS:
I knew it because when the investigators came to see us they put us on the same aircraft to come here.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that not the case with the other three witnesses, the other three persons who names you were shown, the relations of yours?
THE WITNESS:
I do not understand your question very well, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were you not put in the same aircraft with the other persons?
THE WITNESS:
No, we did not travel together and, in fact, I have not seen them for some time.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, how much of that which transpired during the Prosecution's case did the person you identified in document No. 1 tell you about before you came to this courtroom?
A.	These people told me nothing.
Q.	I see.  So the person in document No. 1 simply came up to you and said, I would like you and others, other siblings of mine to come all the way to Arusha and testify in this case, did he?
A.	That is not how it happened, no.
Q.	So, how did the person in document No. 1 know that you would have any useful evidence to provide for the Accused in this case?
A.	I cannot know, I can only tell you that he came to see me at one time and I had -- we had not seen each other for some time, and he put questions to me in regard to what happened in Mugonero complex.  He asked questions and then he went away afterwards.  He said that he would return.  And he came for the third time; he came with the professor.  And the professor interviewed me and I gave him information.  And the professor asked me whether I would make the same statements before this Court and I agreed to do so. 

And the investigator came back and they both asked me whether I would be able to repeat my statement as testimony before this Court, and that is how I came to give testimony before this Court.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, when you said, "the professor" are you referring to Professor Songa, the lead Defence counsel in this case?
THE WITNESS:
You are right.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	So, is it your testimony, Madam Witness, that all that you have told us today concerning Gafurafura's children and those concerning Charles Ukobizaba, all of these things you have told us today, you never discussed these matters with the person in No. 1, or did you?
A.	I did not discuss these things with that person.
Q.	So, how then were you aware that these things were relevant to the discussions here; and is it your testimony that you were simply responding to the questions put to you by Defence counsel, or is it your testimony that you had been notified of these topics before you came here?
A.	I did not discuss my testimony with these investigators, however they put questions to me and I answered.  And afterwards they asked me whether I would repeat the same information before the Court.  And I agreed to do so.
Q.	Have you met anyone, just out of curiosity, have you met anyone from the Defence team since you arrived in Arusha?
A.	Since I arrived here in Arusha, I have met the professor and I have also met his team.
Q.	I see.  Have you met the person in No. 1?
A.	I used to see him in this team but I did not meet him in particular.
Q.	Very well.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honours, I have no further questions for this witness.  

Thank you, Madam Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Adeogun-Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
Your Honour, just on a procedural issue, it kind of crossed my mind, I've made a lot of reference to the Defence list.  You may or may not wish to enter this as an exhibit; I'm in your hands.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which document?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS: 
You know, I made reference to No. 34, 40 and so what --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This will be Exhibit No. P. --
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
 Forty-eight.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Forty-eight.  Can we have the list to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 48 admitted, under seal)
   MADAM PRESIDENT:
      Yes, Professor, do you have any re-examination?
MR. SONGA: 
No, Madam President, I do not have any re-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, in the course of your evidence you have given us the names and the ages of various people, some who are much older than you.  In 1994, your age was 22 years; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You have told us about the names --
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
-- and ages of other people, some aged 26, some aged 25, and so forth.  How did you know their ages?
THE WITNESS:
The people whose ages I gave you are people with whom I grew up.  The first person whose name I gave you -- whose age I gave you, I told you that this was my teacher in primary school.  I estimated his age for you in reference to his physical appearance that I noted considering the time when this person married and how many children the person had.  

In reference to No. 3 and No. 4, I referred to the age at which one goes to primary school because I had been at the same school with these people.  And I tried to see what -- how many years separated me from these people.  If I was 22 years of age and these people were in the third year when I was in the first year, then I made a calculation, and this is how I was able to estimate for you the ages of these persons.
(Pages 57 to 68 by Donna M. Lewis)










	1615H
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, had anybody told you before you came to give evidence that they would ask you the ages of those people?
THE WITNESS:
Nobody told me.  That is why when I was asked -- answering your questions, I tried to use a starting point to estimate their ages.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you also gave us evidence telling us where people were in April of 1994.  Quite a number of them, you knew where they were in Kigali, in other places and so forth.  Did you discuss with anybody where people were in Kigali in April of 1994?
THE WITNESS:
I did not discuss this with anyone, but I can tell you that I knew where these people were because these were people whom I knew and with whom I had worked.  And in our area, there was a commercial centre which was inhabited by people I would consider intellectuals.  And through these people, I could receive various source of information.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And did you keep this information in a book -- in a notebook?  How long have you been away from -- from the location you were in 1994?  When did you leave that location?
THE WITNESS:
Do you want to know?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What location?
THE WITNESS:
Where I was?
JUDGE MUTHOGA: 
The location you were in 1994.  You remember Mugonero hospital?  When did you leave that location?
THE WITNESS:
I left Mugonero in July 1994.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Nineteen ninety-four.  When -- and you have not gone back.
THE WITNESS:
No, I have not gone back.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Good.  So that all the information you were given by the intellectuals in April 1994, have you kept that in a notebook or have you kept it in your head, as to where people were?
THE WITNESS:
I did not keep it in a notebook, because I did not think that questions would be put to me in that regard.  These are people that -- these are things that I kept in my memory, and I have a lot in my memory.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That's right.  You kept knowledge of where people were in 199 -- in April 1994 clearly in your mind, having received it from intellectuals in your area -- in your centre.  Is that your evidence?
THE WITNESS:
This is not information that people gave me that I remembered.  These are things that I knew.  Well, let's say some things I knew, others were told to me.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, I mean, I'm talking about those that were told to you.  You kept them in your mind since that time.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you haven't -- and you haven't gone through remembrance -- the old memory lane with anybody?
THE WITNESS:
No, nobody helped me to remember.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your evidence has concluded.  We thank you for your testimony before the Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home.

Mr. Registrar, please assist the witness.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
	(Witness excused)

first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to ask you a number of questions.  When you learnt of the death of President Habyarimana -- I will start asking the question all over.  When you learned about the death of the President Habyarimana, were you at the address that you can find on the piece of sheet before you?
A.	Yes, I was at that same address.
Q.	Were you alone when you learned of his death?
A.	I was not alone.
Q.	Can you tell us who was with you?
A.	I was with my family; that is, members of my family.
Q.	Do you mean your father, your mother?

Q.	On what day did you learn of the death of the president?
A.	It was on the 7th.
Q.	Was it in the morning or in the evening?
A.	It was in the morning.
Q.	After having learned of the death of the president, what was the security situation like in your home?
A.	After learning the news, I can tell you that, for starters, I was scared.  On the 8th we left our residence because we did not quite know what was happening.
Q.	You state that on the 8th you left your home.  Where did you go?
A.	We went towards the hospital buildings.
Q.	What was the distance between your house and the hospital?
A.	About 100 metres -- between 100 and 200 metres.
Q.	And why did you go to the hospital?
A.	It is because *********************************, and he felt that we had no other choice but to go and take refuge in ******************.
Q.	You state, Mr. Witness, that *****************************************.  Can you possibly tell us what he did?
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal)
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal)
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal)
Q.	And for how long did you stay at the hospital?
A.	We stayed at the hospital for about a week.
Q.	When you say one week, is that from the -- from the 8th?
A.	Yes, it is from the 8th up until the date we left the hospital.
Q.	When you say one week, can you be more specific?  Were you there for five days, for six days?
A.	Since we left the hospital on the 16th, I would say that we were there during the days between the 8th and the 16th.
Q.	When you got to the hospital, were you the first person to take refuge there, or did you find people there already?
A.	We found other people there who had come to take refuge there like us.
Q.	Were there many of them?
A.	Yes, there were many of them.
Q.	Can you recall the hour at which you reached the hospital?

We, of course, moved back and forth from our house to the hospital and back to move a few items.  But I can assure you that we did not spend the night of the 8th of April in our house.
Q.	And what was the situation in the hospital between the 8th and the 16th of April in so far as your security is concerned?
A.	As concerns our security, we ensured our own security.  We, as refugees, during the initial days, there was no problem, we could protect ourselves.  We came together.  The young ones who were among the refugees carried out nightly patrols to the extent that during the initial days, there was no problem.
Q.	Can you tell us the ethnic group of those refugees?
A.	As concerns the ethnic group, I can tell you that there were people from two ethnic groups; Hutu and Tutsi.
Q.	And on the 16th, do you want to confirm that you left Ngoma?
A.	I do confirm it.
Q.	Can you tell us if it was in the morning or in the afternoon?
A.	We left that place in the morning.
Q.	And can you give the exact time at which you left the hospital?
A.	I had to remember that we reached Gishyita at about 8 o'clock.  We, therefore, left that place at 7 o'clock and reached Gishyita at about 8 o'clock.
Q.	Mr. Witness, what is the distance between the hospital where you took refuge and Gishyita?
A.	I never calculated the number of kilometres between Gishyita and Ngoma, but I know the distance was quite a bit.  I can say there were about four or five kilometres, but I don't know the exact distance separating the two locations.
Q.	When you say that you left the hospital at about 7 o'clock, who is "we"?  Is it the family you described a short while ago, or does the "we" include other persons?
A.	I am talking about my family and myself.
Q.	Well, that is what I mean in my question.  The family, does it comprise the number of persons you mentioned a while ago?
A.	Our family left the hospital to go to Gishyita, but we were accompanied by other persons.
Q.	And who were those other persons?
A.	Amongst those who were with us, I recall that there was Ntakirutimana family.  We also heard people -- persons called Muvunyi, and there are many names that I have forgotten, for instance, Madam Rachelle was also with us.
Q.	And who is Ntakirutimana?
A.	Ntakirutimana was pastor in the Ngoma association.
Q.	And how was his family?
A.	I recall that his family included his wife, a certain Gerard, those are the names that come to mind, who were members -- the names of those who were members of the Ntakirutimana family that was with us.
Q.	You mentioned a person, Mr. Witness, called Madam Rachelle.  Who was she -- or who is she?
A.	It was an old lady who used to work at the hospital.  She was well advance in age, and she looked more like a white person.  I think she look more like a European.
Q.	Did you leave Ngoma on foot or did you use any other means?
A.	We left Ngoma by other means.
Q.	Can you tell us about those means?
A.	We left on board a car, a vehicle.
Q.	All the persons you have mentioned, your family, the Ntakirutimana family, Madam Rachelle, were you all in the same vehicle?
A.	No, we did not all get into one vehicle.  The fact is that we left on board a vehicle.
Q.	That morning at about 7 a.m., how many vehicles left the Mugonero hospital going towards Gishyita?
A.	Two vehicles left the hospital.
Q.	Did they leave at the same time?
A.	Yes, about the same time.
Q.	But there is one vehicle that left before the other?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Are you asking him or are you telling him?
THE WITNESS:
I remember that the two vehicles left at the -- left or started at the same time.  When we left, we left at the same time.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We left at the same time.  Professor is only asking which one went ahead of the other one.  Is that the question you are trying to put?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how this line of questioning --
MR. SONGA:
What was your question, Your Honour?

Yes, Madam President.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You asked the witness which one went first, and the witness has told you that they left at the same time.  I'm asking you, were you ask -- seeking to ask from the witness which vehicle preceded the other one, went ahead of the other one, or what was the question you intended to elicit?
MR. SONGA:
I was trying to find out in which vehicle he himself was in when they left.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  I left on board hospital vehicle.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how this line of question is relevant to your case?
MR. SONGA:
My impression is that if you don't find any relevance to my line of questioning, then I may not find any either.  So, I may as well continue with other questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We want to have some very relevant questions and to save the time of the Court.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I will bear that in mind as much as possible.  

Can I proceed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You proceed, yes.  Please, you can proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you stated that you arrived at Gishyita at 8 o'clock in the morning, is that correct?
A.	I reached Gishyita at about 8 a.m.; that is correct.
Q.	Where exactly in Gishyita did you arrive at 8 o'clock?
A.	When we reached Gishyita, we went to a place called CC -- CCDFP.
Q.	Why is that place called that way?
A.	There were buildings that were used for games, but I cannot explain what CCDFP stands for, but those were letters that you could find on the buildings.  And that the letters were as follows:  CCDFP.
Q.	Whom did you find at CCDFP, CCDFP?
A.	Just as we arrived, there weren't people.  People came later rather and found us there.  And those who found us there were the authorities of that place in Gishyita.
Q.	And who were the authorities who found you there?
A.	Amongst those authorities, were the former bourgmestre; there was the person called Mika.  They are the ones who found us there.  There were secretaries or the staff of the communal office.
Q.	When you say, Mr. Witness, that they found you there, how much time later did they come there after you had arrived at the place?
A.	Well, not much time had elapsed.  Just immediately after we arrived, at about five minutes later, those people started arriving and the members of the population came to see the refugees who were there.
Q.	What was the distance between the CCDFP and the Gishyita communal office?
A.	Only a short distance separated the two locations, about five metres.
Q.	A while ago, Mr. Witness, you gave the names of Mika, or you gave Mika's name.  Were you referring to Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, he is the one I was referring to.
Q.	Did you know him?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	And under what circumstances do you know him?
A.	I knew him because he had been the conseiller of that area in the Gishyita secteur.  Those are the circumstances under which I knew him.
Q.	Did you know his family?
A.	I did not know his family.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  If I heard you well, you mentioned the bourgmestre?
A.	Yes, I did mention his name.
Q.	Did you also give his name?
A.	No, I did not give his name.
Q.	Probably, you can tell us his name.
A.	If I remember correctly, I think he was called Charles, but I can't recall his other name.
Q.	Before reaching Gishyita on that 16th day of April, did you use to go to the Gishyita centre?
A.	I used to go there.
Q.	How often did you go to Gishyita?
A.	I went there -- I seldom went there, probably once a week.  I didn't go there frequently.
Q.	Before the events, and if this will not undermine your identity, what was your occupation?
A.	I was a student.
Q.	The persons or authorities who came to see you when you arrived, for how long did they stay with you?
A.	Those officials didn't spend the entire day there.  They, first of all, listened to our problems and then they went back to their offices.  I, myself, I could move about.  So I could see them.
Q.	Thank you.  We are still on the 16th day of April.  Do you remember your timetable for that day?
A.	Personally, when I arrived at that place on that 16th April, we were shown where we could sleep or lie down.  I was able to move about in search of something to eat.  I left that place to go to the market, and those were my movements.  That is the movements of a person who was unemployed.  I shuttled to and from that centre.
Q.	Can we take it that the moment you arrived at CCDFP, you left the place several times on that day?
A.	Yes, I left CCDFP to go to the centre.  I couldn't spend the entire day sitting there.  I could leave the CCDFP to go to the centre.  I would lie down and then I will go back to the centre.  I did that.
Q.	And the security you were looking for in Gishyita, did you find it there on that 16th April?  Was it safe in Gishyita on the 16th of April?
A.	Yes, sir, it was safe.
Q.	As you left the CCDFP often on that 16th April, did you happen to meet Mika somewhere other than at the CCDFP?
A.	I saw him often at the market.  Each time I went to the market, I found him there.  There were other persons that I did not know, but each time I went there I saw him.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how long would you go to conclude the evidence of this witness? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I cannot afford any longer to ask you more time, but if you can grant me 40 -- 30 to 40 minutes.  That would be helpful for me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have forgotton your 45 minutes you promised to Judge Muthoga before the lunch break.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, I have given up on promises.
MR. SONGA:
I think things will work out, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are not keeping up your promises.  We are disappointed with you, anyway.
MR. SONGA:
You will see, Madam President, that I will be able to lead 12 witnesses during this week, at least 12.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Insa Allah.  We stood for the day.  

Mr. Witness, we are still continuing with your evidence.  You are under oath.  Please, do not communicate your evidence -- the proceedings of this Court to anyone outside the court.  Thank you.  We resume tomorrow morning --
MR. KAPAYA:
I have just a small, very quick clarification which we would seek from the professor.  We would like to know whether this witness testified in the Ntakirutimana's case and whether -- and if so, what his pseudonym was, as a Defence witness, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, can you help the Prosecutor with the pseudonym of this witness, if he testified in the Ntakirutimana's case?
MR. SONGA:
From the information we have, his pseudonym was, or he was designated as Witness No. 4 in the Ntakirutimana's case.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, could you endeavour to inform us in advance about all the witnesses who had testified before?  Can you provide us with this information long beforehand?
MR. SONGA:
Whenever I will have the information, I will do that, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

We resume tomorrow morning at 9:00.  Thank you.
