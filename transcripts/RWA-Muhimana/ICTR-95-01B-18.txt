EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	Do you have a piece of paper before you that contains your personal particulars?
A.	Yes, I have the document before me.
Q.	Have you verified the contents of that document by signing -- by appending your signature on the document?
A.	The document is written in French and I can't read French.
Q.	Okay.  Did I, with a person who speaks Kinyarwanda, did I go through that document with you this afternoon where you are staying, as to verify this document, the contents of the document, by signing it? 
A.	That is correct.  
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, I tender the particulars of this witness as Prosecution Exhibit P. 19. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will be --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This protected information sheet is entered and admitted as Exhibit P. 19, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 19 admitted, under seal)
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, this is Witness PW15?  
MR. KAPAYA:
PW14, Your Honours.  PW15.  Mr. Issa had told me that he was PW 14.  So it is PW15, and he has made one statement, it is dated 29th November 1999.  It was disclosed to the Defence on the 14th of March.  You will find it on page 392 to 402 of Volume 2 of the Prosecution witnesses binder.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will ask you questions regarding the events that took place in Rwanda in 1994.  Do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I can understand you. 
Q.	Tell me, sir, were you resident in Bisesero in 1994? 
A.	Yes, I was residing in Bisesero. 
Q.	Did there come a time in 1994 that you had to seek refuge some place? 
A.	No.  I didn't go anywhere to seek refuge. 
Q.	Was there a time in 1994 that you left your residence and went some other place to seek refuge?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
To hide.
THE WITNESS:
No.  I simply went to hide in bushes in the vicinity.  I did not have any other place where I could hide. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us why you had to hide in bushes, Mr. Witness? 
A.	That was due to Interahamwe and their leaders. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us the various places in which you went to hide?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, do you mean various places during the war?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, please answer the question.
THE WITNESS:
I used to hide in bushes, and when the Interahamwes came, I fled. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell me the location of those bushes?  Where were those bushes? 
A.	Those bushes were found in our locality, but at a certain point Interahamwes found us out in a sorghum farm.  There were very many of them and they were accompanied by Mika, Sikubwabo.  They chased us.  I was in the company of Kabanda, who was still very young at the time.  And when we reached close to Runyangingo, Mika, who was carrying a gun --
Q.	Thank you.  Once you talked about seeking refuge in a sorghum farm.  Now, when was that?  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, the witness has told you.  He said he hid.  Hid is different from seeking refuge; there are two different concepts.  And the witness's position is that he has never gone to seek refuge but he has hidden at various places.  So unless you do not accept that hiding and seeking refuge are different concepts -- 
MR. KAPAYA:
Well, they are different, Your Honour.  But let me use the word "hiding." 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you testified that there was a time you were hiding in a sorghum field; is that correct? 
A.	No.  That took place, but I wanted to tell you that -- I was going to tell you or to relate to you the atrocities that occurred, and that is when you interrupted me. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are advised to respond to questions that I put to you, right?  You story should come out through the questions that I put to you as we stand here.  Do you understand that? 
A.	I understand you. 
Q.	So, can you now tell Their Honours, when were you hiding in a sorghum field?  Do you remember the month?
THE WITNESS:
Your Honours, Madam President, in the month of June or mid-June I was hiding in a sorghum farm with Kabanda and other refugees that I could not identify during that period, which was a difficult one.  Many Interahamwes led my Mika and Sikubwabo arrived.  They found us out.  We tried to run, and they chased us, and when we came close to a big trench, Mr. Kabanda had lagged somewhat behind, and we heard gunshots.  I had seen Mika among the assailants, and when I looked back, I saw Kambanda fall down.  We hid in that trench. 
Q.	Right.  Now, what time of the day, as you were hiding, did you come across Kabanda? 
A.	The truth be told, we didn't consult our watches.  But, in any case, it was in the afternoon. 
Q.	Can you tell Their Honours about approximately how many refugees were hiding with you? 
A.	There were three of us refugees.  There were others with us but there were two of us who hid in the trench. 
Q.	Before we get to the trench, Mr. Witness, can you tell me at what point in time did you see these attackers arrive? 
A.	They came while we were in the trench, and when they saw Kabanda, they no longer chased us, and they shouted: "That is Kabanda."  Mika said, "Don't kill him.  Wait for me to come first." 
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's backtrack a little bit.  What time did you see Mika and the attackers come to attack you? 
A.	It was in the afternoon.  I did not quite note what hour it was but it was in the afternoon. 
Q.	Can you tell me by what means did the attackers come? 
A.	They came on board a vehicle, but there are some of them who came on foot.  Sikubwabo and Mika and some other assailants came on board a vehicle. 
Q.	Can you tell us what type of vehicle they came in? 
A.	It was a white Toyota. 
Q.	Had you seen that car before that day? 
A.	Yes, I used to see it. 
Q.	Do you know to whom it belonged? 
A.	It was a communal car, a vehicle.
Q.	To which commune did it belong, Mr. Witness? 
A.	It belonged to the Gishyita commune. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many people were in that car? 
A.	I cannot tell you the number.  When you are at a distance trying to flee from danger -- I mean, you can only look at something with attention when you are not under duress.  But when you know that somebody is after your life, you don't pay that much attention. 
Q.	When the car arrived, can you tell us where it stopped? 
A.	The vehicle was parked close to Kabanda's residence on the road.  And each time the assailants came, they used to park their car on that spot and began to attack the refugees. 
Q.	How far was it from where you were hiding to where the car stopped? 
A.	The distance was about 20 metres. 
Q.	Now, did you recognise any of the people who were in that car? 
A.	I was able to recognise Mika and Sikubwabo.  The other Interahamwes were many and I couldn't identify them because I was running away.  If I had paid attention and tried to identify them, I would have been killed. 
Q.	Could you determine whether any of the people you saw were armed? 
A.	Mika was armed with a gun, and while we were running away, he was shooting at us.  I saw him with a gun. 
Q.	Who else was armed, Mr. Witness, and with what type of weapon? 
A.	I have told you that we immediately took flight, but since I knew Mika before and since I had seen him carrying a gun, I can't tell you exactly what make of gun he was carrying. 
Q.	Could you tell us whether the Interahamwe were armed, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I did not see arms with the Interahamwe.  Rather, I saw Mika who was shooting at us with the gun that he was carrying.  On another occasions probably I saw Interahamwes with weapons, but on that day, it is only Mika that I saw carrying a gun. 
Q.	What sort of weapons did the Interahamwe carry? 
A.	They were carrying cudgels, machetes and spears. 
Q.	Now, could you tell Their Honours, after Mika, Sikubwabo and the Interahamwes had disembarked and you were hiding with Kabanda and other refugees, what did you observe? 
A.	They chased us.  We ran, and when we arrived at the place that I have indicated to you, next to a cassiterite quarry, we heard many gunshots.  When I turned my head, I saw that Kabanda had fallen.  We hid in the quarry, and the assailants did not know where we had gone. 
Q.	Can you describe the place where you hid, Mr. Witness? 
A.	It was a trench that was in an old cassiterite quarry, and we could hide in a corner and not be seen.
Q.	How far was that place from where Kabanda had fallen? 
A.	If was quite close; it was about 15 metres away. 
Q.	Now, before you sought -- before you hid in that hole, can you -- and as Kabanda fell, could you tell us whether you observed or heard anything, Mr. Witness? 
A.	This is what I heard.  The Interahamwe were saying, "It is indeed Kabanda."  And Mika said to them, "Wait, don't kill him.  You have to wait for me.  Do not kill him."  I heard this from where I was hiding. 
Q.	Now, when you heard Mika speak these words, can you estimate the distance that was between you and him? 
A.	Mika was still behind.  It is the Interahamwe who reached Kabanda first.  But from the trench where we were hiding, there were 30 metres between us and Mika.  When he spoke, I could see him, but we were closer to the place where Kabanda fell. 
Q.	Now, sir, can you tell us how long you hid in that hole or cave? 
A.	We did not stay there for long.  We hid for about ten minutes because a few minutes afterwards, Mika arrived, and when we heard that -- when we realised that the assailants were not speaking anymore --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness did not complete his statement. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Okay.  As you hid by the cave, were you able to observe what was happening where Kabanda had fallen? 
A.	No.  It is afterwards that I realised.  When the assailants reached the place where Kabanda had fallen, I couldn't see them from the place where I was hiding. 
Q.	All right.  For how long did you remain hidden in the cassiterite, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Ten minutes after the departure of the assailants, or, rather, 15 minutes, we left our hideout. 
Q.	From that hideout, can you tell us where you went? 
A.	I went up.  I went to see the other place where Kabanda had fallen.  I realised that Kabanda had -- Kabanda's head had been cut off and that his genitals had been cut off. 
Q.	In what condition was the body?  Did it have clothes on or it was naked? 
A.	He had no clothes on him; he was naked.
Q.	So, what did you do then after you had found the body? 
A.	I became afraid.  I went to my home.  The next day, very early in the morning, I went to bury the remains of his body. 
Q.	Sir, why did you take it upon yourself to bury the remains of Kabanda? 
A.	He was a brother.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did he disclose the relationship of the witness?
MR. KAPAYA:
He said it was a brother. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It was like a brother or it was -- what did say?  Was it protected information?
THE WITNESS:
When I say that he was a brother, it means that he was a neighbour.  When somebody is your brother -- is your neighbour, you consider him as your brother. 

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, how far did you bury the body from where it had fallen? 
A.	I dug a hole quite close to where he had fallen. 
Q.	Did you find the -- did you know what happened to the head and the genitals of this man, 
Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes.  Subsequently after the war, I met Mika's relatives, who told me that Mika had taken away Kabanda's head and had asked people to hang it up at the window of his house.  The genitals had been hung on a pole, and they were drying on this pole, and I saw this after the war. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, did you say you met the relatives of Mika or Kabanda?
THE WITNESS:
No.  I said the relatives of Mika. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know the name of the relative of Mika?
THE WITNESS:
I would not say that they are very close relatives, rather, I am referring to an old man called Ndoliyobijya, who was a neighbour of Mika in Gishyita because Kabanda and Mika had trades in Gishyita.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know the name of the place where Kabanda was killed? 
A.	It is a place called Runyangingo.
Q.	Witness, can you tell us when you started hiding in the hills in Bisesero? 
A.	I began to hide from the 11th of April. 
Q.	What is it that led you to start hiding? 
A.	All of a sudden, I saw people arrive.  These are the people that I told you about.  These people attacked us with non-firearms weapons, and burnt houses, and the situation began to deteriorate.  Mika and the Interahamwe began to arrive, and it is from this time that we began to hide.  But these events took place after the death of President Habyarimana. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, did you know the owner of the millet farm in which you were hiding?
THE WITNESS:
It is the farms that we cultivated ourselves.  We hid in different farms.  We did not take note of whose farms we went to hide, because we did not know whether we would survive.  These were farms where we cultivated various crops.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I am referring to the millet farm from which Kabanda was flushed out, if you knew who was the owner of the millet?
THE WITNESS:
This farm was on Gitwa hill in Bisesero.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Proceed, Counsel. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, let me ask you about the various people you have referred to in these proceedings.  For how long had you known Assiel Kabanda?
A.	Since when I was a child, I knew him. 
Q.	Can you tell us where he lived? 
A.	He resided in Gitwa cellule, Bisesero secteur, in Gishyita commune. 
Q.	Where did his family reside?
A.	His family resided in Gitwa cellule, but he had a trade in Gishyita. 
Q.	What sort of trade did he carry, can you tell us?
A.	He sold various items, sorghum, coffee, beans; the usual items that one finds in a store. 
Q.	Do you know that distance between his Bisesero home and his Gishyita house? 
A.	There was a house between the two places. 
Q.	Sir, I asked you whether you knew the distance between his house in Bisesero and his house in Gishyita town. 
A.	Oh, now I understand you.  From Bisesero to Gishyita, the distance was about one hour's walking distance. 
Q.	Now, did you know who Charles Sikubwabo was before you saw him in June 1994? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
Q.	Do you know who he was and where he lived? 
A.	He was bourgmestre of the commune. 
Q.	Which commune? 
A.	Gishyita commune. 
Q.	Do you know where he lived? 
A.	He lived quite close to the commune bureau, the communal office. 
Q.	Now, had you known Mika Muhimana before April 1994? 
A.	I knew him. 
Q.	Can you tell us when you knew him? 
A.	I do not know exactly the year in which I knew him, but I knew him from well before, but I cannot tell you in what year I knew him.
Q.	Can you tell us where he lived or what he did for a living? 
A.	I used to see him in Gishyita.  He was a trader; he sold beer.
Q.	Apart from trading, do you know whether he had other businesses? 
A.	He was a conseiller, a secteur conseiller. 
Q.	He was conseiller for which secteur, Witness? 
A.	He was conseiller of Gishyita secteur. 
Q.	Did you -- where did he live? 
A.	When I left Bisesero to work, I used to find him there in Gishyita.
Q.	Do you know his residence in Gishyita? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us how far it was from Kabanda's residence? 
A.	From Bisesero or from the store?
Q.	I mean Kabanda's store in Gishyita. 
A.	It was a distance that could be covered in one hour's walk. 
Q.	Do you mean to say that from Mika's residence in Gishyita to Kabanda's residence in Gishyita was a distance that could be covered in one hour?  Is that what you said, Mr. Witness? 
A.	No.  It is just next door; they were neighbours. 
Q.	Can you tell us the distance in metres, if you can, between the two places?
A.	From the store to the residence of Mika, it is about 20 metres, because between the two houses there was a house of one of the inhabitants. 
Q.	Sir, can you tell us when you last saw Mika?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How many metres did you say? 
MR. KAPAYA:
He said 20, about 20 metres. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, but from there to Kabanda's residence in Bisesero, there is a distance that can be covered in one hour's walk.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	All right.  I had just asked you whether you recall when you last saw Mika in 1994.
A.	The last time I saw him in 1994, it was in the month of June when Kabanda was killed and his head taken away, and from that date, in fact, we did not hide here and there because the killings had begun to reduce. 
Q.	Can you describe how Mika looked like when you last saw him? 
A.	I know him and I have even seen him in this courtroom. 
Q.	Oh, can you indicate to Their Honours where you see a person you recognise as Mika? 
A.	Yes, I can tell you.  I can see him.  He is sitting on that side and he is wearing a cap. 
Q.	On which side of where you are seated, and what type of cap is he wearing?  

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Point at him, Witness, if you can see him.  Just stand up and point at where he is sitting.
THE WITNESS:
There he is, he is wearing a white cap. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has identified Accused. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Thank you, Witness.  That is all I have from this witness, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, now you will be asked questions by Defence counsel for Mika.  Please understand the questions and answer them very briefly.  

Professor, you have the floor for cross-examination. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Counsel.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, before putting questions to the witness, I would like to draw to your attention a little discrepancy and receive the most precise instructions from you.  This is what it is about.  

In the only statement, witness statement, we learned that the events about which he has come to give testimony took place in Bisesero, on a hill called Gitwa.  Later on, we received a document titled, "Reconfirmation of the statement of Witness BE."  This document came from the Prosecution, and it is written as follows:  "Prior to the beginning of the Muhimana trial, the Prosecutor went out into the field in Kibuye, Rwanda, so as to reconfirm the statement of this witness."  

"Herewith, we are informing you that in reconfirming his statement, Witness BE added or modified the following items of his previous statement: One:  The witness, Kabanda and others were in Uwingabo and not on Gitwa.  He saw Muhimana and fled to Runyangingo.  Two," and that is the last point, "The witness heard Muhimana shout, 'I see Kabanda,' and immediately after there was a shot fired."  

I am bringing this to the attention of the Court, Madam President, because the Defence was prepared based on the knowledge that the Prosecutor brought the most accurate and recent elements of information, and that the hill in question is no longer Gitwa, but, rather, Uwingabo.  However, before this Court, the witness has just stated that the events took place in Gitwa, instead.  I am very disturbed because I do not know whether the questions can be put to the witness as such, whereas the latest written information had been forwarded to us by the Prosecutor.  That is the difficult situation in which the Defence finds itself, Madam President.  We would be grateful if you would help us to make some progress based on this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, what do you have to say?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What do you have to say?  
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, the best person to resolve the issue counsel has raised should be the witness.  But according to what we have done, we -- what has happened is that the witness has said he kept on moving from place to place.  Actually, he had been hiding with Kabanda from April, May, June, in different places, and the last place he was, was at Gitwa, that is where they were seen, and then he moved to Runyangingo, and that is where he was killed.  So, I believe, Your Honour, I don't think there is any discrepancy or difference.  

And as to what Mika said immediately before Kabanda was killed, I think it is contained in the statement and the witness has testified to it, although it is in slightly different words, but the effect is the same.  It is not expected the witness will use exactly the same words every time he is asked about this particular incident.  But the effect of the statement is the same, that Mika had said, "Wait, don't kill him I am coming."  

Thank you, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Songa, these are matters that you should explore in your cross-examination.  You have all the materials before you.  And if you think there are any inconsistencies, it is up to you to go into them during cross-examination.  So what kind of direction do you need from us?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And if you have contradictions -- you will have them then. 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, Madam President, your answer satisfies me.  That is what I wish to hear. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  Please proceed. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Mika Muhimana? 
A.	I know him.  I have pointed him out to you. 
Q.	For how long have you known him? 
A.	I stated to you that I do not remember the year in which I knew him.  But whenever I went to Gishyita, I used to see him.  So I cannot tell you that I saw him for the first time in such a year or such an hour and so on and so forth, but I knew him well before then. 
Q.	Did you know his family, Witness? 
A.	I used to meet him in Gishyita.  He was a conseiller.  I did not know that the events we are dealing with were going to take place.  We used to meet.  We used to greet one another.  I was not interested in his family because I was not aware that such events were going to occur and that I would have to appear before a Tribunal to be examined on those.
Q.	Do you know where he was living in 1994? 
A.	He was living in Gishyita itself.
Q.	You state, Witness, that you were on a Bisesero hill when you were flushed out by assailants; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	How was that hill called, Witness? 
A.	We were flushed out of a place on Gitwa hill.  I heard you say, Witness -- that I didn't state what is contained in myself statement.  The hills of Gitwa and Runyangingo are very close to one another.  I heard you state that I did not mention Uwingabo hill.  That was because Gitwa hill is very close to the other one.  I stated to you that I buried Kabanda's remains in Runyangingo.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, what is the distance between Runyangingo and Gitwa hill? 
THE WITNESS:
Those two hills are close to one another.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you estimate it in metres?
THE WITNESS:
I did not measure the distance because you cannot measure distance between two hills unless you have good reason to do so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Professor, please proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	If I understood you correctly, Witness, you stated that Gitwa and Runyangingo are very close to one another.  Could we say that --
A.	Runyangingo is in the area of Uwingabo and Uwingabo is very close to Gitwa.  Runyangingo is a separate hill just as each of us here has a separate name, but we are in the same room.  Those hills were therefore close to one another, and each of those hills had its name. 
Q.	Is Uwingabo a secteur or a cellule, Witness?
A.	It is a cellule. 
Q.	And Runyangingo? 
A.	Runyangingo is a hill situated in Uwingabo cellule.  Runyangingo is a hill but it is situated in Uwingabo cellule. 
Q.	Witness, please continue to assist us by telling us, what is the relationship between Gitwa and Uwingabo?
A.	I have understood that Uwingabo is a cellule.
Q.	And how about Gitwa?
A.	Gitwa is also a cellule. 
Q.	Witness, did the attack you mentioned take place in which of those two cellules?  In which of those two cellules did the attack take place?
A.	The attack was launched from Gitwa cellule and we fled into Uwingabo cellule. 
Q.	Let me rephrase my question so that you should understand correctly.  Where exactly were you flushed out?  In what cellule was that place located? 
A.	We were flushed out of Gitwa cellule in Bisesero region.  And we left Gitwa to flee towards Runyangingo, which is situated in Uwingabo cellule.  Let me give an example.  I can leave the witness box and go in front by passing through the middle. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You state that you were hiding in a millet farm.  How many of you were in that hideout? 
A.	I was with Kabanda and two other refugees, because people were coming from all over the region and I don't know their names.  So we fled without me knowing the name of the two others.
Q.	At that place where you were, were you close to your house? 
A.	Yes, it was very close to my house.  Do you think I could hide far away from my home?  The distance between my home and my hideout was very small. 
Q.	Was it also close to Kabanda's house? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the two other refugees whose name you do not know, were they also from nearby before they got to that hideout? 
A.	Those refugees were fleeing the attacks.  We saw each other, each person going his way. 
Q.	Were they from near or from far? 
A.	I did not ask them because I was in a very difficult situation.  Do you think we were at a wedding, to be in a position to ask such questions?  Under circumstances in which you were expecting death, you could not ask such questions.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, when the Accused (sic) has told you that he did not recognise them, it is unlikely that he would know whether they are from near or far.  He didn't recognise them, he didn't recognise them.  He did not know whether they were from near or far.  That is why you are getting bad answers from the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness --
THE WITNESS:
I took a solemn declaration in order to tell the truth.  I would therefore tell you that under circumstances in which we were fleeing, you would not know the people who were coming from different areas. 
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, in 1994, what was Kabanda doing? 
A.	I believe I have told you that he was a trader.  However, during those events, he was no longer in Gishyita. 
Q.	Where was he, Witness? 
A.	He was in his house. 
Q.	Was he continuing to engage in his business activities?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us what business activities consisted in? 
A.	He bought coffee, he sold beans, clothes and various commodities that are found in shops.  So you could find everything in his shop. 
Q.	Did he have a shop in Bisesero, Witness? 
A.	No.  His house was in Bisesero.  He had a house in Bisesero.
Q.	We are talking about 1994, Witness.  If I understood you correctly, he was no longer in Gishyita but in Bisesero.  My question to you was whether in 1994 he was continuing his commercial activities.  Could you please give me a precise answer to that question?
A.	Are you referring to April 1994?  No.  How could he have continued to engage in his business activities at a time it was said he was no longer alive? 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  When you were flushed out, when was that?  What period was that?  Do you remember the date, even roughly? 
A.	I do not recall the date.  I remember that it was in the month of June, in late June.  However, I cannot remember the exact date. 
Q.	Witness, would you remember the hour, by any chance? 
A.	I wasn't wearing a watch.  All I know is that it was in the afternoon. 
Q.	You state, Witness, that Mika was leading that attack; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	What made you think he was one of the leaders of that attack? 
A.	I knew him.  I could have known the position of the attackers during that attack.  But I knew that he was one of the leaders of the attack because I knew him. 
Q.	Did you hear him say anything when he arrived in Gitwa? 
A.	He said nothing in Gitwa.  We fled, and when we got very close to Runyangingo, we were being fired at, and subsequently, as I stated to you, I went back.  Kabanda - l looked back, Kabanda was behind me.  I saw him fall.  So we went into a hole in which cassiterite had been extracted, and we hid in that hole.
Q.	You stated that Mika and Sikubwabo were accompanied by many Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Who are -- or who were those Interahamwe, Witness? 
A.	I could not identify them.  Do you really expect me to have paid attention to my executioner?  All we had to do was flee from him. 
Q.	Did you have the impression that Mika and Sikubwabo were leaders of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, they were their leaders, by the way they were the ones issuing orders to them; they were the authorities.  If you give orders to your army, can that army really disobey you? 
Q.	Those Interahamwe, Witness, how many of them were there when you saw them coming down in Gitwa? 
A.	I did not count them. 
Q.	Was it a small number? 
A.	There were very many of them. 
Q.	When you say there were very many of them, Witness, could you please give us a rough estimate as to their number? 
A.	You cannot give a rough estimate of a large number of people; you will succeed if it is a small number of people. 
Q.	Let us take an example, Witness.  Could there have been about a hundred? 
A.	When people are pursuing you, you cannot stop to count them.  Your first preoccupation is to hide in order to save your life.  You cannot count the number of people pursuing you.  If it is just two people, you may be able to know their number. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  How did those Interahamwe arrive on the scene?
A.	They came on foot. 
Q.	And the people you referred to as their leaders, how did they arrive on the scene? 
A.	They came on board two vehicles. 
Q.	One or two or several vehicles? 
A.	On that day they came on board a single vehicle. 
Q.	Witness, did you see all those who were on board that vehicle? 
A.	I did not see them.  I couldn't take risks to get close to that vehicle. 
Q.	When that vehicle arrived, Witness, at what distance were you from it? 
A.	I was at a distance of about 20 metres. 
Q.	In your opinion, Witness, what does 20 metres represent, for instance, in this room? 
A.	I'm only giving an estimate.  It is perhaps more than 20 metres because when you leave the sorghum farm, your main concern is to flee from the gunfire.  I gave the estimate.  It is perhaps more, but I believe I have told you the truth. 
Q.	I am very grateful to you for that, Witness.  When the vehicle arrived in Gitwa, were the Interahamwe already there? 
A.	The Interahamwe had not yet arrived.  They met there, and on board that vehicle, there were mostly Interahamwe.  They could not all come on board that vehicle. 
Q.	How much time elapsed between the arrival of that vehicle and the arrival of the Interahamwe who came on foot?  
A	About five minutes after the vehicle arrived, the Interahamwe also arrived. 
Q. 	.During those five minutes, Witness, what were you doing?
A.	We were hiding in the millet farm thinking they were not going to find us. 
Q.	Let us talk about the Interahamwe who were in the vehicle.  Could you give us an idea as to their number? 
A.	No.  I could not know their number.  We were in hiding.  We were lying low, and we could not count them. 
Q.	The vehicle you saw, how many people could it have contained? 
A.	I was simple peasant farmer.  I could not know the number of people who could have entered that vehicle.  It is possible that the person who has vehicles could have known the number of people that vehicle could have contained -- 
Q.	Now, Witness, the Interahamwe who came on foot, and those who were in the vehicle in which was Sikubwabo and Mika, were they dressed in the same way? 
A.	They were not wearing the same kind of clothes.  The clothes they were wearing did not look alike. 
Q.	Witness, was there a particular manner of dress with which you could make out Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Could you please describe such dress to us? 
A.	They were wearing white clothes. 
Q.	Can you be more precise as to the clothes?  Were they white from head to toe?  
A.	Yes, they were wearing white clothes.  Their clothes were white.  We could not describe them exactly because we couldn't get close to them. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Were these Interahamwes male or female?
THE WITNESS:
They were mixed.  Men came and women came as well.  Interahamwe of both sexes came, some came to loot. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Were they wearing similar clothes, men and women?
THE WITNESS:
No, it was only the men who wore white clothes.  It was only the men who wore white.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What did the women wear?
THE WITNESS:
And the women were not in the forefront.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on, Counsel. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Apart from the colour, could you please describe the clothes worn by the male Interahamwe?
A.	I wouldn't be able to describe them.  You can only describe what you see close at hand.  Unless you are close to somebody, you cannot describe what he is wearing. 
Q.	From a distance of 20 metres, Witness, you could distinguish a loin cloth from a pair of trousers, couldn't you? 
A.	Even though I didn't get close to them, I have the impression that they were wearing something similar to what medical assistants wear. 
Q.	How are medical assistants dressed?  How were medical assistants dressed in 1994? 
A.	I did not go to the hospital. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Those Interahamwe you saw of first all in the vehicle, were there some who were carrying guns? 
A.	I have already told you.  You can ask him.  He, himself, knows this.  If he were telling the truth, he would tell you himself.  He knows what I am talking about.  If he could help me, I am sure he will be able to explain this to you.  He is pretending not to know this but he knows everything. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you are here to answer questions.  Please answer the question.

THE WITNESS:
Well, ask me the questions and I will answer them. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I will rephrase the last question.  Amongst the Interahamwes, who were those who came on board the vehicle?  Were there some who were carrying weapons? 
A.	On that day, Mika was armed, but I did not see other Interahamwe with arms.  We were trying to run away.  I think I already explained this. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You state that as soon as you were discovered, you started running; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Towards which direction were you running, Mr. Witness? 
A.	We ran towards Runyangingo passing through Uwingabo. 
Q.	That is not very clear, Mr. Witness.  If I understand you well, Uwangingo is in Uwingabo, or if you want to be clearer, well, please carry on.
A.	When you leave Gitwa, you first of all reach Uwingabo, and if you continue you will reach Uwingabo hill which, by the way, is situated in Uwingabo, and Gitwa is quite close to Uwingabo. 
Q.	I do not know if we have made any progress, Mr. Witness.  I will crave your indulgence probably because my geography is not very good.  

Now we are in the Uwingabo cellule.  Uwangingo is part of the Uwingabo cellule?
A.	No. 
Q.	The precise point which you left to go to Runyangingo, where did you leave to go to that cellule that is called Uwingabo? 
A.	We left Gitwa and we went towards Uwingabo and Runyangingo and those are two hills that are close to one another. 
Q.	Now, what is the border, Mr. Witness, between Gitwa and Runyangingo? 
A.	Uwingabo is found between Gitwa and Runyangingo.
Q.	Do you know any place called Gisoro?
A.	Yes, I know that locality. 
Q.	When you leave Gitwa going towards Runyangingo, do you pass through Gisoro? 
A.	Yes, you pass through Gisoro, but Gisoro is found in Gitwa, just as I said that Runyangingo is found in Uwangibo.  So Gitwa and Uwangibo are two border cellules. Thank you, Mr. Chairman (sic).
Q.	Which is the distance you covered as you ran?  
A.	I ran for about 20 minutes, that is, leaving Gitwa and going towards Runyangingo.  Probably 
15 minutes is the time I used. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Why did Kabanda lag behind you? 
A.	He was older.  He was older than us. 
Q.	And how much distance was separating you from Kabanda at the time that he was shot down with the gun? 
A.	The distance wasn't long.  It was short.  He was about ten steps behind us. 
Q.	Thank you.  You said -- you state, Mr. Witness, that you went towards a hole from where cassiterite had been extracted; is that correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	When you were running and heard the gunshot, were you able to identify the person who shot the gun? 
A.	We saw him because we were running.  We were looking behind us.  It was Mika.  We were seeing him. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you look back before or after the gunshot? 
A.	I looked back and I saw Kabanda fall.  I did not immediately go back. 
Q.	Please, can you answer as concisely as possible the questions that I am trying to put to you very clearly.  Now, did you turn back?  Did you look back before or after the gunshot? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, surely, you have heard from this witness more than five times that they heard the gunshots and they looked backwards.  The gunshot was the reason for looking backwards.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  Answer the question. 
	(Pages 1 to 19 by Sithembiso Moyo)


















	1540H
THE WITNESS:
I looked behind me and I saw Kabanda who had just fallen. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, it is after the gunshot that you looked back?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	This means, Mr. Witness, that you didn't see the person who shot the gun. 
A.	I saw him.  It was Mika.  I was seeing him.  It was clear.  And it was daylight.
Q.	How did you identify him, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I saw him carrying a gun.  There was no other gun.
Q.	What kind of gun was he carrying?  How did it look like? 
A.	It was a gun that could be used to fire.  I can't know what was the make of the gun.  I don't know the various types of guns. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When Mika fired, what was the position of the Interahamwe? 
A.	They were together, but the others were chasing us. 
Q.	What I mean, Mr. Witness, is, between Mika and the Interahamwe, who were those directly after you in the chase? 
A.	They were all together, but the Interahamwe were ahead.
Q.	So when Mika fired the gun, the Interahamwe were in front of him?
A.	They were on one side because they knew what he was going to do.
Q.	In your statement, Mr. Witness, you contend that you just had enough time to hide with the two other refugees in that hole; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You said "barely the time."  How much is that after you had stopped running?
A.	We heard a gunshot.  I looked behind and I saw that Kabanda had fallen, and we ran towards that hole.
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you talk to us about that hole? 
A.	That was at Runyangingo.
Q.	How deep would it have been? 
A.	It was a quarry of cassiterite.  It was wide, deep, about two metres deep, and you could go down as far as three metres, if you went further down.
Q.	Were you referring to its depth when you said three metres? 
A.	We climbed down that hole, but I could not measure its depth in terms of metres.  All I know is that that is where we hid ourselves.
Q.	How could you access that hole?  How did you get there? 
A.	You had the point through which those who used to go to mine the cassiterite before going down the hole.
Q.	Are you talking about points which looked like steps?
A.	Yes.  That's it.  And in Kinyarwanda, there is a specific name for that.  We called it  amadende.
Q.	What was the width of that hole, Mr. Witness? 
A.	The width was like from here to the wall opposite me, and it was also deep.
Q.	How many of you reached that hole, Mr. Witness? 
A.	There were three of us.
Q.	Was the hole dry? 
A.	Yes, it was.
Q.	And what was your position in that hole? 
A.	We were bent over because we were afraid to be discovered.
Q.	And if you were bent over on yourselves in -- at the bottom of the hole -- or were you bent over yourselves at the bottom of the hole?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  So once you had folded yourself up at the bottom of a three-metre-deep hole, can you tell us how you were able to see the Interahamwe who arrived first where Kabanda was lying?
MR. KAPAYA:
The witness didn't say that.  The witness didn't say that he saw the Interahamwe reach Kabanda after he had entered the hole.  The witness certainly didn't say that.  On the other hand, he said -- I don't know whether I should say that.
JUDGE SHORT:
What did he say? 
MR. KAPAYA:
He said that he saw them before he had entered the hole, that they reached Kabanda first and then Mika said something.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please move on.  Professor, you can clarify the position if you want to. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And I will not look at my watch but I know you are coming to a close now. 
MR. SONGA:
I will not take frivolous commitment, Your Honours, but I do understand the Tribunal's concern, and I will take that -- I will bear that in mind as much as I can.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This time I will say merci. 
MR. SONGA:
The progress achieved by the Tribunal is extraordinary. 

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thanks to your help, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
You have it, Your Honours. 

Generally, Madam President, the objections raised by the Prosecution have grounds, but I am not quite sure about the last one, because in the witness's testimony or in the statement that the Prosecution disclosed to us, it is not his version that features there, but, rather, it is that which, according to which, after the witness had hidden himself, he realised that the Interahamwe were the first to reach where Kabanda was lying.  And I think I will try to read out the text as faithfully as possible.  That statement takes only one page, and we can very easily locate the passage.  "When I looked back, I realised that it is Kabanda that had just fallen and that he had been hit by the bullet.  I barely had time to quickly hide inside the trench with the two other refugees, as the Interahamwe were the first to reach Kabanda.  Mika, who was coming behind, told them not to kill Kabanda until he arrived." 

I don't think that this portion lends itself to interpretation.  It is clear.  And that is why, 
	Madam President, I took leave to ask the question so that your Chamber can understand how the witness, who was hiding in -- at the bottom of a three-metre deep hole, and who was bent over, was able to see that the Interahamwe were the first to reach Kabanda's body.  Unless the Prosecutor has another version of the facts.  But this is a version that I have.  And if Madam President will grant me leave, I can always ask my question all over.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, go ahead. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will ask the question that I asked before.  How, from the bottom of a hole that is three-metre deep, and where you were hiding, bending over yourselves in order to escape the assailants, how could you see the Interahamwe? 
A.	I told you that there were small steps that had been contrived by the miners, and you could climb, using those steps, to see what was happening outside, without being seen.
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you were no longer bent over yourselves in that hole?  You climbed on the steps? 
A.	Well, I saw them furtively.  I thought you were asking me the depth of that hole.  Otherwise, what I saw I saw before I entered the hole.  And after having been witness to what had happened, I entered the hole.
Q.	Now we understand you, Mr. Witness.  How many of the Interahamwe were around Kabanda's body? 
A.	I did not count the number of Interahamwe.  When you are scared, you don't have the courage to be counting those you're seeing.  I didn't have the courage to count them.
Q.	Now, when a person is scared, what steps does he use to see outside a hole? 
A.	Yes, because sometimes -- well, you know that you are in hiding, but you can't start counting.  How could you do that? 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  The Interahamwe who were surrounding Kabanda, what did they do? 
A.	I did not see what they were doing because I wasn't seeing clearly where Kabanda was.  I wasn't seeing clearly where he was lying.
Q.	Even from the steps, you couldn't see? 
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Were you at least able to hear what they were saying?
A.	No. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I think I heard you contend before this Chamber today that the Interahamwe shouted, "That is Kabanda."  When did they shout this out?
A.	They shouted that when they reached Kabanda.  And when I tried to listen keenly while I was on the steps, it is then that I heard them shout that. 
Q.	Who said, "That is Kabanda"? 
A.	I couldn't tell who made the statement, but it was one of the Interahamwe.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You state, Mr. Witness, that Mika was behind the Interahamwe when he asked them not to kill him until he reached the spot; is that correct?
A.	That is what I stated.
Q.	Is that how things occurred?  Please confirm. 
A.	Yes.  That is how things occurred. 
Q.	When you say Mika was behind the Interahamwe, are we also to understand that the Interahamwe were also in front of Mika? 
A.	There were Interahamwe on one side when Mika was firing at Kabanda.
Q.	Can you help us a little further, Mr. Witness, by telling us, by either yes or no, if the Interahamwe were in front of Mika? 
A.	They were not in front of him.  He fired a gunshot which hit Kabanda, and the Interahamwe ran and reached the place where Kabanda's body was lying before Mika.  So they were together, but they were faster, the Interahamwe were faster than Mika.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you see all of the above from the hole in which you were hiding?
A.	He was -- they were shouting and they were not far from me.
Q.	I would like to appeal to you to be a little bit clearer.  Did you see that? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, did he see what?  Could you be more specific? 
MR. SONGA:
That is my intention, Your Honour, to try to be as precise and clear as possible.  I will try to rephrase the question. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	When you describe the position that Mika was holding, vis-à-vis the Interahamwe or vice versa, or when you describe the position of the Interahamwe vis-à-vis Mika, is it a position that you saw with your own eyes?  Yes or no. 
A.	I was an eyewitness to that.
Q.	When you were seeing the positions of the Interahamwe and Mika, where exactly were you, where in the hole? 
A.	I hadn't gone down to the hole.  Before going down to the hole, I had seen all of that.  You should remember that Kabanda was behind me.  
Q.	And what exactly did Mika say?  What is the sentence that he pronounced? 
A.	He said the following:  "Do not kill him before I arrive." 
Q.	Could it have happened that you were not seeing the Interahamwe and Mika but only hearing them? 
A.	I didn't say I heard anything.  I only heard the initial conversation.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You also state that in the afternoon, when the assailants had withdrawn, you came out from your hiding place to see what had happened to Kabanda; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Can you give us the time, even an approximate time? 
A.	I came out of this hole in the afternoon, at about 3 or 3:30 p.m.
Q.	Is it at that time that you discovered that he was dead? 
A.	I knew this before, when he was shot.  I went there afterwards to see where he had been killed, to determine whether his body was still at that place.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that you saw the bullet wound on one of Kabanda's legs; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was this wound like? 
A.	He had been hit on one of his legs.
Q.	Was it the left leg or the right leg? 
A.	It was the right leg.
Q.	How high up was the wound? 
A.	I did not pay attention.  When you see somebody in such a state, you do not pay attention to all of that.
Q.	Can you tell us what you know about his beheading? 
A.	I can.
Q.	Please go ahead. 
A.	I went to see the place where he fell.  When I arrived there, I realised that his body had been beheaded and that his genitals had been cut off.
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you able to learn who decapitated Kabanda?
A.	No.  I could no longer see the place.  I did not know who had beheaded him.
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, were you able -- are you able to tell us about the fact that his genitals were cut off? 
A.	His genitals had been cut off.
Q.	What were you able to find out as to the person who may have cut off these genitals? 
A.	I found the genitals at the place where it had been hung up.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You also state, Mr. Witness, that it is Mika who hung up Kabanda's head at the entrance to his store; is that correct?
A.	I was not a witness to that incident, that particular incident.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that after the war, you saw the genitals of Kabanda on an electric pole near his house; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	After the war, when was that? 
A.	In 1994, October of that year.
Q.	How much time had passed between the death of Kabanda and the time when you saw his genitals on the electric pole?
A.	This is the time when we were going back, when we were returning from our refuge, and Kabanda had been killed in June.  So you can try to calculate.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  What was the weather like in Rwanda from April to October 1994? 
A.	It was raining.  It was the rainy season.
Q.	And so when you saw the genitals of Kabanda, what state were they in, four months after? 
A.	They had dried up on the electric pole.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You state that the Gitwa attack, which you claim to have witnessed, was led by Sikubwabo and Mika; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Why do you state that Sikubwabo was leading this attack? 
A.	He was with his people.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if I've already asked you a question and I repeat it, you are authorised not to answer.  Who was Sikubwabo? 
A.	He was the bourgmestre.
Q.	When Sikubwabo arrived in Gitwa, did you hear him say something?
A.	I did not hear him say anything whatsoever.
Q.	Did you see him do something? 
A.	He was in the company of his people.  I did not see him do anything.
Q.	Mr. Witness, why, then, did you say that he was leading the attack? 
A.	He was leading these assailants. 
Q.	By doing what?  By doing what? 
A.	I ran away.  I did not see him do anything.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to ask a question as to the relationship between the witness and a person whose name we shall write down on a piece of paper so that he can recognise the name and determine the kind of relationship that he has with this person. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please take that piece of paper to the witness.  Show it to us.  Show it to the Prosecutor. 

Witness, Mr. Witness, can you read or write? 
	(Pages 20 to 26 by Mark Porter)





























	1615H
THE WITNESS:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you read the name of this person on the piece of paper?
THE WITNESS:
No.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we ask an interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth to please assist the witness?
MR. KAPAYA: 
Your Honours, if I may be of some help, that name is not a name of a protected witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, but we need to know the relationship of that person to the witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, I understand, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, just ask the relationship of this person on the piece of paper with the witness, from the witness.

Mr. Kapaya, do you want (inaudible) the relationship of the lady?
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour, I think the witness should just tell the interpreter and get it written down on the piece of paper.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:  
I can rely on you, Professor, to finish before we go away.  Can I rely on you, Professor, to finish before we rise? 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, sometimes you frustrate me when I am determined to make you a present, and then you take the initiative.  This was my intention.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Merci.
MR. SONGA:
All I can do is ask, Madam President, whether we may tender exhibits for the Defence.

The first exhibit, Madam President, is the prosecution document titled, "Re-confirmation of witness statement for Witness BE."  The second document is the witness statement, itself, but I am very hesitant, Madam President.  I do not feel at ease because I note that we do not have these documents in French.  I don't know whether the Defence may be allowed to deposit these documents in French for the Judges.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Both the documents, you mean, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
 Exactly, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, you have not provided the first version of these documents, the re-confirmation of the witness statement and the statement of the witness, in French?
MR. KAPAYA:
There is a French copy of the witness statement in the witness binder, Your Honour, and as for the reconfirmation statement, I will find out, and if it has not been disclosed to him in French, then we will do so in due course.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. SONGA:
With your leave, Madam President, it would seem that I said that I did not have the French version.  Actually, it is the French version that I have.  It is the English version that I do not have.  I'm sorry for this lack of clarity.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will admit as exhibit this statement of the witness of 29 November 1999, is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 28, F for the French, which we have now, and the reconfirmation of witness statement is Exhibit D. 29, F for French, to be kept under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 28F admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 29F admitted, under seal)
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I'd be grateful if would you allow that the exhibit bearing the person's name also be tendered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Of course, Professor.  This piece of paper with the name of a person is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 30, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 30 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that all, Professor?

MR. SONGA:  
All I can do at this time is to thank the witness for his willingness to testify and to thank 
Madam President and Your Honours for your patience in listening to me.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Yes, Mr. Kapaya, if you have any re-examination for the witness.
MR. KAPAYA:
No re-examination, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for assisting the Court with your testimony.  We wish you a safe trip home.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's almost 4:30 so it's an appropriate time to stop for the day.  We adjourn and resume tomorrow afternoon at 2 p.m.  Thank you. 
(Court adjourned at 1626H)
