MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon to all present here.  The Court is in session now.  May we have the appearances for the Defence -- for the Prosecution, please?
MS. MADENGA: 
Afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours, members of the Defence team, and all colleagues in court.  Today, standing for the Prosecution will be Mr. Kapaya and myself, Renifa Madenga. Thank you, madam.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, the appearance for the Defence. 
MR. SONGA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours, Madam President.  Professor Nyabirungu Mwene Songa, lead counsel for Mika Muhimana, with his legal assistants, to his left Mr. Leopold Munderere, and to his right, Mathias Sahinkuye.  

Good afternoon, colleagues of the Prosecutor's Office.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, professor, you have the floor for the cross-examination. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I believe that when we separated yesterday, I was asking a question to Madam Witness.
WITNESS AX
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SONGA:
Q. I am sorry, I did not greet you, Madam Witness.  Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	I think we were talking about the sudden arrival of Mr. Mika, Sikubwabo, and communal policemen, Manassé Ntwaronzima, Samuel Ruhindura, Rwigimba, and a large civil crowd, a large crowd of civilians.  Madam Witness, it is just at that time where -- when your husband and children died, so my question is, first, regarding your knowledge of the people that you referred to.  In regard to Mika, I don't think you need to answer because I heard what you responded to the Prosecutor, but could you talk to us, for instance, about Mr. Sikubwabo? 
A.	I know Sikubwabo as a bourgmestre of the commune.  I knew him as the person who used to run our commune, and as a neighbour.
Q.	What do you know about a man known as Manassé Ntwaronzima?
A.	He was a member of the communal police, and I was a neighbour to the communal office.
Q.	This is probably the same answer for -- that you will give for Ruhindura and Rwigimba.
A.	It is the same answer, because these two people were working together.
Q.	What was a communal policeman?
A.	I used to hear it said that such-and-such a person was a communal policeman.  To me, a communal policeman is a person who maintains order in the community.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that all these persons that you have just referred to had gone and taken over Antoine Nzamurambaho's house.  Antoine Nzamurambaho was a prosperous trader in Cyanya.  Who is Antoine Nzamurambaho?  
A.	He was a trader in Cyanya, and he was a Tutsi.
Q.	What was his house like?
A.	His house was very beautiful.  It was a house that belonged to a trader, you understand.  I cannot tell you anything about the plan of the house, however, because I am not a construction engineer.
Q.	I should think not.  And what do you mean by his house being taken over?  What happened exactly, Madam Witness?
A.	We went out.  When we learned that the war had begun, as I say, we went out; we stood outside on our hill and we saw assailants looting the house.  They took out the tables, the beds, and they began to destroy the house, and we understood that the attacks had begun.  I was a witness to this looting. 
Q.	Were you still with your husband?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What was your distance from the house of Nzamurambaho?
A.	I was quite close.  I could see the house very clearly, and I could see the people who were there, and I could identify them by their clothes.  They were just -- there was just part of a hill that was between us.
Q.	Can the distances be evaluated, be estimated?
A.	I can tell you that I could see easily.  I could see this place easily because I wasn't far, but I cannot estimate the distance in metres.  But I could see very clearly, and you could hail someone from where I was standing, and you would be heard.  The people who were standing next to this house would have heard us if we had called out to them. 
Q.	Do you maintain that it is a distance of about 10 minutes' walk -- two minutes' walk. 
A.	This distance can be covered in 10 minutes, if you are not hurrying.
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I don't understand what you mean.  Do you want to know was the house fenced?  I don't understand what you mean by fenced.
Q.	We would like to know whether between your house and the outside, there was an obstacle of durable or semi-durable material?
A.	There were houses; there was one in front and one behind.
Q.	You also state, Madam Witness, that Antoine Nzamurambaho was in the house and had realised that his life was in danger, and that is how he escaped through the second door, abandoning his vehicle.  Is this statement correct?
A.	That was my statement.  He left his home, and his wife also left, passing through the window.  She died afterwards in the Ngoma hospital.
Q.	Was he alone in the house?
A.	I was not living in the same house as Antoine; I don't remember the people -- I don't know the people who lived with him; I was not his wife.
Q.	Yes, madam, even if you were not his wife, you were able to know whether he was in danger.
A.	I learnt of it because I saw that people were beginning to destroy his house and to loot his property.  And the assailants went past the Hutu houses to attack the Tutsi houses, and we realised that it was our neighbours who were destroying the houses of Tutsi.  Antoine had problems because the fate of Tutsis had already been decided. 
Q.	My question was, for example, to know whether his wife was not in the house or whether his children were not in the house, and whether they did not face the same danger.
A.	They had the same problem because they were also Tutsi; the children and the wife of Antoine were also Tutsi.  And the wife of Antoine also had to try to leave the house to take refuge somewhere.
Q.	I shall recall that the wife and children were still there. 
A.	The wife and the children were present, but at the time when they left the house, everybody went in a different direction.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that Antoine Nzamurambaho escaped, abandoning his vehicle.  Do you confirm this statement?
A.	I did not see him leaving in a vehicle.  His vehicle stayed on site.  He went away on foot.
Q.	So, at that time you saw the vehicle?
A.	Yes, I could see this place.  I saw the vehicle.  Even if it were a bicycle, I would have seen it.  The vehicle was not parked inside, it was parked outside.
Q.	What was the colour of the vehicle, Madam Witness?
A.	I no longer remember the colour of the vehicle.  I have seen many vehicles.  I don't know the colour of vehicles, and what is more, I have never owned a vehicle.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.
A.	You state that after looting Antoine's house, the same group went to Kanyankware your immediate neighbour; is that correct?
A.	That is correct; he was our neighbour.
Q.	The answer is not - that, I expect, is not that you were neighbours.  My question is, if the assailants went to loot Kanyankware's home.
A.	They went and looted Kanyankware's house.
Q.	Let us come a little -- come back to discuss the looting at Antoine's house.  What property was taken away from Antoine's house?
A.	The assailants did not take the property to my own home.  I saw the assailants taking away chairs, beds and other property that was in the house.  If someone attacks you, he doesn't leave anything for you; his aim is to kill you or to loot all your property.  I see -- I saw the assailants going away with chairs, beds, and you have to know that they did not take these to my home.
Q.	Thank you.  How long did the looting in Antoine's house last?
A.	I did not estimate the number of hours that it took.  I, myself, was afraid.  The situation was a very difficult one.  Everyone was trying to see how to protect their life, so I did not estimate the time that it took.
Q.	Can you not risk any estimates?
A.	What can I tell you?  The assailants left very quickly; they went from house to house, but Antoine had a lot of property.  The assailants could have stayed at his place for about two hours to loot his house.
Q.	Thank you.  And do you have any idea as to the destination of the looted property?
A.	I did not leave with the assailants.  I saw them loot his house.  Mika took property and went to his own way; the other assailants did the same thing.  I did not go with the assailants.
Q.	You state that the wife of Kanyankware had left to go and hide the cows in Bisesero.  Could we have the names -- the names of the wife of Kanyankware?  Since you have only given the surname, the first name?
A.	She is called --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has just given a name which is probably a protected name.  We are waiting on the decision of the Chamber.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You state that Mika and his accomplice Sikubwabo gave the order to remove all the property that was in the house and that all the property was stored, some of it at Mika's house, and others -- and the rest of it taken by the population; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Why do you call Sikubwabo "Mika's accomplice?"
A.	Each time I saw them acting together. 
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, I am not sure whether the protected name has been expunged from the record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It was never spoken.  We never heard it. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, could you please speak into your microphone?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If the name of the lady is mentioned in French or Kinyarwanda delete it from the record, but we have not heard it in English.  It is not mentioned by the English interpreter.  Madam Prosecutor, is that so? 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I thought if it was mentioned in Kinyarwanda or French, most probably then it will be placed under seal.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have ordered it to be deleted from the record. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Indebted, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, when Mika gave the order to his men, did you personally hear this order?
A.	Yes, I heard these orders.  I was quite close to him.  I heard him.  He was talking to them and he said to them, "Loot the crates of beer and the rest of the property and take them away". 
Q.	You state that you were close to Mika?
A.	Yes, I was quite close because the entrance to my courtyard was almost the same as the entrance to this person's courtyard.
Q.	How far were you from Mika when he was giving the orders?
A.	I was quite close to him. 
Q.	And what was this property?
A.	It was the property that belonged to our neighbour and which was in his house.  There were crates of beer and other personal effects that you can find in a house.
Q.	You state that all this property was stored, some it in Mika's house and the rest taken away by the population; is that correct?
A.	The members of the population took away part of the property, and the rest of the property was taken away by Mika.
Q.	Did you identify some of the persons who were taking away Kanyankware's property?
A.	I know the names of some of these persons; for the others, I no longer remember their names.
Q.	What name, for example, if you please?
A.	There is Kayonga, a certain Kayonga, Japhet; there is a certain Rwasibo; there is also Tabaro, Michel Tabaro; and also Nikobahoze.
Q.	Who are they, madam?
A.	They were civilians.
Q.	When Kanyankware's cows were taken to Bisesero, was that the 7th of April in the morning?
A.	Yes; the cows were transported or transferred in the morning.
Q.	Did you see the transfer?
A.	Yes.
Q.	How many cows?
A.	I don't know how many head of cattle.
Q.	Were there many?
A.	There were many.
Q.	More than 20, less than 20?
A.	About ten, not including the calves.
Q.	I thank you.  You state, madam, that after looting Kanyankware's house, the same group went to our house.  Mika took the floor.  Mika spoke and asked you to -- where your husband was, and you said that he was around.  Is that still on the 7th of April?  At what time was it?
A.	It was in the afternoon.
Q.	The same group -- the same group as the one that you described a little earlier?
A.	Other people came to join the assailants who were there before.
Q.	You state that Mika spoke to you.  What was the attitude of the crowd when Mika was speaking to you?
A.	But how do you want me to describe the assailants?  They behaved like assailants because their aim was to kill.
Q.	Were you able, at least, to hear Mika's voice?
A.	But they were there; they had come to the place where I was.
Q.	You state that Mika immediately gave the Interahamwe the order to loot your house; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	In what terms was the order given?
A.	I don't understand what you would like to know.
Q.	How did he express himself?
A.	He said to the assailants to loot the property of Tutsi and to take it away, and that part of the property would be used as reward for the assailants when they returned from the attacks.
Q.	And during this time, what was Charles Sikubwabo doing?
A.	He was part of the assailants and he was encouraging them to carry out the evil acts that they were carrying out.
Q.	And how was he encouraging them?
A.	He encouraged them to loot and to kill people.
Q.	In Kanyankware's house, were people killed there?
A.	No.  On that day, nobody was killed at Kanyankware's house.
Q.	Had you had the opportunity of discussing the looting of Kanyankware's property with his wife?
A.	No, I did not have this opportunity.
Q.	You refer to Interahamwe, madam.  What, in your view, are the Interahamwe?
A.	It was said that they were -- it was the Interahamwe who carried out massacres.  Interahamwe meant Hutus who killed Tutsi.
Q.	So, in your understanding, it could be said that Interahamwe -- you could say Interahamwe and mean the Hutu?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did they have any distinctive signs?  How did you recognise them?
A.	I could not fail to identify them because they were armed, and they killed all Tutsis on their way.
Q.	So, you can improve on the definition of Interahamwe and say that the Interahamwe are armed Hutu; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  It was being said that the Interahamwe were Hutus committing massacres, and I could see them carrying weapons.
Q.	Can we say that Mika was the head of the Interahamwe in Gishyita?
A.	Yes, he was the leader because he was the secteur, conseiller.
Q.	Do you mean that it was conseiller du secteur who were leaders of the Interahamwe?
A.	Of course.
Q.	And what were the bourgmestre in relation to the Interahamwe?
A.	The bourgmestre and the conseiller acted in joint accord, because whatever the conseiller did was done under the instructions of the bourgmestre.
Q.	Can we also call a préfet, a leader of Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, he was also a leader of the Interahamwe because, in his capacity as préfet, he did not call on people to stop such acts but he, instead, called on his subordinates to kill Tutsis, so he was the one giving the orders.
Q.	And the cellule leaders, could they also be called leaders of the Interahamwe?
A.	At all levels, they acted in accordance with the orders that were given to them by their superiors.
Q.	(Microphone not activated) ... right, but please answer my question: Were the leaders of the cellule also leaders of the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, of course, they were leaders of the Interahamwe at their level and the nyumbakumi.  All of them were the same.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, these positions you have talked about, nyumbakumi, cellule, commune, were not -- none of them were occupied by Tutsis, held by Tutsis?
THE WITNESS:
No, there were no Tutsis holding those positions.  The Tutsis who held positions went into hiding like the other members of the population who were Tutsi.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Continue, Witness; proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I believe I have some knowledge of the structures and of certain personalities.  Let me give an example.  In Gisenyi, it was a préfecture; and the préfet, was he a Hutu or a Tutsi?
A.	He was Hutu.
Q.	To my knowledge, he was known as Nshunguyinka; was he Tutsi?
A.	Is he still alive?
Q.	Madam, please don't put questions to me; instead, answer my questions.

Witness, to your knowledge, was there any relationship between Interahamwe and political parties?
A.	I am not a politician.  I do not have any knowledge of such matters.
Q.	And the property that was looted in the last location, where was it carried to?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you have mentioned which property?  Please specify.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.  It was a simple question regarding where the property that was looted was taken to.  I am putting this question to the witness because she was very clear as regards the destination of property looted in Antoine's house.  She said that some of the property was stored in Mika's house and the other was taken away by the population.  That was why I wanted her to clarify the destination of the property looted in Kanyakwari's home. 
THE WITNESS:
The same destination as property looted in Antoine's house.  

By the way, I did not follow them to know where they took the property to, but I suppose that the looters took the property to their homes.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Now, Witness, let us talk about the property that was looted in your own house; what happened to that property?
A.	The property that was looted in my home received the same fate as the property that was looted in other people's homes; it was carried away.
Q.	The question I am asking to you is, what happened, because I do not believe that the looting was carried out in the same way everywhere because it was not the same kind of property everywhere.  In your home, what happened?  I am not yet talking about where the property was taken to.  I just want to know what happened in your home.
A.	They came; they entered the house; they looted the property and they also looted cattle; and they removed the roof.  So these attacks were very well organised.
Q.	How was your house?  What did it look like?  Could you please describe your house to us?  Was there a boys' quarters?  If so, let us know.
A.	There were two houses, one in front and another behind it. 
Q.	You stated that your husband asked you to flee with your five children to your parents' home.  Where were your parents living, and what was the distance between your home and the home of your parents?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, ask one question per question.  If you asked the witness more than one question, she won't know which one to answer.  So go question by question.  Where was the home; how far was it; and so forth. 
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Let me start with the first question.  Where were your parents living?
A.	We were living in the same secteur.  It was very close to my home, so they were my neighbours.
Q.	What cellule was that?
A.	They were resident in (Name struck from the record, by order of the Court) cellule.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is protected information, Professor. 
MR. SONGA: 
I crave your indulgence, Madam President.  I will make an effort not to divulge the witness's identity.  

Nevertheless, could we put this question to the witness regarding the distance between her home and her parents' home? 
MS. MADENGA: 
Again, Your Honour, with your leave, if that information could be expunged from the records.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think she has only given the name of the cellule; she has not given the specific location of the house.

You want us to remove -- to delete the name of the cellule, too?
MS. MADENGA: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let the name of the cellule be deleted from the record. 
MS. MADENGA: 
Thank you, madam. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, you state that on the 7th of April, at night, you arrived in your parents' home with the children, and you hid them with your mother; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Do you confirm that after you went to your parents' home with your children, your husband went to Bisesero?
A.	Yes.  He went to the region of Bisesero. 
Q.	Do you also confirm that when you arrived in your parents' home, you went to your plot to look for food for yourself and your mother?
A.	Yes, I went to my farms.
Q.	And you also state that once you arrived in the farm, you observed that the crops had been looted?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, are you okay? 
THE WITNESS:
I am feeling tired, Madam President.
MS. MADENGA: 
To assist the Court, Madam President, maybe if you can ascertain from the witness both -- yesterday she indicated, before starting her testimony, that she has a backache, so that might be part of the problem.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you continue with your statement for a while, for half an hour?
THE WITNESS:
I am suffering from an illness which often makes me tired.  That is why I feel tired.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You need a short break.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I need a short break.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we take a short break for 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1440H to 1500H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is in session now.  

Madam Witness, how are you now?

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone is not on. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you proceed now?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, you may continue.  I am going to try.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before you proceed with the cross-examination, Professor, we may remind you that you have already taken -- 

Is it okay, Professor?  Sorry, Professor.  Professor, are you okay?
MR. SONGA: 
I think so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Professor, we want to remind you that you have already taken one-and-a-half hours.  You should keep that in mind, and I hope you finish before we take a short break at 4:30. 
MR. SONGA.
Madam President, we indeed have a problem.  As you will certainly have realised yesterday or the day before yesterday, we are somewhat dissatisfied because we have not been able to finish all the questions that we prepared for the witness.  

You know that the witnesses who testify are the Prosecutor's witnesses.  The Prosecutor has worked with them for years, and we have to listen to them for a very short time.  But for us, it is the very first time that we are meeting them, and it is not always easy to determine the time that we need to ask all our questions.  And as you can indeed imagine, Madam President, if we do not ask some questions, we shall leave with a feeling that truth and justice have not been realised. 

All we can promise you, Madam President, and this is a request, is that we should make an effort not to put questions that would waste time.  There are necessary questions which we suspended, especially in regard to Witness AP, and we do not want that there be questions that are not put to any witness.  If we could crave your indulgence in this regard, we would be eternally grateful. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please proceed now. 
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I asked the question  --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, before you go on, I am concerned that there is a feeling that justice and the truth might not come out.  It is the intention of this Court to do whatever it can to get the truth and justice coming out.  

When the President has drawn your attention to the time span, she is doing so because as a cross-examiner -- all of us have been cross-examiners at certain times -- one does sometimes get carried away and one doesn't remember the time frame that we are trying to work to.  We would not want you to be in a position where you say you have not asked questions you had wanted to ask, but we would wish you keep it in mind so that you don't necessarily ask questions which are not useful to what you are trying to do or which are just time making or time spending, so that we can try and keep to the schedule that has been cut out for us as well.  

So, we would wish that you would just keep it in mind in asking questions.  But we would want you to go home feeling that you have been fully heard by this Court. 
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I think that our concerns are one and the same, and we promise to do all in our power not to waste time.  

Madam President, I was asking a question regarding distance between the house of the witness and the cellule of the parents, but since sometimes we come up against the problem of witness protection, would you permit that she give us this information on a piece of paper; that is, information regarding the position of cellule where she lives and the cellule of her parents, so that we can determine whether or not there is a cellule between these two?  With your permission, Madam President.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, I thought she said she lived in the same cellule with her parents, or is it the same secteur?
MR. SONGA: 
I crave your indulgence, Your Honour.  They live in the same secteur, but the cellules are different.  

First, since we have focused on the cellules, we -- and by so doing, we might disclose the witness's identity, that is why I suggested that this question be answered in writing, giving the names of the cellules in question.  Either her cellule and her parents' cellule are neighbouring cellules, or there is a cellule between these two. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, first ask the question whether they are living in the same cellule or in a different cellule and whether they are neighbouring or not neighbouring, and whether there are other cellules in between their cellules.

MR. SONGA:
You will understand the reason for the question as the cross-examination continues.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, are you residing in the same cellule as your parents? 
THE WITNESS:
It was two different cellules.  We lived in the same secteur, but it was two different cellules, neighbouring cellules though.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
They were neighbouring cellules.  Did you get the question -- the answer, professor?
MR. SONGA: 
Yes.  But I don't think that this is consistent with the truth.  There has to be a cellule between these two.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, is there any other cellule in between the cellule where you lived and where your parents lived?
THE WITNESS:
There was another cellule that was next to these two, but it was not between them because, as you see, where we lived -- from where we lived, I could call out to a person who was in my parents' house and I would be heard.
MR. SONGA: 
Madam President, if the witness could write this down on a piece of paper for us?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registry, give the witness a piece of paper.

Madam Witness, the first one is the name of your cellule?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is the cellule where my residence was found.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the second one is your parents' cellule?  Can you write it down, too?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.
MR. SONGA: 
Madam President, with your leave, we would like to enter this document as an exhibit for the Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This will be admitted as Exhibit D. 4 
(Exhibit No. D. 4 admitted)

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, could you tell us the distance between these two locations?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, between the cellules or between the residences -- house, her house and house of her parents?
MR. SONGA: 
That's exact -- that's the clarification I want, Madam President. 
THE WITNESS:
Between the two houses, you might cover this distance walking for about 20 minutes.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you.  The question I was asking before the break was requesting confirmation of the statement that when you got to the farm to look for food for the children, you realised that the farm had been looted and that there was nothing else -- nothing more to harvest; is that correct?
A.	The assailants were looting the harvest.  There was only a little part of the harvest left.
Q.	May we look at the statement and see what you said?  "One day when I reached the farm, I realised that it had been visited by looters so much so that I had nothing to give to the children and to my mother."  Is that your statement?
A.	I couldn't give anything either to my mother or to my children because the looters did not authorise me to harvest my own produce in my farm.  There was a little of the harvest left, but I couldn't get to the farm because the looters prevented me from getting to it.
Q.	Do you understand, Madam Witness, that either there was nothing or there was something; what is the truth?
A.	The truth is that the looters were looting -- were in the process of looting, and I could also go and harvest a little of the produce, but the looters prevented me from doing so because they said that the products of the looting would be used as a reward for the assailants.
Q.	On this particular point, we may say that your previous statement is not truthful.
A.	My statement is truthful.  I said that I found the looters in the form -- in the farm and they were looting, and I couldn't harvest the produce from my farm because these looters were looting the produce, and because they prevented me from harvesting anything.
Q.	We would like to -- that it be included in the transcripts that there is a difference between the witness statement and what the witness is stating at this time, because the statement says -- the written statement says, "I noticed that the looters had visited the farm so that I had nothing to give to the children". 

The question is:  The looted farm and the farm to which you were requiring authorisation to gain access, are they the same?
A.	We had several farms.  Some had been completely looted and others had not been looted yet.
Q.	So you are referring to different farms?
A.	Yes, they were different farms because we farmed several plots.
JUDGE MUTHOGA.
What crops did you farm?
THE WITNESS:
We had beans, which were ready to be harvested, as well as sweet potato. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How far were these farms from your parents' house?
A.	There was a little distance which I could cover in 20 minutes, if I were walking.
Q.	And you used to walk this distance regularly, didn't you?
A.	Yes, I regularly covered this distance when I went to get the harvest.
Q.	Was there no danger on the road?
A.	There were people on the road on roadblocks, and when I got to the roadblocks I asked them to let me go through, considering that it was not I that they were looking for; they were looking only for my family and my children. 
Q.	So, you had a pass?
A.	I didn't have a pass.  These people stood at roadblocks and monitored the passing of people from the other ethnic group.  So, there were no passes; we were not going abroad.  These were people from the same area as ourselves.
Q.	When Mika received your request for authorisation, instead of granting you authorisation, what did he do?  He wrote three letters to the nyumbakumi; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	So, there were two addressees -- three addressees for Mika's letter?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And these three nyumbakumi are called Micobo, Seth and Rwasibo. 
A.	That's correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, were the letters in respect of the same farms or different farms?
THE WITNESS:
These letters were referring to different farms.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How do you explain that a certain Jeremy Ngamije was able to show you this letter, whereas, apparently, he was not one of the three nyumbakumi to whom the letter was addressed?
A.	It was because he lived quite close to these farms.
Q.	So Mika wrote four letters?
A.	The letter was passed around because they ran -- or they were leaders in the same cellule. 
Q.	So the letters were not written to three nyumbakumi, but to four?
A.	There were three nyumbakumi, and these three nyumbakumi sent the letter to the other one who was living close to these farms. 
Q.	As a nyumbakumi or as someone who lived near the farms?
A.	They wrote to him as a neighbour in -- of the farms.
Q.	You state that you kept this letter, along with the identity card of your mother, and that when your mother was killed, you were no longer able to find the letter; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What is the link between the death of your mother and the disappearance of the letter, since she was not the one who was keeping the letter?
A.	I kept them together, and I lost them after the looting of this place.
Q.	So, there is no link with the death of your mother?
A.	After killing her and the children, they looted, and we lost the documents because -- because we were in distress.
Q.	So, there was looting in the house of the parents?
A.	Yes, they came and looted my parents' home.  They looted our property.
Q.	Does this appear in any of your statements, previous statements or statements made before the Court?
A.	I stated that I lost the documents amongst the documents that my mother had, but I did not mention the looting in my parents' house. 
Q.	Today you can state that there was looting in your parents' house?
A.	I did not say so in my statements.  I was concerned with the property that was looted in my husband's house.
Q.	That is right, but we may be able to find out the truth still.  Was there looting in your parents' house or not?  
A.	They looted the property that I have moved.  I had moved from my house to my parents' house.  They did not, however, loot my parents' property.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  And what -- on what date did you visit Mika to request leave to go and harvest from your farm?
A.	It was before the death of these children.
Q.	Can you give -- can you not give us even an approximate date?
A.	I no longer remember the dates.
Q.	Would you accept my help? 
A.	Do you want to help me to remember the dates?
Q.	That is correct, madam.
A.	I no longer remember any dates, except perhaps if you were to give me the file so that I would look at the dates, and then I would be able to identify it from the file.
Q.	Are you accepting or rejecting my offer of help?
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, Madam President, I am not very sure about the specific help he wants to offer.  Let's say that he wants Madam Witness to refresh her memory, I am not very clear about the nature of the assistance my learned colleague wants to tender to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, how do you want to help the witness, with respect?
MR. SONGA:
If the Prosecutor had been patient, he would have known that immediately -- she would have known that immediately.  In the statement I have before me, the witness states, "The next day, on the 26th of May 1994, news of the capture of my husband reached me, as having been carried out by the Interahamwe, Mika, Sikubwabo and Ruzindana."  

My only assistance that I wanted to offer is that if she was able to say that the 26th of May was the day following the day on which Mika wrote to the nyumbakumi, it means that the visit to Mika's office should have been on the 24th -- 25th of May.  That was all I was driving at, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can proceed, professor. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You take long routes, professor. 
MR. SONGA: 
There is nothing one can do, if one's offer of help is denied. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You state, Madam Witness, that the next day, on the 26th of May, the news of the capture of your husband by Mika got to you and that, according to your informer, your husband had been taken to Gishyita in front of Mika's house, which is at the centre of Cyanya.  At what time did this news reach you?
A.	It was about 12 o'clock.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Who informed you?
A.	It was people who were coming down from Gishyita and who were saying that my husband had been captured.
Q.	So, it was not one informer, but several?
A.	It was pupils who were returning from school. 
Q.	I shall repeat my question:  It was not one informer, it was several?  Where was your husband captured, on what hill?
A.	He was captured on Mpatsi hill
Q.	Was it -- did news of the capture arrive you -- or reach you on the same day?
A.	Yes, it was the same day.
Q.	And did your informers tell you about the origin of this Interahamwe who had captured your husband?
A.	They told me that my husband had been captured and I went to see for myself, and I found these Interahamwe there.
Q.	No, my question is:  Was it on the same day that the news of the capture reached you?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She answered that, professor.  She said yes. 
MR. SONGA:
I am grateful, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Where did the Interahamwe come from?
A.	The Interahamwe came from various places and they were led by Mika, and even the bourgmestre, Ruzindana, and others, many other Interahamwe.
Q.	Can I quote an extract from your statement regarding the origins of these Interahamwe?  You state, "When I arrived, the major road leading to Ngoma, Interahamwe blocked the road to Mika's house against me and from which I could see my husband sitting on the ground wearing his jacket in front of Mika, Sikubwabo, Ruzindana and Ryandakaye, and many Interahamwe who had come from Cyangugu."  Can you confirm the origin of these Interahamwe, or is your version going to change?
A.	Yes, I confirm this statement.
Q.	Would you -- could you note the difference between what you said earlier, that they came from many places, and the statement you have just confirmed, to the effect that they came from Cyangugu?
A.	These Interahamwe were mixed.  There were some who had come from Cyangugu.  They all met in the same place before they went to kill Tutsi.
Q.	So the statement that you signed on the 23rd -- 27th of January includes a mistake?
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, in that sentence, the witness mentions Interahamwe twice.  The second time, she indicates that many Interahamwe came from Cyangugu, but in the first instance, she does not state where the Interahamwe came from.  So, it doesn't necessarily mean that is an inconsistency.
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you for that interpretation, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	At the time when you got the news, where were you, precisely?
A.	I was very near my parents' home.
Q.	Not in your parents' home, but very close to your parents' home; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	For how long did you stay in your parents' home?
A.	I stayed in my parents' home throughout the period of the war.
Q.	Can you confirm to us that you didn't go anywhere else?
A.	I went nowhere else.
Q.	Thank you.  You have already talked to us about Mika and Sikubwabo, but who is Ruzindana?
A.	Ruzindana was a young man who lived in Mugonero, and he used to kill people in cooperation with Mika.
Q.	Could you please answer my question without straying, otherwise we won't ask all the questions.  And Ryandikayo, under what circumstances did you know him?
A.	He used to live in Mubuga and he incited Interahamwe to kill people.  I had known him for nine years. 
MR. SONGA:
If Judge Short will allow me, I will ask the question of the witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How did you know that the Interahamwe who killed your husband came from Cyangugu?
A.	I could not know the names of the Interahamwe who hailed from Cyangugu, and people were saying that they were Interahamwe who came from Cyangugu to assist the Interahamwe in our area.
Q.	You state that when you succeeded to stand five metres away from your husband, the cousin of your father known as (.............................) dissuaded you from going towards your husband because they said you were running the risk of being killed; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How did you succeed to get as close as five metres to your husband?
A.	We were no longer afraid.  I took a risk and I went very close to my husband, and we spoke to one another, and he heard that our daughter had been killed.
Q.	We'll get there, Witness.  

When you stood at a distance of five metres from him, did you feel safe?
A.	How could I have felt safe?  I met all those problems.
Q.	You state that you spoke with your husband, and that is how you heard about the capture of your elder daughter and that she was killed on the same day with your mother, and that is the 26th of May; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Was she in the same Mpatsi hideout?
A.	Yes, my daughter had hidden in Mpatsi.  I had hidden her in Mpatsi after her brothers had been killed.
Q.	In order to talk to your husband, did you seek permission?
A.	How could I have sought permission, whereas I, myself, was looking for an opportunity to flee?  I did not seek any permission.  I would have run the risk of being killed, or they would have killed him before my eyes or they would have crucified him at the spot called Aratay (phonetic) -- on the tree at the spot called Aratay. 
Q.	And who told you of the death of your mother?
A.	I heard about it myself.  I learnt about it myself because she was hiding in the vicinity.  Nobody informed me.
Q.	Let us go back a little.  You said that she was killed with your eldest daughter; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you did not get to know about the death of your daughter yourself, you heard about it from your husband?
A.	My husband told me that he was informed of the death of my daughter, but I, myself, had already heard about it.
Q.	At what time did you hear of the death of your eldest daughter?
A.	I do not recall the time.
Q.	You state that you waited there to see what kind of death your husband would be subjected to.  For how long did you stay there?
A.	A few minutes -- a few hours.
MR. SONGA:
I don't know whether the translation is faithful.  I believe I heard "a short while", whereas in the translation, I've heard a few minutes and a few hours.  Can we clarify the translation?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, this suggests that you know Kinyarwanda?
MR. SONGA: 
You are right, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Translator, please clarify the position.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter -- the Kinyarwanda interpreter corrects that the witness indeed said "a short while". 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	And it was still while you were standing at five metres distance from your husband?
A.	I was unable to estimate the distance in metres.  I could not measure the distance.
Q.	I asked this question because, Witness, I am relying on your statement.  You said that you managed to go and stand at a distance of five metres from your husband.
A.	Yes, I was still there, and when he fled I was still there.  And when he fled, I left that spot; I could not continue standing there.
Q.	We gathered from your statement, Witness, that your mother and your daughter were in the same hideout and that they were killed at the same time.  My question to you now is whether that event preceded the death of the other children or whether it came after their deaths?  I just want you to clarify this matter.
A.	They died after the other children.
Q.	Does that mean that on the 26th of May, all the other children had died?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, are you okay?
THE WITNESS:
No. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, how much more of this have you got to go?  Can you do some estimate? 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honours, I believe that you have already learned to mistrust my estimates.  Each time I give them I usually take up more time than estimated.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I am hoping that, because you have been at this for two hours or so, you can now see that you have another so many minutes so that if we take our short break now, you will be able to wind up in another half an hour, 15 minutes or something.  I'm just trying to find out what your scope is to help planning.
MR. SONGA: 
I do not believe, Your Honours -- if you could allow me a lot more than 30 minutes, maybe I will get by.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you continue for half an hour?
THE WITNESS:
I cannot withstand the stress.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we take short break for 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed at 1550H)
(Pages 1 to 21 by Judith Baverstock)













(Court resumed at 1613H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings in the court are resumed.  Professor, please proceed with your cross-examination. 
MR. SONGA:
I'm grateful, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Before the break, I had just asked a question which received the following answer: "On 26th of May 1994, the day on which the mother, the eldest daughter and the husband were killed, all the other children had already died."  

At this time my question is as follows:  During yesterday's testimony, in response to the question that was put to you, Madam Witness, as follows: "You indicated in your statement that your children were killed, but what happened to your mother?"  This is the transcript, page 51 of the transcript, line 24.  And the answer that we have before us is, "My mother was killed at the same time as my children." 

Madam Witness, the Defence would like you to clarify this statement because there is a clear contradiction.  If it is established that your mother and your eldest daughter, as well as your husband, were killed on 26th of May, if at the same time all the other children had been killed, that is before 26th of May, how can you say that your mother died on 26th of May?  We would like you to clarify this so that we can get at the truth in the chronology of facts.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone is not on.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, repeat. 
THE WITNESS:
The reason for which I stated that my mother died at the same time as my children is that I wanted to say that she died a few days after the death of my children, and that is when she died with my eldest daughter, and in my statement it was written that she had died at the same time as my children.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In the statement that we have before us, you state -- we are here referring to the statement that was signed on 27th January, and we are towards the end of such statement.  You state in this statement that, "My three children were hiding in the banana plantation where Mika and his men discovered them.  Since I was in another hiding place not far from there, when my children screamed, I came out of my hiding place, and that is when I saw Mika standing on an embankment surrounded by several of his Interahamwe.  On his orders I went towards him, as well as my children and my mother, and he made us sit down.  The killing began with my child, with my baby, because they said that Kagame had been exiled when he was that age.  They threw him, and as he fell, his head hit the wall of my parents' house.  The other ones were killed using clubs, spears and other traditional weapons.  Only my mother was killed afterwards."  

Could you tell us what "later" was in relation to your mother's death?
A.	She was not killed immediately at the same time as my children.
Q.	How long after that was she killed?
A.	She was killed afterwards, after the children had been killed.
Q.	Was it on the same day?
A.	She was killed after the children were killed.
Q.	Yes, I am asking for clarification, Madam Witness.  One hour afterwards; two hours afterwards; one week afterwards; one month afterwards?  That is what I would like to know.
A.	It was two days later.
Q.	Are we still referring to the 26th?
A.	Are you referring to the deaths of my children or the killing of my mother? 
Q.	I am referring to the killing of your mother.
A.	I no longer remember the dates.  I wasn't verifying the dates.  It was not my job.  I did not have to find out the dates, so I could not know on what date she was killed.
Q.	Is it possible to estimate the time between the deaths of the children and the death of the mother?
A.	It was on the same days.  It was on those days when my children were killed.  First my children were killed and then my mother followed.
Q.	May we gather that the mother and the eldest daughter were killed on the same day -- and the husband?
A.	They were killed on the same day.
Q.	May we ask you to confirm that you were present at each instance?
A.	I was present.
Q.	For the mother, it was in Mpatsi, for the husband it was in Gishyita, and for the eldest daughter it was in Mpatsi.  What space or period of time separated these two events?  What period of time enabled you to be present both in Gishyita and in Mpatsi?
A.	My child was not killed in Mpatsi.  She was hiding in Mpatsi.  My mother was hiding close to her house, and the child was taken to where my mother was found, and she was killed at this place.  My daughter was not killed in Mpatsi; she was hiding in Mpatsi.
Q.	You state that your husband was accused of having links with either Inkotashi (phonetic), since a letter to that effect was found at his house.  Who were the Inkotashi -- who were the Inkotanyi?
A.	It was said that the Inkotanyi were people who were out of the country and who wanted to come back to the country.  It was also said that the Inkotanyi wanted their colleagues who were within the country to send them contributions.  It was then said that our husbands were sending contributions the RPF and that documents had been found to this effect.
Q.	So the Inkotanyi is another name for the RPF?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And about this letter, was there indeed a letter that was found?
A.	The document was not shown to me, but people said that they had seen this document.  If the looters found this document indeed amongst the property that they took, I don't know.
Q.	Madam Witness, please describe to us how your husband was able to get rid of the robes that tied him, in the middle of a great group of Interahamwe?
A.	From Cyangugu, regarding the way in which he loosened his robes, first he had been tied using his very old coat that he was wearing.  He struggled, he was able to loosen his robes, because the assailants said that they were going to torture him to death and they said that they will cut off part of his genitals, but he was able to loosen his bonds.
Q.	Before we get to the case of policeman Charles, I would like to come back a little and ask you this question:  When your children were killed, how did the Interahamwe treat you?
A.	I was being beaten up.  The Interahamwe beat me often and tortured me because once a person was arrested with Tutsi children, they asked that person to kill the children, or they beat the person, sometimes killed that person.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You stated that policeman Charles, who was then in service in the Gishyita commune, but who lived in Bisesero, had, a week beforehand -- had beforehand been captured by the group of Mika, Sikubwabo and Ruzindana.  Do you confirm this statement?
A.	I confirm this statement.
Q.	And who was this policeman, Charles?
A.	He was a communal policeman before the war, and he was a Tutsi.
Q.	Do you have any idea even of the approximate date of his capture?
A.	I do not know the date.
Q.	When you refer to the group of Mika, Sikubwabo and Ruzindana, were they the only people you could identify, or were there other people?
A.	There were many other people that I was not able to identify at that time.
Q.	Did you see Charles in person?
A.	I saw him.
Q.	Does this statement -- is this statement in line with your statement of yesterday?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	With your permission, I should like to refresh your memory.  I am referring to page 40 of the transcripts, line 25.  "Did you see Charles with your own eyes?"  That was the question, and you answered, "I saw his genitals which had been castrated."  "Let us go back in time.  You say that you heard the beating of drums, and I would like to know whether from that time you saw Charles?"  Answer: "I went up after the others and people were saying that he had been castrated, and when I arrived on site, I realised that his genitals were being exhibited."  Question: "Did you see Charles in the crowd?"  Answer: "He was already dead."

Do you have any other clarifications to provide?  In the absence of any such clarification, the Defence would like to point out that the two versions cannot both be true, that there is a lie somewhere.  I am going to explain by citing from your statement once more.  

In the statement of 27th January, you claimed that you had hurried to Mika's house to identify the person in question, who was no other than Charles.  You were saying that he was standing in the midst of Interahamwe who were asking him about his weapon, and then the bourgmestre arrived and Charles was tied up, and between the statement of yesterday and the statement you made on 27th of January, are you trying to tell us that we have three different versions?  This should be included in the transcripts?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, you mentioned a statement of 27 January.  Which statement are you referring to? 
MR. SONGA:
I'm grateful, Madam President.  In the document given to my by the Prosecutor, it referred to the document of 16th December 1999 which, from all indications, was signed on 27th of January 2000.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. SONGA:
I am equally grateful, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, you said that it was signed on 27th of January? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You stated that the bourgmestre gave the spear to the bourgmestre (sic) saying that he was setting an example that every Tutsi who was captured by him would be treated in the same manner.  The Defence would like to you clarify this matter.  How come you state in this statement that the genitals were circulated in Gishyita centre, and at the same time you state that all that happened in front of Mika's house?  Can you explain to us with regard to this geographical setting whether Gishyita centre was the space in front of Mika's house, or was Mika's house in Gishyita centre?  Witness, we would like to you clarify this matter. 
A.	It was in the courtyard of that centre, and it was part of the courtyard that was in front of Mika's house in the middle of the centre.
Q.	In administrative terms, does the Gishyita centre not signify a specific entity, a specific location?
A.	Yes, the administration knows that centre because meetings were held in that centre, and that centre is considered as a town in that area.
Q.	And that centre which is considered as a town, do you consider it as a location in front of Mika's house?
A.	Yes.  The centre was in front of Mika's house.  The centre has buildings all round and Mika's house is in that centre.
Q.	Can we also say that the centre is in front of the other houses, apart from Mika's house?
A.	Yes.  The centre is surrounded by those houses, namely the house in which meetings were held, and that house was surrounded by other houses.
Q.	So you don't mean to say that it was Mika's house.  It was in front of many other houses?
A.	Yes, it was also in front of other people's houses, because Mika is not the only person who has a house in that area.  There are other houses in that area.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You stated that when the French troops arrived, pictures were taken by those troops, pictures of the genitals of that police officer, and thereafter the genitals were brought down in your presence.  What do you mean by your presence?
A.	The French arrived.  We were told that they were coming to provide for the security of genocide survivors.  We all went to see who was a survivor and who was coming out of the forest to move towards the French, and the people who were on the spot showed the French people the place where Charles' genitals, had been killed, were displayed, and the French soldiers photographed the genitals.
Q.	When did the French troops arrive in Gishyita?
A.	I do not recall the date, but it was towards the end of the month of June.
Q.	From the time when the genitals were cut and suspended on the tree and the time when the genitals were displayed on the tree, how much time would you make that?
A.	The genitals were decomposed and dried up.  It took quite some time.
Q.	Quite some time?  Can you give us a more precise idea?
A.	I wasn't paying attention to that because I did not have time to think about the period between when the genitals were cut and the time when they were photographed.
Q.	You say that the genitals were in a state of decomposition?
A.	The genitals had dried up on the pole.
Q.	Witness, you used two expressions.  If you would allow me, I will ask two questions for the purposes of clarification.  After a short while, were the genitals decomposed or dried up?
A.	The genitals dried up.
Q.	Thank you.  You stated that in late June 1994, Mika, Sikubwabo, Ruzindana and a group of killers from Cyangugu got down from Bisesero hill the head and the genitals of Kabanda, Assiel.  Do you confirm that statement?
A.	Yes.  They came down with that head.
Q.	And how did you once more identify those killers from Cyangugu in that period of late June 1994?
A.	Everyone knew that the Interahamwe from Cyangugu had come to give a hand to the Interahamwe in Gishyita.  I heard people say that there were other Interahamwe who looked like animals and who had come from Cyangugu to give a hand to the Interahamwe of Gishyita in the killings of Tutsi in Bisesero.
Q.	Did they come with their leader?
A.	I was unable to find out who their leader was, but I learnt that the assistants of Interahamwe who had come from Cyangugu who had been more experienced had been sought.
Q.	And you saw with your own eyes when they were bringing Kabanda's head and genitals?
A.	After the drum was beaten and it was announced that the body or the head of Kabanda had been brought down, everybody ran to see what was happening, because whenever the drums were beaten, everyone ran to see who had been captured.
Q.	Who was holding Kabanda's head?
A.	The head was brought down on board a vehicle.
Q.	Who brought it down?
A.	It was on board the vehicle carrying Mika and the bourgmestre, and the bourgmestre was carrying the head.
Q.	Who brought down the head, please?  Who was holding the head, please?
A.	The Interahamwe were holding the head.  They brought it out of the vehicle and they hung it on a spear and exhibiting it and saying, "Kabanda has returned. Members of the population should bring coffee to him.  He is back and he can buy their coffee." 
Q.	Were many people holding the head or was just one person, one Interahamwe, holding the head?
A.	There was one Interahamwe who was holding it at the end of a spear and exhibiting it and saying, "Kabanda, the buyer of coffee, is back.  All you have to do is to bring coffee to him so that he should buy it," and that Interahamwe was surrounded by other Interahamwe who had come down from Bisesero.
Q.	And who was holding the genitals?
A.	The genitals were also held by the Interahamwe who had been in Gishyita.
Q.	Was it just one Interahamwe or several Interahamwe holding it?
A.	It was only one Interahamwe who was holding the genitals, but he was surrounded by other Interahamwes, and the person who was holding the genitals was exhibiting them.
Q.	Who hung the genitals?
A.	Mika asked that the genitals be hung on Kabanda's -- on the door of Kabanda's house.
Q.	Where was the head hung up?
A.	The head was hung up on the door of that person.
Q.	And the genitals as well?
A.	The head was hung on one of the doors.
Q.	You state that Ndoriyobijya was -- seeing the head of his friend in a state of decomposition, removed it and threw it in the toilet.  Who was Ndoriyobijya?
A.	Ndoriyobijya was an old Hutu man who lived in that centre.
Q.	What powers did he have?
A.	He was a trader who had a business, and at one time he stopped trading and he had become an old man.
Q.	When did he remove Kabanda's head?
A.	It was shortly after the head was hung on that spot and after it had started decaying.
Q.	Witness, did you witness that event or you only heard about it?  Did you see it with your own eyes or you only heard about it?
A.	Nobody told me about it.  I saw that head hanging on the door with my own eyes.  By the way, up till this point, there is a sign indicating that the head was hung there. 
Q.	To be more precise, did you witness the removal of the head from where it was hung?
A.	Yes, I witnessed that fact, or that event.
Q.	And you state that his genitals were removed later.  When was that?
A.	I do not recall the date.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You state that in late April 1994, prior to the assassination or the murder of your husband by Mika, a message was sent to you and you heeded the message and went to meet him in the secteur office; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	You state that it was in late April.  Can you be more specific as to exactly when that was?
A.	I stated to you that I wasn't paying attention to dates.  That is why I cannot recall the date.
Q.	How was the invitation sent to you?
A.	The invitation was brought to me by an Interahamwe.
Q.	Only one Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, only one Interahamwe.
Q.	That you knew?
A.	Yes, I knew him.
MR. SONGA:
The translation is not faithful. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	That you knew at the time of the events?
A.	I knew that Interahamwe.
Q.	You knew that he could be the bearer of an invitation from Mika?
A.	That Interahamwe told me so.
Q.	And you were in your parents' house, isn't it?
A.	Yes, I was in my parents' house.
Q.	Was it normal that a conseiller should send an invitation to a citizen?
A.	Yes, it was normal.  Whenever he wanted to see somebody, he sent a summons to him or her, or he came to see that person.
Q.	Was that the first summons you were receiving from Mika?
A.	Yes, that was the first invitation.
Q.	Why do you say that it was normal?
A.	Even before the war, when an official wanted to meet somebody, he sent an invitation to that person and the person came and saw the conseiller.
Q.	Was that before or after he refused you permission to go and harvest your crops?
A.	It was afterwards.
Q.	How did you feel when you responded to the invitation?
A.	I felt ill at ease.
Q.	Were you afraid?
A.	Yes, I was afraid.
Q.	You state, or you stated yesterday in examination-in-chief, that Mika undressed you brutally and that he raped you.  You also said that you were wearing kitenge loins; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	However, when we read the statement of 27 January 2000, we find that you undressed yourself.  Maybe you would like to see the exact passage.  It is the last page of your statement, first paragraph, line 6.  "Since his weapon was next by, I did what he wanted me to do by undressing me, myself, while the Interahamwe were drinking beer outside."  Isn't that your statement?
A.	Yes, it is what I stated, but that was on the second occasion.
Q.	Witness, that was not on the second occasion.  We are dealing with the first paragraph, which starts with the words, "Towards late April 1994, prior to the murder of my husband by Mika, and in answer to an invitation sent by him to me, I went to meet him in the secteur office," and that is where you state that, "He got up, got me by the neck and pulled me and told me if I resisted he would kill me with his gun.  Since his gun was next to him, I obeyed what he asked of me and undressed myself."  That was during the first invitation.

The second invitation which you refer to is in the second paragraph.  We were only dealing with the first invitation.  We can gain time by noting that you gave two contradictory statements which cannot both be true, so there must be a lie somewhere.  Did you tell a lie in the statement or you told a lie yesterday?
A.	In my statement, I stated that he was standing next to me, was carrying a gun, and he told me to obey his orders, so to say that I lied here is not truthful.  It was on the second occasion that I obeyed his instructions because I was seeing his gun, I could see his gun. 
Q.	Madam, we take it that you acted under his orders, undressed under his orders, but being undressed brutally are two different things, so I move that this contradiction is well founded.  We are still dealing with the first invitation.  

As part of the same invitation, you state that he shut the door, undressed himself removing one part of his trousers on one leg, and when the question was put to you, and the question was as follows: "Did Mika himself undress himself?"  Answer: "He undressed himself."  What are we to retain from what you have said?  Did he undress completely or was it only one leg of his trousers that he removed?
A.	He undressed.  He undressed only one leg and his pants.
Q.	It doesn't square with your statement on line 3 when you state -- line 26 you state that, "After undressing me and after undressing himself, he simply raped me."  This is not something which we should forget.  It is the picture should be clear in your mind.  You state, Witness, that that rape lasted more than an hour and it went on over and over again.  How many times did he rape you, madam?
A.	The times correspond to the duration.  That is the one hour it lasted.
Q.	And how many rounds does one hour correspond to?
A.	The rounds correspond to the time period that is one hour.  The rounds lasted one hour.
Q.	We can note that the witness is not answering my questions, so let us move on.  You state that after the deaths of your children and your mother, Mika once more summoned you to his office.  What was the form of that second invitation?  What format did it take?
A.	He sent people who came to take me.
Q.	Did they state why?
A.	They told me that he wished to see me, simply.
Q.	Is it at the time when he had already raped you once, killed your mother and your children, killed your husband, that you received his second summons?
A.	Yes, it was just afterwards.  It was just after these acts that he summoned me for the second time.
Q.	Regarding the Interahamwe who came to get you, can you confirm that they were Gasigwa and Burabyo?
A.	Yes, indeed, it was Gasigwa and Burabyo.
Q.	How did you know these two persons?
A.	They were Interahamwe who participated in killing in that region.
Q.	How did you know them, unless I am to understand from your response that you know all the Interahamwe?  How did you know these two individuals?
A.	They were my neighbours.
Q.	Did they come as neighbours?
A.	They came as messengers.
Q.	What was your relationship with your neighbours, Burabyo and Gasigwa?
A.	Before the war, we had good relations because they had not changed their behaviour at that time.
Q.	When did you notice that their behaviour had changed?
A.	I realised that their behaviour had changed as from the time when I saw them being involved in the killings.
Q.	Was there a problem or a conflict between your family and Burabyo?
A.	There was no problem at all apart from what happened during the war.
Q.	You state that Mika stood up immediately, undressed, and that you did the same; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	There is an extract from your declaration that I do not understand -- second paragraph where you say that, "Mika stood up, undressed immediately, and I did the same.  As during the last time, he pulled my wrapper which I was wearing, and I remained naked."  In the final analysis, did you undress or did he pull at your single wrapper that you were wearing?
A.	He ordered me.
Q.	He ordered you to undress, or did he ask you -- order you to pull your single wrapper?
A.	He ordered me.
Q.	So it is not he who pulled your single wrapper?
A.	You're right.
Q.	This means you lied.  I hope that the transcripts will show this.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I will just move back to ask one or two questions and I shall conclude my 
cross-examination.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President.  I require some clarification on the secteur office in Gishyita.  I do not know who can help us to project this picture that comes from the Prosecution document. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Please show us where the secteur office is.  Madam Witness, the picture that we are about to project is just to help to enable you to show us where the Gashyita office is.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which picture?
MR. SONGA:
It is just to enable Madam Witness to locate the secteur office in Gashyita on that picture.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, could you please go to the projector and identify the communal office in the picture.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can.  
(Witness marks photograph)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, she has tick-marked the office of the secteur on the picture.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I'm afraid I was a little distracted.  With your leave, I would like to take another look at the place that she has indicated and to determine whether it is indeed the secteur office.  I was not referring to the commune office, but to the secteur office.
THE WITNESS:
It is here, next to Mika's house.
MR. SONGA:
May I ask Madam Witness to perhaps go back to the stand.  

Madam President, I would just like to ask one question about this. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know Seth Bimenyimana?
A.	I know him.
Q.	Where was his house?
A.	It is the house that had been changed into a secteur office and which was just next to Mika's house.
Q.	When was this house changed into a secteur office?
A.	This building was used as Mika's office because this man was already dead, and so his house had been changed into a conseiller office, and that is where we used to find him, and that is where he kept all accusations, and that is where he listened to all the propositions that were submitted by the population.
Q.	I want to know at what time this change took place.
A.	From the time when he was appointed conseiller, he worked in his home, and after that, the house was furnished and he made it his office.
Q.	Am I to understand that you do not know the time when this house was changed?
A.	All I know is that it was in this house that Mika worked, and it was Mr. Seth who was a conseiller, and he also worked in this house.
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam Witness.

Madam President, may I request that the statement of 16 December 1999 be entered by the Defence as an exhibit, as along with the photograph that we have just shown to the witness?
MS. MADENGA:

Sorry, do you have any re-examination?
MS. MADENGA:

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please proceed. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you indicated during cross-examination by my learned colleague that Tutsi were targeted during the genocide.  Do you know why you were also a target of rape by Muhimana, you being a Hutu?
A.	After the death of my relatives, he found that the opportunity was good, and so he tortured me.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.

(Exhibit P. 7 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know a man called Mika Muhimana?
A.	I know him.
Q.	How do you know him?
A.	Before the war he was a tall man.  He was neither young nor old.  He was fair skinned.  I knew him during the war.  If you wish that I should give you the dates, I don't know.  I could do that.
Q.	How long before the war did you know him in terms of years?  Can you just help me with that, approximately?  By that, I mean how many years had you known him before the war?
A.	I saw him in 1992, and after that I continued to see him.
Q.	Do you know what Mika Muhimana did for a living, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes, I know he was the conseiller of Gashyita secteur and he had a store.
Q.	Very well.  Madam Witness, did you see Mika Muhimana during what you describe as a war in 1994?
A.	I saw him.  I saw him on the 11th April when he came to the parish where I had taken refuge.  I saw him again on the 15th when he came to kill us.  I saw him on the 15th April when he was raping a girl in Zambwa.  On the 11th I saw him when he was going to the parish.  He committed no evil action.  I saw him on the 15th on the football pitch where a meeting of sorts was being held, where people were dancing and saying that they were going to kill and exterminate the Tutsi.  I saw him on the 15th when I was inside the church.  I heard the sound of a vehicle and I saw a Suzuki vehicle.  Muhimana came down from the vehicle with a gendarme.  He took a carton of grenades; he put it on the stairs in front of him.  He took a grenade and he threw it into the church where we were, and I was wounded.  Kayihra died.  Many other people were wounded inside the church.  

I saw him again on the 15th during the attack on the dispensary, which attack cost the lives of my parents.  When I was still in the church, my little sister came to see me and told me that my parents had been killed, and I decided to go and see the bodies of my parents.  I then tried to get out of the church and I realised that my parents were indeed dead, and on the road leading to the dispensary, I hid.  I tried to continue on the road to the dispensary.  I heard people on the roadblock and that is when I saw Mika and other Interahamwe who were taking six girls.  Including amongst these six girls there were Collete, Alphonsine and Agnes.  The Interahamwe were pushing them around and they were taking them along the road.  Mika then said that he was not going to take these girls to kill them before he had raped them.  He gave the example.  He took one of the girls next to me, quite near where I was hiding.  He ordered Agnes to undress.  When she refused, Mika slapped her, and Agnes panicked.  She unbuttoned her blouse and her skirt, and Mika asked her to place herself on her clothes, and Mika called a man who was next to him, and he undressed and he gave his shirt to this man, and he took his underclothing off and he began to rape Agnes.  Agnes was moaning with pain and was asking Mika to kill her without causing her to suffer.  She was moaning with pain.  And after raping her, Mika took a bayonet and wanted to kill her with it, but Agnes asked Mika to kill her with a gun, and Mika indeed had a gun.  Then Mika laughed and he asked Agnes to go away naked.  He brought Agnes down to where the other girls were and he asked the other Interahamwe to rape them, and he asked them to go ahead.  I therefore crawled on my stomach and I went back to the church.
Q.	Very well, Madam Witness.  Now, let me take you through parts of your testimony.  You testified that you saw Mika on the 11th of April.  Do you recall saying that?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	Where was the parish church that you referred to as having sought refuge at?  Where was that?
A.	It is the Catholic church which is quite near Lyaruhanga town.  It is quite close to the dispensary, and this Catholic church is in Mubuga secteur in Gashyita commune.
Q.	Would I be correct in saying that that church is referred to often as the Mubuga Catholic church?  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, indeed, it is Mubuga parish.
Q.	What were you doing at the Mubuga parish church, and who were you with at that location on 
11 April?
A.	I had sought refuge there and I was accompanied by other refugees.
Q.	Approximately how many refugees have sought refuge with you at the Mubuga parish church as at 11th of April 1994, Madam Witness?
A.	I am unable to give you an estimate, but there were many refugees there because the church was full.
Q.	Are you able to tell us whether or not the refugees were mostly men or women, or can you help us with the composition of those refugees?  What sort of people were these refugees, Madam Witness?
A.	There were men, women, children, girls, youngsters.  All sorts of people.  Many people were there.
Q.	And you testified, as best as I can recall your testimony, that when you saw Mika, he wasn't doing anything.  Can you expand on that?  Under what circumstances did you see Mick on 11th of April?
A.	I said that on the 11th April we were outside a church.  When we saw strangers, we usually went to see who they were.  I saw him in the company of Ryandikayo Rutaganira.  He was passing near the church and going to the presbytery.  They did not talk to us and they did not do anything.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'll spell Rutaganira for the record. R-U-T-A-G-A-N-I-R-A.  And the other name the witness refers to as Ryandikayo is spelt R-Y-A-N-D-I-K-A-Y-O.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, you also talked about seeing Mika on the 15th April 1994.  Where did you see Mika on the 15th of April 1994?
A.	I saw him opposite the church and I saw him again at the cemetery.
Q.	Let's talk about the first time that you saw him on the 15th of April.  Now, when you say "opposite the church", would I be correct in saying that you mean the same Catholic parish at Mubuga, or is this another location?
A.	Yes, it was the same Mubuga Catholic church where we had sought refuge.
Q.	What time of the day did you see Mika on 15th of April at the Catholic church?  What time of the day was it?
A.	It was around 10 a.m.
Q.	Where were you located, Madam Witness, when you saw Mika at 10 a.m. or around 10 a.m. on 15th April?  Where were you?
A.	I was inside the church.
Q.	Were you alone inside the church when you saw Mika at this time or were you with others?
A.	I was with the other refugees who were inside the church.
Q.	How had Mika arrived at the Mubuga parish church at 10 a.m. on the 15th April?  Do you recall his mode of transportation?
A.	He came on board a Suzuki jeep, blue in colour, and he was accompanied by a gendarme.  They have a box of grenades and they put it opposite the church.  He took a grenade, and one of the refugees who was with us inside the church shouted and saying, "Lie down, lie down.  Mika is going to throw a grenade at us," so I lay down on my stomach and I heard an explosion.  There were screams inside the church, and when I looked around I saw the shattered head of Kayihra, and I also observed that I was wounded on the shoulder.
Q.	Madam Witness, let me ask you a question about the person you describe as a gendarme.  How were you able to recognise this person as a gendarme?  Can you help us with that?
A.	I heard people who were with me say so.  They said that since he's wearing a red beret, he was a gendarme.  That was the first time I was seeing that soldier.  The people who were inside the church said he was a gendarme because he was wearing a red beret.
Q.	Do you know if this person wore a uniform, apart from the red beret?
A.	Are you referring to the soldier?  The soldier was in military gear, and even Mika was wearing military fatigues.
Q.	You've talked about a box of grenades being off-loaded.  Can you tell me where on this Suzuki vehicle was the box of grenades off-loaded from?  Where had they recovered the box of grenades from?
A.	I do not know whether that box was between them.  I saw them remove the box.  I don't know exactly where that box was.
Q.	Following the arrival at that location on 15th of April, are you able to tell us whether or not Mika actually entered the church?
A.	No, he did not get inside the church.
Q.	You've testified that a grenade was thrown into the church.  Do you know who threw the grenade?
A.	The grenade was thrown by Mika.
Q.	Madam Witness, how were you able to identify the weapon used as a grenade?
A.	He was holding it in his hand, and one of the refugees who was with us probably knew that weapon, because he indeed said that it was a grenade.
Q.	And --
A.	And that weapon had the shape of a pear, a pear fruit.
Q.	And what happened after the grenade was thrown into the church?  Can you help me with that?
A.	After throwing that grenade, one of the refugees said that Mika had thrown a grenade at us and he asked us to lie down on our stomachs.  Subsequently I heard an explosion, and when I realised that there were no longer any explosions, I got up and I noticed that Kayihra's head was shattered.  I, myself, felt blood on my head and my shoulders and I immediately realised that people were bleeding.  I was afraid and I moved elsewhere, and I moved towards the sacristy.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Kayihra, for the record, is spelt K-A-Y-I-H-R-A.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	Madam Witness, what ethnic group did Kayihra belong to?
A.	He was Tutsi.
Q.	And Kayihra, was that a man or a woman?
A.	He was a man.
Q.	And you also testified, Madam Witness, that you sustained some injuries, did you not?
A.	Yes, I was wounded.
Q.	How were you wounded?  What part of your body was injured during this attack?
A.	I was wounded on the head, on the neck, as well as on the shoulders.
Q.	How many people were injured in the church, to the best of your knowledge, as a result of this attack?
A.	Many people were wounded.  I was afraid.  I could not properly observe.  There were many corpses.  Many people were wounded.
Q.	How far were you from the point where the grenade exploded?  What location in this church were you from the point where the grenade exploded?
A.	I was at a distance of about five metres.  I was very close to the spot on which the grenade exploded.
Q.	Did you remain at the church of Mubuga for the rest of that day, Madam Witness, or did you go elsewhere?
A.	I did not stay inside the church because, shortly after that, my junior sister came to tell me that my parents had been killed.  I went out to see what had happened, but when I got to the road, I encountered the attack by Muhimana.  I could not continue going on my way.
Q.	What time of the day was it that you encountered this attack involving Muhimana?  Can you help us with that?  What time was this?
A.	I do not remember the hour because we were not wearing watches, but all I remember was that it was in the afternoon.
Q.	In terms of your location -- you have told that us you had left the church -- can you describe in more detail whereabouts you were located at the time when you saw this second attack involving Mika?
A.	I was very close to the cemetery in a forest.
Q.	Was that still within the Mubuga area -- Mubuga secteur area?
A.	It was very close to the church in Mubuga secteur.  
(Pages 22 to 39 by Trevor Gerbes)





	1730H
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q.	And what is it exactly did you witness during this second attack that you've described earlier, what was it that you witnessed?
A.	I saw Mika with the people who were accompanying him and those people were leading six girls, they were pushing them in front of them and leading them towards the cemetery.  And I heard Mika say "Nobody should kill those girls before we've raped them." 

He seized one of them called Agnacè Mutagatare, who was working at Mubuga dispensary.  He led her in my direction. When he got to a place that is, more or less, level he asked her to undress.  Agnacè started resisting.  "Instead of torturing me, just kill me immediately."  Mika gave her a slap; Agnacè started undressing.  And as she undressed, Mika asked her to sleep on her dress.  And Mika called the people who were with him, and he undressed and gave his shirt to that person, put his gun on the ground, he removed his trousers and his underwear, and he climbed on Agnacè, and raped her.  

While he was raping Agnacè, Agnacè was screaming and was begging him, but Mika continued raping her.  And after having raped her, he took hold of his bayonet and tried to kill Agnacè with that bayonet.  Agnacè pleaded with him again and told him to kill her with a gun instead of killing her with a bayonet.  Mika laughed and told Agnacè to stand up but not to dress up.  Mika then called a person to whom he had given his shirt, and he dressed up himself and pushed Agnacè in front of him.  And he told the Interahamwe, "Now is the time.  You can continue doing your work, and after killing those people you must make sure you see what they look like."  And the girl was pushed further on.  I could not continue observing the scene.
Q.	What language did Mika speak during this second attack on the 7th of April?  What language did you hear him speak in?
A.	He was speaking Kinyarwanda, as usual.
Q.	And what was the distance between your position, where you were located, and where this rape was taking place?
A.	I would say around five metres.
Q.	The three ladies that you say from your testimony of having recognised, out of the group of six, what ethnic group did they belong to, Madam Witness?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	And the people you've described as being with Mika, can you help us, what sort of people were they, were they men, were they women, were they young or old, these people that he had with him?  Can you help us with that, please?
A.	They were young men who were accompanying Mika.
Q.	Were they armed, and if so, what were they armed with?
A.	They were armed with traditional weapons, namely clubs, machetes.  But I noticed that Mika was carrying a gun.
Q.	Now, you testified that you were in a bush, if I remember your -- the testimony accurately.  Were there any obstacles between yourself and the events that you've described?  Is there anything blocking your view, like bushes and shrubs?  Can you help us with that?
A.	The spot on which Mika raped Agnacè could be seen by me very clearly.  It is true that there was a little bush between me and the place where the rape occurred, but I could easily see them and hear what was being said.
Q.	The men that were with Mika, could they see what Mika was doing to Agnes?
A.	No, they could not see that because they were a little withdrawn.
Q.	And where were the other five women, who had also been captured, whilst Mika was raping Agnes?  Where were they located at the time?
A.	They were standing near the group of people who were with Mika waiting for Mika's instructions, because those men were taking orders from Mika.
Q.	Having raped Agnacè, as you've testified, what, then, happened?  What did you see happen next? 
A.	Mika wanted to kill Agnacè with a bayonet, and Agnacè asked him to kill her with a gun.  Mika laughed at her and told her to get up.  He told her to take her clothes but not to dress up.  He pushed her in front, and he asked the person to whom he had given his shirt, he took his weapon, which he slung over his shoulder, and he moved forward in the group and he told the group, "Now you should kill her, but before killing her take time to see her guts, to see what she looks like."
Q.	What did you understand that to mean, "see her guts, see what she looks like?"
A.	He meant that her stomach should be opened, so that they could see what was inside the stomach of a Tutsi woman.  That is what I thought that meant.
Q.	And in relation to the five other ladies that were present, do you know what eventually happened to them?
A.	I heard that, when I went to the church, there was a young man known as Cum.  He came and he insulted me because I was afraid.  I was trembling, when I thought of what had happened when Agnacè was being raped.  And then they told me, "When you were hiding we could see you in the bush."  And he told me that they have taken the five girls and that they had raped them and taken them to the road where they had been cut up into pieces.
Q.	Madam Witness, if I asked you to look around this courtroom today, to see whether or not you can identify the man you describe as Mika Muhimana, do you think you would be able to oblige me?
A.	I can do so.  I believe I remember what he looks like.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I request leave of the Court for the witness to take all practical means from her -- let's start from the witness box, and if she has any difficulties I would extend my application further.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you can stand up and look around if you can identify the Accused in the courtroom.
THE WITNESS:
I can see him.  He is sitting on the last row, he's wearing a white cap, a tie and a black jacket.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Let the record reflect that the witness is looking to the left to the Defence bench and there is only one person wearing a white cap, in my opinion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness has recognised the Accused.
BY MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Q. Madam Witness, thank you very much for answering my questions.  
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
	Your Honours, I have no further questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Phillips. 

Madam Witness, now you will be asked questions from the Defence side and the counsel for the Defence -- for the Accused, Mikal, sitting on your left side will ask you questions.  Please try to reply to the questions very briefly and precisely.  Thank you.  

Mr. Songa, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, you have just recognised Mika Muhimana.  Did you know him prior to the date you claim to have seen him in Mubuga?
A.	I've known him well before then.
Q.	What were the circumstances under which you knew him?
A.	When I saw him for the first time it was during a ceremony held in the Gishyita communal office.  He came down and he was moving towards the rostrum.  I saw people in front of him.  I asked my friend Beatrice, "Who is that person I can see?"  And Beatrice told me it was Mika Muhimana, the conseiller of Gishyita secteur.
Q.	Did you know his family?
A.	I did not know his family.
Q.	You state, Witness, that you heard of President Habyarimana's death on the 6th of April 1994 in your family home; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you state that people screamed with joy and applauded; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Who are the people shouting with joy?
A.	It was our neighbours.  I could hear them clapping.  They were happy and they were laughing.
Q.	Are they the same people who were applauding?
A.	Yes, the same people were applauding.
Q.	Did you understand or know why they were so happy?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have to object.
THE WITNESS:
I did not know why.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm going to have to object to my learned friend's line of questioning.  I sat back all day and for most of yesterday observing his mode of questioning.  I have particularly taken pains to streamline this witness's evidence to the matters in issue as reflected in the indictment.  I do not recall leading any questions in relation to the president's death or the matters referring to the president's death.  And if you look at Rule 90(G) of the Rules of Procedure.  It clearly says that cross-examination shall be limited to the subject matter of the evidence-in-chief.  We are on a fishing expedition here and absolutely unnecessary.  The events occur all on one day and there is no reason for this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Songa, go on.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, however, were we to limit ourselves solely to the witness statement, it would not prevent us from taking account of the written statement, nor would it prevent us from verifying the witness credibility. 

Madam President, I would like to know your opinion on this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are deliberating and we rule, Mr. Songa, that you have to limit your examination to the examination-in-chief.  You can only refer to the statement for the purpose of credibility.  The objection is upheld.
MR. SONGA:
Much obliged, Your Honour. 

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that you saw Mika on the 11th of April.  May we be apprised of the circumstances of this meeting?  How did you see him on the 11th of April?
A.	I saw him when I was in Mubuga church where I had gone to seek refuge.  He was passing in front of the church towards the rear courtyard of the presbytery.
Q.	At what time were you in the Mubuga church?
A.	I no longer remember at what time I arrived at the church.
Q.	When you arrived at the Mubuga church on the 11th of April, how did you spend your day?
A.	That day we did not experience any problem.  There was no attack that threatened the refugees.
Q.	You stated that Mika did nothing evil.  Could you explain what you mean?
A.	I meant that it was on this day that I saw him at the church, and I saw him on another occasion when he came to kill us.
Q.	When did he kill for the first time, on what date, Madam Witness?
A.	First, it may be said that there was nothing to say about Mika up till the 15th.
JUDGE SHORT:
Please allow the answer of the witness before you ask your second question, Mr. Songa.  I didn't hear the translation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you repeat your last answer?
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember the question that was asked of me.  Can it be repeated?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I asked whether until the 15th nothing can be noted as having been done by Mika?
A.	For my part I saw nothing evil that I can hold against him, except that I saw him go past the church, and I saw him when he was going to a meeting that was held on the school yard.
Q.	Could you assist the Defence in gaining a better understanding of the distance between the Mubuga church and the CERAI of Mubuga?
A.	I was not able to measure this distance, but these places are close together because when you are at the church you can see the school yard of CERAI Mubuga.
MR. SONGA:
If I were to request, Madam President, the technician to help us view a photograph of Mubuga parish, it would be to enable us to locate the school yard in relation to the church.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please, take the photographs to the projector.

Madam Witness, can you go to the projector and identify the place?

THE WITNESS:
I can see these buildings.  I see that there are many buildings.  I cannot see very clearly just now.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, what place do you want to be identified by the witness?
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to find out whether this appears on the picture or whether this is out of the picture.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
From an aerial photograph, Your Honour, that has not been shown to the witness prior to now.  How would he reasonably expect her to do so?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, what do you have to say?
MR. SONGA:
I state that if the picture has never been shown to the witness, it has been done so now.  This is a place that she has always known, where she experienced the events that are judged at this trial.  I don't understand the Prosecutor's extension, if it is - intention, if it is not to negotiate a time for the witness to examine the picture.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, you are not going about it in the appropriate way.  First of all, I have to ask you -- her to identify the church, if she can, on the photograph because that is a pivotal point.  And then, from there, you have to ask her if she can identify the field and where it is.  This is not a photograph produced by her.  It is a photograph produced by somebody else who asserts that it does contain the church.  It may very well not contain the church, but we do have to hear it from the witness.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Your Honour.  We may begin by locating the church.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sir.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Ask the witness if she can identify the church.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Are you able to locate the Mubuga Catholic Church on this photograph?
A.	Yes, I can see the church.
Q.	Can you point to it?
A.	That is the church (indicating).
Q.	From this church can we have the location of CERAI or the direction in which CERAI can be?
A.	CERAI could be seen when one was standing at the end of the church you could see over the other side, you could see the CERAI over on the other side.
Q.	So it does not appear on the picture.
A.	Yes, I see the CERAI.  I think it is this building which can be seen there.
Q.	What is the building?  What do you think is the building next to it?
A.	A little higher there was a Cafe Pro and on the lower part there was another part of the CERAI, and after the CERAI there was a house belonging to a woman whose name I no longer remember.  But this CERAI school was divided into three parts.  But on the picture I can see parts of the school, whereas I know that this school had three parts.
Q.	And if you were told that the building that you have identified as the CERAI is the Mubuga primary school, what would you say?
A.	It is possible, because I see a part whereas the CERAI was composed of three parts.  I do not see the three parts of the CERAI school.
Q.	What little knowledge we have of Mubuga would indicate that the CERAI does not appear here, it is at the extreme -- the far right.
A.	Are you talking about the end of the church?
Q.	After the wood that is visible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, are you able to identify CERAI?
THE WITNESS:
Up until now I am not able to distinguish the CERAI building from other buildings.  I see many buildings.
MR. SONGA:
Let the Court note that it is difficult for the witness to locate the CERAI.  

Perhaps one question which would aim to confirm that this is indeed the location of the parish and church of Mubuga.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has not been able to locate the CERAI, however she has found the church at Mubuga.  

Madam Witness, take your seat.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	In regard to the church, the Mubuga church, you state that it was full.  Are you in a position to tell us the official capacity of this church?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What is the official capacity, Professor?
MR. SONGA:
The capacity to contain a certain number of occupants or persons who attend the church.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that a part this witness could possibly, possibly, by whichever way, establish?
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, I think that since this is a church located in a place that she knows well, she may give an estimate, an approximate estimate.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But the problem, Professor, is that if you want to say how many people can occupy the church you then have to say sitting down, standing up, lying down.  There is opposition because if they were all sitting down listening to the pastor it will hold a certain number.  If they are all sleeping on it, it will hold a different number.  If they are all standing on it, it holds a different number.  And then whatever number she gives will be complete guesswork, either way.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, are you referring to the capacity in terms of feet in the church?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President, that would be the normal situation.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor Songa, please ask the question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, after this brief discussion, I am sure that you have now understood the question.  What was the capacity of the church, especially, as I saw in your particulars that you are Catholic, that must have been a church that you attended.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you may clarify capacity in terms of feet.  If you know it fine.  If you don't know it, fine.  If you know the number of the feet, say the number of the feet.
THE WITNESS:
Now I understand. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It seems, Madam President, that the witness didn't understand the question.  Perhaps it could be asked again.  She had problems with her headset.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you give us the capacity in terms of seats in the church?  How many worshippers could be seated in the church?
THE WITNESS:
This church had a high capacity.  I am not able to tell you the number of persons that it could contain.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  When Mika and those who were accompanying him arrived at the church, around ten o'clock, on board what vehicle did they arrive?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please specify the date, too.
THE WITNESS:
They did not come into the church.  Instead they disembarked just in front of the church.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Is it correct that you saw them get out in front of the church?
A.	Yes, I saw them get down and they stood in front of the church.
Q.	Were you able to see and identify who was driving the vehicle?
A.	The vehicle was driven by Mika himself.
Q.	We refer in this instance to the jeep.
A.	Yes, it is the blue jeep we refer to.
Q.	So there was a total of two persons on board?
A.	On board this vehicle there was Mika and a gendarme.
Q.	You say that Mika was in military uniform.  Can you describe this uniform?
A.	It was an ordinary military uniform.
Q.	What is an ordinary military uniform like?
A.	It was army fatigues.
Q.	Do all units of the Rwandan army wear the same uniform?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	But you do see soldiers in Rwanda?
A.	I used to see them.  That is, in fact, the reason that which I recognised Mika's outfit.  I thought that it was a military uniform.
Q.	At that time you could not, for example, distinguish between a paratrooper and a gendarme, based on his uniform?
A.	I have never seen a paratrooper before.
Q.	Let's talk about this carton full of grenades.  Do you remember its size? 
A.	It was a carton of average size.
Q.	What does that mean?
A.	I am not able to give you specifications as to the measurements of this carton. What size are you referring to, Counsel?  Is the question asked put to me?
Q.	You said there was a carton of ordinary size.  The Defence wish to know what the ordinary dimensions of a carton are?  What did you see?
A.	I think that I am not able to explain on this question.  I do not understand what it means in reference to the measurements that you refer to.
Q.	Are you referring to the size?  I do not understand.  If size will help you to understand the question then I am referring to the size.
A.	Listen, I did not measure the carton.  I saw it.  I saw him heft the carton.  I am not able to tell you the size of the carton because I did not measure it.
Q.	I thank you.  You state that the carton was full; is that correct?
A.	I do not know whether the carton was full, because I did not verify its content to determine whether it was full or half full.  So unless my statement was not well taken down -- otherwise, I did not verify the contents of this carton to determine whether it was full.
Q.	We have some documents that we can show to verify where the stairs of the church were found.  Can you tell us where the church steps were found, where the carton was placed?
A.	The carton, there is a flight of stairs that is found in front of the church opposite the Bank Popular and this carton was placed in front of the gate leading to the presbytery.
Q.	But you do confirm that there was a flight of stairs?
A.	Yes, there is a flight of stairs.  There are steps, cement steps in front of the church.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, we would have liked to determine the position of the flight of steps up to the church, and to this end we would like to show you photographs from the witness bundle, from the Prosecutor's document number 182 and 183.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, can we have a look?

Professor Songa before you proceed with the stairs of the church, you have to establish whether the witness is able to recognise the building.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, we are talking about the fact that a box of grenades was put in front of the church.  In order to understand exactly where that was placed, in light of what she said and reading her statement that it was put on the steps of the church staircase, we would like to absolutely identify the spot on the photographs provided by the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
First, Mr. Songa, first you should determine if she is able to identify the building.
MR. SONGA:
Of course, Madam President.  

If the witness could be shown the first picture.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, please help us by letting us know whether it is one of the things you know.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is this a picture of page 183 of the English document P2?
MR. SONGA:
We have tried to verify this on the photographs, which go from 182 to page 187.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I will now call the witness.  On that first photograph, could you please indicate the location of the steps or the staircase of the church?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That's like asking --
THE WITNESS:
The steps are not on this side of the church.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, let's have the document identified -- the picture identified.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, do you recognise what you are seeing on this photograph?
A.	Yes, it is the Mubuga church.
Q.	Thank you. Now, my question is whether you can locate the staircase on which the grenades were put?  Can you identify that location on this photograph?
A.	No, you have shown me another side of the church and the staircase is not on that side.
MR. SONGA:
May I ask the technicians to show the next photograph?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, can you identify what is represented on this photograph?
A.	Yes.  I recognise the building on this photograph.
Q.	What is this building, please?
A.	It is the Mubuga church.
Q.	The Catholic Church, you mean?
A.	Yes, the Catholic Church.
Q.	Now, can you please indicate to us, if possible, where the staircase of this church is located?
A.	Once more, it is not on this side of the church.
MR. SONGA:
May I ask the technician to go to the next photograph?
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, can you identify the building in this photograph?
A.	Yes, I have identified it.
Q.	What building is it?
A.	It is the Mubuga Catholic Church.
Q.	Is it possible for you to identify the church staircase?
A.	I cannot see the staircase, but I can see where it is paved in stone.
Q.	So there is no staircase there.
MR. SONGA:
Can the witness be shown the next photograph, please? 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, can you identify the building?
A.	Yes, I have identified it.
Q.	What building is it?
A.	It is the Muguba Catholic Church.
Q.	Can you identify or locate the staircase on this picture?
A.	Please give me time to properly look at it.
Q.	Please go ahead.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we make -- find that the pictures you are referring to, to the witness, are not very clear.
MR. SONGA:
She has not finished looking at all the pictures.  

Mr. Technician, is there another photograph? 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Can the witness identify this building?
A.	Yes, this is the interior of the Catholic Church, and we are looking at the altar of the church.
Q.	I don't think the interior is of any use to us.
MR. SONGA:
Mr. Technician, is there another picture?

But we shouldn't go beyond the photograph on page 187.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, can you identify this building?
A.	Yes, I have identified it.  It is the interior of the church.
Q.	And this is the last photograph.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, that was the last photograph in which we were trying to locate.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, in all those photographs we have not seen the stairs.
JUDGE SHORT:
We haven't seen the stairs, but it doesn't mean it's not there.  The photographer who took these photographs did not take them with a view to show the stairs.  And you know that in most of the pictures the bottom part of the picture is very dark, so even if the stairs existed you would not be able to see them from these pictures.  You are assuming that the photographer took them with a view to showing the stairs, are you not?

In any event, Professor, when these pictures were taken, the photographer who took them or was present with the person who took them, you didn't ask him any questions on the stairs.
MR. SONGA:
You are right.  We were not yet examining the statement of the witness.
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, but you were aware of the statement of this witness, and you are aware the witness will testify, and the stairs are referred to in the witness's statement and you led a witness to say, yes, there were stairs or there were no stairs. 

Mr. Songa, maybe you could ask the witness what portion of the church the stairs are.  Then you can move from there, because the various pictures show the different parts of the church, the front, the side and the inside.  So, if you want to make any progress, maybe you could ask the witness what portion of the church the stairs are, and then we could look at that picture and see whether it is possible to identify the stairs.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, do you confirm, for a start, the existence of the church staircase?
A.	Yes, I do confirm that, but the staircase is not visible on all those photographs.  All we can see are pavements on the photograph and the staircase is just in front of the pavement, unless the photograph was taken just in front of the Kibuye Credit Union.  From there the staircase would be visible.
Q.	You mean that none of the photographs that have been shown to you have enabled you to identify or locate not only the staircase but the direction in which the staircase was?
A.	I did not see any staircase.  The staircase that is in front of the church is not where he put the box of grenades, but I saw the part that was paved in stone.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, the least we could say is that the staircase is not visible and we cannot see it on these photographs.  

So let us move forward.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	How many Interahamwe were guarding the church?  How many were hanging around the church from the 15th of April?
A.	There were many of them.  They could be seen all over.  I was inside the church.
Q.	You saw Mika carrying a grenade in his hand, is that correct?
A.	Yes, I saw him.
Q.	And one of the refugees said that it was a grenade? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	How many people were hit by that grenade -- affected by that grenade?
A.	I could not count them, but where I was I could see four people who were wounded and I myself was wounded.
Q.	You stated, Witness, that it was in the afternoon and that there were many corpses.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She corrected the corpses, to person.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Your Honour speak into the microphone?  The interpreters didn't hear it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In evidence she corrected the "corpses" to person.  She said there was one person dead.
MR. SONGA:
Yes, I was coming to that. 

When you compare her statement today, we understand that she said there were many corpses.  But when you refer to the written statement, what is mentioned therein is that he cocked the grenade and threw it through the window and hit a certain Kanura (phonetic) and only one death is mentioned in the written statement, whereas in today's oral statement there were many corpses.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The there were corpses -- Mr. -- Professor, the witness, the word "corpses" was used by the witness but she immediately said "one person died."
MR. SONGA:
I do not quite grasp the distinction, Your Honour is trying to make.  If you say "many corpses today" and the witness said "no".
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Today we have taken note of what you said, Witness, you said there were many corpses.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That is not what the witness's evidence is and my learned friend can ascertain what the true picture of things are when the questions are asked.  That is not her evidence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I need to mention that Prosecutor has taken 44 minutes to complete his examination-in-chief and you have already taken 44 minutes, so we can go up to, say, 15 minutes more.

MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I explained to you a while ago that it would not be fair to try to tally the time used by the Defence with that used by the Prosecution, because the Defence is facing the charges and has to defend itself.  So I crave your indulgence, as you have always been indulgent to us, to allow us more time.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I'm happy to take note that my learned friend is assuming the burden of proof in this case, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He is not going to be allowed to assume it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, how much time will you need to complete your cross-examination?
MR. SONGA:
I believe that I'll be over with this in 30 minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are not limiting the time of cross-examination to the examination-in-chief, but there should be a visible time.  You should have additional time to complete your cross- examination.  Mr. Songa, you can have ten minutes, ten today and 20 minutes tomorrow. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Be generous, give him a half hour tomorrow.
MR. SONGA:
I could not belie your goodness, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	While you were in the church, Madam President (sic), were you there with any other member of your family?
A.	Yes, I was with some.
Q.	How many?
A.	There were ten.
Q.	Brothers and sisters?
A.	Yes.
Q.	All your brothers and all your sisters?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And how did you learn of your parents' death at the dispensary?
A.	My younger sister told me so.  She was with them at the dispensary.
Q.	So all your sisters were not at the Catholic Church?
A.	Yes, that sister was not at the Catholic Church.
Q.	When did your junior sister join you?
A.	I do not recall the hour, but it was before midday, around midday.
Q.	Tell us, how did you leave your place of refuge to go to the dispensary?
A.	I passed through the sacristy.  I climbed up -- one of the refugees who was with us helped me to climb and I jumped down in front of the church and I continued.
Q.	What time was that?
A.	It was before midday.  I do not know the precise time.  In any case, it was before midday.  I was not in a situation to assess the precise time.
Q.	It took you quite sometime to get to the dispensary, didn't it?
A.	I never got to the dispensary.
Q.	In attempting to get there, were you alone or with your sister?
A.	I left her inside the church and I went alone.
Q.	Why did you run the risk of leaving that place of refuge to go on the road?
A.	I was in a state of disaster.  I lost my mind.  However, I wanted to see the bodies of my parents to take stock of the fact that indeed they had been killed.
Q.	You stated that on your way you met Mika Muhimana.  Were there any other people that you could identify?
A.	I also identified Nyandikio (phonetic).  There were many of them.  There were many Interahamwe.
Q.	Many Interahamwe.  Can you give us a rough idea of the number of Interahamwe there were?
A.	I could not count them.  I did not have time to do so.  I was hiding.
Q.	But you could see, specifically, the six girls?
A.	Yes, I could see them, but I could not know the names of all of them.
Q.	When you saw them, were you still in hiding?
A.	I saw them at the time when I was going down into my hideout, and even from my hideout I could see them.  They were surrounded by people.
Q.	Can you tell us, roughly, what the distance between the dispensary and the cemetery was?
A.	No, I do not know the distance, but from where I was it was not very close.
Q.	It was not very close.  Can you tell us, in terms of time, the minutes, the time it would take someone to walk from one place to the other, between the two places?
A.	From there to the dispensary, I believe it would take one -- between five and ten minutes walking.
Q.	You mean, therefore, that it was close by?
A.	Yes, it was quite close.
Q.	Regarding the six girls, you could fully identify one of them and you could only identify the first names of two of them and the three others you can't remember their names.  Can you talk to us about Mutagatare, whom you knew the best?
A.	She was a nurse at the dispensary, and that is why I knew her.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Songa, it is 7 p.m. now.  We stop for the day and resume tomorrow morning at 8:30 in court number II.  Tomorrow we continue hearing until 2 p.m.
MR. SONGA:
Can I ask you a favour of you, Madam President? 

Can I ask a favour of you, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. SONGA:
I believe, Madam President, that the 20 minutes you are allowing me are good, but if you could give me a bit more time, it would be better, because I've not talked about rape, which is one of the very, very serious charges in the indictment.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we are very generous.  You can have more time but reasonable more time. 

Madam Witness --
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are still continuing with your evidence, cross-examination.  Please do not discuss your evidence with anyone outside the Court.  

Yes, Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour we have two witnesses left this week, witnesses BG and BI.  We propose to put witness BG on tomorrow.  Well, we had actually proposed to put both of them on tomorrow but from the lock of things it looks as we would only be able to take BG.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you could finish BG tomorrow.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
BG.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we adjourn and resume tomorrow morning 8:30 a.m. in court II.  Thank you. 
(Court adjourned at 1900H)
