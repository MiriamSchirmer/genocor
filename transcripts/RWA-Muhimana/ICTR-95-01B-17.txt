WITNESS AT
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when we broke up yesterday, we were in room number 3, which you also refer to as the surgery room.  Now, in that room we were talking about the clothes that Mukasine was wearing.  To help all of us and the Chamber as a whole to refresh its memory, can we go back to the clothes that Mukasine was wearing?
A.	Mukasine was wearing a yellow skirt.  She was also wearing a multi-coloured shirt.
Q.	Thank you.  In your declaration of November 1999, you told also how Mika stripped her forcibly of her clothes.  Which clothes in detail were removed from her body?
A.	Her skirt and her shorts.  The shorts that she was wearing under the skirt were removed.
Q.	And what was the colour of the shorts?
A.	The skirt was yellow.
Q.	What about the shorts?
A.	The small shorts she was wearing was red in colour.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Still concerning Mukasine's clothing -- well, I will withdraw the beginning of that sentence.  With regard to Mika, himself, how was he dressed?
A.	He was wearing a pair of trousers, a military type overshirt and a white T-shirt inside the shirt.
Q.	Did Mika remove his clothes?
A.	He removed his clothes but kept his T-shirt on, but he did not totally remove his trousers.  He just pulled them down.
Q.	And then what did he do?
A.	He had sexual intercourse with Mukasine.
Q.	What kind of resistance did Mukasine put up against Mika's action?
A.	Mika found her on the bed on which she was lying.
Q.	I will ask the question again.  What did Mukasine do to resist Mika's action?
A.	She first of all pleaded for mercy from Mika by raising her arms.
Q.	While, she was begging Mika, did she say anything?
A.	She told him, or rather, he told her, "Why don't you lie down as you should, for Christ sakes?" 
Q.	I'm rather talking about Mukasine.  What did she say?
A.	Mukasine didn't say anything.  All she did was beg Mika.
Q.	And how -- what did she say in the terms of begging him?
A.	She raised her arms and she said, "Please do not kill me," because actually she thought that he was going to kill her.
Q.	And so when she saw Mika climb on the bed, she thought he was going to kill her; is that correct?
A.	Yes, because this was happening during the massacres and she thought that Mika wanted to kill her, but Mika instead wanted to have sexual intercourse with her before killing her subsequently.
Q.	In the position that you found yourself, do you think that Mukasine could have been able to see whether Mika Muhimana had pulled down his trousers and that he had put out his leg from one side of the trousers?
A.	Mukasine first of all resisted, and Mika hit her with the butt of the gun, and when Mika hit her with the butt of the gun, he seized the legs of the young lady, removed her skirt, her underwear, and left her lying on the bed to the extent that any person passing by could see how the genitals of a Tutsi woman looked like.
Q.	Let's go about it slowly.  My question was to find out if Mukasine saw Mika when he started undressing. 
A.	Mika undressed after having hit Mukasine with the butt of his gun.
Q.	When you talk about the hit with the butt of the gun, did he use one hand or two hands?
A.	Mika used only one arm.
Q.	And what was the other arm doing?
A.	That arm was holding Mukasine's own arm.
Q.	And when you say that at the same time that Mika was hitting her with the butt of the gun, he hit her on the knees; is that correct?
A.	No, he hit her on the chest.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to read out your statement of November 1999 where, on page 3 or page 4 of the French version, we read the following.  "Mika reached for his gun and hit her with his butt on the chest, and while hitting her knees."  Do you confirm that statement?
A.	I said that Mika hit her chest with the gun.  As concerns her knees, the young lady had bent them, and Mika was trying to unbend them by force.
Q.	Now, do you confirm either Mika hit her on the knees or not?
A.	He hit her on the chest.
Q.	So Mika did not hit her on the knees?
A.	No, rather the young lady had bent her knees and Mika was leaning on her knees in order to unbend them.
Q.	Thank you.  You state that Mika raped Mukasine.  What precise act did you see to allege that Mika raped Mukasine?
A.	Mika removed his trousers, removed his penis and introduced it into the vagina orifice of the woman, and while Mika was doing this, the young lady was crying, was screaming, which means that she didn't want to yield to Mika's -- she didn't want to do what Mika wanted her to do.
Q.	Mr. Witness, yesterday you said that you were lying on the ground and that there were three bodies on you, and I would like to know how, in spite of that, you were able to see the penis and the penetration that was taking place on the bed.  What was your position vis-a-vis the bed?
A.	Since the assailant was busy raping, he couldn't have been looking at me and I could raise my head to see what he was doing.
Q.	Do you have an idea of the height of the bed, Mr. Witness?
A.	I did not measure the height of that bed.
Q.	Could you try to give an estimate of the height?
A.	Well, just retain that it was a bed on which patients lie.  Patients could only lie on a bed, so these were beds on which a patient used to lie, and I couldn't measure the height of that bed.
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  You talked about Karera's two daughters, but you didn't give their names.  Could you at least give us the ages of those girls?
A.	I did not know their ages, but these were young girls, adolescent young girls.  When a young girl already has a breast, you can say that the girl is adolescent.
Q.	Were they of the same age?
A.	One was younger to the other -- was younger sister of the other.
Q.	And who raped Karera's older girl or daughter?
A.	Kanyabungo's two sons took those two girls.  I don't know who exactly raped which one, but I know it was Kanyabungo's sons, but I can't know exactly.  I can't recall who was raping which girl.
Q.	Now, can I ask the question as to whether you knew them?
A.	I knew them before.  I knew that they were soldiers.
Q.	Who, therefore, raped the elder girl?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness has told you, Professor, he doesn't know which boy raped which girl.  That has been several questions, several times.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, with all the deference that I have for your opinion, he has not yet answered that question.  He says that the two girls were raped by the two sons of Kanyabungo.  My question is to find out which of Kanyabungo's son raped which girl.  Even if the witness does not know their names, he said he could distinguish between each other because he knew that one was the elder of the other.  That is the answer I've been expecting, but we haven't had it so far in this courtroom.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We have it.  He answered that he did not know which boy raped which girl, so that is an answer.  You may not think it is, but that is the answer.  So you follow it up from there.
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, I think I understand you much better now, and thank you.  We can definitely proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you describe how each of the Karera girls was dressed?
A.	As concerns their clothing, the circumstances were tense, and I can't recall the clothes that they were wearing, but I did retain the clothes that Mukasine was wearing because I was closer to where she was.
Q.	Closer.  When you say closer, what was the distance, Mr. Witness?
A.	There wasn't a long distance between the two of us.  The bodies of the victims were just close to the bed.
Q.	I hope that you understood my question.  I asked what was the distance between you and the Karera girls?
A.	There were three beds that came one after the other, and then the bed on which Mukasine was, which was closer to me, and the other beds came after that one, after Mukasine's bed, that is.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You say in your statement of November 1999 that while Mika was raping Mukasine, the two soldiers were raping the two other girls.  How long -- for how long did Mika's act last?
A.	About approximately five minutes, but that is only an approximation because I wasn't wearing a watch.
Q.	And for how long did the second rape take place?
A.	They ended their acts at about the same time.
Q.	Did they begin at the same time?
A.	They began at the same time since they entered the room at the same time.
Q.	Did you see how each of the soldiers was undressing himself?
A.	They undressed themselves in the same manner as Mika.  They couldn't have sexual intercourse with their clothes on.
Q.	Mika was wearing pants, a pair of shorts and a pair of trousers.  Was it the same type of clothes that the soldiers were wearing?
A.	The soldiers were wearing military clothes.
Q.	Now, if they were not wearing the same clothes, how did they undress themselves in the same manner?
A.	If I said that they undressed themselves in the same manner, the trousers of the soldiers, as well as that of a civilian, are worn in the same way.
Q.	Did each of them, did all of them take out a leg from the trousers?
A.	There is one amongst them who undressed himself completely, who removed his trousers completely, but he put on his trousers later, but the other soldier did like Mika.  That is, he removed only one leg from the trousers.  The one who was closer to me removed one leg from the pair of trousers, and the one who was on the bed at the end of the row undressed completely.
Q.	Mr. Witness, which leg was it?  Was it the left or the right leg?
A.	Please don't ask me such a question.  I simply noted that only one leg was out of the trousers.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In the same statement you talked about your departure from Mugonero.  Can we hear you talk about your departure from Mugonero?  When did you leave the Mugonero complex?
A.	I left the complex in the night.
Q.	At about what time, please?
A.	I wasn't wearing a timepiece, but the massacres ended at 9 p.m., which means that I left the complex well past 9 p.m.
Q.	As you were leaving the complex, were you alone or did you have company?
A.	When I came out into the courtyard of the complex, I saw people who were arguing.  I also saw bodies, and when these people saw bodies that were outside, I thought they were Interahamwes, whereas we -- but when we looked more clearly, we realised that these were more bodies than Interahamwes, and when we stepped on the corpses of the bodies, we realised that these bodies were inert.  We created a small pathway in order to come out using a roundabout path, so we entered a bush.  We used the bush to leave the hospital because the Interahamwes had said that they were going to come back the next day to finish offer those who hadn't died entirely.
Q.	What was your destination, Mr. Witness?
A.	I went to Murambi.
Q.	When I read your statement of 20 June 1996, just as your statement of 12 November 1999, you say that you went to Bisesero.  Is it the same destination?
A.	But those are two hills that come one after the other.
Q.	My question still stands.  What was your destination?
A.	I went to Murambi, and it's only later that I went to Bisesero.
Q.	When you say later, how much time after Murambi?
A.	I arrived at Bisesero in the month of May.
Q.	Please allow me to read to you your statement of 20 June 1996.  In that statement of 20 June 1996, on page 4 of the French version, second paragraph, last but one line, we read as follows: "I then left the complex to flee towards the Bisesero region."  And in the other statement, that of 12 November 1999, on the last page of the French version, that is page 5 thereof, on the first paragraph of page 5 you stated the following:  "When the night fell at about 9 p.m., I left the complex for Bisesero simply because I had heard the attackers say that they were going to come back the following day to finish off the survivors.  At Bisesero I moved about on many hills as dictated by the movement of the attackers." 

On the basis of your testimony here in the courtroom, compared to what you stated on those two different dates, I would like to ask this question again.  When you left Mugonero, where did you go?
A.	I went to Murambi.
Q.	Mr. Witness, on 20 June 1996 and on 12 November 1999, did you bear false witness to the investigators of the Tribunal?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Songa, the witness has said that he went to Murambi first, and then later on went to Bisesero.  That's the evidence he's given.
MR. SONGA:
With all due respect to Your Honour, I have just read two statements wherein the witness states that he left the complex and went to Bisesero.

JUDGE SHORT:
Did the statement say that he went directly to Bisesero?  Is that what the statement means?  He is explaining that before he got to Bisesero, he went to Murambi.
MR. SONGA:
I do not know whether the problem has to do with language, but what I read in French is that, "At nightfall I left the complex to go to Bisesero," so I understand from this that he went to Bisesero.  He may have got there late, but he did go there.  In any case, if he went elsewhere, he would have said so.  What he said was, "I went to Bisesero."  What about the case -- he has clearly stated that he only got to Bisesero in May, whereas we are in April in this particular context.  My question to the witness was simple.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, why did you tell the investigators that you went to Bisesero whereas your destination was Murambi?
A.	I started by going to Murambi, and I only got to Bisesero in the month of May.
Q.	Witness, why did you not mention Murambi on both occasions?
A.	I would ask you to read the transcripts in the Ntakirutamana case and you find that when 
Pastor Ntakirutimana was destroying the church in Murambi, I was there.
Q.	Did you say that you were there, or you were not there?
A.	I was in Murambi.
Q.	Why are you referring me to the Ntakirutimana case?  Do you mean that is where you were more accurate?
A.	Counsel, why are you asking me questions regarding other points whereas I have stated that I went to Murambi?
Q.	All right.  I will follow your advice and refer increasingly to the Ntakirutimana case.  Witness, I would like to remind you of your statement made yesterday, yesterday's testimony.  Yesterday we spoke at length --
MR. SONGA:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I'm looking for a document and I need a couple of minutes to find it.  

Thank you for your understanding, Madam President.  I would like to refer to the statements made by the witness yesterday.  I want us to go back to the surgery room.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, do you remember that yesterday before this Chamber you told us about room No. 3 in the medical complex, which you also called the surgery room, and which you located in the basement of the Mugonero medical complex; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's correct.

MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like us to refer to a document on Mugonero produced by the Prosecutor.  This is to enable the witness to help us locate exactly where room No. 3, which he also refers to as the surgery room, in the documents produced by the Prosecutor.  I would like the registrar to come over to me so that I can show him that document.  It is on page 165 of the document produced by the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this is a sketch of the hospital? 
MR. SONGA:
That is correct, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Show it to the witness.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, if that sketch could be screened, it would enable us to better locate it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please put it on the projector.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. SONGA:
I think it will be more convenient, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please, go to the projector.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, may I point out that the drawing to which Counsel is referring -- there were corrections made by the investigator, Mr. Tony Lucassen.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have noticed.
MR. KAPAYA:
I hope this has been taken into account.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, the corrections have been made.

Yes, Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Before we go any further, Madam President, I would like to know whether the plan that is on the screen contains the corrections the Prosecutor has referred to.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, I don't think so.  No, it doesn't.
MR. SONGA:
That being the case, Madam President, I don't know whether those corrections contradict fundamentally what I'm going to question the witness on.  I don't know what the corrections are and I crave the Court's indulgence.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, do you remember the correction, yourself?  Do you have it on your exhibit, your copy of the document? 
MR. SONGA:
I just crave the Court's indulgence because I'm not aware of those corrections and I don't know when they were disclosed to the Defence.  If the Chamber confirms that they do exist, I would like to know whether we could verify them and whether we can still go ahead with the questions I want to put to the witness.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
At the time the witness was giving evidence -- the author of this document was giving evidence, he asked us to change BH-K, and exchange it with AT-K, and those alterations were made in the document that we had in our possession.  They are indicated on the screened map by an arrow.  That arrow is supposed to go to BHK, not ATK, from circled "3", and in the lower part, from circled "Maternity room", the inscription there was supposed to be AT-K, not BH-K.  Those are the corrections, if I remember well.
MR. KAPAYA: 
Yes, Your Honours, and we suggest that the witness should be shown the document which contains those corrections so that he is not misled.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But, anyway, the witness is illiterate, he cannot read or write, so even if the corrected copy is shown to him, it won't make any difference.
JUDGE SHORT:
Let's see how professor is going to manage this exercise in view --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But it would be better if a corrected copy is shown to the witness.  

Mr. Issa, please take this corrected copy.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, just before you ask that question, this sketch we are looking at is at 204 in the presentation, not on 99, the full representation of the building.  Is that the case, or do I misunderstand the position?
MR. SONGA:
The question I will put to the witness has to do with the structure of the building.  That was valid both in 1994 and in 2004. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go ahead.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Since the witness is illiterate we will ask the interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth, please assist the witness.

Yes, Professor, please continue with your cross-examination.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, I would like you to first of all confirm whether at the time of the events in 1994 that building was in two levels or two storeys?
A.	I will explain the situation to you.  In 1994 the position of the rooms was changed.  After 1994, the position has been changed.  Bearing in mind such change, I wouldn't be in a position to recognise where I was because of the said changes.
Q.	I would like to rephrase the question so that you should understand properly.  In 1994, was that building in two levels; yes or no?
A.	Yes, the building had two levels.
Q.	With the assistance of the interpreter, could you please indicate where the first level is and where the second level is?
A.	I do not know where the second level is because it was destroyed.  At the moment, you can no longer get to the surgery section, because it is not accessible.
Q.	Witness, do you confirm that in 1994, that is the year of the events, you sought refuge in this basement or in the first level?
A.	I sought refuge in the basement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, look at the sketch in front of you and see if you could identify the place -- the room where you were hidden in 1994.
THE WITNESS: 
In 1994 I sought refuge in room 3, that is the surgery room, but after the restructuring of those rooms, I wouldn't be able to say where exactly I sought refuge.  By the way, I have already stated to you that I can neither read nor write nor draw.  Today, the surgery wing has been restructured.  All you should remember is that I was in the surgery room, that is room 3.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	What is relevant to us, Witness, is what happened in 1994, so please do not be concerned about what happened subsequently in terms of the restructuring of that wing.  Do you, therefore, confirm that you sought refuge in the basement without passing through another room?
A.	Yes.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like us to turn to the Ntakirutimana case, and the witness, indeed, recommended that I refer to it because he was more precise in that context.  I'm going to read an extract of his testimony on 20th September 2001, and with your leave, Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can we have copies of that?
MR. SONGA:
Exactly.  That is what I was going to request the Chamber to do, that I submit copies dealing with this passage.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which question, or which answer? 
MR. SONGA:
The version I have is the French one.  I don't know whether we can indicate the English version, the equivalent of that document.  This is the passage I'm referring to: "After that incident, where did you go?"  

Madam President, I would like us to first of all find the English version so that we can be reading both of them at the same time.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the interpreters would also need a copy.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you have an extra copy?  

Mr. Issa, please give this copy to the interpreters.  This is on page 146 of the English version, which is dated 20 September 2001, the last question on page 146.  

Yes, Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  This is how the first question was phrased: "After that incident, where did you go?"  Answer: "I went to hide inside a hospital in room three."  Question: "Can you estimate the time, around what time was it now?"  Answer: "It was during the day."  Question: "Did you find other people in room No. 3?"  Answer: "When I went in, I found people in there.  They were chopping up the other people who were in the room and I immediately went below, running to the surgery room, and that is where I stayed, and when I got to that surgery room" -- there is an intervention, 
Madam President.  
Let's go backwards.  Let's try to translate the beginning of the answer.  When you went into room 
No. 3.  "When I got into room No. 3, I found people chopping up other people with sharp instruments, so I immediately went to the surgery room below, running, and when we got to that room, I was covered with bodies."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor -- (microphone not activated)
MR. SONGA:
I'm sorry, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Does the interpreter have a copy?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The copy we have, Madam President, doesn't seem to tally with what Counsel is reading.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, it is possible that a page is missing, but if we proceed, we will get to other questions and answers which confirm what we are trying to demonstrate, so I crave your indulgence once more for the fact that there is an omitted passage, but I believe subsequently we will be able to confirm what I'm trying to establish.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, Professor.  Move on.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  "When I got into room No. 3, I found people chopping up others with bladed objects.  I immediately went down to the surgery room while running, and when I got to that room, I put myself under dead bodies, such that if people were to come into that room, they would believe I also was dead."  Question from the presiding judge: "This is room No. 3, Mr. Witness.  Which floor, at which floor was it situated in that building?"  The witness answered, "Room No. 3.  It was on the upper level of the building," and here I believe the English version contains this statement: "And the surgery."  That is a question.  "Was it at the same level as room No. 3 or at a different level?"  And the witness answered saying, "They were not on the same level.  I went to the surgery room from room 3.  It is the same building, but on different levels."  "Is the surgery room at an upper level or a lower level?"  "The surgery room is below.  When I left room No. 3, I went down to go to the lower level into the surgery room."  "For how long did you stay in the surgery room?"  "I stayed there until that night." 

That was the witness's testimony in the Ntakirutimana case on the date of 20 September 2001. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	My question was, if, before you arrived at the surgery, the witness had gone somewhere else -- I do not wish to ask cumulative questions, so I will ask first question.  Did he hide elsewhere before he arrived at the surgery room?
A.	I hid in the surgery room.  I went nowhere else.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, did you ask him whether he went anywhere before he went to the surgery room, rather than whether he hid somewhere, because he may have gone somewhere but he did not hide there.  If you look at the transcript which you have read where he says that he went to room 3 and he found that people were being chopped up there, he did not stay there, some maybe you could ask him whether he went anywhere, any other part of the building, before he went to the surgery room.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness.  You have already been asked this question and I believe I understood that your answer was no?
A.	Yes.
MR. SONGA: 
Your Honours, the question had already been put to the witness, and he repeats the answer.
JUDGE SHORT:
You suggest to the witness that he had already been asked "this question".  Which question?  You didn't mention the question.  Put the question again to him, whether he went to any other room in this same building before going to the surgery room.  That is much clearer.

Witness, did you go into any other room of this same building before you went to hide in the surgery room? 
THE WITNESS:
I hid in no other room.  I hid in the surgery room until nightfall, and afterwards I hid elsewhere.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, I'm not asking where you hid or where you were hiding.  The question is did you go anywhere else before you went to hide in the surgery room.  Listen to the question carefully.  Did you go into any other room of this building before you went to hide in the surgery room? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
After you entered into this building.
THE WITNESS:
We came from the outside and we tried to enter the upper part of the building, but people were being cut up with machetes there, and I decided to go to the basement, to the surgery room, and that is where I hid until I left the building.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your statement of November 1999, we read as follows.  In a paragraph that begins with 16 April 1994, we read, as I said, as follows.  

I shall take a break to enable the Court to find the passage.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you are referring to which statement? 
MR. SONGA:
The statement of 12 November 1999.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, if Mr. Songa is through with the sketch, could the witness take the stand, the witness box.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, have you finished with the sketch? 
MR. SONGA:
I cannot say that I have finished, because I do not know what answers will be provided to the questions I will put.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, then proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, in the statement of 12th November 1999, I would like to extract a passage for the witness. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is what we are reading: "Since I was outside, I saw the assailants began to shoot indiscriminately at the refugees.  Meanwhile, I ran to room 3 of the medical complex to hide.  I found about 30 bodies lying on the floor and hid among them."  

Mr. Witness, this is the passage which is taken from your statement, unless you deny that.  It confirms that not only did you go to room 3, but that you stayed there, and it is from this room that you witnessed all that you saw.  Do you have any explanation to provide to the Chamber in this respect? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, this is a misstatement of this statement here.  The witness has testified -- I believe he testified yesterday that there is room No. 3 on the first floor and there is a room No. 3 on the ground floor.  Here he doesn't talk whether it was on the basement or on the first floor, so Professor Songa cannot say that by this statement the witness says the third room on the first floor.  He can't say that, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Let the witness answer and tell us where he was.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  Please reply. 
THE WITNESS:
He said that I was in room No. 3.  I have never been to room No. 3.  I went to the surgery room and I left this room at night to take refuge in Murambi.  So, in the surgery room -- in the surgery unit there were various rooms.  There was a waiting room, there was a dentist's room, there was an anaesthesia room, so before the restructuring of this unit, there was room No. 3.  When I refer to where I hid, I am referring to the surgery room and that is where I found 30 bodies.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you tell us that where is this room No. 3 and the surgery room, they are two different rooms? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, these are two different rooms.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you go to room No. 3 before you went to the surgery room? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not go to room No. 3 because people were being cut up there with machetes.  I decided to go and hide in the surgery room which was situated in the basement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How did you know that people had been cut up with machetes in room No. 3 when you had not been there? 
THE WITNESS:
The doors had been broken down.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So do you mean to say that you witnessed the slaughtering of the people from outside the room? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I was outside.  The door had been broken down.  I could therefore see what was going on inside this room because there was no longer a door.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And then you did not enter; is that what you mean to say?
THE WITNESS: 
I did not enter this room.  I immediately went towards the surgery room.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  Do you still need the witness to be near the projector? 
MR. SONGA:
No, Your Honour, he will go and sit down because I will conclude this question.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, sit down, please.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And Professor, we have been an hour and 15 minutes into the cross-examination this afternoon.  Just a reminder, a friendly reminder.
MR. SONGA:
I shall not disappoint you two times in a row, Your Honour.  I shall do something  -- I shall make a concerted effort to finish in 20 minutes on the outside.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Merci.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, in order not to lose the Court's time, I would ask you -- I would like to tender the Ntakirutimana transcript as an exhibit, since there are contradictions.  The witness claims that he never went into room 3, whereas the transcript says, "When I entered room 3, I saw people."  In view of these contradictions, we would like to tender this transcript as an exhibit from the Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, where did he say that he entered room No. 3 in the transcript? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, you stated a while ago that it is entirely possible that a page is missing in the English version.  However, in the French version it is perfectly clear.  It is possible that this is the page that has been omitted.  When the President in the transcripts of 20th September intervenes and says, "Let us try to come back, try to translate the beginning, try to translate or retranslate the beginning of the response or the answer," referring to when he entered room No. 3, so on 20th September, the witness states, "When I went into room 3, I found people who were cutting up others with bladed objects," so this is the passage that states clearly that he entered room 3, and I would add, 
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  This will be Exhibit D.  26, to be kept under seal -- E for the English transcript and Exhibit D. 26F for the French.  These are public documents, so no need keeping them under seal.
(Exhibit Nos. D. 26E and D. 26F admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please move ahead.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that in Bisesero, you used to cross several hills.  Might we know these hills that you crossed when you were in Bisesero?
A.	I went to Bisesero to seek refuge.  I did not know the Bisesero hills.  All I know is that there is a secteur or a cellule of Bisesero called Bisesero.  As regards the hills, I did not know the names.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state on 12th November 1999 that you were hiding in a bush when you saw a group of assailants discover or flush out a certain Kabanda; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that was in Bisesero.
Q.	Do you not remember a more precise place?
A.	I remember I knew Kabanda's place.  Kabanda *********************************, and he was flushed out in a millet field.
Q.	Were you alone in your hideout?
A.	I was alone.
Q.	How were the assailants like?  Were there many? 
A.	There were many.  There were Interahamwe and soldiers who were armed with guns, there was Mika and the bourgmestre, Sikubwabo.
Q.	In your hideout, were you able to identify other assailants apart from Mika and Sikubwabo?
A.	I was not able to identify others.
Q.	What time was it?  Was it day or night?
A.	It was during the daytime.
Q.	Was your hiding place also in Mr. Kabanda's millet field?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Kabanda's millet field is the millet field from which he was flushed out, or is that his own property?  I'm asking you, Professor.  What are you referring to as Mr. Kabanda's millet field? 
MR. SONGA:
My question seeks to determine whether the witness's hideout was located in Mr. Kabanda's millet field.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, and my question is Mr. Kabanda's millet field, is it the millet field from which he was flushed out, or is a millet field belonging to Mr. Kabanda? 
MR. SONGA:
In view of the witness statement, it would appear that this is the same field.  I refer to the statement of 12 November of 1999.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You have asked the witness whether he was hiding in Mr. Kabanda's millet field.  I'm asking you, do you, by reference to Mr. Kabanda's millet field, refer to the millet field in which Mr. Kabanda was flushed out or the millet field which belonged to Mr. Kabanda?  Which is the meaning you give to the words, "Mr. Kabanda's millet field"? 
MR. SONGA:
Perhaps to ensure better understanding, I think the statement should be read and then it will be understood why I am putting this question.  This is what we find in the statement.  "While hiding in a bush, I saw Mika and a group of attackers he led find Assiel Kabanda.  He was hiding in his sorghum field."  That is the starting point of my question, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Merci.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you understood the question more clearly now, and can you answer it?
A.	But you didn't ask the question.  I didn't hear it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, repeat your question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, your own hiding place -- was your own hiding place in the farm of Kabanda, Assiel?
A.	Yes, it was in the farm of Kabanda, Assiel, because he was flushed out above the place where I, myself, was hiding.
Q.	How would you describe the group of assailants?  Were they wearing uniforms, for example?
A.	Some were wearing military fatigues.  Others were in civilian dress.  There were people like Mika who were participating in the attack.  It is not easy to distinguish a soldier from a civilian because the soldiers and the civilians were each shooting guns, so there was no real distinction as such.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say that Mika was at the head of a group, how do you know that he was the leader of this group?
A.	It is because everywhere where people were being killed, Mika was always present and with his gun.
Q.	Is it only his presence that caused you to say that he was leading the assailants?
A.	Before the war started, he did not own this gun.  Where did he find it if he was not really the leader of the attacks? 
Q.	If I understand you correctly, Mr. Witness, only leaders had guns.
A.	No.  There were people who had learnt how to handle firearms, who had been demobilised, and who were subsequently provided with arms.
Q.	Did you hear Mr. Sikubwabo say something?
A.	On that day, I did not hear him say anything at all.
Q.	Did you hear Mika say something?
A.	Yes, when he gave over the head to be taken away.
Q.	What did he say exactly?
A.	He gave the head to people so that it could be taken away.  I don't know -- I think that the head was taken to Gishyita.  I do not know whether his vehicle was a bit separate.  I saw him when Kabanda was flushed out.
Q.	What term did he use?
A.	He told them to take this head away.
Q.	And who took the head away?
A.	I do not know their names.
Q.	Did you know how many there were?
A.	The number of these people? 
Q.	Exactly.
A.	When you're hiding, you cannot have the liberty to go and count people.
Q.	But when you were in hiding, you confirmed that you could see?
A.	I talked of the people that I saw there.  I have talked of Sikubwabo and Mika, who were present.
Q.	You state that Kabanda was hit in the leg; is that correct?
A.	He was shot at several times.  He fell, but he did not die directly.  They found him on the ground and they cut off his head, but I couldn't tell you whose bullet hit him, but I was able to identify Mika and Sikubwabo amongst the people who were shooting.
Q.	Did I understand you correctly when you said that you do not know or you were unable to identify who exactly shot him?
A.	Mika was shooting.  Sikubwabo was doing the same.  Other assailants were also shooting.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see Mika cutting off the head of Assiel Kabanda?
A.	Mika ordered a young man who was with him to cut off the head of Assiel Kabanda and to take the head away.  I did not know where the head was being taken, but after the war I understood that this head had been taken to Gishyita.
Q.	Is it the same young man who cut the head off that took it away?
A.	Yes, and he was in the company of Mika.
Q.	Who was carrying the head?
A.	It is the young man that he handed it to.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I do not know whether this translation is accurate because, if I understood correctly, it is the young man who decapitated Assiel Kabanda, but it is said that the young man was taking the head away, but somebody had to hand it to him. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you explain that?
A.	I am explaining to you that this head was cut off and that it was taken away.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you be more specific?  Who had cut the head off Mr. Kabanda?
THE WITNESS: 
It was Mika.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	And the young man you mentioned a while ago, Mr. Witness --
A.	Mika handed over the head to that young man.
Q.	So Mika didn't give orders to anybody to behead Kabanda?
A.	Mika cut off the head and handed it over to the young man.
Q.	Mr. Witness, who undressed Kabanda?
A.	The young men who were with Mika.
Q.	But your statement of 12th November 1999 says that it was Mika who undressed him.  Now, what do you have to say about that?
A.	When Mika was cutting off the head, everybody was bending over to look at and undress Kabanda.  That is why I concluded that it is Mika who undressed him, given that he is the person who beheaded him.
Q.	And who beheaded Kabanda?
A.	We found the remaining part of Kabanda's body without his genitals, and we understood that the person who beheaded Kabanda is the same person who cut off his genitals because we found his body without his genitals.
Q.	If I understand you, Mr. Witness, you did not see the person who cut off Kabanda's genitals?
A.	We found his body without his genitals, nor his head.
Q.	When you found the body without the genitals or the head, where was Mika?
A.	Mika had gone back.
Q.	So it is after Mika had left and gone back that you realised that there were no genitals on the body, isn't it?
A.	He, and all the other assailants, went back, went home.
Q.	You state, Mr. Witness, that after the war, you saw Kabanda's genitals; is that correct?
A.	Yes, his genitals had been hung up on a stake in Gishyita, and it had dried up.
Q.	What was the season in Rwanda?
A.	The Inkotanyi brought us to Gitarama to ensure the security at Kibuye.  We remained at Kabgayi and when the security was restored, we returned.  We knew that Kabanda's genitals had been hung up on a pole, and when we arrived, we saw the genitals on the pole, and we had just come back from Gitarama. 
Q.	Please, can you answer my question.  What was the season in Rwanda at the time that you saw Kabanda's genitals on the pole?
A.	It was the dry season, because we were brought to Gitarama in July, and we returned in October.  It was, therefore, in October that we returned.
Q.	According to your information, would genitals that are hung up on a pole dry up or get rotten?
A.	The genitals dried up.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness.  
MR. SONGA:
And Madam President, I am inching towards my last question, unless the witness's answer elicits a further question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to conclude with your statement of 20 June 1996.  The statement of 20 June 1996, last page.  This is the portion I'd like to refer to.  It is virtually the end of the statement where there is a list of names.  In that portion you talk about the survivors of the Mugonero complex and you give the names of *********************************.  You also give the names of the survivors of *********************************************************************************************************************************************************.  Do you confirm that statement?
A.	Yes, I confirm it.
MR. SONGA:
Certain names, Madam President, were mentioned yesterday during the closed session, but these are names that are not protected, or those were names that were not protected.  Can we therefore ask the questions directly to the witness.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Do you recall that a question was asked you yesterday?
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA:
With due respect, Professor Songa's statement is not correct.  I think I will stop there.  When he says that these are not protected names -- I would wish to stop there.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The names which are mentioned in the statement of 20th June 1996? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.  I have reason to believe the contrary.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So all these names taken by professor are protected names? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Some of them are, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What do you mean by some of them, Mr. Kapaya? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, are you likely to identify these names, the individuals to whom these names belong, in your examination? 
MR. SONGA:
No, I would rather, Your Honours, say first of all that it is possible that there will be protected names among them, but since these are protected names that are on that list, they will not be repeated in my question.  The Prosecution should rest assured my question will only deal with names that are not protected.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we hope that this will be your last question, as you said -- as you promised.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I do keep my word.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Most times.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	The question is as follows, Mr. Witness.  You recall that yesterday you were asked a question on a number of persons as to whether you knew them.  You said that you recognised some of them and refused to recognise others.  Do you maintain the answer that you gave yesterday insofar as Elia Gashi and Iyamuremye, Mathias, are concerned?
A.	I never talked of Iyamuremye, nor of Gashi, in my testimony.
Q.	Mr. Witness, that is not the issue.  The question is as follows.  On account of the answer that you gave yesterday with respect to Elia Gashi and Iyamuremye, Mathias, persons whom you mentioned by name expressly as being some of the survivors of Bisesero and Mugonero, now do you want to maintain your answer according to which you do not know those persons?  Yes or no.
A.	I know those persons, but I have never mentioned them in my testimonies.
Q.	In other words, you are not going to stick to your answer, so your answer is no?
A.	I have told you that I know those persons, but that I have never mentioned them in my testimonies.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would simply like to request your leave so that I can tender some Defence exhibits, in particular, the statement of 20 June 1996, on which I just asked the last two questions.  That said, Madam President, once again, I would like to thank you and I would also like to thank the witness for making himself available to us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So it is the statement of this witness dated 20 June 1996 is Exhibit D. 27E for English version and Exhibit D. 27F for French, both versions to be kept under seal.
(Exhibit Nos. D. 27E and D. 27F admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Mr. Kapaya, do you have any re-examination?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, I have a few questions in closed session, and for that reason, I make a formal application under the provisions of Rule 75(B)(ii) and 79(A)(ii) for a closed session because the questions I'm going to put to this witness may identify him, he being a protected witness.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you have any objection to the closed session?
MR. SONGA:
No objection, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  Then we go into the closed session.  

Mr. Issa, please arrange for the closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 24 to 29] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)  
(Pages 1 to 23 by Trevor Gerbes)

















MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  We thank the Chamber for allowing us to express our opinion in open session.  We indeed filed a motion to amend the judicial calendar, following service of a document dealing with the amendment of the judicial calendar for the month of April to June 2004.  

When we read that document, we realised that that calendar confirmed the session of the 30th of 
April 2004, as far as the Prosecutor was concerned, to close his case, and that the Defence had to make its own case on the 31st of May 2004.  

If we raise that motion, Madam President, as you must have noticed, it would have been between the 30th of April 2004 and the 30th of May 2004, and the gap would have been only one month, 22 days.  This time limit, as far as we are concerned -- the Defence is concerned, seems to be too short.  

We should first of all, take into account the circumstances under which this trial began, and we are referring to all the status conferences that were held before the trial began.  

You would realise, Madam President, that we raised a certain number of issues, some of which were responded to, while no satisfactory answers were given to others.  But to sum up the situation, what exactly are we talking about?  

When the status conference, that is the last one, was held on the 24th of March 2004, we were on the ground trying to meet potential Defence witnesses and we had to do that by the 17th of February.  We could not finish our work because we had to attend the status conference with a view to effectively starting the trial on the 29th of March.  

However, that trip had already been accepted by the Tribunal.  It was your Tribunal during its 14th January 2004 meeting, had understood the need for organising such a trip in order to meet potential witnesses.  We could not complete that mission because we had to heed the orders and instructions of the Tribunal.  And we thought that we would have enough time, the necessary time, to complete the mission.  

Subsequently, following discussions we held, both with the OTP and the registry, we had to schedule at least one other mission in order to meet witnesses who are located in the Rwandan communities of the diaspora, and the most important of these communities is in DRC; others are in Central African region, notably in Cameroon, Benin and Togo.  
By the way, after the first status conference, the President of the Tribunal had directed us to consult with the witness support section in order to be informed of all prior arrangements regarding the calling of Defence witnesses, such that we of the Defence would be in a position to inform the witnesses we are going to meet as regards the measures that have to be taken regarding precautions that had to be taken, and to meet the Tribunal's expectations in order to travel to Arusha, to stay in Arusha and eventually return to their countries of origin.  After that session, we were informed that in order to act properly, the witness support section should have at least two months from the time when they received the final list and the time when the witness is expected to be called before this Tribunal.  
It was in view of all those circumstances, Madam President, that we thought your Chamber could meet the requirements of Rule 20(4)(b) of the Statutes, which provides for the Defence having the necessary time and facilities to prepare itself.  

Then in our motion, we made it a point of duty to recall two decisions already taken by the Tribunal, and which both recognise the principle that the Defence should have sufficient time, taking into account the indictment which was amended only on the 20th of January this year and which contains new charges and new sites.  I am referring to the decision of the 21st of January 2004, relating to the Prosecution motion to be allowed to amend the indictment.  

In that decision, Madam President, we find the follow passage:  "The new counts of rape constitute a serious offence for the Defence, which should, therefore, be given a certain amount of time to prepare its case."  

I also refer the Chamber, Madam President, to the decision of this Tribunal, the decision of 5th of March 2004, relating to the Defence motion relating to the date of commencement of trial.  This is the relevant passage:  "The investigations that the Defence is currently carrying out are aimed at enabling it to efficiently deal with Prosecution witnesses.  It will have the possibility to undertake other investigations before the presentation of the Defence case."  

The same decision continues: "There is no doubt that the Defence should urgently contact witnesses again which it intends to call and find new witnesses to challenge the accuracy of events related in the statements of Prosecution witnesses disclosed after the month of December 2002."  

Why does this last decision refer to December 2002?  It is because since the month -- since 2002 up to the 17th of February 2004, the Defence team was not allowed to undertake a mission for reasons -- for financial reasons, housekeeping matters.  This means that for almost a year, in fact, a year and a half, Mika Muhimana's Defence team has not had any contact with potential Defence witnesses, whether we are dealing with new witnesses or witnesses who had already been identified and located since December 2002.  

In raising our motion, Madam President, we were hoping that through your decision, you would reconcile the need for an expedient trial and the need for a fair trial which would enable the Accused to enjoy full defence and answer.  That is why, Madam President, we have raised this motion, requesting the Chamber to rule that the motion is well-grounded and admissible, and to, therefore, give the Defence reasonable and necessary time to prepare its Defence.  

In our motion, we estimate that the time we need will be at least two months, which, in any case, may not be enough to enable us to meet the requirements of the judicial calendar.  We thought that if we had at least two months -- and thanks to your understanding, we could even have more than two months -- it would enable us to really prepare our case and make a full defence and answer in a fair trial.  

We are raising this motion, Madam President, with all the respect and deference we have for you, Madam President and the Honourable Judges as well as the august Chamber.  I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Yes, Mr. Kapaya, what do you have to say?
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  We have very little to say, actually as regards this motion.  We are all aware that a judicial calendar is normally fixed in consultation with the wishes, problems of both parties, and in this particular case, we have had several status conferences whereby the Chamber, in consultation with the parties, agreed to fix these dates, as to the beginning of the Prosecution case and the beginning of the Defence case.  Now, it's our humble submission, Your Honours, that, though we do not in principle oppose this motion, we submit that -- I think each of the parties should strive to the best of their ability to conform to the dictates of the judicial calendars as agreed upon by the parties.  That is all that I have to say, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

We have deliberated, and also taking into account the fact that the Prosecution this time was very generous and has not seriously grudged the prayer of the Defence.  Therefore, we are inclined to grant the motion.  

As for the fixed date regarding the presentation of the Defence case, that will be released later on, after we check or schedule the other trials pending before the Chamber II, of which myself and 
	Judge Muthoga, we both are members.  And we may assure you, Professor, that the minimum -- that you will have the minimum of two months for the preparation of your case after the close of the Prosecution evidence. 
MR. SONGA:
We are much obliged, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So we take a short break for 15 minutes. 
	(Court recessed from 1628 to 1655H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	The proceedings in the Court are resumed.  

Good evening, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you are a protected witness.  You will be referred to as Witness BC in these proceedings instead of your real name.  Make sure that you do not disclose your name, place of residence or any other information which may lead to your identification.  You shall speak the truth, and for that, you will have to take the solemn declaration.

Mr. Issa, please, swear in the witness.
MR. ISSA:
Madam Witness, kindly stand up and raise up your right hand and repeat the following words after me: 
	(Declaration made by Witness BC in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Madenga, please lead your witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, Your Honours, members of the Defence team, Madam Witness and colleagues in Court, a very good evening.  

Madam Witness BC is Prosecution Witness No. 14.  She made one statement dated the 29th of November 1999.  It was disclosed to the Defence in French, English and Kinyarwanda.  If Your Honours refer to the binders, the statement is contained from page 403 to page 412.  

With your leave, if I can proceed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed.
WITNESS BC,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, there is a protected witness information sheet in front of you.  If you recall, this morning, we went through the details, your personal details, together and you appended your signature on line No. 3.  Do you identify your signature on the document? 
A.	Yes, my signature appears on this document. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecution would like to tender the protected witness information as Prosecution Exhibit No. 18. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is so entered and admitted as Exhibit P. 18, under seal.
	(Exhibit No. P. 18 admitted, under seal)
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, we want to focus from the period of the 6th of April, 1994.  When did you learn about the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I learnt of the death of President Habyarimana on the 7th of April. 
Q.	When you learnt about the death on the 7th of April --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel.
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In the protected information sheet you have provided us, would you please let us know what No. 9 means?   
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  No. 9, you will notice, is the same description given in all the witness statements when it is related to current occupation.  I also asked, because I wanted to understand the meaning of No. 9, and I was referred to the physical disabilities she sustained during the war.  So I think it is a way of indicating that by virtue of those disabilities, she is now in the state described on page 9. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, we will continue.  You had just related that you heard about the death of the president on the 7th of April.  And the follow-up question was:  Where were you? 
A.	I was on Kalama hill, in Kalama cellule, Musenyi secteur, Gishyita commune. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  If I can just remind you that when I ask  follow-up questions, if these questions reveal your identity or where you were staying in 1994, just avoid giving specific details contained in Exhibit No. 18.  Who were you staying with in 1994, on the 7th of April, when you heard about the president's death? 
A.	I was living with the members of my family.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  What was your marital status in 1994? 
A.	In 1994, I was married and I had three children. 
Q.	Madam, what was your husband's ethnic background? 
A.	He was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Thank you.  You indicated that you were married and you had three children.  Can you please tell the Court the ages of your children as in 1994?  How old were they? 
A.	Yes, I can tell you.  The eldest was six years old.  The second was three years old, and the youngest was a year and a half old. 
Q.	For the time being, let's focus on your children.  The six year old child, your child -- was the child a girl or a boy? 
A.	It was a girl. 
Q.	What was the sex of the three and a half year old?  Was your child a boy or a girl? 
A.	It was also a girl. 
Q.	The baby you said was aged one and a half years old.  What was the sex of the baby?
A.	It was a boy. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  
MS. MADENGA:
Madam President, before I proceed to the next aspect of the examination-in-chief, I have just noted that the witness seems depressed, and during the course of reconfirmation in the morning, she actually made a request that she wants a witness support assistant.  But I had actually explained to her that I will just monitor in Court how she will be feeling.  Then, if I feel that she needs that support, then I will make an application to the Court.  So it is in view of that observation that I make an application in terms of Article 21, as read with Rules 34(A)(iii) and Rule 89(B).  I am applying that the Court allows the witness to sit with a designated witness support assistant from the witness and victims support unit. 
MADAM PRESIDNT:
Yes, Professor, what do you have to say?  
MR. SONGA:
We do not have any objection, Madam President.  We defer to your wisdom. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have deliberated and we allow the application.  Let somebody from the witness support section to sit beside the witness.  
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  Thank you, the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, please. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness, for your strength.  You had taken us to the events of the 7th of April 1994, when you were in the company of your husband and your children.  

Now, can you explain to the Court the security situation which prevailed after you heard about the death of the president? 
A.	The security situation wasn't very good.  The war began and people started getting massacred. 
Q.	Can you describe to the Court what you mean by deterioration of the security situation and people being massacred?  Who was being massacred? 
A.	The Tutsis were the ones who were being massacred. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court what you personally saw?  Who was doing the massacre you are referring to? 
A.	There is a gentleman who was called Mika Muhimana.  On the 9th he launched an attack against our colline.  There were clashes on our colline because we had regrouped and we were giving stones to our husbands and Mika with Ruhindura and they had surrounded us and they talked to us, asking us with whom we were fighting, and we told them, "Can't you see them?"  We asked him, "Can't you see them?" And he said that, "Those who were shooting at you are not intelligent.  How can a person who is armed with a machete be facing people who had guns?"  Mika took the weapons from the assailants and said they were bandits who had attacked us.  He put together these firearms and made them to be kept in a certain Ngendahayo's home.  From there onwards, he launched attacks on us every day. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  You referred to this gentleman you refer to as Mika Muhimana.  Can you please clarify to the Court?  Who is Mika Muhimana? 
A.	I know him very well.  Besides, when I saw him, I was traumatised.  I prayed to God to comfort us, given what he did to me. 
Q.	Madam Witness, before the events you are describing on the 7th of April 1994, did you know this gentleman you are referring to as Mika Muhimana? 
A.	Yes, I knew him. 
Q.	What was his occupation? 
A.	He was the conseiller of the Gishyita secteur.  He was also a trader. 
Q.	For how long had you known Mika Muhimana? 
A.	I knew him since the time I was married. 
Q.	You also deposed in your evidence that when you saw the person, you were traumatised.  Did you see Mika Muhimana today?  
A.	Yes, I have seen him. 
Q.	Where is Mika Muhimana sitting? 
A.	I can see him.  He is sitting on this side.  He is wearing a black jacket and a red tie. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Do you think you can point out so that we know who exactly you are talking about? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you stand up and identify the Accused in the Court?

The witness has identified the Accused. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  

Thank you, Madam Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness, please take your seat.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	You also explained how Mika Muhimana attacked your village.  Can you tell the Court how 
	Mika Muhimana came to your place? 
A.	I thought I explained this to you, unless you want me to tell you where he found us where we were hiding. 
Q.	Thank you, madam.  You can proceed to tell us how close Mika Muhimana was when you first saw Mika? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
During the war? 
MS. MADENGA:
Yes, Your Honour.  We are talking of the events of the 7th of April 1994, when she says Mika came to their village. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
THE WITNESS:
We were on a hill.  People had come together and they were not aware that it was a war; that the Tutsis and the Hutus, they were assembled together.  Mika came and found us and asked us to sit down.  We sat down.  He was in the company of Ruhindura, who was a communal policeman.  He asked us, "Why are you fighting whereas you have machetes and while others have guns?"  We answered by saying that, "Before we die, we will have to fight."  So the distance wasn't very long.  He was sitting like where this gentleman is sitting, and he said, "Go away, nothing is going to happen to you." And since for us we knew things were difficult, we fled because we were under the impression that he was marking us, and we tried to run towards Bisesero.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you mentioned "gentleman."  You are referring to which gentleman? 
THE WITNESS:
I am referring to the man who is near the lady, to the white lady.  That is where he was when he asked us to put down what we had with us. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam, are you referring to the Judges?  I mean to the Judge beside me?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  That is exactly what I wanted to say.  I am talking about the man who is sitting near the woman.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MS. MADENGA:
Your Honour, may the record reflect that the witness has made an indication from the witness stand to where Honourable Judge Short is sitting, and I would seek the indulgence of my colleague from registry to ascertain the specific distance.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Four and a half metres. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it was exactly at that distance that he was from us.  I, myself, if I try to come up with an estimate, from here he was standing where the Judge is. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant, could you please verify this?
MR. HOMETOWU:
Madam President, I confirm that it is about four and a half metres.  This was confirmed yesterday, and we still confirm that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Ms. Madenga, please proceed.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	When Mika Muhimana was at that distance, and you also indicated he was addressing the people, who specifically was Mika Muhimana addressing? 
A.	He was talking to the Hutus and the Tutsis, but when we broke up, he asked the Hutus to break away from the Tutsis since their fate was sealed.  We remained on that hill.  Our husbands remained on that hill whereas the women and the children went to Bisesero.  And while the Hutus and the Tutsis were separating from one another, they came and shot at us, but they couldn't do this before because the Hutus were mingled with the Tutsis.  They knew that they could not throw grenades at people from both ethnic groups.  People did not know that the war was targeting only one ethnic group.  So he tried to sensitise the Hutus and asked them not to be with the Tutsis, and it is then that we were able to flee. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You referred to Mika saying that you are armed with machetes.  Were people armed with machetes? 
A.	Everyone was equipped with a machete or a gun, and they were facing people who were armed with guns, and these are the attackers that Mika was leading.  The others were on the hill and they were throwing stones.  But then, there were some who had machetes.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You also indicated that the machetes were given to one Ngendahayo.  Do you know Ngendahayo's  ethnic group? 
A.	Ngendahayo was a Hutu and he was in charge of a cellule.  
Q.	Madam, you also indicated that you then decided to flee to Bisesero.  Why did you choose to go to Bisesero? 
A.	This is because there were many Tutsis there, and where we were, we had many Hutus with us.  On the night of Friday, the Hutus had killed a certain Leona, so we decided to flee towards Bisesero, because there were many people of our ethnic group and there were collines that could give us hiding. 
Q.	Madam, when you fled to Bisesero, did anyone accompany you, any member of your family? 
A.	Yes, I went with my husband and my children, as well as with many other members of the population, my mother and my brothers. 
Q.	Did you pass through any other place before you reached Bisesero?
A.	No.
Q.	Thank you, madam.  Can you explain to us whether you found Bisesero safe? 
A.	When we reached, we realised that it wasn't safe.  People were surrounded by attackers.  We therefore climbed down.  There was an attack that came from Mubuga, another from Gisovu, so we decided to go to Kigarama.  The war wasn't when we were at Kigarama. 
Q.	What happened in Kigarama? 
A.	There was no security either.  There we spent the day running, and we used to go back to houses that had been destroyed.  During the night, there was no security.  Wherever we were, insecurity prevailed. 
Q.	You also indicated that because of the insecurity, there were also attacks.  Can you describe the attacks in Kigarama? 
A.	These attacks were led by Mika.  These are attacks that he used to launch in our region. 
Q.	Can you recall how many attacks Mika Muhimana launched in your region? 
A.	I cannot count them.  He had a very fearsome Interahamwe who used to disguise themselves with paint, and when they were returning, they would kill cows.  So you cannot exactly say where they went. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I now want to focus on your children.  You talked of the many attacks.  What happened to your children? 
A.	They died.  Even if I am still surviving, I am handicapped because of Muhimana, Mika Muhimana.
Q.	I am sorry about that.  We will come to the issue you raised, that you are handicapped.  Now, I just want to focus on your children.  You say they died.  Who killed your children? 
A.	It is Mika Muhimana. 
Q.	How did Mika Muhimana kill your children, Madam Witness? 
A.	We were on the Ngendombi hill, our colline.  They came, they fought our husbands; people were throwing stones and people were fighting and sometimes they could even capture a person that was armed with a gun.  So when they realised that they were going to be beaten, Mika placed a grenade on the road.  So people felt that with stones they had fended off the assailants.  The assailants retreated and our husbands moved towards the assailants that were retreating, and the grenade which had been placed on the road exploded and people died.  Those who did not die were finished off.  We were supplying our husbands with stones, and the men who survived that grenade, came and it is then that my children died.  I, myself, I was wounded and we had to flee and go into the bush.  So they had just thrown that grenade at us. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I know it is very difficult, but it is very important for the Court to know exactly, step by step, if you know which child was killed first and how that child was killed by 
	Mika Muhimana.  Do you know which child was killed first?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was she present?  
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Let me rephrase the question. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, were you present when your children were killed. 
A.	Yes, I was with them. 
Q.	Did you personally see your children being killed? 
A.	Yes, I was witness to that. 
Q.	Madam Witness, which of your children was killed first? 
A.	It is the eldest who was killed first.  Do you want me to give you his name or her name? 
Q.	Don't give me the name because you are a protected witness, and we do not want to disclose your identity.  It will suffice if you just explain how that child was killed. 
A.	He cut his throat.  He cut off the arm of the other child as well as that of the second child.  He also cut me up but, fortunately, I survived. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  When Mika Muhimana cut off the first child and the second child, did you personally see what happened to the baby, your last child? 
A.	Are you talking about the baby I was carrying?  When I woke up, I realised that he had cut up my baby and that he had also cut me up. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness, can you now explain to the Court how you were personally cut?  You indicated that, "I was also cut by Mika Muhimana."
A.	Yes, I can tell you that.  He cut my two hands.  He completely cut off one arm and he hit me with the machete on the head and on the shoulder. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You referred to him cutting your arm.  Can you indicate which arm you are referring to? 
A.	It is the left hand.
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, can I ask my witness to stand up so that she makes indications of the arm which was cut by Mika Muhimana. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you stand up and indicate to the Court which arm was cut by Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes, I can do that.  This is it.  I have scars on the head and on the shoulder.  I have very many scars on the shoulder.

MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honour, can the record indicate or reflect that the witness has indicated an arm where the hand was cut off.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The left hand of the witness is cut off.  And she has also scars on her right arm. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	You were cut on the arm.  You have scars on the right hand.  Did you sustain any other injuries as a result of the attack by Mika Muhimana on your person? 
A.	He left thinking I was already dead.  I don't have any other scars resulting from attacks launched by him.  When I came to, my husband was standing over me, and he was the one who moved me from there.  The time was about 6 p.m. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  You explained that the children were cut by a machete.  Can you please tell the Court what was used by Mika to inflict those injuries on your person? 
A.	He used a machete and not a gun.  I was not hit by a bullet from his gun. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  When Mika used the machete -- I know it is difficult in terms of time, but you are strong.  You indicated that you woke up around 6 p.m., but do you know at what time Mika started attacking you? 
A.	The time was about 2 p.m.  We had yielded to the attackers, and that was when people were killed. 
Q.	Did Mika Muhimana say anything to you when he was cutting you? 
A.	They were singing and saying, "Exterminate them.  Flush them out of the forest."  And they went on to say, "Kill them.  Exterminate them."  I could hear that slogan. 
Q.	Madam, can you also just clarify in terms of the place where this happened exactly? 
A.	Those events occurred at a location called Ngendombi, in the Bisesero hills. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  You indicated that when you woke up you saw your husband.  What then happened from there? 
A.	He took me away from there, but all my children were dead.  He brought me to Kigarama, to the ruins of a house in which we stayed.  I stayed there for a few months.  And whenever they returned, they looked at me with contempt and said, "Let us do the same to the others." 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I didn't follow you, Witness.  When who returned? 
THE WITNESS:
You are referring to whom?  Who returned where?  
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who was it who said, "Let us do the same to the other ones?"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, could you please stand on your microphone, please. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Who was it that said -- you said when they returned they said, "Let us do it to the other ones."  I didn't follow your evidence.  

Perhaps, Counsel, you can rephrase the question.  I didn't get it.
THE WITNESS:
I am referring to the Hutus, the assailants who returned.  I was lying down.  I could not move; I had too many wounds on me.  I even heeded the call of nature where I was lying down. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In Bisesero? 
THE WITNESS:
It was in Kigarama.  I had left Bisesero for Kigarama.  My husband brought me to Kigarama, to a location situated below Bisesero.  It is a secteur or a colline of Bisesero. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Continue, Counsel. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you, Your Honour, I will proceed. 
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Madam, from the time your husband took you to Kigarama after Mika Muhimana had inflicted those injuries, did you receive medical attention? 
A.	I received no medical care apart from hot water that was used to bathe me with.  When the assailants arrived, they took our pots and went away with them.  And even the pots in which we boiled water were taken away. 
Q.	Madam Witness, did you see Mika Muhimana after you were taken to Kigarama by your husband? 
A.	I saw him before I was brought back to Kigarama.  I saw him after he inflicted those wounds on me. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  What happened to your husband? 
A.	My husband took care of me for two weeks, and thereafter, he was killed. 
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, how your husband was killed after taking care of you for two weeks? 
A.	He was killed behind the ruins of that house.  I was inside the house.  He had gone to hide with the others.  It is the people who were with him who related that to me.  He said, "I will return to the ruins.  I don't think there are any further assailants.  There is nobody taking care of my wife."  And when he returned, he was killed behind that house which was in ruins. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has just given the name of her uncle. 

THE WITNESS:
So (By order of the Court this name has been extracted and filed under seal) was complaining of the fact that I was suffering.  He knew that my husband had been killed.  I insisted that I wanted to go and see the remains of my husband.  I was assisted to go and see where my husband's body was.  And when I got behind that house in ruins, I noticed that my husband's throat had been slit.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, madam.  Thank you, members of the translation team.  They indicated that my witness had just disclosed the uncle's name.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The protected information be kept under seal.
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	Who then looked after you, after your husband had been killed? 
A.	My father did. 
Q.	What eventually happened to your father? 
A.	He was also killed. 
Q.	Do you know how your father was killed? 
A.	I could not get to the place where he was killed.  He was killed together with my five cousins in an area where I couldn't get to. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  For how long did you stay in this ruins, the house you indicated was in Kigarama? 
A.	After my father was murdered, who had been the only one taking care of me, I was with my uncle.  He went to see my elder sister who had sought refuge in a place called Kazirandimwe.  And my uncle told me, "Your father is dead and there is nobody to take care of her.  Come here and take care of her."  So my elder sister came and took me to Kazirandimwe.

	1745H
BY MS. MADENGA:
Q.	From Kazirandimwe, Madam Witness, where did you go? 
A.	The French arrived.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness, for your strength. 
MS. MADENGA:
Thank you very much, Your Honours.  That's the end of the examination-in-chief. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Madenga. 

Madam Witness, now you'll be asked questions by the -- by Counsel for Muhimana.  Understand the questions and answer them very briefly. 

Yes, Professor.  You have the floor for cross-examination. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  This afternoon, it is Counsel Kazadi Kabimba, Co-Counsel, who will lead the cross-examination.  I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He is welcome.
MR. KABIMBA:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, learned friends of the Prosecution.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, thank you for coming to state the facts before this Chamber, the facts that this Chamber is out to investigate.  This is my first question to you:  Where were you residing in April 1994?
A.	I was residing in my parents' home.
Q.	Could you please tell me the name of the cellule? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is protected information.  Hold on, Madam Witness. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Madam President, she could write it down on paper so that her security may not be jeopardised. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you read or write? 

THE WITNESS:
No. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we ask the interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth to assist the witness? 

Mr. Issa, please give a piece of paper and pen to the witness -- to the interpreter. 

Mr. Interpreter, please ask the name of the cellule from the witness and write it down for her -- for us. 

So this is the name of the cellule in the -- in 1994, where she used to live with her parents. 

Yes, Mr. Interpreter, please, thank you.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  Could you please add, on the same paper, the name of the secteur in which your cellule was located? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we ask the interpreter once again to assist the witness? 
MS. MADENGA:
I would suggest, Your Honours, that since the information is contained in Exhibit 18, maybe the witness will just make indications or confirmations if it's different.  Then maybe the Kinyarwanda interpreter can write, because what we are seeing is the same information which is being duplicated. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
This is cross-examination, Madam.  She is being cross-examined.  It's the hope of Counsel that she will give a different name from that one.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the Defence Counsel knows -- he knows the name of the cellule and secteur is given in 
Exhibit P. 18.

Yes, Mr. Interpreter, please write down the name of the secteur too.  Ask the witness first and then write it down. 

Thank you, Interpreter.  Please take a seat. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, are you finished with the interpreter?  We don't want to recall him again.  Are you finished with the interpreter?  You don't need him any more? 
MR. KABIMBA:
Your Honour, if the Defence requires him, we will call him back, if we have any question relating to that. 

Could the witness tell us who was the conseiller in charge of her secteur? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to Gishyita secteur, Counsel.
MR. KABIMBA:
Exactly.
JUDGE SHORT:
Counsel, you have to be sensitive to the need to protect the witness, not to ask questions which will reveal the identity of the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe we should recall the interpreter.  

Mr. Interpreter, please.  Can you oblige us once again? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
We hope, Counsel, you are not going to ask who was the bourgmestre and the next one, because if you are, then we might just as well go into a closed session. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you for your remark, Your Honour.  It reflects my own feeling.  I would like to add that I didn't mention the name of the secteur.  It's the witness herself who mentioned that name.  That is why I requested that she should write it down with the assistance of the investigator -- of the interpreter, so that her security may not be endangered. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What we are suggesting to you, Counsel, if you have many questions of this type which require to be written down instead of spoken out, then it is safer to apply to go to closed session so that we can deal with it quicker.  But if that's the only one you're asking, then it can be dealt with that way.  But if we are now going to ask who was bourgmestre and who was this and who was that, which might reveal the identity of the witness, then it is simpler to just go to closed session. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Your Honours, for your pertinent reaction.  If such is the conviction of this Chamber, we have no objection that these questions be put to the witness in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, are you intending to elicit more information which are of a protected nature?    
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I don't have many other questions, just one more question, and then we can continue without any further problems. 

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Can you ask that one while the interpreter is still there so that he can help, then finish with him?
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Witness, could you please give us the name of the conseiller of your secteur? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was that not the name which was given before?  Yes.  Any other name you want, Counsel?  Any other name you want? 
MR. KABIMBA:
No, Your Honours.  I did not see the name she wrote on the piece of paper. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yeah, you didn't.  So we are asking you if you have other questions before the interpreter goes away. 
MR. KABIMBA:
No, Your Honour.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you acknowledge that you were interviewed by the investigators of the Prosecutor on the 7th of December 1999?
A.	Yes.  I know this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, which day did you say?  7th of December 1999? 
MR. KABIMBA:
Madam President, her statement is signed, with her handprint, her fingerprint, on the 13th of December 1999, but it states that the interview took place on the 29th of November 1999. 
JUDGE SHORT:
That's not the date you mentioned when you put your question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Counsel, as you know the witness is illiterate, you should be very specific about the dates.  She doesn't understand the dates, we believe.  She doesn't understand the dates.  So you should be very specific with the dates. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

I would like to ask Madam Witness whether she remembers signing a document before the Prosecution investigators. 
THE WITNESS:
I acknowledge that I made a statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you have a copy of that document?  Can we see it? 
Mr. Issa, please pick up the copy from the counsel. 

Yes, Mr. Kabimba, please proceed.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you confirm that you knew Muhimana before the events of April 1994?
A.	I knew him.
Q.	Did you also know the members of his family? 
A.	No.  I do not know them.  I do not know his family because he is not my neighbour, but I knew that he was conseiller.
Q.	Because your statements that I have mentioned before the Court states that on the 17th of April 1994, following the death of the president, that is on the 7th of April of 1994, people were telling you that the Tutsis were going to be killed.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is indeed correct.  That is my statement.
Q.	Can you tell us who said that Tutsis were going to be killed? 
A.	Are you trying to say that the Tutsi did not die? 
Q.	Madam Witness, I would be grateful if you would limit yourself to just answering my question.  Who told you that the Tutsis were going to be killed? 
A.	I was a witness. 
Q.	I would prefer that you answer my question as in relation to your statements before the investigators.  You stated that somebody said that the Tutsis were going to be killed.  Could you tell us who said that?
A.	Do you think that this is not true?  Were they not killed?  I have the feeling that you are insisting on this question so that you want to know who told me.  This happened to us.  Ask me the question -- don't ask me the question.  Ask Mika.  You must ask Mika who asked him to kill Tutsis.  How do you want me to be the person to know? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, please answer the question asked by the Defence counsel.  Don't go into the details and comments on -- and comment on the question.  Can you tell the counsel who told you that the Tutsis were to be killed?  Do you know the people -- do you recall the people who told you that the Tutsi were to be killed? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you how the war began.  You ask me to tell you who ordered that the Tutsi be killed.  How can I tell you?  I do not know who ordered it.  I just saw that we were attacked.  I do not know who was at the origin of this policy. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you said that some people told you that the Tutsis were to be killed.  Who were those people? 
THE WITNESS:
That is all I have to tell you.  We were attacked.  That's all.  There were two tribes.  The Hutu said that the Tutsi would be killed.  And that is what happened.  Do you think that I can really answer this question?  You yourself must understand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, you have the answer.  Now move on to another question. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Madam President.  We are not going to spend -- waste all our time on that.  She has given the answer that we hoped for. 

I would like Madam Witness to be a little bit more courageous and tell us whether she felt personally threatened at that time when the rumours were circulating. 
THE WITNESS:
How could I not have a problem, when I was a member of the people who were being targeted?  How couldn't I have a problem? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You answer questions in a positive way.  Say yes or no.  Don't go into the details. 

Yes, Mr. Kabimba, please proceed.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that on Friday, your Hutu neighbours began to terrorise the Tutsi; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Perhaps with the aid of the registry, would you be able to write down the names of these neighbours on a piece of paper so that we might learn more about this? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That's not a fair question, Counsel.  It's not a fair question because once she has said Hutu neighbours, she isn't identifying individuals.  It's members of the Hutu community who were living in the neighbourhood with him -- with her.  Unless you want to ask -- unless she makes a specific allegation about a certain individual, the question would not be fair. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, move on to another question, please. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I will adopt the position of Your Honours.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, are you able to tell us whether you were personally terrorised? 
A.	Listen, this was just not -- not just terrorism.  It was not limited to being frightened.  I was a witness to these attacks. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Counsel, what do you mean by "personally terrorised"? 
MR. KABIMBA:
Your Honour, Madam President, I would like to know whether she, as an individual, her physical person, her family, her home, whether she was terrorised by these undetermined neighbours. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
	On which date? 
MR. KABIMBA:
We are talking about Friday, the 8th of April 1994.  Madam Witness stated that the neighbours began to terrorise the Tutsi.  I would like to ask her whether she was one of those persons who were terrorised that Friday, because she was still in her home at the time. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, please answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
Why wouldn't I not have been frightened?  I was frightened.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us concretely what frightened you in your home? 
A.	But you are a witness to what happened to me.  I have shown you what I am like now.  I just think that you want to force that panic in my head.  You are trying to terrorise me. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you can be sure that I am sorry for your trouble and I do not wish to terrorise you in your head, as you say.  I am seeking the truth. 

Madam Witness, you state that an attack -- or assailants led by Mika came to your house on Saturday; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What did this attack consist of? 
A.	The assailants disarmed us and took our weapons to a person's house.  This Mr. Muhimana said that we had been attacked by thieves.  This is what Mika and Ruhindura said.  They disarmed us and put our weapons in somebody's house.
Q.	Did you yourself see that you were attacked? 
A.	But think, do you think that the assailants wanted to have fun with us or do you think that they were shooting firearms for the fun of it?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Counsel, you are asking hypothetical questions.  Be specific in your question, please. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Madam President, I would like to determine whether there was indeed an attack, whether there were concrete, material acts that could help convince us that there was an attack on that Saturday, and it is only she, who was there when it happened, can explain to us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So ask straightforward questions. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Can the witness tell us how many people died during this attack of Saturday? 
THE WITNESS:
Nobody died on that day.  The assailants were afraid to kill people because the Hutu and the Tutsi were mixed up.  When the assailants came, they were not able to sort the Hutu from the Tutsi, and men and women were together, and these people disarmed our husbands and -- saying, "It is only thieves who attacked you."  That is what I stated.  On that day, on that Saturday, nobody was killed.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Can you explain to the Court the acts that Mika committed on that day? 
A.	It is he who led the attack.  He came to reassure us.  Afterwards, he went away and he asked the assailants to withdraw.  Immediately, we left for Bisesero.  On that day, Mika came to reassure us, he disarmed us, he went away, he didn't do anything evil.  And immediately after that we went back -- we went to Bisesero.  On that day, he did nothing bad.  I cannot say -- tell any lies about anybody whatsoever.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Can you tell us what Ruhindura did on that day?
A.	Mika spoke to Ruhindura and asked him to store his weapons.  Ruhindura put his arms aside and he went away with Mika.
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  When we read your statement, we see that you say there that it is Mika who gathered all these weapons and spears.  Do you confirm this statement? 
A.	It is he who took these weapons and gave them to Ruhindura, asking him to put them inside the house.
Q.	Madam Witness, you said a while ago that it is Ruhindura who gathered all these weapons.  Now you change your position or do you maintain it? 
A.	Please, Counsel, I have told you that Mika disarmed us.  He gave the weapons to the policeman asking him to put them in the house, and he was saying that we were attacked by bandits.  You are -- what you're saying -- you are saying what you're saying.  That is not what I said.  I'm telling you what I witnessed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, what is the name of that policeman? 
THE WITNESS:
He was called Ruhindura.  And he is dead, in fact.  He was killed during an attack that was launched against us.  But ask Mika whether he knows anything about it, before you ask me this question.  Ask the question of Mika.  Does he not know where Ruhindura fell?  He knows where Ruhindura fell.  And Ruhindura was carrying a gun and the Tutsi arrested him with his weapon and seized it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, please try and answer the question, only the questions you are asked.  Don't tell us any further stories.  When Counsel requires some more information, he will ask you.  Just answer the one he is -- the question that he asks you, without expanding it, without explaining it, without commenting on it.  That way, your evidence will come out much better than it's coming now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And answer the question very briefly.  

Yes, Mr. Kabimba.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you now state that it is Ruhindura who gathered the weapons that you were holding and that he put them in a house, whereas you said beforehand --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, she said it was Mika who had collected the weapons and gave it to the policeman. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Asked the policeman to keep it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
To keep it. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I am basing this on the statement before the Prosecution investigators, wherein she said that it is Mika who gathered the weapons and stored them in the home of the person whom she mentioned.  So these are two different versions.  May she confirm one or the other? 
MS. MADENGA:
With your leave, Your Honours? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MADENGA:
If my learned colleague can make a distinction between the witness's oral evidence and the written statement, what the witness has just said now is to elaborate what happened.  So I think the confusion is coming because there is now a mixture between the oral evidence in Court and the written one. 

So can you ask specifically the witness, stating what she said in Court and what she said in her statement, not mixing the two?  Because I think that is where the confusion is coming from. 
Thank you very much, Your Honours. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Perhaps we can clarify from the witness.  Is Ngendahayo the same person as Ruhindura? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  Ruhindura is a policeman, but Ngendahayo is a neighbour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So who is the person who was asked by Mika to keep the arms, the weapons? 
THE WITNESS:
It is Ruhindura.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Where was Ruhindura to keep the weapons? 
THE WITNESS:
The weapons were stored in Casimir's home. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on, Counsel.  Go on. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

Can the witness indicate the duties or the function of the person that she has just mentioned, the person in whose house the weapons were stored?  What was this person's official function? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, you can ask the question from the witness.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us what official function was occupied by the person whom you mentioned a while ago? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, what was the question, please?  Could you repeat the question?
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you indicate to us the official function of Mr. Casimir at the time when the weapons were stored in his home?
A.	He was (By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This information would disclose the identity of this witness.  So this will be expunged from the record and is under seal. 

Yes, Mr. Kabimba, please go ahead.

BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that many Interahamwe had surrounded your secteur; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	How did you recognise the Interahamwe?
A.	I have eyes to see.
Q.	Was he dressed in a way that would have caused him to be recognised as such?
A.	They were naked.  They were wearing banana leaves.  They had clothes that caused them to be identified with devils.
Q.	That's a very important clarification, Madam Witness, and I thank you for it.  

You state that Mika was wearing a rifle slung across his shoulder and that he was accompanied by many Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	Did I say that? 
Q.	When we look at the transcript, because there is only one transcript, you state this clearly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, you are looking at which transcript? 
MR. KABIMBA:
There is only one transcript that she signed with the Prosecution witness.  There is no other, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You've referring to the statement, the statement of the 29th of November 1999? 
MR. KABIMBA:
Yes, Madam President.
JUDGE SHORT:
It is not a transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It is not a transcript.  It is a written statement of the witness. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Don't confuse us.  
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Your Honours, but we would like to know whether she will not change her version tomorrow.  That is why we are doing this examination and cross-examination.  We would like to determine what the Court thinks. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, you didn't get our position.  In this Court -- in this Chamber, we use the word "transcript" to refer to the record of evidence before the Court, previous, before the Court.  Statements recorded by witnesses outside the Court, before the -- with the investigators are not referred to as transcripts.  They are referred to as witness statements.  So that is why we were cautioning you that the word "transcript" is not correct. 
MR. KABIMBA:
I thank you, Your Honour, for this opinion.  I shall take it into account in future.  I was referring to her statement before the Prosecution investigators. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kabimba.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you indicate to us how Mika arrived to the place where you were gathered with your husbands on that day? 
A.	What day are you referring to?  Are you referring to the Saturday? 
Q.	That is correct, Madam Witness. 
A.	He surrounded the hill on which we were.  After he surrounded it with his assailants, they surprised us, and we said to ourselves, if we were not with their ethnic -- fellow ethnic members, they would have finished us off.  So they encircled or surrounded the hill, and they surprised us.  That is how they surrounded the hill.  They did not come from before, in front.  They came from behind.  And that is how they surrounded us.
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that Mika asked you to go home because -- and you say that this is a trick because it would have enabled them to kill you more easily; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us why you feel that this was trickery? 
A.	On the next day, he came back with his Interahamwe.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you indicate to us what quantity of weapons, in particular machetes and spears, were taken from the refugees? 
A.	Ask Mika Muhimana.  Don't ask me.  Because it is he who remained with these weapons.  He should have counted them.  So it is not to me that you must put the question. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, please answer the question asked. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And if you don't know, just say so, you don't know. 
THE WITNESS:
Listen, there were many people.  I cannot tell you how many weapons were there.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, could you at least tell us how these weapons were carried or transported? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Transported by whom? 

THE WITNESS:
They were transported in the arm -- in their arms, and they kept them in this house.  So they used their arms to transport them.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you stated that on the night of Saturday, on Saturday night, you went to seek refuge in Bisesero secteur; is that correct?
A.	(No interpretation).
Q.	Madam Witness, could you tell us the first hill that you reached in Bisesero? 
A.	I can tell you. 
Q.	Please go ahead. 
A.	We first arrived, we reached the Kigarama hill in the Bisesero region.  We were moving from Kigarama to the Bisesero region. 
Q.	Madam Witness, did you leave alone or did you leave with your husband and your children? 
A.	I left with my husband and my children.
Q.	Can you tell us at what time you arrived at Bisesero? 
A.	We were like mad people, traumatised people.  Don't ask me about the time.  I cannot tell you.
Q.	Madam Witness, did you arrive Bisesero the same Saturday at night or Sunday morning? 
A.	We arrived Bisesero on Saturday, as I stated.
Q.	Let us now talk about the Sunday attack in Bisesero.  How many assailants did you see in Bisesero at the time of the attack? 
A.	The attack was launched by Mika. 
Q.	Was he alone or was he accompanied by Interahamwe?
A.	He was accompanied by Interahamwe.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us whether you recognised anybody else apart from Mika during this Sunday attack? 
A.	He was with Interahamwe that he had brought from Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  I cannot tell you who they were.
Q.	How was Mika dressed on that Sunday? 
A.	But you are submitting me to a test.  Can I indicate or tell you the colour of the clothes a person was wearing in 1994?  Can you yourselves do that?  In any case, I do not know.  I cannot tell you what he was wearing.  In any case, he wasn't naked.  He was dressed.  But I cannot tell you what clothes he was wearing.  In a situation like that, where you are being chased, you cannot note the clothes that your -- the person who is pursuing you is wearing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, please answer the question to the best of your knowledge.  And answer the question very briefly.  This would help you and help the Court, too. 

Mr. Kabimba --
THE WITNESS:
I know that he was also carrying his gun, but I did not pay attention to the clothes he was wearing.  When we were facing him, he was wearing his gun.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Can you tell us if you recognise, amongst the assailants, other people who were carrying guns? 
A.	He was accompanied by this communal policeman who was called Ruhindura, as well as Rwigimba.  There were -- well, the commune had many guns, and the guns were given to the Interahamwe, who were behaving rather badly.
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  How did you know that Mika was the person who was leading the assailants on that Sunday? 
A.	Well, I cannot lie about him.  He cut me with a machete.
Q.	Madam Witness, I am really very sorry about the affliction that you suffered, but please tell me what are the acts that made you determine that Mika was the one leading the attackers. 
A.	He threw a grenade, and I think I told you this.  He threw a grenade.  And the Tutsis were facing these attackers who were equipped with guns, and the Tutsis retreated while we were carrying stones.  The refugees fell on the grenade that was put on the road by Mika.  Some were killed by the grenade.  And those who were not killed were finished off with machetes.  And it is then that he cut my hand with the machete.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you confirm that in -- out of those thousands of attackers, you yourself saw Mika personally put down or lay down the grenade? 
A.	Yes.  I am confirming it.
Q.	You stated that the assailants retreated when your husbands were chasing them.  Were you with your husbands when they were chasing those assailants or did you remain where you were at the onset with your children? 
A.	We were providing them with stones. 
Q.	Did Mika also retreat with the others? 
A.	Everybody retreated over a short distance.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us what was your position when the grenade exploded? 
A.	We were behind the men, and we saw smoke, and there are some people who lay on the ground, and we ran down the road.  The assailants came and they finished off many of us, and I must say that there were very many corpses on that spot.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us at about what time the attack began? 
A.	At 2 p.m., at 2 p.m.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us at what time Mika cut off your hand? 
A.	It was at about the time that I've just mentioned to you.
Q.	Can you tell us -- do you want to tell us that immediately the attack began at 2 p.m., Mika immediately cut off your hand? 
A.	The attack did not begin at 2 p.m.  The assailants had spent the day at that spot and they were facing us, but the grenade was put on the ground at 2 p.m.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you want to correct the time you just gave, that the attack did not begin when the grenade was put on the ground at 2 p.m.?
A.	No.  I cannot -- I can simply say that the attack began in the morning, but the situation worsened at about 2 p.m.  So throughout the day, the attack was being launched.
Q.	Would you remember the time at which Mika cut off your hand? 
A.	It was at sundown.  Please, don't ask me what time it was.  I didn't go to school.  I simply know that the sun was setting.  I lay on the ground at that spot.  A gentleman came and saw me and told me, "I am going to hide again, and I will come back to see if you've stopped breathing."  That is what he told me.
Q.	When you talk about sunset, was it in the evening or in the night, to help you answer the question?
A.	It was still daytime.  I am sorry, Counsel, but I realise that I am becoming tense, but retain that what I'm telling you is the truth.
Q.	Madam Witness, I will pray God that you shouldn't get tense and that you should help us know the truth.  Can you tell us, sunset for you begins at what time?  Was it already dark?  Was it still -- was there still daylight? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, she has answered the question.
THE WITNESS:
It was still daylight.  It wasn't at night.  It was in the day but it was almost sunset.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Hold on, Madam Witness. 
MS. MADENGA:
If I can just seek your indulgence, Your Honour, the witness indicated, "I'm becoming tense," and my learned colleague is saying that "you should not become tense."  I think if the witness is, like, depressed and upset because of the trauma, I would actually request the Court to ascertain how she's feeling because it's like she did not apply for the trauma to visit upon her.  I think she is actually pleading that "I'm becoming tense" and my understanding is that she might need a rest of some sort.  

Thank you very much, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Counsel, please make sure that you don't repeat your questions. 

Madam Witness, can you continue with your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
You may proceed, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness. 

Yes, Mr. Kabimba, please proceed. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you very much, Madam President.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you state --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, maintain a pause between the answer and the question. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you very much, Madam President.  I will try to follow your advice.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you say that when Mika took a machete from Interahamwe, he cut off your hand; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You also relate that you fell on the ground and that you were pushed to the ground by a young man and that you were wrapped up in a loin cloth; is that correct?
A.	No.  That is not correct.  We fled, and somebody pushed me and he fell on me, and I hid in the bush, and it's at that point that the assailants came on to us.  I can't exactly say that I covered myself with a loin cloth.  I hid behind a bush and an assailant hit a child with a cutlass, with a machete, and I saw blood ooze.  I hid myself.  And at that point, somebody came.  So I didn't cover myself with a loin cloth.  You shouldn't try to distort my statement.  And I think that is how my statement has been written down. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like to read your statement, the statement you made to the Tribunal's investigators.  That is on the first page, last paragraph thereof, and you say the following, "This is how it happened.  When I saw Mika take the machete, I covered myself with my wrapper.  A boy who was fleeing with us ran into me and I fell down, still covered in my wrapper.  Mika then came and started cutting me up."  Do you confirm that statement? 
A.	Did I tell you that I covered myself up with a wrapper or loincloth?  When I saw blood oozing from the body of that young boy who had just been cut up, I covered my face with my wrapper but I did not wrap myself up in the wrapper.  Did I say that? 
Q.	Madam Witness, I am merely reading your statement.  I did not invent it.  Can you tell us, according to you, you covered yourself with a wrapper when you saw blood ooze out of the boy's body?
A.	Yes.  It is at that point that I covered my face with my wrapper, when I saw blood oozing.
Q.	When the wrapper is covering your face, can you see what's happening, Madam Witness? 
A.	He had just cut into pieces my children with a machete, and when I saw blood, I covered my head with my wrapper.  That was to avoid blood splashing on me.  For me, the situation was desperate.  They had just cut my first child into pieces and I couldn't see how he was going to cut my second child.  You think the wrapper could stop me from seeing what was happening? 
Q.	Madam Witness --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, may we remind you, please maintain a pause between the answer and the question because the English interpreters are unable to follow you.  We are not getting the correct interpretation.  Please make a pause.
MR. KABIMBA:
Once again, Madam, thank you.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us that if your face is covered with the wrapper, you could see what was happening thereafter? 
A.	Please listen, Counsel.  I didn't completely cover myself up.  I covered my head in order not to see how he was going to cut up my other child.  In any case, when I came to, my loincloth or my wrapper wasn't there, and my wrapper had already been taken away when I -- when I regained consciousness I didn't have that wrapper with me any more.  In any case, you shouldn't dwell on the wrapper.  I don't know if you understand very well. 
Q.	Madam Witness --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has demonstrated by a piece of wrapper she had covered the head and not the face. 

Yes, please move on. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	In order not to see the blood of the child that was dripping, can you tell us if you covered your eyes in order not to see that blood ooze out of the kid or did you cover your face in order not to see it? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that a fair question, Counsel? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that a fair question? 

MR. KABIMBA:
Your Honours, the witness has said that she used the wrapper in order not to see her son's blood that was splashing.  I would like to know exactly where she put the wrapper in order not to see because I know that it is with the eyes that she has to see and not the face. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yeah, but the question you asked was:  "Was the reason because you wanted not to see your child being cut or because you wanted to -- not to see what was happening?"  I'm asking you, really, whether, in a real situation, a person is capable of determining what the reason is for wanting to do those reflexive actions that one does?     
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you very much for your question, Your Honour.  We are trying to look for the truth.  We are all called upon to find out if she actually saw what happened, and I think that is the reason for that question, unless you decide otherwise.  Otherwise, I may carry on. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm not stopping you from asking any question that you think is relevant.  Please don't put us on record as stopping you from asking a question which you think is very material.  You ask the question.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, have you never made a complaint in Rwanda against people that you are accusing of having cut off your hand? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	How many children did you have before the killings? 
A.	I had three children.
Q.	And how many children have you had since those killings? 
A.	None.
Q.	Madam Witness, under your particulars, it is indicated that you have two children.  Is that correct?
A.	Are you talking about the children who survived the war?  Do you want to say that I had children who survived the war? 
Q.	Madam Witness, probably the Prosecutor may help you.  The identification sheet of the witness, which was disclosed to us by the Prosecution, shows that she has two children.  Probably it is a typographical error on the part of the Prosecution, but you signed with your own fingerprint. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you have any children at the moment? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I have three children and I had them after the war.  No child that I had before the war survived. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness. 

Mr. Kabimba, please move on.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, you relate that you used to see Mika when you were attending meetings where all secteur conseillers were present; is that correct? 
A.	I know him.  Do you think I do not know him?  Our secteurs border on each other.  And I know Mika very well. 
Q.	Can you tell us what kinds of meetings you used to attend?
A.	Well, you want to ask the subject of our meetings? 
Q.	Madam Witness, what types of witnesses -- what types of witnesses (sic) were they? 
A.	They were communal meetings.  You yourself know about them.  Such meetings exist.  These are meetings in which members of the population are convened.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you say "witnesses" or "meetings"? 
MR. KABIMBA:
Meeting. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He meant "meetings," but he said "witnesses." 
MR. KABIMBA:
I was referring to the venue of the meetings. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I heard "witnesses." 
MR. KABIMBA:
Your Honours, the witness states in her statement that she knows Mika because she used to attend meetings where all conseillers were represented, including Mika, and I'm trying to ask her if she can confirm the holding of such meetings.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
She has confirmed.  She has told you they were communal meetings.  It's only that in your question you had used the word "witnesses" twice. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  That is one of the questions.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Where did you used to hold those meetings? 
A.	Those meetings used to be held at a place called Kibande, above or below the communal office.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Can you tell us how many meetings you attended? 
A.	But what kind of question are you asking me?  Since 1994, I was an adult.  It's as if you are asking me how many times I had taken part in communal labour work.  Can you actually give an answer to such a question?  All I know is that we used to obey to the orders issued by the state, and you're asking me how many times I took part in those meetings.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, if you know the answer, please answer it.  If you don't know it, say you don't know it. 

And Mr. Kabimba, how long would you take to conclude your cross-examination? 
MR. KABIMBA:
Madam President, I am trying to be of the school of those who try to keep to time so I will try to follow the president's instructions.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, let's go back to the death of your children.  I know these are very difficult moments and complicated moments as well. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Counsel, you have not answered the President's question.  What is your estimate of the time left for your cross-examination?  It enables us to know how to schedule our time. 
MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I will finish in five or ten minutes. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Five. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Please go ahead.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, let's go back to the death of your children.  Can you confirm to us that you saw with your own eyes Mika killing all the three children? 
A.	I saw him with my own eyes.
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us if, before cutting off your hand, Mika had already killed your children? 
A.	He first of all killed the children.
Q.	Can you tell us if, when you regained consciousness, that is when you saw the bodies of your children?  Or did you see them before?
A.	I had seen them before losing consciousness, and it was at that point that I had covered one of the children with my wrapper, and this child was bleeding on the head.  He even removed that wrapper.
Q.	Madam Witness, how old are your three children -- the three children you have now? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kabimba, she has given the ages.  The present one? 
MR. KABIMBA:
Oui, oui.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Madam Witness, please answer. 
THE WITNESS:
One of my children is aged six.  He reached the age of six this month of April.  The next one will have -- the other one will be five years old in the month of July.  And the other one will be two years old before the 11th.  No, in fact, what I meant was he will be 11 -- or two years old in the month of November.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you confirm the relationship that you indicated between yourself and the person whose name I have just written on this piece of paper? 
MR. KABIMBA:
Perhaps the registry could help me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, can we see that? 

Can we ask the interpreter from the Kinyarwanda booth to please come and assist the witness? 

Mr. Issa, please switch off the mike.  Did you show this piece of paper to the Prosecutor? 

Mr. Interpreter please ask the relationship of this person with the witness, from the witness, and write it down on the same piece of paper. 

Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.  Please take your seat.
BY MR. KABIMBA:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you confirm that this person died as a result of the grenade explosion?
A.	Of course.  If you were to conduct an investigation in our area, you would realise that this person was a victim of the explosion of this grenade. 
Q.	Did this person die before your children or after?
A.	He died -- or the person died before my children were killed.  When the grenade exploded, he died immediately.  We were quite close to that place.  This person was the first to be hit by the explosion from the grenade.
Q.	Would you have an idea as to when this happened? 
A.	I told you that I do not know the time.  It was during the daytime.  I do not even know how to use a watch.  I've never undergone any studies.
Q.	But you do know the time at which the attack was launched. 
A.	Attacks came in the morning, at sunrise, and we had to face them all day.  Vehicles brought assailants very early in the morning, and left them there.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness, for your patience. 

MR. KABIMBA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I have concluded my cross-examination. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kabimba. 

Madam Prosecutor, do you have any re-examination? 
MS. MADENGA:
No, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for assisting the Court with your testimony.  We wish you a very safe trip home. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Court is adjourned until tomorrow afternoon.  We resume at 2 p.m.  Thank you. 
(Court adjourned at 1910H)
