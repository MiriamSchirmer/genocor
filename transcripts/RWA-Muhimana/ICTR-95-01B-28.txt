WITNESS TQ28
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Yesterday, when we left, you were telling us about your stay in the CCDFP.  Could you tell us how much time or for how long you stayed at CCDFP?   
A.	We stayed there for about two weeks, because from about the 16th to the end of the month of April we were there, and that is about two weeks.
Q.	Did you learn that the Mugonero hospital complex was attacked? 
A.	Yes I heard of this.
Q.	Did you receive any information regarding the identity of the assailants?
A.	I cannot say that I knew their names, but I heard it said that assailants had come from various places, fairly distant places.
Q.	Was Mika's name mentioned to you?
A.	No, I did not hear Mika's name amongst the assailants that were mentioned to me.
Q.	In the Mugonero complex was there a school of medicine?
A.	There was a nursing school, instead.
Q.	In this nursing school, were there operating theatres?
A.	No, there were no operating theatres.
Q.	In Mugonero, did you know a person called Josiane?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us about this person, for example, what this person was doing in April 1994?
A.	I remember that she was a teacher.
Q.	Do you know anything about what she was doing in April 1994?
A.	I cannot tell you that I knew anything about her or to tell you that she had such-and-such a problem.  I really know nothing about it.
Q.	If somebody were to tell you that on the 16th of April she was raped by Mika Muhimana, how would you react?
A.	I would tell the person who said that that it is not true.
Q.	And why would you say that?
A.	Before I sought refuge in Gishyita I was in Ngoma.  At the complex, I had sought refuge there, and I confirm that during all the time that I spent there I was one of the people who were conducting patrols, so I knew all events that took place at this place.  It is on that basis, that I would say that such a person who made such a statement would not be speaking the truth.
Q.	Did you know the family of a certain Gafurafura?
A.	I know the family of Gafurafura.
Q.	When you state that you know the family, do you know Mr. Gafurafura himself?
A.	I also knew him.
Q.	Can you tell us who he was?
A.	He was a pastor.
Q.	And what was he doing in April 1994?
A.	He was dead.
Q.	Did you also know his wife?
A.	I do not know his wife.
Q.	Did you know his children?
A.	Yes, I knew his children.
Q.	Where did he live?
A.	Generally, they lived in Gishyita.  That is where Gafurafura's family was established.  However, some children had left for other regions, that is, the adult ones.
Q.	Do you remember all his children?
A.	I think I remember who they were.
Q.	Can you try to tell us?
A.	I am going to do it.  There is, first, Jérôme Habimana, there is Mathias, there is Pierre.  There is also another one who used to work in Kibuye who was called -- well, let me go on, because I can't recall his name.  Amongst the girls, there was Marthe Nyirahabimana, there was also Marie and Madeleine Murakatete.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You have named Marie.  In  April 1994, where was she? 
A.	I remember that she was in Kigali.  I think she was in Kigali with Mathias.  She had been living with Mathias for a long time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are not sure that she was in Kigali?
THE WITNESS:
I know because before 1994 she often stayed in Kigali.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you said you think she stayed in Kigali.
THE WITNESS:
I said it because at some time -- or sometimes she came to Kibuye where her other brother was living.  But what I meant was that she was not residing in Mugonero, she was either in Kibuye or at her other brother's house in Kigali.  This is what I know, and I can confirm it. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	You also mentioned Marthe Nyirahabimana.  Do you confirm this name?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us where she was in April 1994?
A.	I know for sure that in 1994 she was not in Ngoma.  I said that in 1994, Marthe was not in Ngoma, however, her children and her house help were there.
Q.	How many children did she have?
A.	She had two children.
Q.	Did she have a husband?
A.	She was separated from her husband.
Q.	Let us return to Maria (sic) now.  Was she married?
A.	To the best of my knowledge, she was not married.
Q.	Do you confirm that you did not see her either on the 16th of April or the day before that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is a leading question, Professor.

THE WITNESS:
I confirm it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This was a leading question, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  I shall try to rephrase the question. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It has been answered now.  Water has gone under the bridge, but try not to ask leading questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you said that Nyirahabimana was not in Ngoma in 1994.  Could you tell us, where was she? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that she used to live with her brothers, and her brothers did not live in Ngoma.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry, Witness.  Did you actually know where she was? 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that she had two brothers one in Kibuye and the other in Kigali.  I cannot tell you that on the such-and-such a date she was in Kigali or Kibuye; I was not watching her.  She may have been in Kigali or Kibuye in one of her brothers' houses, but, for sure, on and before the 16th she was not in Mugonero and Ngoma.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was she prevented from being in Ngoma or Mugonero?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How can you say --
THE WITNESS:
No, I cannot answer that question.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why can you not answer the question? 
THE WITNESS:
I was not in charge of watching the private life of everyone.  I think everybody would tell you the same thing.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Therefore, you wouldn't necessarily know whether she was in Ngoma or wasn't, unless she was reporting to you.

THE WITNESS:
In any case, I was not blind.  Also, I could move about in Ngoma.  A person ********************, and whom I knew, who was the same age as I was, if such a person were in Ngoma, I could not -- I would surely have known where she was.  Since she was the same age as I was, I would have known if she was at this place.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So you knew the whereabouts of every person of your age in Ngoma?
THE WITNESS:
For certain of them, yes.  I told you that her father was a pastor, but since I knew this person, we went to the same primary school, so I knew this person, there was no problem between us.  I cannot say that she was not there, whilst she was there.  I have come here to tell you the truth.  My truth is that she was not there, and I know this for sure.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But a better truth is that you didn't know where she was; is that not so? 
THE WITNESS:
You say that I did not know where she was.  Perhaps you wish me tell you whether she was with my (sic) parents or with her other brother.  I know that she was not in Ngoma or in Mugonero.  If she was with her brother in Kigali or in Kibuye, I don't think it is necessary for me -- I am just confirming that she was not in Ngoma.
JUDGE SHORT:
How can you be certain that she was not in Ngoma?
THE WITNESS:
I confirm, without making a mistake, that she was not in Ngoma, because I lived there, and this is a place that I knew very well and I could visit everybody without any problems.
JUDGE SHORT:
So are you saying that it is not possible for her to be in Ngoma without your knowledge? 
THE WITNESS:
If she had been there, I would have known.
JUDGE SHORT:
Why? 
THE WITNESS:
Ngoma was not a very big location for people that one knew.  If she had come to Ngoma, I would have known.  For example, when I was in Ngoma, people knew it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed, Professor. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President,.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in Ngoma, did you know a person called Kajongi?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who is or who was he? 
A.	I remember that he used to work for the school.
Q.	What school would this be?
A.	The school that was called École des sciences infirmières, that is, the nursing school.
Q.	Do you remember his first name?
A.	He was called Isacaar Kajongi.
Q.	Did you know his family?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Where did they live?
A.	The family lived in Kanyinya in the buildings belonging to the hospital.
Q.	Was it within the hospital complex?
A.	I would say that it was the hospital buildings.
Q.	Did you know the members of his family?
A.	I think I know his children.
Q.	Could you try to tell us about them?
A.	I am going to try.  There was a certain Paul Védeste, Josephine, and Joy Mukasine.
Q.	Thank you.  In April 1994 --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in April 1994, was this family still in the Mugonero complex and, precisely, in Kanyinya?
A.	Yes, that is where this family still lived.
Q.	Were all the children that you have named there in April 1994?
A.	No, not all of the children were there in April 1994.
Q.	Can you tell us who was not there?
A.	Yes, I can.  Paul was not there, Vedeste was not there, and Joy Mukasine was not there.
Q.	Thank you.  And where was Joy Mukasine?
A.	Joy Mukasine was studying at Butare university.   During the holidays, I did not see her in Ngoma.  By the way, we were neighbours.  Between their house and ours *******************.
Q.	Do you remember what Joy Mukasine was studying in Butare?  What was her area of studies?
A.	If my memory serves me right, she was in the area of public health.
Q.	And if one were to tell you that Joy Mukasine was raped on the 16th of April 1994, what would your reaction be?
A.	I would consider that as a lie.
Q.	Why?
A.	I would consider that as a lie because that girl was not there during that period.
Q.	Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, do you know a person by the name of Ukobizaba who was resident in Ngoma?  Ukobizaba.
A.	I know that person.
Q.	Do you know that person's family?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Who was Ukobizaba?  
A.	Ukobizaba was an accountant at the hospital.
Q.	Was he married?
A.	Yes, he had a wife.
Q.	Did he have children?
A.	Yes, they had children.
Q.	Are you in a position to talk to us about their children?
A.	Yes, I can try.  One of the children was called Musonera.  Another was Uziya.  One was called Charlotte; another Joseph; yet another Rutaganda; another was named Verene, and another one was named Espérance.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  If someone told you that Ukobizaba had a daughter by the name of Mukasine, how would you react to that?
A.	My reaction to that would be that he or she did not know the family members of Ukobizaba.
Q.	Did Ukobizaba have a daughter studying in the nursing school?
A.	Yes; a girl by the name of Verene attended that school.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
Did you know a person by the name Byumbe?
A.	I know no one by the name of Byumbe; however, I know a person by the name of Byumve.
Q.	What was that person's other name, if you can remember?
A.	His name was Samuel Byumve.
Q.	Who was he?
A.	He was a teacher at l'ESAPAN.
Q.	Was he married?
A.	Yes, he was married; he had one wife.
Q.	Did they have children?
A.	To my knowledge, they had one child.
Q.	Do you remember that child's name?
A.	No, it was a young child, I cannot remember his or her name.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know a person by the name of Amos Karera?
A.	Yes, I know Amos Karera.  He was also an employee at the hospital.
Q.	Do you know his children?
A.	Yes, I knew his children.
Q.	Can you tell us who they were?
A.	I will try.  One of them was known as Johaneta; another was Eugenie; then there was Jean-Bosco; then Jean-Louis, Albert, and Chantal.
Q.	Can you tell us a bit more about Johaneta?  For instance, by telling us another name she may have had?
A.	Johaneta's other name was Josiane.  She acquired that had first name of Josiane because she changed schools, abandoning the name Johaneta and assuming the new first name of Josiane to enable her to change schools.
Q.	So, if we have understood you correctly, in Amos Karera's family, Johaneta and Josiane were one and the same person?
A.	You are right.  Josiane was called Johaneta.
Q.	Did you know a person whose first name was Eugenie?
A.	Yes, I know Eugenie.  She was ********.
Q.	Did you also know her father? 
A.	Her father was Amos Karera.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know a person by the name of Mukankwaro?  
A.	No, I do not know that person.
Q.	Did you know person by the name of Mukangwira?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you know person by the name of Mukabarore?
A.	I do not know any person by that name.
Q.	And if someone were to tell you that that person was raped on the 16th of April in Mugonero, what would your reaction to that be?
JUDGE SHORT:
He has already answered no to your questions, so which person are you referring to?
MR. SONGA: 
Your Honours, I agree with you that you are right in interrupting me since the witness's answer to my question was that she (sic) did not know any of those persons.  So I thank you for your interruption.  

May I proceed?  

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, did you bear the same names as your father?
A.	No, I had my own names and my father had his.
Q.	I thank you, Witness. 
MR. SONGA: 
Madam President, I had requested 40 minutes.  You would note that I have not used all those minutes.  I have ended my examination-in-chief.  I thank you.  

Witness, I also thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  

Yes, Mr. Kapaya, you will proceed with your cross-examination?
MR. KAPAYA: 
Good morning, Your Honours.  

Good morning, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, yesterday you took an oath to speak the truth, did you not? 
A.	And I am also speaking the truth today.
(By order of the Court, at this point in the proceedings, a portion of the proceedings [pages 10 to 14] was extracted and placed into a closed session transcript)
	(Page 1 to 9 by Judith Baverstock)












MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, you testified that you learned about the death of the president on the radio.  Did you say that? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Was it Radio Rwanda that said the president had been dead -- has been killed?
A.	I learned of it on Radio Rwanda.
Q.	Did the radio say who was responsible for shooting down the plane?
A.	It wasn't specified, the person who shot down the plane.
Q.	Did the radio say that people should stay at home?
A.	Yes, it was said that people should stay at home in order to know what would follow subsequently.
Q.	Now, you testified that you and your family took refuge at the Mugonero complex.  Did you say that?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, when you talk of your family, who are you including in that term, in that category?
A.	When I talk about my family, I am referring to the members of my family with whom I went to the complex, and I will mention, in particular, my father and my mother.
Q.	I will show you a document that contains names, and tell me whether those names ring a bell to you.  Now, Witness, do the names that appear on that document, do they mean anything to you?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Why don't you ask him whether he knows the people they represent, rather than whether they mean anything to him?
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, do you know these people, these five people who are listed there?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Or better still, why don't you ask him, "Do you know number 2?  Do you know number 3?" so that we know exactly who it is he knows and doesn't?  It is possible that he knows some and not all. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
According to my information, he knows all those people and I know, generally, what he will say. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Do you know these people?
A.	I know the people whose names are on this sheet of paper.
Q.	Are these your brothers and sisters?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, did you seek refuge with these five people along with your father and mother at the Mugonero complex on the 8th?
A.	No, I didn't go with every one of them.
Q.	Could you tell Your Honours which ones of these you went with to the complex and where the rest were?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Using numbers. 
MR. KAPAYA: 
Yes, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
The second person on the list was with me; the fifth person as well. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Can you tell us where one, three and four were?
A.	The first person was in Butare, and the third and fourth had gone to the Gisovu region, and they weren't present with us.
Q.	When did three -- one go to where he was, and when did three and four go to where they were?
A.	I don't talk about number two because he was with me.
Q.	Witness, I asked you when did number one go to where he was and where did three and four go to Gisovu?
A.	Number 1 was in Butare.  In other words, we came home for the Easter holidays; he had remained in Butare.  Numbers 3 and 4 had gone before we fled to the Mugonero complex.
Q.	In other words, you are not in a position to give the dates these people went to Butare and Gisovu.  Are you in a position to give that date? 
A.	I don't recall that date.
Q.	Now, why did you  decide to seek refuge in the hospital?
A.	I decided to take refuge at the hospital because it appeared to me that there was more security there than at home.
Q.	When you talk of security or insecurity, what does it encompass?  What threatened you while you were at home?
A.	After the death of Habyarimana, we didn't quite know the truth surrounding his death.  We were being told that there were bandits that were all over the place, and when we went to the hospital, the idea was to protect our goods.  We were fearing that our goods and property may be stolen and so we went there with the same. 
Q.	Do you know people who were referred to as Interahamwe?
A.	I heard about that name.
Q.	Did the Interahamwe in any way contribute to your insecurity in your area?
A.	To start with, I must say that there weren't any Interahamwe in our region.  We were moving about in groups and there weren't Interahamwe in our region.
Q.	Maybe I should ask you this:  Who do you consider to be an Interahamwe?
A.	To me, the Interahamwe were the youth of this or that party, and that is how I think I can explain what the Interahamwe meant.
Q.	So you are telling this Court that in that period in your area there were no youths of this or that party.  That is your testimony. 
A.	That is not what I meant.  Amongst the youth -- the youths, members of parties, there were some that didn't have Interahamwe youths.
Q.	Which party had the Interahamwe youths -- which political party?
A.	It is the party that was called the MRND that had the Interahamwe.
Q.	So it's your testimony that the MRND youth wing did not exist in your area?
A.	The truth be told, there weren't Interahamwe there.  The MRND wasn't well understood in our region.
Q.	For how long did you stay at the hospital?
A.	Can you repeat your question, Mr. Prosecutor? 
Q.	You testified that you, number 3, number 4, and your parents -- number 3 and 4 on the list I showed you -- took refuge at the Mugonero complex on the 8th of April.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He believes it is number 2 and 5. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Sorry.  Number two and five. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, for how long did you stay there from the 8th, the day you went there?
A.	We left the hospital in the morning of the 16th.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you not testify in the Ntakirutimana case that you stayed at the hospital between 8 and 12, and then you moved to Kabahinyuza market?  Didn't you say that? 
A.	Thank you for the suggestion.  You just asked me how many days we spent at the hospital, and I answered that the family, from the 8th up until the 16th, we were in the hospital.  What I meant is that it is after that period that we left the region surrounding the hospital.  In so far as the dates on which we left the complex are concerned, we did not leave the complex at the same time.  I think I mentioned this in my testimony.  We left the complex at different times, and people also went there, you know, on different dates. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my question is this -- let me put it this way:  Didn't you stay at Mugonero hospital between -- from the 8th to the 12th April 1994?
A.	You mentioned the date and what other date? 
Q.	11th or 12th.  That you left the hospital complex between either the 11th or the 12th; is that not the position? 
A.	Up until that date, I was still in the hospital.
Q.	Did you then leave for Kabahinyuza market on the 12th -- the 11th, and stayed there, you and your family, in someone's house in the market area outside the Mugonero complex? 
A.	Yes, I am aware that on the 11th, on that day we left the hospital.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 Mr. Witness, can you give us the estimated distance between the hospital and the market?
THE WITNESS:
The distance is short.  It is not up to a kilometre or even 500 metres.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The market is located in the same area --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, your microphone, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The market is in the same area? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the market is in the same area. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	When you say it is the same area, do you mean that the Kabahinyuza market is within the Mugonero complex?  Is that your testimony, or it is outside the Mugonero complex?
A.	The market is outside the complex, but they are close to one another.
Q.	So, when you said a short while ago that you were at the hospital between the 8th and the 16th, you were not speaking the truth were you? 
A.	That was due to the manner in which you asked your question.  I asked you to repeat it and I explained that it is on the 16th that we left that area to go to Gishyita.  I did not say that I left the complex on the 16th to go to Kabahinyuza. 
Q.	So your testimony is that between the 11th and the 16th of April you were not in the Mugonero complex but you were in Kabahinyuza market in somebody's house?
A.	It wasn't the 11th, it was on the 12th, in the evening of that day.  But you shouldn't confuse between the hospital and Kabahinyuza.  There is -- the distance between the two is not far, because you could very easily call out to someone in the hospital from Kabahinyuza; the distance was very short. 
Q.	So maybe you want us to rewind your testimony.  So you are saying that between the 8th and the 16th you were in the Mugonero complex; is that what you are telling us?
A.	Can you repeat your question, Mr. Prosecutor? 
Q.	I put it to you that you were in the Mugonero complex between the 8th and the 11th or the 12th; thereafter, you left the complex and went to Kabahinyuza market and stayed in somebody's house.  Now, my question was:  Between the 12th and the 16th, you were not in Mugonero complex, were you?
A.	Between the 12th and the 16th, I was at Kabahinyuza.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, is it possible that the activities in the hospital could be seen from the market or from the house where you were? 
THE WITNESS:
It was possible because where we were staying at Kabahinyuza, from there, you see in front of you the hospital.  You, therefore, could see the goings on in the hospital. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, do you remember your evidence of yesterday? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you remember having agreed to tell the truth yesterday?
THE WITNESS:
Am I lying?  I said I was going to tell the truth.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, this is not a laughing matter, okay.  I want you to take this matter seriously.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do remember saying that you left the hospital at 7 a.m. and arrived in Gishyita at 8 a.m.  Do you remember that was asked of you twice in your testimony yesterday?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I made the statement.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You made that statement that you left the hospital complex at 7 a.m.  and arrived in Gishyita at 8 a.m.  You made that statement yesterday, on the 16th.
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And now you have now amended that and said you left the hospital on the 11th -- is it the 11th? -- on the 12th, and went to some other place, from whence you then went to Gishyita on the 16th.  Now, which of the two versions do you want the Court to accept? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  The person who asked me questions previously, asked me questions to which I gave answers.  In the region where we used to live, we were used to the name "hospital."  Now, when you asked me when I went to Gishyita, and I said that I went to Gishyita from the hospital -- on the 16th from the hospital, it is not that I wanted to lie.  This does not mean that I left the complex itself.  What I meant is that the area surrounding the hospital -- because the whole of that area was referred to as the hospital -- and I left that area to go to Gishyita.  

I did not mean that the vehicle took me at (sic) the hospital, because no hospital came to -- no vehicle came to the hospital to take us.  Because definitely, if questions are poorly asked, sometimes you have poor answers thereto.  So, if you ask me from where did you go, I will answer you.  If you ask me when did you go to Gishyita, I will also give you an answer.  Now, if you ask me from what point did the vehicle depart, I will also provide you with an answer to the question.

	1030H
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you remember also telling us you left your home 100 to 200 yards to go to the hospital, to the hospital complex? 
THE WITNESS:
I do remember.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Was your home also part of the hospital? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, we were living in a building that belonged to the hospital.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So when you say that you left for Gishyita, you said that you left the hospital because that other place is also a hospital?
THE WITNESS:
I don't mean that it was part of the hospital.  It was simply close to the hospital in the market square where we lived after leaving the complex.  These locations were close to each other.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the estimated distance given by you between the hospital and the market is 500 metres; is that correct?
THE WITNESS: 
I said that the distance was not greater than one kilometre, and after I said that it was about 500 metres, almost 500 metres.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you think the activities could be seen from a distance of 500 metres or about one kilometre? 
THE WITNESS:
I don't know what activities are being referred to, but if I say that I could see what was going on, it means that this distance of 500 metres was not actually up to 500 metres, because from that hillside you could hail someone who was at the hospital.  It could have been less than 500 metres. 

In any case, there is no doubt you could hail across to someone who was at the hospital if you yourself were in Kabahinyuza.  Thank you, Your Honours.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that while you were at Kabahinyuza market going to Bamporiki's house, you could see what was taking place at the Mugonero complex between the 12th and 16th?
A.	I mean that when I was in Kabahinyuza, there is a place where one could stand on a slope towards the hospital and, from there, one could see the hospital.  And there was a nutrition centre quite close to this place at a distance of a few metres.  When one was at that precise location, one could see what was going on at the hospital.  It was not hard to see what was happening within the buildings of the hospital.
Q.	So that if someone, say the Accused person, is raping somebody in the hospital, you could see that from the Kabahinyuza market?
A.	That would depend on how the rape was carried out.  But in respect of questions concerning rape, I have told you that I know nothing of rapes committed at that place during the time when I was there, and nobody told me that rapes had taken place there.  That is why I told you that it was a lie, because nobody ever mentioned rapes taking place at that area or that location.
Q.	My question is this:  If somebody is raping somebody at the Mugonero complex, could you see him while you were at Kabahinyuza market?
A.	I think that if somebody was raping someone behind me, I wouldn't know about it unless I was aware of the rape.  There were some things that one could see and others that one couldn't, especially as one was not in the know about what -- all what was happening in that place.
Q.	Now, who told you that you were to leave for Gishyita on the 16th?
A.	It's my father.
Q.	When was it you first knew that you were supposed to go to Gishyita?  What was the date that you knew that on the 16th you were supposed to go to Gishyita? 
A.	I learnt on the eve of our departure, in the evening.
Q.	I don't understand.  Could you kindly repeat your question, please -- your response, please, to my question?
A.	I told you that I learnt of it, or we discussed it, with my father in the evening, and on the next day, we left.
Q.	When you say "in the evening," you mean that you discussed your itinerary with your father in the evening, in the evening of the 15th of April?  Is that what you're saying?
A.	Listen, we didn't discuss it as such.  It is not I who was deciding.  He just told me where we had to go, and I followed him.
Q.	My question is:  When was that?  When did he tell you that you were going to leave the 16th?
A.	Yes, I told you that it's on the evening of the 15th.  We discussed it and, the next morning, we left.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, I'm going to show the witness the transcripts.  I'm making reference to the transcripts in Ntakirutimana in relation to this matter.  These are the transcripts of 11 February 2002, page 22, English version, lines 19 to 24.  

The President of the Tribunal asked this witness the following question:  "Was it in the morning of the 16th that you were informed that you were about to leave? The Witness: Yes, indeed, it was that morning that I learned that we were about to leave."
He has just given testimony that it was on the night of the 15th, the evening of the 15th, that his father told him that he was leaving for Gishyita the following morning.  I request that this be admitted as an exhibit, Your Honours, these two copies. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you asked the same question?  Were you asked in the Ntakirutimana case the date you first knew that you were to leave for Gishyita?  You were asked that question, were you not?
A.	I no longer remember very well, but I know that the question was put to me regarding the time when I knew that we were to go to Gishyita.
Q.	And was your response not that it was in the very morning on the eve of departure on the 16th that you learned of the departure to Gishyita?
A.	I said that it was on the morning of the 16th that we decided to leave, so it is on the morning of the 16th that we decided once and for all that we were to go to Gishyita, and indeed this is what we did.
Q.	My question was:  When did you know for the first time that you were supposed to go to Gishyita?  And you testified here in this case that it was in the evening of the 15th.  Didn't you say so?
A.	Yes, I said that on the night of the 15th, I knew that we could leave the place where we were, and the next morning we set out for Gishyita.  That is what happened.
Q.	Okay.  Now, what time did you leave for Gishyita in the morning of the 16th?
A.	It is not easy to determine the time, and I had told you before that I couldn't give you an exact time.  I know that we arrived between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.  As to the time of departure, I am not able to give it to you, but I know that we arrived at Gishyita between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you gave your time of departure in your evidence-in-chief yesterday. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I said that it was possible that we left at seven o'clock in the morning because, between 8:00 and 9:00  a.m., we were already in Gishyita.  That is what I explained, but I cannot tell you with any certainty that we left at 7:30 or at 6:00 a.m.  I said that it was probable that we may have left at six o'clock, but between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. we were already in Gishyita.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But yesterday you told us with certainty that you left the place at seven o'clock and arrived at Gishyita at eight o'clock.
THE WITNESS:
I said that we'd left this place at about seven o'clock and that we arrived at the other place at about 8:00 or 9:00 a.m.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in the Ntakirutimana trial you were asked this very question.  Again, you told that Tribunal -- that Chamber, that "To be more precise, let's say it was between five and eight o'clock in the morning."  That was your testimony there.  Didn't you say that, the time of departure?
A.	Yes, it is between 5:00 and 8:00 a.m. that we prepared ourselves for departure.
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I'm referring to the Ntakirutimana transcripts, page 72, transcripts of 7th February 2002, lines 5 and 6, the English version. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So, according to your testimony in these two cases, you're telling this Tribunal that you left any time between 5:00 a.m. and eight o'clock?
A.	I think that you misunderstood me.  I said that between 5:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. we prepared for departure, and between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., we were already in Gishyita, and I think that is what I explained.  I don't know whether this was not taken down correctly or whatever, but this is what I said.
Q.	Okay.  How long did it take you to travel from the market, Kabahinyuza market, to Gishyita centre, to the CCDF?
A.	I cannot give a precise time because we stopped at some places, so I cannot tell you that we spent this number of minutes or that number of hours, but I know that when we arrived at Gishyita it was between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.  So between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. we had already arrived.
Q.	Did you say that you stopped somewhere on the way between Kabahinyuza market and CCDF? 
A.	Yes, I said that before we reached Gishyita, one could stop or we could walk slowly.  We were not in very much of a hurry.  Listen, we were not counting the kilometres that we covered.  That is why I am telling you that I was not sure about the time when we arrived.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you say you could walk slowly? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  The vehicle was not travelling very quickly. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So how long did it take you to move from that place, between Kabahinyuza market and Gishyita centre?
A.	I remember, I can tell you that it was between eight o'clock and nine o'clock in the morning that we arrived at Gishyita.  I cannot say that the kilometres were such-and-such in number.  Only the person who was driving could determine the number of kilometres, but I cannot confirm it to you. 
Q.	Do you know the distance between Kabahinyuza market and Gishyita centre?
A.	No.
Q.	You don't know the distance between Kabahinyuza market and Gishyita centre; that's your testimony?
A.	No, I don't know the distance.  If I were to give a distance, it would only be an estimate.
Q.	Okay.  Can you tell us -- give us an estimate of the distance between the two places?
A.	Listen, when you make estimates, you might make a mistake.  You could make a mistake in giving estimates and you might give the wrong distance.  I cannot tell you how many kilometres there were between these two places.  It would take me a lot of time to think and to try and determine the number of kilometres that separated these two places.  I told you when we arrived in Gishyita.  You, too, can make an estimate and you would say to yourself,  well, if they left at this time and they left at -- and arrived at that time, you yourself can estimate the distance.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are an educated man, are you not?  And actually, you hold a degree **************, don't you?
A.	I follow you.
JUDGE SHORT:
You agree with him or you follow him?  What do you mean?  Is it true? 
THE WITNESS:
I can hear what the Prosecutor is saying.  He's asking me whether I'm an intellectual.  I say yes, I have a certificate or a degree **********.  But the fact is I did not finish my studies **********.  The war stopped me from obtaining my certificate, but he can continue to put questions to me, if he wishes.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	But at that time you were in your second or third year at the university, were you not?
A.	I was in my second year at university.
Q.	And you told this Tribunal that you were *************** area, were you not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And that Gishyita centre is the headquarters of your commune; is that not so?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you are here now.  You want Their Honours to believe that you cannot estimate the distance between Kabahinyuza market and Gishyita centre?  Is that what you want Their Honours to believe?
A.	I don't know whether the Judges would believe me.  It would depend on their willingness to do so.  You are asking me to estimate these things.  If I were to give you an estimate and somebody gives you another estimate tomorrow, my estimate might not be the good one.  If I am telling you that we arrived at this place at a certain time, you yourself have gone to school as well.  You, too, can estimate the number of kilometres that separate these two places.  If I give you the time, then you can deduct or deduce the number of kilometres that separate these two places.  I cannot -- I do not wish to give you an estimate to find that my estimate has been contradicted because I might be making a mistake.  But if I tell you that we arrived at such-and-such an hour, I think it is more plausible.  I prefer to give you the times rather than the number of kilometres. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You have already given estimates before this Court, haven't you?  You gave an estimate -- you gave an estimate of the distance between the hospital and the market, did you not? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I gave you that estimate because there is a short distance, but in regard to the two other places, there is a winding road.  It is difficult to tell you how many kilometres there are between these two places.  It is difficult because I might perhaps give a greater or smaller distance than there actually is and you might think that I'm doing this just to lie to you, which is why I prefer to give you the time when we arrived in Gishyita.
JUDGE SHORT:
How long would it take you to walk from Gishyita to -- what was your question? 
MR. KAPAYA:
From Gishyita to the -- from the Kabahinyuza centre, Your Honour, to the CCDF where they went, which is in Gishyita centre.
JUDGE SHORT:
How long would it take you to walk from that place to the CCDF? 
THE WITNESS:
I think one could cover this distance in four hours of walking.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, you are a second-year ******* student; is that what you said?  You studied ****.
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Sorry?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
As part of your studies in ********************, correct?  You did? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I follow you.  It is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And you are telling us you left the hospital where you were at what time? 
THE WITNESS:
Listen, we didn't go on foot.  We were on board a vehicle.  You asked me --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I'm asking you the time you left by vehicle.
THE WITNESS:
I told you that we started off at about 7:00 a.m.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Seven a.m.  And you arrived after eight, between eight and nine; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I said between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
That is in the space of about an hour plus, an hour and a half, an hour and ten minutes, an hour and 30 minutes; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:
I don't think that we took more than an hour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not more than an hour.  So you took about an hour.  And assuming your vehicle was --
THE WITNESS:
Let's say one hour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Let's say one hour.  And assuming your vehicle was "walking" slowly, as you said it was "walking" slowly, if you walk now at what speed? 
THE WITNESS:
Listen, I don't know at what speed the vehicle was going, but I know we were moving slowly. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Slowly. 
THE WITNESS:
Slowly, along the road, which was not good.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Remember, you said you are a ********* student, so we won't allow you to pretend that you don't know whether a vehicle is travelling at 20 kilometres per hour, 30 kilometres per hour, 60 kilometres per hour, 50 kilometres per hour. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Listen, it's not a road as you know them.  This is a road that would be called bad.  That is why we were driving slowly.  Bad roads of Kibuye, when you're taking a turn, a corner, you have to be careful because, if not, you might just end up in a valley.  Listen, I don't know at what speed the vehicle was travelling, but what was obvious was that the vehicle was going very slowly.  I don't know why you don't want to accept that the vehicle was moving slowly.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
I do, but I want to know how slowly.  "Slowly", slowly can be 10 kilometres per hour; it can be 20 kilometres per hour.
THE WITNESS:
Listen, I really do not know how to answer you.  I have told you that we were already in Gishyita between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., and you are asking me at what speed we are travelling.  If I was sitting next to the driver, I might have been able to tell you, but I was in the rear of the vehicle.  I don't even know why you insist on asking me at what speed the vehicle was travelling.  I told you that we arrived at our destination between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.  I don't see the importance, on my part, of determining the speed at which the vehicle was travelling.  You can put other questions to me.  I have asked you -- I have told you at what time we arrived at our destination.  You are trying to prove the contrary, whereas I was the one who was there.  I don't know what you are driving at.  Thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on, Mr. Kapaya, go on.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Yesterday you gave us the estimate between the two places as four to five kilometres.  Are you vacating that response? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which places?  Can you name the places?  
MR. KAPAYA:
He said from the Mugonero hospital to Gishyita centre.  And we know from Mugonero hospital to Kabahinyuza centre is hardly 500 kilometres, so it's just about the same place.  So I'm asking him whether he's vacating that response now.
THE WITNESS:
I think that you got this answer from someone else.  If that is what you understood, it is not because I am the one who said it.  You probably did not understand correctly. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Well, the record will bear this out. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, how many -- in which vehicle did you travel from Kabahinyuza market to the CCDF, whose vehicle?
A.	I was on board the hospital vehicle.
Q.	Can you tell us the people you travelled with in that vehicle, the names of the people you travelled with?
A.	I have the impression that we are returning to the Ntakirutimana case.  I will ask you to give me the document from which you are reading all these names because there were in fact people who were with me in the vehicle.  You are putting questions that were put to me in the Ntakirutimana case.  You are consulting a document.  So I would ask you to give me the document so that I can read the names as well.  I've given you these names; you know them.  You've known them for two years.  I told you that this court case had been on two years ago.  I gave you the names; you have them in the document.  So give me the document if you want me to read out the names to you or you read them out yourself.
Q.	Like, let me put my question differently.  Among the people you know --

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it an appropriate time for a short break?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will take a short break for 15 minutes.  Thank you. 
	(Court recessed from 1100H to 1135H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  

Mr. Kapaya, please proceed. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Sir, when we broke, I had reached the stage where I was asking you the people with whom you boarded in Dr. Gérard's car to go to the CCDF in Gishyita.  Now, was Mr. Mathias Ngirinshuti and his family in that car?  Did you travel with him?  Just a yes or no, to speed up the process.
A.	I will not answer by a yes or a no.  Rather, I will make a request.  I think that I am not appearing here within the framework of the Ntakirutimana trial because that trial has ended, and besides, I didn't retain like a parrot all that I said in this Tribunal during the Ntakirutimana --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness --
THE WITNESS:
-- trial.  If you want the transcripts -- if you want me to repeat what I said there, give me the transcripts of that trial and then I'll be able to remember certain things I said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just answer the question asked. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that I cannot continue, to contradict myself or to lie, because you have before you the transcripts of my testimony.  I think I should answer questions with the transcript before me so that I myself, I can take note of the contradictions that I've made today.  Because if you say that the testimony that you find in the Ntakirutimana transcripts are true, then give them to me, because I did not retain by rote memory all I said within the framework of my testimony then.  When I came to testify here, I did not review all that I said in the Ntakirutimana trial.  

Besides, I'm not God.  Please, let's understand each other on that score.  For instance, ask me the question, "Did you state this?"  And I'll say to the best of my knowledge, or as far as I remember, if I accept or not.  Otherwise, I will request that if you want to ask me a question on what I stated in my testimony in the previous trial, then give me the transcripts thereof.  Otherwise, asking me questions, you know, in the abstract on a trial that is already past, I don't quite agree with you.  So give me a copy of the transcripts and if you ask me a question on this person or on this issue, I will give you an answer, having before me the transcripts, and that is why I want us to make some progress. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, is your difficulty the fact that you cannot remember the evidence you gave in the Ntakirutimana case in 2001?  Is that your difficulty? 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot remember all the details, whereas you have the transcripts before you.
JUDGE SHORT:
If you cannot remember all the details of the evidence you gave in that case in 2001, how can you remember what took place in 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
If I say that I don't remember the purport of my testimony in 2001 in the Ntakirutimana case, I mean that it will be difficult for me to recall names, dates, because I would need to remember the -- all the details and how things went on.  I don't know, you are deliberately asking me to do this.  You have the copies of the transcripts of that case.  So give me the copies of the transcripts.  I will confirm what you are asking me with respect to what I would be seeing in the transcripts that I would have before me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you are clear about the dates and the names and everything that happened in 1994?
THE WITNESS:
I don't know what was written down as my statement since the commencement of my testimony.  Questions are being asked me of what I said during the Ntakirutimana trial and I said I can remember as much as I can of what I said in my testimony.  Whereas I came here without knowing whether I would be asked questions that I had addressed in the Ntakirutimana case.  If I had reviewed the transcript of that case, that would have helped me.  Here, I knew that I was coming to testify in the Mika case and I haven't had time to go over or to try to recall what I said in the Ntakirutimana case.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, you are being asked just to tell us the truth, not to tell us what you said in the Ntakirutimana trial.  You tell us what is the truth, what happened in 1994.  If you went with Mr. A in the vehicle, you will know it.  You know it is A, not B.  So if you are asked a question, "Did you go with 
Mr. A in a vehicle,"  you will remember in 1994 it was Mr. A and not Mr. B who went in the vehicle.  We are only asking you to tell us the truth as you know it, and that shouldn't be difficult.  If you can't remember what happened in 1994, just say, "I cannot remember who went with me" or "I cannot remember what happened."  Or you tell us, "I remember what happened."  The truth alone, that's all.  Is it too much to ask you to tell us the truth? 
THE WITNESS:
The truth be told, it is not difficult to say the truth.  All that I said was written down.  If you mention this or that name by asking me that the last time around you said you travelled with this or that person on board this car, I think that could help me.  Now, if you ask me a question concerning the date, I can answer, but I would like to have that document.  I did not come here to bear false testimony.  So you can't want to be able to say in the Ntakirutimana case this is what you said and now he's saying some other thing. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. --
THE WITNESS:
And do you agree with me that we can proceed in that manner?   
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	What I'm asking you now is that you said you cannot remember all the people you travelled with, and I agree with you.  And we are not here to test your memory; you are here to give evidence.  So I'm trying to refer you to names of people and ask you whether you recall that you were with them in the car or you were not with them in the car.  So my question was whether you recall -- you can say yes or no --- whether you recall that Mathias Ngirinshuti and his family were in the car in which you travelled.  That's all I'm asking you.  If you recall, you say "yes."  If you don't, you say "no," you don't recall. 
A.	I don't remember well that I was with all the members of Mathias's family but I do remember that I was with Madam Rachelle.
Q.	And who was Rachelle?  Can you tell us who Rachelle was and where she worked?
A.	Madam Rachelle was an elderly lady who was like a white lady and she used to work in the laundry section of the hospital.
Q.	Do you recall whether you were with any pastor or families of pastors in that car?
A.	I recall that I was with my father, who was a (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).  Besides, I remember that I was with a 
	Pastor Gakwerwere.
Q.	And do you recall whether Muvunyi and his family were there?
A.	I do not quite remember if all the members of that family were in that car.  All I remember is that they were the employees of the hospital who were with us in that hospital vehicle.  I remember that there were hospital employees who were in that car.
Q.	Now, among the people whom you know, with whom you travelled to the CCDF, can you tell me one who was of the Tutsi origin, just one?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you have someone of the Tutsi origin in the vehicle?  That's all you're being asked. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, there were some.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Can you give us the name of those who were there? 
THE WITNESS:
No one was supposed to know the ethnic backgrounds of the occupants of that vehicle.  But I do remember that there was a Tutsi lady, but you must understand that before people got into the car, nobody said the Hutus are climb -- "get into the car" or "Tutsis, get down from the car."  So I know that the occupants were Tutsis and Hutus.  So we had the people from the various ethnic backgrounds in the car.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I ask you to name the people who you knew to be Tutsi.  Give us their names, if you know -- if you know them. 
A.	I don't know the names of those Tutsis besides the lady I just mentioned to you who is of Tutsi origin.  I can't remember her name or I don't know her name. 
Q.	Was Gakwerwere a Hutu or a Tutsi, or don't know?
A.	I don't know.  People were saying that he was Hutu, but I cannot confirm whether he was Hutu or Tutsi.
Q.	Was Dr. Gérard a Hutu or Tutsi, or you don't know?
A.	I think you know that better than myself.  Don't ask me whether he was Hutu or Tutsi.  His case took place here and you know that more than I do.  Don't ask me such questions, please.
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, you are here to answer questions, okay?  You are here to answer questions, and don't be arrogant. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I am not arrogant.  The only thing is that I know that the Prosecutor himself knows that Gérard Ntakirutimana was Hutu, and I know that he's aware of that.
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm not interested in what the Prosecutor knows but what you know.  That's what we're interested in at the moment. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It is the Court you are addressing, not the Prosecutor. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, let's move on to another area.  Can you tell us, when you reached the CCDF, what is the first thing that you did?
A.	As soon as I arrived at CCPDF, I didn't get into the building because it was locked when we got there.  When we went there, we sat down to rest.  Subsequently, I went about looking for what could help us to survive.  That is what I did. 
Q.	And where did you go?  Did you go anywhere?  Did you go some place, in the first place and, if so, where?
A.	I went to the Gishyita market for a walk.  It is not far from that place and I used to go there frequently.  And I used to go back and forth without any problem.
Q.	So it's your testimony that on arrival at the CCDF, after you had settled down, you went to the Gishyita market for a walk?  Is that your testimony?
A.	As soon as I arrived at CCDF, some time after, the officials of the region, including the bourgmestre and conseiller, Mika found us there at that building.  Subsequently, they showed us accommodation, and some of us found accommodation inside the building and others outside.  And then, later, I used to go to the market square without any worries.
Q.	You haven't answered my question, Mr. Witness.  I asked you that after you had settled down, after you had unloaded the luggage with which you went, had been shown a place to stay, did you leave the place or did you stay at that place?
A.	I left that place to go for a walk.
Q.	And where did you go for a walk?
A.	I had a habit of going for a walk at the centre.
Q.	How long did you stay at the centre?
A.	Since the market square was not far from where we were settled, I used to go there and maybe stay there for a short while and I could buy some items that -- or I could converse with people.  You would understand yourself that somebody who is idle can only take walks.  So it was like an unemployed or an idle person who was taking a walk.
Q.	Right. Ntakirutimana trial, page 77 of the transcripts, dated February 7, 2002, you were asked this question:  "What did you do when you got to Gishyita, Mr. Witness?  What was the first thing you did when you got to Gishyita?"  And this is what you said:  "When we got to Gishyita we climbed down from the vehicle, of course, and left our personal items somewhere, and we went to look for wood to make fire and prepare food.  That is what we did."  So is going to prepare to look for firewood and going for a stroll one and the same thing?
A.	I wonder if you understood me well.  I said the first thing I did was to go and look for firewood.  It is good that you gave back the answer that I gave in the Ntakirutimana trial, and that is what I just told you.  And when I came back from where I went to look for firewood, I went for a walk.  I think I explained this well. 
Q.	That is not what you said here. 

MR. KAPAYA:
And I am tendering these transcripts as Prosecutor Exhibit -
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May we have the transcripts? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.  I have them, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	All right.  Now, you talked about authorities coming to that place at the CCDF.  Who, Mr. Witness, did you say came to see you there as you sought refuge?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, before you proceed, may we know, is CCDF a centre? 
MR. KAPAYA:
It's a social centre.  Maybe the witness can respond to that. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what's the long form of "CCDF"?  I know that's an acronym.  What's the long form of that, if you know?
A.	I think I told you that I did not know what the CCDFP stands for.  All I know is that it was a centre where games took place.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Kapaya, continue. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you say that any authorities came to see you at that place and, if so, which date? 
A.	Those authorities came to see us on the 16th.
Q.	Can you tell us who came to see you on the 16th?
A.	You have the communal authorities, including Mika. 
Q.	 (Microphone not activated)
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	I didn't get the answer.  Who are the other communal authorities in addition to Mika that came to see you there, the name or names?
A.	I do not remember their names but I remember their duties.  There was the secretary and his assistant, but I can't remember their names.
Q.	Was the bourgmestre there, did the bourgmestre come?
A.	Yes, I mentioned the name Charles.  He was there. 
Q.	What is his full name?  Do you know his full name?
A.	I do not remember his other name.
Q.	Did Mika come with this person or the bourgmestre Charles came separate from Mika?
A.	I remember that all these authorities came almost at the same time.  I do not know whether they came at the same time, but it was almost at the same time.  When we were taking our places, that is just after our arrival at this place. 
Q.	Can you confirm that the name of the bourgmestre was Charles Sikuwabo?  Do you recall hearing that name?
A.	Thank you, you are right.  That is indeed his name.  His name was Sikuwabo.
Q.	Okay.  So you say he came with Mika.  Did you say on the 16th?  What time?
A.	I did not say that they came together.  I said that all the authorities came to see us.  There was Mika; there was Sikuwabo.  I know that they arrived at that place in the morning at about 8:00 a.m., before we tried to find something to eat -- while we were trying to find something to eat.  So when these authorities arrived, we went to find something to eat, but they had already all arrived.
Q.	Now, when you talk of communal authorities, who do you include in that term?  It's a rather all-embracing term.  Who do you include in "communal authorities"?
A.	I believe I've already answered this question.  I said that the bourgmestre was there.  The assistants of the bourgmestre and secretaries were there.  The secteur conseiller was also there.  He was with them.  It is these people that I was referring to, and I believe I have explained this.
Q.	And for how long did they stay there, Mr. Witness?
A.	They didn't spend the entire day there.  They didn't stay for long.  They just spent enough time to bring us together and to give us advice.  After they left, we undertook our activities.  Some of us went for walks and others went to look for food.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What advice had they given to you? 
THE WITNESS:
This is the kind of advice that is given to refugees, especially respect for order and telling them where to find food, where to find water.  That is the kind of advice that they gave us.  And after they gave us this advice, they left.  But they often returned.  Given that there was a centre at this place, I used to walk there.  I used to go to this centre without any trouble whatsoever. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me refer you to the Ntakirutimana transcripts again.  In the transcript of 8 February 2002, page 26, you were asked the following question:  "My question to you, sir, was whether or not you ever saw the bourgmestre come to the house in which you stayed in in Gishyita?"  Your response was, "No, I never saw the bourgmestre visit that house, all the more so as the house, as I said, was close to the communal office."  

That is what you said in Ntakirutimana, two years ago.  Again in the transcript of 30th of -- page 30, transcript of 8 February 2002, you were asked the following question:  "Sir, during the time that you were there, you didn't see any communal authorities visiting the pastor, did you?"  The answer you gave was: "I did not see any communal authorities visiting the pastor.  I saw none."

Now, how do you reconcile your response you've just given in the Mika case and the response you gave in the Ntakirutimana case?  Tell us your purpose.
A.	Thank you.  I remember that this question had been put to me, but this is how the question was put:  "When you arrived at Gishyita, did any authorities receive you?"  And I answered, "When I arrived, the authorities did not receive us but they arrived afterwards because there were people -- there were no people who were ready to receive refugees from Ngoma, but it is later on that these authorities met with the refugees."

You're asking me whether I saw the authorities of the commune.  The reason why I did not say that these authorities had come is not that I don't know them, it's because the authorities had come later.  And I answered that I did not know whether these authorities had met Gérard.  So I didn't say that the authorities did not come to the commune office or that I did not see them.  Since I knew them.  Thank you.
Q.	Thank you.  Everything is in black and white, Mr. Witness, so the Chamber will judge.  Do you recall --
MR. KAPAYA:
I produce, Your Honour, the transcripts of February 2002 as Prosecution exhibits. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Do you recall the members of your family with whom you went to the CCDF, your brothers or sisters, apart from your father and mother?  Can you tell us their names?
A.	Yes, I remember the members of my family:  (No interpretation) 
MR. KAPAYA:
I believe the response has not been translated into English.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, can you repeat your question, please? 
MR. KAPAYA:
I asked the witness the names of the --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not the names.  Not the names, please, the numbers. 
MR. KAPAYA:
The number on the list of names of his relatives with whom he went to the CCDF.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
And he answered but it was not translated. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So what was your response, Mr. Witness?  What are the numbers?  Do you have this piece of paper before you?
A.	I answered that those are the people -- it is the people who appear on No. 2 and No. 5 of your list. 
Q.	No. 2 and No. 5.  Now, I refer you again to the Ntakirutimana transcripts, closed session of 11th February 2002, in which you were asked the following question:  "Which other family members were with you in that vehicle?  How many?  Who were they?  They may well be deceased now.  Who are they, please?"  And you mentioned No. 2 and No. 5 -- you mentioned No. 2 and No. 4, right?
A.	It's not correct.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are referring to the closed session transcripts? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour, of 11th February 2002, page 25, lines 14 to 25, English transcripts.
JUDGE SHORT:
But you are not going to ask any question which would compromise his identity, are you? 
MR. KAPAYA:
No, I just mentioned the name by using the numbers. 
JUDGE SHORT:
That's all. 
MR. KAPAYA:
That's what I did, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
That's in order then. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	So your response is -- what are the numbers that you -- you say 2 and 5; that's your response in this case?  Is that the position?
A.	Yes, I gave the same answer at the time. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I produce as exhibits these transcripts. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, can you tell us where Mr. Muhimana was between nine and six on the 16th of April?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Who? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Mika Muhimana.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Does the witness know where he was?
MR. KAPAYA:
Maybe he knows, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Start from that, whether he knows or doesn't.  Because he hasn't told us that he knew as of now.
MR. KAPAYA:
Well, he said briefly that he saw him at the CCDF.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He came to the CCDF but that doesn't mean that he knows where he had been or where he was up to that or anything like that.  But he could know, but I think you have to ask him first of all whether he does. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Whether, do you know -- can you tell us whether you know where Muhimana was the whole of the 16th of April? 
A.	On the 16th of April, when I was in Gishyita, I saw him there.  I saw him no where else. 
Q.	For how long did you see him in Gishyita, from what time to what time?
A.	I spent two weeks; that is, from the 16th to the end of the month.  I would say that most of the time, each time I went to the market, I found him at the market square.  This means that I saw him frequently each time I went for a walk.
Q.	My question is confined to the 16th, 16th of April.  I'm not talking about the 17th or 15th or any other date. 
A.	Thank you.  I saw Mika on the 16th.  I saw him well enough. 
Q.	For how long did you see him?
A.	Since I used to go to the market often, I went -- I saw him there each time I went to the market.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Witness, you have been asked a question.  You say Mr. Mika came to where you were with the other authorities of the commune.  You have been asked how long did you see him there, not you went to the market many times or whatever.  How long, how many hours, how many minutes, how many -- what period did you see him there or in Gishyita? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, I think that the question is clear now.  In Gishyita, where we were, I saw him for 30 minutes after his departure.  Since he lived quite close to the market square, I wasn't in prison, I could move about on that day, and on the hours that followed, I took a walk and I saw him in the market square. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm confining myself to the 16th.  Please, try to understand my question.  Where did you see Mika on the 16th and for how long on the 16th of April?  That's all. 
A.	I think I have answered this question.  I said that where he found us, he spent 30 minutes, and after he left, I was walking about on that day.  I didn't stay sitting all day.  I went for a walk in the market square and I saw him there, in the market square.
Q.	What time was it?  What time was it that you saw him at the market square?
A.	After their departure, the hours that followed, that is about 11:00 a.m. or midday, I went to the market square and I spent the afternoon in the market square.  I saw him on that date up 'til the end of the day.
Q.	Was he at the market --
A.	Before I went back to sleep, I saw him.
Q.	Was he at the market?  Did you see him at the market or did you see him at his home?
A.	I saw him in front of a house.  I don't know whether it was his house, but it was explained to me that this is where he lived.  I do not know that is where he worked, but I was told that he lived at that place.
Q.	Was he alone?  Was he with some other people?  Or what was he doing when you saw him?
A.	I did not see him alone.  He was with other people, but I did not pay attention to what he was doing, considering that he was older than I was.  I was younger.  I was still young.  We didn't talk.  But he wasn't alone.  He was with other people.
Q.	Was he attending any particular occasion or he was just sitting around?  You tell us what precisely he was doing. 
A.	I didn't pay attention to what he was doing, but I heard people say that there was a funeral or that they were in mourning or that they were concluding their mourning.  I don't remember exactly what it was.  That's what I heard, but I know that at that time he was involved in mourning.
JUDGE SHORT:
Who gave you this information? 
THE WITNESS:
There were passers-by on the market square.  I don't even remember the person who told us.  I could hear passers-by saying this.
JUDGE SHORT:
And is it your testimony that on the 16th you saw Mika at the Gishyita market square for 30 minutes?  Is that your testimony?
THE WITNESS:
And even more.  I was at the market square.  When you are a refugee you also have the right to move about.  I arrived and I saw him.  All the time I spent in the market square, I saw Mika.
JUDGE SHORT:
So exactly what are you saying?  Did you see him for 30 minutes on one occasion, went back to CCDF, then came back and saw him again?  Can you be more precise as to when you saw him and how often you saw him?
THE WITNESS:
After their departure from the CCDFP, the refugees, including me, continued with their business.  Those who wished to take walks did so, which is what I myself did.  I was a young man.  I couldn't go anywhere else, apart from the market square.  So where I went for a walk, I saw Mr. Mika.  There's no doubt about that for me.
JUDGE SHORT:
How long did you stay at the market square?
THE WITNESS:
I didn't stay there all day from midday to evening.  I used to go to and return and go back there.  I wasn't doing anything.  What I was able to notice was that when I arrived at the market square, I found Mika there.  I could see him each time I went to the market square.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What was the time when Mika came to see you at CCDF? 
THE WITNESS:
Not me that he came to see.  He came to see everyone.  He did not know me perhaps.  I didn't pay attention --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Anyway, what was the time?
THE WITNESS:
-- to the reason why he had come. 

I don't remember the time, I'm sorry.  I just told you that after our arrival, the people in the square came to see us --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How long --
THE WITNESS:
I cannot determine whether it was eight or nine o'clock.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But it was morning; is that your testimony? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  They came to see us during the morning period.  And after they left, we began to move about.  I was amongst those who went for a walk and I walked to the market square.  After the visitors had left, I went to the market and I saw him there.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Is it your testimony that the Gishyita market was operational in the midst of a war?  Is that what you're telling us, that people were selling goods at the market in this period of the month?
A.	That is not what I said.  If I said that I was taking a walk, it doesn't mean that it was on market day.  All I meant is that I could go to the market square.  I don't even know when the market day was.  It is called a market square, that's all.
Q.	And when you walked around, you never felt threatened in any way amidst the war?  You never felt threatened at all? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, if I'm not mistaken, you did say that you went to the market to buy articles -- stuff for the food. 
THE WITNESS:
I did say that.  
(Pages 21 to 41 by Karen Holm-Porter)




























	1230H
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	And you never felt threatened at all and people were selling produce at the market without fear of looting of their property by hoodlums or anybody?  You are telling us it was business as usual in Gishyita on the 16th of April?
A.	I did not feel any problem.
Q.	Very well.  Now, you were asked whether Josiane, Marie and Marthe were raped at Mugonero on the 16th of April and you said they were not.  Now, you were not at the Mugonero hospital on the 16th of April, were you? 
A.	On the 16th, I had already arrived at Gishyita.
Q.	So you wouldn't know what took place at that place, would you?  You don't know what transpired at the Mugonero complex while you were at Gishyita?
A.	I cannot say that I was following events when I was in Gishyita.  I didn't have the right to do so.  I can state that people could tell us about what had happened.  We could receive information, but I cannot state that I could follow the course of events over there.
Q.	Okay.  My last two, three questions:  Were you contacted by anybody from the Defence before you came to give testimony here? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is in Arusha? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes -- no, before, before coming to Arusha. 
THE WITNESS:
And under what circumstances would that be? 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	I'm asking you that before you came to testify here, did anybody from the Defence or anybody for that -- come and ask you to come and testify in the Muhimana case? 
A.	To the best of my knowledge, no.  What I know is that I was asked to come and give testimony.  I prepared myself.
Q.	Who asked you to come and give testimony? 
A.	I do not remember his name.
Q.	How often did you talk to him? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Or her. 
THE WITNESS:
There was no discussion as such.  I was asked to come and give testimony, and I answered that I was ready to come and give testimony.  When the time came, they came and contacted me to tell me the date.  So there was no discussion between me and them.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	I'm asking you, sir, how many times did you discuss with that man -- did you discuss your testimony with that person? 
A.	This person asked me whether I was ready to come and give testimony in this case, and I was -- and I said that -- that I was ready because the innocents were being condemned.  And lastly, recently, another person whom I did not know contacted me and he told me that I would come and give testimony.  So I did not have any discussion with people in regard to my testimony.
Q.	When was it -- when did you -- were you first contacted in connection with the matter?  Will you tell us the year, month and date, if you recall?  When was the first contact made? 
A.	It's difficult for me.  I didn't pay attention to the dates as to coming here or the dates on which I was to come and give testimony here.  Understand things as I say them.  I didn't keep in mind the date on which such-and-such a person came to see me.  What I remember is that it was suggested to me that I should come and give testimony, and I agreed to do so.
Q.	So you don't know the name of the person you saw who came to contact you?  You don't know when he did that?  Do you know perhaps whether you told that person that you had been a witness -- a Defence witness in the Ntakirutimana case?  Did you tell that person that fact? 
A.	I do not remember, but as far as I can remember, the last person I spoke to was perhaps the Prosecutor.  At one time he asked me whether I was going to testify in the Ntakirutimana case, and I said yes.  And since then, someone came and asked me to come and give evidence.  I talked with the Prosecutor --
JUDGE SHORT:
Were you asked to come and give evidence in this case this year or last year or when? 
THE WITNESS:
I recall that I was contacted --
MR. SONGA:
Excuse me, Madam President.  Someone has said that the -- what the witness said in answer to the previous question was not translated into English. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And what did the witness say that was not translated into English? 
MR. SONGA:
I believe that was when he said that his last meeting was probably with the Prosecutor.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That was translated. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Yes, we heard that.  We heard that, although I don't quite understand what that means. 
MR. SONGA:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  That was the information that I had received from one of my collaborators.  Since I don't understand English, I went along with what he said.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, you have not answered my question.  Were you approached to give evidence in this case this year, last year, two years ago?  You have to think very hard to answer this question?  
THE WITNESS:
I don't have to think very hard because I recall that since the beginning of this year, since I was aware of Mika's detention, I have no doubt in my mind.  Specifically, in the month of April, I knew that I had to come and give evidence, and it was recently that I understood that I had to come and give evidence.  Prior to that, I wasn't well informed on this matter.  It was only recently that I was informed of this fact, and it is -- and that was when I gave my consent. 
JUDGE SHORT:
When were you approached for the first time to give evidence in this case? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not recall the day.  You may perhaps be thinking that -- that I was reluctant to say so.  I didn't expect questions to be asked on this.  It was not of my own volition. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Let's not talk about the day.  Let's talk about the year.  Was it this year or last year that you were approached to give evidence in this case? 
THE WITNESS:
I believe it was this year.
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you remember the month? 
THE WITNESS:
No.
JUDGE SHORT:
You don't remember which month this year you were approached to give evidence in this case? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE SHORT:
And the person who approached you, did he introduce himself or herself to you? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  That person did not introduce himself to me, did not give me his name. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And you did not ask the person who he or she was? 
THE WITNESS:
The person was a man; that is for sure.  It wasn't a woman.  I took note of that, of course.  But I did not ask his name.  We were used to working with people who were investigators.  I don't know how to call them.  But what is for sure is that it was a man.  But I was not keen to find out what his name was.  It is not up to me to answer that question.  Perhaps you should ask that person whether I asked him to tell me his name. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that person here? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not see that person in this courtroom. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How can we ask him when you are not telling us who he is? 
THE WITNESS:
Or you could perhaps ask members of that team.  They would be able to tell us who was sent in our region -- to our region.  Maybe the head of that team will be able to enlighten us on that matter. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, continue. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Since you came to Arusha, have you seen that person, the person who approached you for the first time in connection with this case? 
A.	When I arrived in Arusha, I was taken to a house where we are housed.  As you know, nobody can leave that house.  Nobody came to visit me in that house.  That is all I can state to you. 
Q.	Before you came to testify in court today -- yesterday, did you meet with any of the members of the Defence? 
A.	I met the person who brought documents for me to sign, the documents I have before me.  I certainly met that person in the house where I am residing here in Arusha.
Q.	Did you discuss with him what you were supposed to come and talk about in this court? 
A.	We did not discuss any matter.  He asked me to sign a document.  I looked at it quite briefly, signed it, and the person went away.
Q.	So you were with him for hardly five, ten minutes, just enough for you to look at a piece of paper like this, signed, and then he left?  That's what you're saying? 
A.	No.  That is not what happened.  I don't know whether you need more than 30 seconds to read the document.  The document is written in French.  I speak French.  I don't know whether it would take you more than 30 seconds to read the document.  We were not together for more than a minute.  He asked me to briefly look at the paper.  I did so very rapidly, and the person left. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Witness.

That's all, Your Honours, thank you. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kapaya. 

Professor, do you have any --
MR. KAPAYA:
Sorry, Your Honours, maybe I should tender the exhibits now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Oh, yes, yes. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Actually, my request would be to -- I request that I tender the entire transcripts of the testimony of this witness in the Ntakirutimana case, Your Honour, because the cases I have referred to, they cut across the entire testimony for all the three days the witness gave in court. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Why would you want to tender portions of the transcripts which are not -- which have no relevance to his evidence here?  The only purpose for which you are tendering these transcripts are to impeach his credibility, and so the only portion that would be relevant are those portions that impeach his credibility.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Which was referred to in the --
JUDGE SHORT:
Which were referred to.  We don't want to read the whole testimony. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Fine, Your Honour.  Then I will confine myself to the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The sheet of paper containing five names would be entered and admitted as Exhibit P. 49, to be kept under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 49 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The next exhibit is transcript of 11th of February 2002, page 25, lines 14 to 17 and 21 to 25, closed session.  Exhibit P. 50, under seal. 
	(Exhibit No. P. 50 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Exhibit P. 51 is the transcripts of 11 February 2002, page 22, lines 19 to 23, closed session, to be kept under seal.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you have any re-examination? 
MR. SONGA:
Just a couple of questions, Madam President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, I would like us to go back to the transcripts in the Ntakirutimana case and put a few questions to you -- one question to you on that matter. 
MR. SONGA:
With your permission, may I ask the registry to show the witness a certain page. 
Madam President, all I have is the French version, but it is a very short passage and we rely on the translation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you going to read this answer for the witness? 
MR. SONGA:
Precisely, Madam.  In the document that I have handed out, we are dealing with the passage that is underlined only. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, go ahead. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Witness, I will read out a passage from your statement of the 7th of February 2002 in the Ntakirutimana case, regarding your -- the year in which you were born.  Let me read what you stated:  (By order of the Court, at this point in the proceedings, a portion of the proceedings [page 49] was extracted and placed into a closed session transcript)
	(Pages 42 to 48 by Mark Porter)























BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Do you recognise this passage from your statement before the Tribunal? 
A.	Yes.  I recognise that statement.
Q.	I thank you.  Witness, let me put this question to you.  From what point did the vehicle that took you in Gishyita set out? 
A.	I repeated my answer on several occasions.  I said we set out at about 7 a.m. when we set out for Gishyita.
Q.	From where exactly did that vehicle leave? 
A.	The vehicle left at Kabahinyuza, Kabahinyuza market.
Q.	Did you know Pastor Ntakirutimana's house?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Where was it located in relation to Kabahinyuza market? 
A.	When you left the hospital, around the market square, you continued towards the beginning of the market square.  You go down the road, and the first house you see in that area -- as a matter of fact, it is among those first houses you see that Ntakirutimana's house is found.
Q.	Those houses you referred to, were they part of Mugonero hospital?
A.	No.  Those houses were not part of the hospital.
Q.	Can it be said that Pastor Ntakirutimana's house was in Kabahinyuza?
A.	Yes.  It was situated in Kabahinyuza.
Q.	Witness, you were not at Mugonero on the 16th of April 1994; is that correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is a leading question.  It's a leading question.  It's a suggesting question. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I'm asking this question because in his answer to the Prosecutor, he stated that on the 16th of April he was not in Mugonero. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Now, my question to you, Witness, is why, whereas you were not there, you are able to assert that Marthe was not raped on that day by Mika? 
A.	This is the first reason why I make that confirmation:  That woman called Marthe, during the events of 1994, she was not present in that area.  I stated that it was instead her children and her houseboy who were present.  Marthe was not present.
Q.	Why do you state forcefully that Marie was not raped in Mugonero by Mika on the 16th of April? 
A.	I make that confirmation because that person was not present in Mugonero.  Marie -- Marthe, was not present in Mugonero.  I don't know whether after my departure in the morning that person arrived, perhaps by air, but I can confirm that those people were not present.  If they had been present, I would have seen them because I went to seek refuge with many families at the hospital.
Q.	Is that the explanation -- the same explanation you would give with regard to Josiane? 
A.	I would not give the same explanation regarding Josiane, since I saw Josiane at the hospital.  She was present.  And while we were at the hospital, I was one of those who participated in patrols with my colleagues.  I did not notice any insecurity.  I didn't see anyone committing acts of rape.  I did not hear that anyone had come to rape people.  I don't know whether Mika was the exception to the rule by coming to rape people coming from Gishyita, where he was residing.  If that had taken place, since I was taking part in the night rounds, I would have known.  I was providing for the security of people who were in that area. 
MR. SONGA:
I thank you, Witness. 

I thank you, Madam President, and with your leave, I would like to tender into evidence an extract of the transcript of the 7th February 2002 in the Ntakirutimana case, page 13. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The transcript is entered as Exhibit D. 55. 
	(Exhibit No. D. 55 admitted, under seal)
MR. SONGA:
I would like to complete the document by giving the French -- the English version, Madam President, subsequently. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If a witness has given evidence that Mika was at Mugonero complex on the 16th of April, what would you say to that? 
THE WITNESS:
Could you please repeat your question? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If there is testimony to the effect that Mika was at Mugonero hospital on the 16th of April, that day you were seeing him at Gishyita, what would you say to that evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
Such evidence would be false.  Mika could not have been at Ngoma and Gishyita at the same time.  That could not have been possible.  Such a witness would be lying. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Would be lying.  Because it takes how long to get from Gishyita to Mugonero by car? 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot give you the exact number of minutes or hours that can be spent to cover that distance.  It would depend on the speed of the vehicle.  So I'm therefore not in a position to say that it could have taken so many minutes or hours, so I cannot answer your question at the moment. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Going by the slow vehicle you took yourselves, it could take an hour or less? 
THE WITNESS:
One hour or less than an hour.  It would all depend on the speed of the vehicle. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, you are very familiar with the Mugonero complex, aren't you? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
And you're familiar with the hospital wing of the complex? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
JUDGE SHORT:
You know the hospital wing of the complex? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Did I hear you say in your evidence that there is -- there were no operating theatres in the hospital? 
THE WITNESS:
Nobody asked me that question.  I stated that in the school, there was no surgery ward. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But in the hospital, was there a theatre, an operating theatre, in the hospital? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  There was a theatre in the hospital.
JUDGE SHORT:
A surgical theatre? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  That was where patients could be operated upon.
JUDGE SHORT:
And this surgical theatre was located in the basement of the complex? 
THE WITNESS:
I no longer remember in what part of the hospital the operating theatre was.  It is true that there was a storey building.  I did not pay attention to the medical activities.  It is true I knew where the hospital was, but I cannot tell you that it was in this or that building that such-and-such an activity was undertaken.  I went to receive care in the hospital, but I didn't pay attention to that.  It was not my area of competence, but I know that there was an operating or surgical theatre at the hospital.
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you know that the hospital had two floors, a first floor and a basement? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  The hospital had a storey building.
JUDGE SHORT:
And did you know or hear that there were refugees in the hospital, in this complex, that there were many refugees in this complex? 
THE WITNESS:
I myself was one of the refugees.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you know or hear about any attacks on this complex during the period that you were there, or afterwards? 
THE WITNESS:
While I was there, no attack was launched against the complex, but after I left, I did, in fact, hear that the hospital had been attacked.
JUDGE SHORT:
And on what date did you hear that the hospital was attacked? 
THE WITNESS:
I began to hear about this around the 17th and the 18th.  It is from these dates that I learnt that the hospital had been destroyed.  That is what I heard. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And you heard that the hospital had been attacked on what date?  I'm interested in the date that you heard the hospital was attacked. 
THE WITNESS:
Those who told me did not tell me the time, but I know that what was said here and there was that from the 17th people began to tell us that the hospital had been attacked.  I left the hospital on the 16th.  It is on the next day, the 17th, that I learnt that the hospital had been destroyed.
JUDGE SHORT:
You left the hospital on the 16th or the 12th?  Is it the 12th you left or on the 16th?  Can we just clarify this? 
THE WITNESS:
Listen, if I say that I left the hospital on the 16th, then that is the date on which I left to go to Gishyita, but that was not on the date on which I left the hospital to go to Kabahinyuza because when the attacks were launched against the hospital, I was not, in fact, present in Mugonero.  On the 16th, I was in Gishyita.  I was no longer in Mugonero.
JUDGE SHORT:
On the 12th, you had left the Mugonero complex, is that not correct?  That is your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  On the 12th, in the evening.  I spent the night in Kabahinyuza.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, between the 8th and the 12th, are you saying that there was calm in the Mugonero complex, there were no activities which threatened the security of the refugees in the hospital or in the complex?  Is that your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
In fact, during that period, there was no security problem.  If I decided to stay this place -- to take refuge in this place, it is because I knew that it was safe, and before my departure, there were no problems.
JUDGE SHORT:
Why did you feel threatened?  Were you a target during this period?  And if so, why? 
THE WITNESS:
When the events began, everybody was a target.  At the outset, there was theft that spread all over the country.  That is what we were told.  Everybody thought that the country was subject to acts of banditry and that they had to take refuge, so we went to seek refuge, me and my family and other people.  So we took up abode in these buildings, because at one point we realised that there were problems, and so we decided to leave these buildings.
JUDGE SHORT:
Subsequently you realised that you, you particularly and your family, you were not under threat; is that not so?
THE WITNESS:
While we were at the hospital, we didn't have any problems.  The problems arose later on, when it was realised that there were suspicious activities, and we decided to leave the hospital to go elsewhere. 
JUDGE SHORT:
My question is you said that in the initial stages, everybody felt that they were under threat.  Subsequently, did you find out who was under threat and who was not under threat? 
THE WITNESS:
At the outset, reference was not made to security or safety.  They were talking about banditry.  That is why people took all their property to go to the hospital.  We were not going away for safety reasons.  We were going to escape from banditry.  And we said to ourselves if we are together nobody can come and try to take our property.  That is why we left our homes to take refuge.  We were fleeing from acts of banditry, but not security problems as such.
JUDGE SHORT:
How long did this impression last?  How long did you have this impression that you were escaping from acts of banditry only?  Did you have this impression throughout the month of April, May, June? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  The impression did not remain the same, because later on, we used to listen to the news on the radio.  We knew what was going on.  Afterwards we understood that there was a war that threatened the country, and anybody who was able to analyse things understood that acts of banditry were, in fact, acts of war.  That is why we decided to go and seek refuge. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you have any relationship with Mika? 
THE WITNESS:
I didn't even know him.  There is no relationship between me and Mika, none at all.
JUDGE SHORT:
So you had no cause to monitor his movements or to know where he would be at any given time? 
THE WITNESS:
Listen, when I moved about, it was not to go and see Mika.  But if I say that I saw him, it is because I saw him.  There were people that I did not see and others that I did see.  There was no relationship between me and these people.  I was not supposed to be monitoring the movements of Mika, but I knew him by name.  But if I saw him, I cannot say that I did not see him.  The fact is that I did see him, but I was not supposed to be monitoring his movements. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Judge Short. 

To protect the identity of this witness, we direct that all of the questions that had taken place in open session should be entered into closed session, the discussion on the date of birth of this witness.  All discussion on the date of birth of this witness should be entered into closed session. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, do you know whether any of the witnesses you're going to call have testified in previous proceedings before this Tribunal?  And if so, could you give us -- could you let us know? 
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, to the best of my knowledge, we might mention Witness No. 32 on our list, AR1, that is.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
May we know in which case this witness had testified before? 
MR. SONGA:
Yes, exactly, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In which case? 
MR. SONGA:
I believe it is still in the Ntakirutimana case. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Is this the only of your witnesses who has testified before, before this Tribunal? 
MR. SONGA:
To the best of my knowledge, this is the only witness, Your Honour.  But if any new information comes to light, I shall inform you immediately. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence and we thank you for your testimony before this Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home.

MADAM PRESIDENT:

THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you confirm that the particulars given in the document are correct?

Yes.  They are correct. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:

WITNESS TQ8,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you a number of questions, and the first is as follows:  In the identification paper detailing your particulars, you indicate an address at which you used to reside in April 1994. 
A.	Yes.
Q.	When you learnt of the death of President Habyarimana, were you at that address?
A.	No.  I wasn't living at that address. 
Q.	Do you mean that you had another address? 
A.	During that period, I was in Kigali.  I wasn't at the address indicated on that sheet.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And how did you learn about the death of the president? 
A.	I learnt the news of the death of President Habyarimana while I was in the gendarmerie camp at Kacyiru between 8 and 9 p.m.  We heard a bomb explosion.  Since we were responsible for ensuring the security of the Kacyiru camp, those who were in the building told us that the head of state had just died and that we had to ensure security because security was no longer quite guaranteed.
Q.	And what was the security situation prevailing in the town as a whole? 
A.	Do you want to know about the security situation before the president's death or after? 
Q.	After. 
A.	When we heard that news, we understood that there was a problem and we became vigilant, but by dawn, we heard explosions throughout the city, and we understood that the situation had changed and that there was no longer any security because of the explosions we were hearing all over town.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In April 1994, did you know Mika Muhimana?
A.	I knew him, and even before 1994, I knew him.  I knew him since 1983 and up until today, I still know him.
Q.	Did you also know his family? 
A.	I know his family.  At least, I know some members of his family; for instance, his brother Maharaliel, who was the director or the principal of our school, CFG.  I also knew his wife Xavéra.
Q.	Do you also know Mika Muhimana's ethnic group?
A.	To the best of my knowledge, he's Hutu.
Q.	Did you also know Xavéra's ethnic group?
A.	I know that she was Tutsi.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you know a person called Gafurafura? 
A.	I knew Gafurafura.  He was a pastor in Ngoma.
Q.	Do you know what became of him? 
A.	I know that he was a pastor but he died in 1983.
Q.	Was he married? 
A.	Yes, he was married. 
Q.	Did he have children? 
A.	He had children, many children, but those whose names I can remember are Mathias and Marie Mukeshimana.
Q.	And what was Mathias doing in April 1994? 
A.	I met Mathias in 199 -- in 1994 in Kigali, in Kigali-rural, but I didn't know what his occupation was.
Q.	You mentioned Marie.  Can you tell us her full name? 
A.	She was called Marie Mukeshimana.
Q.	Was she also called Marie Gafurafura? 
A.	The names I knew that she bore were Marie Mukeshimana, daughter of Gafurafura.
Q.	Thank you.  Did you see her in April 1994?
A.	Yes.  I saw her. 
Q.	Can you recall the circumstances under which you saw her? 
A.	Yes, I do remember.  On the 8th of April, we had a problem in the Kacyiru camp, which was attacked by the Inkotanyi coming from Kanserege.  All the inhabitants of that neighbourhood of Kanserege fled and sought refuge in the Kacyiru camp.  Others bypassed the camp to go towards Kanserege.  As Marie Mukeshimana wasn't at Rachelle's place, she sought refuge at -- at Kanserege, and in the evening I saw her.  When I saw her, she and her friend, as well as others who were with her, went to the Kanserege neighbourhood or quarter where there was security, because in the Kabagari quarter, which had been sieged by the Inkotanyi, they couldn't stay there.  So they came back because they couldn't take along with them their property.  So they came back to look for food.  We gave them rice, rice which we had ***************.  And this happened up until the 12th.  On the 12th, Marie, Rachelle, her colleague, and other persons, asked us to protect them and to help them go across the Kacyiru valley in order to save their lives, and they were moving toward the Holy Family.  We accompanied them.  I was with my colleagues.  When we reached Kimicanga, we left them there, and they continued on their own, and we returned ******************.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  After the 12th of April, the day you helped her with Rachelle to cross the Kacyiru valley, did you see them again? 
A.	I saw them again on the 20th of that month.  I went with the young persons that were with me.  We passed by the Holy Family.  We saw them.  We discussed and continued to Nyamirembe (phonetic) because we had friends in that neighbourhood.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you talked about a person called Rachelle.  Who was she?
A.	Rachelle was a young girl originating from Kigarama and was married to ******************************, who was living in Kacyiru quarter.  That is in the Kabagari quarter. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if someone were to say that on the 14th of April 1994, Mika abducted Marie Mukeshimana from the Mugonero complex to take her to Gishyita where he raped her, what reaction would that elicit from you? 
A.	Now, listen:  I can't accept such a statement.  To me, it would be a blatant lie, because, on the 12th, we helped her to leave Kacyiru when she was going to the Holy Family parish.  I wouldn't understand how she would have been able to find herself in Ngoma where she met Mika, and if Mika was in Gishyita, especially as, during that period, vehicles were not moving about.  Only military vehicles could move from place to place.  And besides, on the 20th, when I saw her, I was in the company of my colleagues and she didn't tell me that she had travelled.  Besides it wouldn't have been possible.  And that is why I would say that it would be a lie that has no ground at all. 
Q.	Do you confirm that the Holy Family parish is indeed in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, I confirm this.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you know a person called Kanyabungo? 
A.	Yes, I knew Kanyabungo.  He was a reserve soldier who lived in Kigarama in the Ngoma region.
Q.	Did he have children? 
A.	Yes, he had children.  He had sons and daughters.  His sons were soldiers.  There was Muhayimana, and the other one was an agricultural extension worker.
Q.	I don't know whether I understood correctly.  How many children did he have?
A.	He had several children, but I remember three sons who were soldiers, and another was an agricultural extension worker in Gishyita.
Q.	Did you hear anything about them in April 1994? 
A.	No.  I had no news of them since I hadn't been to Gishyita for sometime.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  During the events of April, May and June 1994, did you have occasion to go to Gishyita commune? 
A.	Yes.  I went there on the 5th of June; that is from the 5th of June to the 15th of June.  I went there because I was on holiday.
Q.	Have you told us how much time you spent in Gishyita? 
A.	I left Kigali on the 5th.  Since there was a problem with movement, I spent the night on the road, and I arrived Gishyita on the 6th, and I left Gishyita on the 15th of June.
Q.	May we put it that you were in Gishyita from the 6th of June to the 15th of June? 
A.	Quite so.
Q.	During your stay, Mr. Witness, did you meet Mika Muhimana?
A.	Yes.  I met Mika Muhimana in Gishyita.  I lived in Gatoki with my elder brother, but I used to go to Ngoma to visit my parents and I spent the night in Gishyita.  When I went there, I sometimes saw him in the centre of Gishyita, and I also saw him when I returned.  And when I was returning late from Gishyita, I could see him as well.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I've finished my examination-in-chief. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 

Mr. Kapaya, you have the floor for cross-examination. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Witness, you have told us that in the night of the 6th of April '94, the president was killed.  Now, could you tell us whether you knew officially who was responsible for the death of the president? 
A.	I cannot know that since I was in the ******************* in Kacyiru.  It is therefore not possible for me to have known what happened outside the ********************.  So I do not know who carried out that assassination.
Q.	Was it not officially known that the Inkotanyi were responsible for the death of the president, among the government circles, in the government circles? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is that an allegation you are making, Mr. Prosecutor, or is it evidence you are going to adduce, or where does it become officially known? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Let me rephrase my question, Your Honours. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Was it announced over Radio Rwanda that the Inkotanyi could have been responsible for the death of the president?  Did you hear that over Radio Rwanda? 
A.	We did not have radio, and we did not have any other means.  We lived **************** and we learnt that the president had died and that consequently we should ensure that there was security. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
How did you learn that without the radio? 
THE WITNESS:
That's right. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
From which source did you learn about the death of the president? 
THE WITNESS:
It is the squad leaders who announced the news to us, and they asked us to be vigilant because the aircraft of the president of the republic had been shot down. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us whether there was any connection between the downing of the plane and the violence that you witnessed in Kigali? 
A.	Would you please repeat the question, Mr. Prosecutor? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Kapaya, has the witness told us that he witnessed violence in Kigali?
 
MR. KAPAYA:
	Yes, he said that, Your Honour.  He said there were guns, explosions and whatnot.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Explosions are what you're calling violence? 
MR. SONGA:
I think an explosion is by nature a violent act, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You're right.  It may be a volcano in Mt. Eliva (phonetic) or some other place. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Get full evidence out of the witness the way evidence should be put.  If you think he saw violence and did, in fact, see it, get it out of him and then ask him if he knows the connection. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I think I was going stage by stage.  I reached the point where I started asking him about the violence but I'm now interested in the cause of the violence, if he knows.  If he doesn't -- 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which comes before the other, the violence or its cause? 
MR. KAPAYA:
You're saying? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If somebody hasn't talked about violence and you ask him the cause of the violence he is going to talk about? 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, he said that there were explosions, grenades, guns, and it was difficult to move around.  You see, they were told to be vigilant, the ******.  I don't know how far I should go with that. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
None of that actually says, "I have seen violence."  That is -- up to now, that is insecurity you're talking about and explosions suggesting violence, of course, but for the witness, to tell him "the violence you witnessed in Kigali," you have to do more.

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, following the death of the president, can you describe to us what was the situation like in Kigali town on the morning of the 7th? 
A.	I told you that before that date, and even on that date itself, I was assigned to *******************.  I was on duty. 

Regarding what may have happened anywhere else, especially on the 8th of April when the Inkotanyi attacked ****************, I was not able to witness other events because from that date I was at this position to defend *************, so I couldn't move about to find out what may have happened inside the city. 
Q.	So it's your testimony that on the 7th, 8th, say up to the 12th, you were not -- you didn't venture into Kigali town.  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	I was not able to venture into the town. 
Q.	So, you talk about Inkotanyi.  What is or who is an Inkotanyi, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Inkotanyi, as I used it, referred to the people against whom we were fighting and who had attacked the *********. 
Q.	And who were these people?  Were they known by some other name apart from Inkotanyi? 
A.	I do not know the other name by which to -- they were referred to, apart from the one that I have just given you. 
Q.	Can we say that the word Inkotanyi is synonymous with RPF? 
A.	Yes, it might be the same thing.
Q.	And can you -- are you in a position to say whether the insecurity that ensued was a result of a war between the RPF and the government of Rwanda?  Are you in a position to say that? 
A.	Are you referring to insecurity?  Under what circumstances?
Q.	Between April, May, and June -- the insecurity that was in the country between April, May, and June, can you say that it was between the RPF, or what you call the Inkotanyi, and the government of Rwanda?  Can you say that? 
A.	Yes, that was my viewpoint, because before this period, before the death of the president, I had not witnessed this absence of security. 
Q.	Sir, is it true that part of the security measures the Rwandan government took was to erect roadblocks in the country? 
MR. SONGA:
Objection, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor.

MR. SONGA:
I believe that the Prosecutor should change this line of questioning because the Defence witness did not say that he was an expert or a political analyst.  He should only be questioned in regard to his own statements. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, this is cross-examination, and he's being asked about events that took place during this period.  What's -- I don't see the basis of your objection.  He's not speaking about any matters for which you need an expert.  If there are roadblocks -- either there were roadblocks or there were no roadblocks.  Is this a matter for which you need an expert? 
MR. SONGA:
I am ready to follow your line of reasoning, Your Honour; however, I know that in the 
examination-in-chief, no mention was made of facts other than those that occurred within ******** ************.  I fail to understand why a person who was within **************** should be questioned in regard to roadblocks in the city of Kigali.  However, as this is your opinion, I shall submit to it. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, can you respond to my question, Mr. Witness, whether part of the security measures taken by the Rwandan government in combatting the violence was to erect roadblocks.
A.	I have always told you that I was assigned to ******************.  If government set up roadblocks, I am not aware of this.  For my part, I was not -- I did not witness any of these roadblocks. 
Q.	You testified a short while ago that you travelled from Kigali and -- from Kigali to Kibuye, and that on the way you went through roadblocks.  Was that not your testimony? 
A.	I stated that from the 5th to the 15th, I was on leave.  In regard to the question of roadblocks, I went past them on my way. 
Q.	Why are you reluctant to admit that there were roadblocks in Rwanda between April, May, and June?  Why, Mr. Witness?  Can you tell us why? 
A.	I am referring to the facts that I witnessed personally when I left ****** for Kibuye. 
Q.	Okay.  From ****** to Kibuye, how many préfectures do you go through? 
A.	There is Kigali, Gitarama, and Kibuye. 
Q.	Is it a fact that in each of these préfectures, there were roadblocks at strategic points? 
A.	I cannot distinguish this strategic point -- or strategic points from points that were not strategic.  I was on the road.  I saw them when I was on the road.
Q.	At what points did you see roadblocks in each of these préfectures?  At what points as you travelled along? 
A.	I found a roadblock in Gitarama and in Kibuye. 
Q.	Is it not a fact that in every commune before you enter, any commune within those préfectures, there is a roadblock? 
A.	I do not know the boundaries of communes.  From Kigali to Kibuye, I have told you about the roadblocks that I saw myself. 
Q.	So it's your testimony that from Kigali to Kibuye, you saw only two roadblocks?
A.	Yes, it is these roadblocks that I came across, because it is at these roadblocks that I was asked for permission. 
Q.	Okay.  Can you tell us the location of the two roadblocks you saw?  Where were they located? 
A.	I told you that I saw one of the roadblocks in Gitarama and the other in Kibuye. 
Q.	Who was manning the roadblock at Gitarama?  Not the person by name, but the -- what type of people? 
A.	Who would I tell you that I saw?  I saw soldiers or people in military uniform, and it can only have been soldiers because they asked me to show my permission or my slip giving me permission to be on leave. 
Q.	Apart from the soldiers, who else was manning the roadblocks? 
A.	I would have told you about these other people if I had seen them. 
Q.	Were these soldiers of the government of Rwanda or were they soldiers of the RPF? 
A.	I was not able to identify them.  I asked them -- I didn't ask them to show me their identity cards; I only showed mine. 
Q.	So according to you, it is possible it was RPF soldiers who were manning those roadblocks? 
A.	I cannot confirm that because I did not ask them to show me their identity cards because it was in fact they who had the right to ask me to show my identity card. 
Q.	Did you see gendarmes at roadblocks? 
A.	How would I have known that?  How would I have known that they were gendarmes or not? 
Q.	Gendarmes have a special uniform, don't they?  And if you see one, you'll know him; you'll know that he's a gendarme from the way he is dressed. 
A.	You probably want to talk about the berets.  I didn't see berets that the gendarmes normally have. 
Q.	So how were --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, *************; is that correct?  Did you see --
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Did you see **************** manning the roadblocks?  That's what you're being asked. 
THE WITNESS:
I told you that I passed by that place and I was asked to show my identity document.  I did not ask them whether they were gendarmes or members of the Rwandan army.  I didn't ask them to show me their own identification papers. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Are you saying that gendarmes don't have a special uniform or attire? 
THE WITNESS:
I am aware that gendarmes and the soldiers or military men wear the same uniforms.  The difference is in the berets they wear. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, can you tell us what happened at the roadblocks as you reached each of the roadblocks?  What procedure was adopted there? 
A.	What I saw is that they asked me to show them my authorisation, which I did. 
Q.	When you talk of authorisation, to which document are you referring to? 
A.	I was asked to show the authorisation for leave, that's my leave authorisation, which is what I did. 
Q.	Were you not asked to show your ID, your identity card? 
A.	Are you asking if I had an identity card?  Rather, I was asked to show my service card; my employment card, as it were. 
Q.	And does the employment card -- what, what particulars are shown on an employment card, on an employment card of the type of -- of the type of work you did? 
A.	Well, my employment card showed that I was ***********. 
Q.	Did you have **********in the car in which you were travelling?
A.	We were ************* 
Q.	Did you ****************** in which you were travelling? 
A.	There were some who remained along the way, but there weren't many of them. 
Q.	Were these people asked to show their IDs at the roadblocks? 
A.	We reached the Gitarama roadblock, and there were ******************* in our car.  They showed their identity cards. 
Q.	Were they allowed to pass, or were they detained at that roadblock? 
A.	They were allowed to pass, and we continued on our way together. 
Q.	Did their IDs show that they were Hutu or did they show that they were Tutsi? 
A.	I did not read their cards to know whether they were of the Tutsi ethnic group or of the Hutu ethnic group.  We didn't have authorisation to do so. 
Q.	****************** you were carrying in your car, were they relatives or they were just people you picked on the way? 
A.	******************** were not our close relatives.  I asked to be taken in a vehicle, just as anybody could do.  When I reached Nyabugogo, I was -- I requested that they take me along, and they accepted. 
Q.	Along your journey from Kigali to Kibuye, did you see any dead bodies on the way? 
A.	I didn't see any.
Q.	So there were absolutely no dead bodies on the road between Kigali and Kibuye? 
A.	I have told you that I didn't see dead bodies on the road during that trip that I took on that date. 
Q.	Now, at the two roadblocks you passed, did you see any people who were detained? 
A.	None.
Q.	Right.  You talked about -- you testified about a person called Mathias a short while ago.  Can you tell us what his surname was? 
A.	I did not know his other name. 
Q.	Did you know where this person ordinarily resided in Kigali? 
A.	He used to reside at Kimihurura.
Q.	The lady Marie Mukeshimana, do you know when he (sic) went to Kigali? 
A.	I don't know when she went there.  I used to see him (sic) coming to Rachelle's place at Kacyiru or when I went to visit my friend who used to live at the presidential camp, a guard, or I would meet her, say, at the bar or at her brother's place in her family. 
Q.	Do you -- are you aware of whether this lady was working anywhere? 
A.	I don't know anything about it. 
Q.	Would you agree if I told you that she was employed at the Mugonero hospital?
A.	I wouldn't accept because I wasn't witness to her working in Mugonero.  I don't know when she worked there, so I can't confirm if she worked there or not. 
Q.	Do you know whether or not she was married? 
A.	I have told you that I used to see her at Rachelle's house at Kacyiru in the Kabagari quarter.  That is where I used to see her when we had the leave of absence in the afternoon to go and take a drink.  I didn't know she was married or not. 
Q.	You testified here that on the 12th of April, you took Marie and Rachelle to Holy Family Church.  Isn't the Holy Family Church right in the middle of Kigali town? 
A.	It is above the Kiyovu quarter before you reach the Radio Rwanda, Radio Rwanda. 
Q.	When you moved from where you were living to the Holy Family Church, isn't it a fact that you traverse across Kigali town, you go through Kigali town? 
A.	You didn't have to cross -- to go across the Kigali town because you crossed Kacyiru and the Kimicanga quarter that I talked to you about.  You go upwards towards Kiyovu and then you get there.
Q.	So on the 12th of April, can you describe the security situation in Kigali town as you went to the Holy Family Church? 
A.	I have told you that on the 12th, my friends and myself accompanied those people, as well as the other group that was with them, and we reached the Kimicanga quarter.  And it is, rather, on the 20th that I was able to reach the Holy Family Church when I was going to Nyamirambo in the company of my friends.
Q.	Mr. Witness, just out of curiosity, what makes you recall this date, the 20th of April?  Why do you particularly recall this date? 
A.	I remember that date because it was on that day that I went there, that I reached the place and that I met my other brother who was living at Nyambubari (phonetic) for the last time -- Nyamirambo, rather.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
What day of the week was it?
THE WITNESS:
Are you asking which day? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Which day of the week was 20th April 1994? 
THE WITNESS:
It was a Wednesday. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, did I hear you say that Marie Mukeshimana was not known as Marie Gafurafura?  Was that your testimony, or I got you wrong? 
A.	I have never heard her called by that name. 
Q.	So are you saying that she was or she was not Marie Gafurafura?
A.	What I know is that she was the daughter of Gafurafura.
Q.	So there was nothing wrong with her being referred to as Marie Gafurafura, that's the name of her father, or Marie Mukeshimana, the name under which she normally went by.  There was nothing wrong, or was there anything wrong with that? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, the witness said he never heard the woman being referred to as Marie Gafurafura.  That's his evidence. 
MR. KAPAYA:
All right. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, before you came to testify here, did you discuss with members of the Defence concerning your -- did you have any discussions concerning your testimony with any members of the Defence? 
A.	Would you please repeat that question? 
Q.	How did you find yourself to be a witness in the Muhimana case?  How did you come to be a witness?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the witness has just mentioned a place where he resides. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, hold on. 

The identifying portion be expunged from the record.

Mr. Witness, do not disclose the name of your residence, please.  Rather, do not disclose any information that would compromise your identity. 
THE WITNESS:
Regarding this question, I met people, including a certain *********** who asked me whether I could come and give evidence before this Tribunal regarding matters concerning a certain Mika, and I told him I was ready to come and give evidence.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, did you tell ************* that you used to visit the residence of Maria Gafurafura between April and June?  Did you tell him that? 
A.	Do you mean that I visited that lady?  No, I did not visit that young lady.  I saw her whenever I went to Rachelle's house. 
Q.	My question was, did you tell ******** that you used to visit the residence of Marie Gafurafura between April and June '94? 
A.	He put that question to me, and my answer to him was that I had seen that person. 
Q.	So if he has written somewhere as -- if he has written that fact as part of the summary of your testimony, would that person be telling the truth?  Would he be correctly reflecting the testimony that you told him you would testify -- you would give before this Tribunal?
A.	I do not know whether ************noted that down somewhere.  What I told him, whether he put it in writing or not, I do not know.  I did not give him many details. 
Q.	And that your reference to Marie was actually Marie Gafurafura and not Marie Mukeshimana, that's what you said.
A.	I stated that it was Marie Mukeshimana.  I knew nothing about Marie Gafurafura.  The only person I knew was Marie Mukeshimana. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honours, I'm referring to the summary of the Defence of this particular witness, TQ8.  In the Defence summaries provided to the Court, there is reference to this particular witness. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yeah, but we must warn you that you can't make too much out of that summary, unless you are able to go into the witness box and make out the summary.  So that although it might say one thing or another, it isn't in any event.  We aren't likely to take into great depth to think about how the name was used, 'cause what it reflects depends very much on what questions and how the questions were put and whoever put that question and made the summary.  And if he is not coming in here as a witness so that we can ask him a few questions about what he was told, we can't make too much out of that summary.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, I agree, Your Honour.  But the first counsel gave the impression that Marie has never been known as Marie Gafurafura, that she's always been Marie Mukeshimana, and that the witness had said that he never made reference to that, so --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The witness has said that he never heard her referred to as Marie Gafurafura, which is quite natural, because if they were close to each other, they would normally not be calling each other by their surnames.  They would probably use their middle names, or whatever it is.  That's perfectly natural.  It is people who don't know each other that tend to use surnames when they refer to others. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Fine, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, Witness --
JUDGE SHORT:
Before you go on. 

Professor Songa, who prepared your Defence summaries?  How were the Defence summaries prepared?  Who was responsible for preparation of these summaries? 
MR. SONGA:
I could answer that question in two ways.  I wrote the summaries in the sense that I signed it, but they were actually prepared by a colleague. 
JUDGE SHORT:
You say a colleague.  What do you mean, an associate? 
MR. SONGA:
I did not actually say colleague, but I meant a collaborator. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And what do you mean by collaborator? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is he a member of the Defence team? 
MR. SONGA:
Exactly, Madam President. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And how did the member of the Defence team that made the summary get that information, directly or through somebody else? 
MR. SONGA:
If you consider the witness as a source, well, then, the information was contained (sic) from the witness.  As for Maria Gafurafura, that name exists in the indictment, and reference is made to that name so that we should see something in line with what is said in the indictment. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I'm asking you general questions.  I'm not referring particularly to Gafurafura.  I just wanted to find out how you came about these summaries, who prepared them, and how they got their information.  Just a general question for my enlightenment. 
MR. SONGA:
We wrote those summaries on the basis of what our investigator came up with. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whether you know where Marie Gafurafura was between the 13th of April to 19th of April, 1994?  Do you know where she was? 
A.	I stated to you that I accompanied her on the 12th.  After that date, I saw her at St. Famille on the 20th. 
Q.	My question is, did you see her between the 13th and 19th?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Kapaya, you want him to change his evidence? 
MR. KAPAYA:
No, Your Honour. 
JUDGE SHORT:
He says --
MR. KAPAYA:
I withdraw that question.
JUDGE SHORT:
He says he accompanied them to cross this valley on the 12th and then left them there and saw her again on the 20th.  That's his evidence.

And, Mr. Witness, is that not the -- is that not your evidence? 
THE WITNESS:
That is indeed what I stated. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Right.  Then let me move on to another area. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	You testified that Kanyabungo had three sons, two of whom were soldiers.  You mentioned one of them is Muhayimana.  Can you tell us the name of the other son of Kanyabungo who was a soldier? 
A.	Since I grew up in Ngoma, I know those persons facially.  I do not very well know their names. 
Q.	Could the other one's name, by any chance, be Alphonse?  Do you recall him being called by that name? 
A.	Alphonse was an (unintelligible) extension officer.
Q.	Can you tell us what -- where Muhayimana was in April 1994? 
A.	I don't know where he was because I did not ******************************.
Q.	Would you know whether -- is it possible that he could have been in Gishyita during April of '94? 
A.	I do not know. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Please go on.  It's only the Bench suffering from heat.  They will survive.
MR. KAPAYA:
Hopefully so, yes.  I would hope so. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, were you in Gishyita commune in April, May '94?  Did you ever visit Gishyita during that period? 
A.	I stated to you that I arrive in Gishyita while I was on leave, and I had obtained leave authorisation on the 16th -- go on leave from the 5th to the 16th of June, 1995 -- 1994.
Q.	Did you see Muhayimana in April '94 in Gishyita or anywhere else? 
A.	How could I have seen him when I wasn't there? 
Q.	He could have come to Kigali to visit you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Maybe he did, Mr. Kapaya  (Overlapping microphones)
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I just want it to go on record that he did submit that it was between April and May.  That was the purpose of my question.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yeah, but he --
MR. KAPAYA:
So I want to know what he was doing.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It's so evident from his evidence that it doesn't need to be asked, but you're free to ask it.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, it's self-evident, then I don't -- I will not follow it up.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Now, in June '94, can you tell us whether the war was over? 
A.	Where precisely?
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Issa, did you ask them to put this one off? 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, please go ahead.
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	I asked you, Mr. Witness, whether in -- at the time you took your leave between -- from the 5th to the 15th of June, '94, I want to know whether the war was over?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
(Overlapping microphones)...the nature of the war you are talking about, Mr. Kapaya, is the one which ended in phases, as parts were overrun.  So if you want the witness to give you useful evidence, ask him before the end of the war with regard to the areas that you are referring to. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Perhaps if I disclose my strategies that he -- he is **********.  How could he be on leave when the war is on? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
But you want --
MR. KAPAYA:
That's what I was leading to.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So he ************ in a country which has not declared war, as such.  It's containing an insurgency, an attack by invaders from wherever it is.  Surely it is unlikely that all their leave would be cancelled, and if it was, you can ask the witness.  He told you he got permission.  Obviously, his squadron leader must have known -- must have felt that he can do without him while he is on leave for that two weeks. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, in June '94, was the war over in Kibuye préfecture? 
A.	I do not know whether there was a war in Kibuye.  I know nothing of the sort. 
Q.	So it's your evidence that the war was never fought in Kibuye.
A.	I am not aware of that.  I was not there. 
Q.	Isn't it a fact that in June when you went to Kibuye, you were sent to Bisesero as a reinforcement for the war against the Tutsi who were hiding in that hills; is that not true? 
A.	That is not why I went to that area.  I went there to visit my parents. 
Q.	But you are aware that during that period there was a serious war waging against the Tutsi who were hiding in the Bisesero hills.  Are you not aware of that? 
A.	No, I am not aware of that.  I went there on leave, with permission, on the 5th.  It was a public holiday.  I was entitled to leave.  I had requested leave on the 10th of April, and when they realised that there was peace in Kigali and that people could go and leave, I renewed my request for leave.  Since there was respite in the army, I did not receive permission, and subsequently I renewed my request, which was granted.  I went there to visit my parents.  I didn't go there on duty. 
Q.	Are you aware that during that period, the government was fighting Tutsi who were -- had sought refuge in the Bisesero hills, just on whether you are aware or not aware of that? 
A.	I was not aware of that.  I did not have any information to that effect. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I wish now to show the witness documents containing names of people and ask him whether he can identify, identify those persons. 
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Witness, do you know that person? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Are you in any way related to him? 
A.	There is no family relationship between myself and that person. 
Q.	Is your father and the father of that person noted, are they direct cousins? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What relationship? 
MR. KAPAYA:
The father of this --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The person appearing on document number one?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, the father of that person and the father of this witness are direct cousins, that is, I'm asking him whether they are not.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So this person appearing on document number one and the witness, they are second cousins --
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
-- would be second cousins?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, that's the information I have. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know because I don't know my family's family tree.  I did not have the opportunity to sit down with our elders to give them an opportunity to explain who is the son of whom, and so on and so forth.  I know nothing about that. 

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Is that the person ***************************? 
A.	Yes, that is the same person. 
MR. KAPAYA:
Your Honour, I have now another document I want to show the witness and ask him whether he knows this person. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, this person, the person you have said you know, is he from -- does he come from the same place that you come from? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, we are from the same secteur, from the same commune. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Same commune.  Do you know your grandfather on the father's side? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not know him. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You don't know the name of your grandfather, your father's father? 
THE WITNESS:
No, I do not know him. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
You don't know him.
THE WITNESS:
By the time I was born, he had already died. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Do you know his name?  I'm not asking whether you saw him.  Has your father ever told you who his father was? 
THE WITNESS:
What I'm telling you is the truth.  That is what I know.  I know nothing about that.  I don't know my grandfather's name. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you know your father's brothers and sisters? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I knew some of them. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you know this -- number one's father? 
THE WITNESS:
Do you mean the father of (By order of the Court, this name as been extracted), the father of (By order of the Court, this name as been extracted)?
JUDGE SHORT:
Don't mention the names, just stick to the numbers. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of --
JUDGE SHORT:
Do you know the name of the father of number one, the name of the person on sheet number one? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know his father. 
JUDGE SHORT:
And is there no relationship between his father and your father? 
THE WITNESS:
No, there is no relationship between his father and my father. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So you deny that the father of the person appearing on document number one was an uncle of your father?
THE WITNESS:
I have stated to you that I know nothing about those family relationships.  What I know is that they were all of my tribe, (By order of the Court, this name as been extracted).  As to whether they were uncles or not, I know nothing about that.
	(Pages 62 to 76 by Diane Hermann)

















	1630H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the tribe mentioned by the witness be expunged from the record. 

Mr. Kapaya, please proceed.
BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Just as a follow-up question to the line of questioning which has been (unintelligible).  Now, aren't your parents and the parents of this person appearing in number 1, are they not neighbours where they live?
A.	Yes, the father of person number 1 lives at the summit of the hill while we live in the valley.  The distance from his house to ours is rather long.
Q.	I have circulated the second name (unintelligible) the second name.  Do you know that person? 
A.	Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name is mentioned on document number 2.  There are two names.
JUDGE SHORT:
One name.
MR. KAPAYA:
It's one name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
"Alias", it says.
JUDGE SHORT:
Given two different ways.
MADAM PRESIDENT:

Q.	Is he related to the person number 1?

Q.	And what is the relationship between number 1 and number 2?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's obvious because --
MR. KAPAYA:
I didn't get the response.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
He said the mothers -- their mothers are sisters.
MR. KAPAYA:
Okay, fine.

Your Honour, for the record, that is prospective Defence witness NM6, NM6, the second name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
NM.
MR. KAPAYA:

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	I'll show you another name --
MR. KAPAYA:
It's the last but one, Your Honours.
BY MR. KAPAYA:

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
I am noting that the names that appear as number 3 -- or the name that appears as number 3 is not the same name as DR2.  If the Prosecutor wishes to indicate whether this is the same person or different persons, I would be grateful, but as such as they appear, I -- they are not the same names. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The difference of one word K in document number 3 is R.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yes, the difference is the last -- the last letter on the second name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, the second --
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The third name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The third letter -- third letter on the first name.
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, it's just typographical error.  The intention is refer to this to DR2.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  We should read it as K?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Then you should show the witness with the correct name -- with the correct spelling. 

MR. KAPAYA:
Maybe I write the name correctly here.

Also write down document number 3.

BY MR. KAPAYA:
Q.	Are you related to Mika in any way?
A.	There is no relationship between us.
Q.	Now, what makes you recall events over ten years ago relating to a person who is not your relative?  How come that you recall issues relating to Mika, who is not your relative, things which happened more than ten years ago?  Why the interest? 
A.	What I said and what I saw at the time where I was, I have no interest in saying it here.  There is no interest on my part in exculpating Mika.

RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SONGA:

A.	Are you referring to brothers from the same father and mother?  I don't know whether my brothers are still alive.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, the interpreter did not hear the -- counsel's question because he spoke when the channel was still occupied.

Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Just one question.  Mr. Witness, you said there is no relationship between you and Mika, but you also say that you have known him since 1983; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
I saw Mika in June of 1994.  I did not say that I did not see him after that.
JUDGE SHORT:
Did you not say in your examination-in-chief, when you were asked whether you know Mika, did you not say that, "I knew him even before 1994, since 1983"? 
THE WITNESS:
That is what I said.  I knew him from 1983 until today.  I know him.  However, I did not state that I saw him in 1993.  Instead, I saw him in 1994 when I was on leave.
JUDGE SHORT:
What has been the relationship between you and Mika since 19 -- 1983?  You said you knew him since '83.  Between '83 and '94, what was the relationship? 
THE WITNESS:
I say that I knew him in 1983 because I used to go and ************ in Gishyita, and I used to meet him in Gishyita.  There were no other relations between us because -- apart from the fact that I saw him at that place.  And in *************************** a centre of the ministry of youth where his younger brother Maharaliel used to teach.  And when I went to Gishyita, I stopped at his place since I knew that he was the elder brother of the director of our centre.  So apart from the fact that I went there as a pupil, we had no other relationship.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have concluded your evidence.  We thank you for your testimony before the Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home. 

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness to the exit door. 
	 (Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's ten to five.  We'll stop for the day and resume tomorrow morning at nine for the next witness. (Court adjourned at 1650H)
