MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  Court is in session now.  May we have the appearances for the Prosecution?
MR. KAPAYA:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon members of the Defence.  The Prosecution today is represented by Ms. Kabasinga; Ms. Madenga; myself, Kapaya; and Mr. Phillips will be here shortly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

May we have the appearance for Defence?
MR. SONGA:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon my learned friends of the Prosecution.  The Defence team is represented by Maîtres Kazadi, Kabimba, 
Mathias Munderere, Sahinkuye and myself, Professor Songa.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This is Witness W?
MR. KAPAYA:
AF, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
AF.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
This is W, Your Honour, sorry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Kapaya, do you think we should first finish with the cross-examination of Witness AF?  Is he available?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
The witness support people they, say that he's on the way.  I don't know how long it takes.  They say in five minutes, perhaps five to ten minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then can we deal with the motion, with the oral motion providing the expert's report, in the meantime?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, we can do that, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Has Professor filed a response to the motion?
MR. KAPAYA:
Yeah, we have seen a copy.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, have you filed your response?
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Madam President, I am confirming it.
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, Professor, can you tell us what is contained in your response?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please, assist the witness out of the box.
	(Witness stood down)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, your response was in French.  You filled an hour -- at 12 noon.  Can you translate it for us, what is there in your response?  We hope that you have accommodated the Prosecutor.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, we followed the usual procedure, which consists in filing the motions as -- just as the reply to the motions sent to the Chamber management.  We should make sure that the various parties receive copies thereof.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, this response was filed about an hour ago, about five minutes past one o'clock.  Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
It was filed about one o'clock, but nevertheless we've got the report.  You can tell us what you want to say.  Make your position, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Thank you, Madam President.  You will give me leave that before I summarise my reply I present my apologies for not having been able to submit and file that reply in the morning.  I am sure that I will have the benefit of your spirit because, as you recall, I had requested it 48 hours, but in order not to disobey you, I did concede that when the President said I should provide the answer in the morning and I think I have spared no effort in seeing that I have filed the reply in time and I would like to appreciate your consideration.  Thank you.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Go on.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you.  Madam President, Your Honours.  I have said, in the introduction to the reply, that the Prosecutor, as he himself recognised, did not comply with the prescriptions of Article 94 bis insofar as the time limits are concerned. 

That said, however, it behoves the Chamber to act in all sovereignty to appreciate if, beyond the level of time limits, we can tackle the substance of the matter.  

Furthermore, in my comments I sought to tackle the qualification of the expert, as well as the substance of the issues that the expert had intended to talk on.  

If we look at the first part, we will recognise that under the curriculum vitae of the expert, insofar as the studies that he has undergone are concerned, we pointed out that the expert in question says that he studied in the faculty of journalism, communication in the university (unintelligible) and in the faculty of human sciences in the Bujumbura University.  However, in the two cases the expert does not say which certificates he obtained at the end of his studies.  This, of course, makes it impossible for us to take a positive decision with respect to the probative value of his testimony.  As concerns --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Interpreter's microphone on)
MR. KAPAYA:
Sorry, you have not received what, ma'am?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
CV.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour, that is noted.  I thought that had been given out right at the beginning of trial, but I'll check up on it.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Prosecutor, have you been able to find out the position?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, that CV was filed at the very beginning of the trial. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In English or French?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
In the only copy that exists, in French.  You ordered us to do so and we did so within the first two days of this trial.  There was an express order from Your Honours for us to file that CV and we did.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Has it been transmitted to the person?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
It's in the progress of being translated.  We should get the English version of it tomorrow, because when I was working on it two days ago I realised that it wasn't in English.  But, again, the availability of that depends on whether or not the process is going to take place or not.  But it is in the process of being translated.  But I know we gave my learned friend the French, the only copy we had, and we also filed it because you asked us to.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, you proceed with your presentation.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President. 

After having mentioned the studies that were made, I was going to talk about the professional experience as seen in the report.  And within the framework of the professional experience some particulars are formulated rather vaguely and unclearly and which throws more confusion than light on the professional experience of the expert. 

I will cite two examples.  In relation to 1986 and '90, where the expert says that he was -- 

I was citing two examples, Madam President, under the professional experience of the expert where he talks about years '86 to '90 and the years during which he said he was responsible for public relations in the Burundi Catholic Bishopry.  And that reference is certainly incorrect and confusing because Burundi has at least seven Catholic dioceses and they are Burundi, Bujumbura.
	Gatega, Muhinga, Mabanza and Ruhege.  The question that arises would be to know which diocese was concerned when the expert claims to have been responsible for public relations in the diocese of Burundi.  

Similarly, the expert refers to the years 1999 and 2004 and contends that during that period he was a paralegalist.  Although we hold a PAG in law, we found it difficult to understand which experience -- which professional experience could be represented by the term paralegal expert. 

With respect to refresher courses and training, which we still find in the curriculum vitae of the expert, the expert does not mention the institution that trained him.  This is also a situation that does not enable the Accused to be adequately informed on the quality of the training as well as the professional qualifications of the expert.  

And finally, and this doesn't appear in the written document that I have just filed, but it comes to my mind that the expert does not mention any publication that he would have made throughout his life in the area he claims to be expert in. 

The second part, Madam President, Your Honours, is devoted to the report itself.  With regard to the expert's report, I made a distinction between the comments with respect to form and comments on the substance.  

Insofar as form is concerned, Madam President, and this is what surprised me the most, is the very shortness of the report, because it comprises only five pages.  And this report is so drafted that no reference is made to the sources that the expert consulted.  And in this report there is no indication as to the bibliography or authorities.  

Still insofar as the form is concerned, the work plan contains portions which do not deal with the issues mentioned or which deal with issues that are not mentioned in the outline or yet still which deal with the issues that have already been addressed or which will be addressed once again in other parts. 

This -- an illustration of this will be found in the second, the third and the fourth parts of that report. 

Still insofar as form is concerned, the French version of the report -- and I don't know if it is the authors -- has very many errors.  I don't know if these errors are attributable to the author.  So far as I am concerned, the expert report has neither introduction nor a conclusion.  And this does not, of course, reflect the level of the report that should be produced by an expert. 

Madam President, Your Honours, I will now address the substance itself.  The work of the expert seems to be divided into four parts and these four parts, when you scrutinize them, have unclear headings because some are confused one in another.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Just a moment, please. 
 JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, before you -- we seem to be dealing with the substance of the report and I think that's a problem for sure.  The issue -- the area which we would like you to address is whether you would be willing, you would be accommodating the Prosecutor and have this witness come in spite of the shortage of the time within which you have had the report.  We are able to deal with that issue, if we, in fact, find you accommodate the Prosecutor; or if we overrule your objection then you will have the issue of addressing the contents of the report, if the report is allowed to come in.  The substance of what you have said up to now is based on dealing with whether the report is or is not an expert report, or the competence of the expert to prepare the report, which, of course, are valid arguments but they are not yet -- you haven't reached the area.  What we would ask you to address is whether you would be responding in the positive or the negative to the request made by the Prosecutor, which is that this witness be called tomorrow, even though you have not received the notice that the Statute or the Rules require you to get the report. 

Professor, have you understood my comment?
MR. SONGA:
I have understood you very well, Your Honour.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Perhaps you can respond, then.
MR. SONGA:
I would like to request your Honourable Chamber to reject the appearance of the expert, since the motion was filed belatedly under the Rule 94 bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Mr. Prosecutor, you have heard your colleague is not accommodating your deficiency in time.  Do you have anything to say?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  I have indeed had advance notice of my learned friend's position on this matter.  I had always been of the view that as far as the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of this Tribunal was concerned, it was not mandated for an expert to have a report prior to his or her testimony.  However, having looked at the provisions of Rule 94 bis, it doesn't provide us with such latitude.  There have been instances in this Tribunal where experts have testified without providing reports but it would seem as if 94 bis implies that a full statement has to be provided.  

What 94 bis does not deal with is whether or not you are barred from testifying as an expert, whether or not you provide a full statement.  And of course, I'm in Your Honours' hands in relation to that matter. 

Where the full statement does, indeed, exist as it seems to in this case, and it is the report which has been provided is just a mere indication of the matters that will be covered by the expert witness in this matter, it would seem as though that it falls within the ambient of Rule 94 bis and that's why I considered last week that that was, indeed, Your Honours' understanding of our obligations, and we are in breach of those obligations. 

However, if Your Honours take the view that there is no requirement for a report prior to the testimony of an expert, then we're not in breach.  Now, I would make the following representations to Your Honours that 94 bis(A)has to be read in conjunction with the provisions of 94 bis(B) and (C) and in that regard I would represent to Your Honours that the purpose behind 94 bis (A), (B) and (C) is, indeed, the ability of the Trial Chamber to decipher whether there is actually a need to call an expert witness to testify in a trial or whether or not the statement of an expert witness, if it so exists, can be admitted in lieu of calling such a witness.  

Whether or not that provision actually then extends to the situations when experts don't have reports is a matter that is not explicitly provided by the rules.  

So our humble submission is the following: If Your Honours take the view that 94 bis requires the mandatory presentation of an expert report prior to such testimony being provided before your Court, then we are clearly in breach of that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But you have filed the expert report.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Not in time.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We filed the expert report and we have not filed it according to the provisions of 94 bis, but the issue then is does the -- our respectful submission -- does the lack of due filing or filing on time prevent us from calling the expert?  If you read 94 bis it would seem so.  But then what I'm asking Your Honours to consider is what if the expert report does not exist, what if an expert does not have a report or does 94 bis say every expert must have a report.  There have been incidences in this Tribunal in the Rutaganda case, at least, where an expert did not file a report in advance and he or she was allowed to testify.  

Therefore it would be as I applied in my pre-trial brief, I am going to have an expert to testify on A, B, C, D does it constitute to Your Honours as it does for any other witness or is it mandatory in Your Honours respectful opinion that every witness expert must have a report?

If you take the view I must do, then I am in breach of my obligation.  And there is no doubt of that, according to 94(B) but if you take the view I don't have to have a report then I am not in breach of my obligations calling the expert tomorrow.  Now, in relation to --
JUDGE SHORT:
Now, let's look at this.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Sorry, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
94 bis requires you to file the statement of any expert witness, and let's not get into semantics about reports or statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes.
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.  So that even if the witness is not expected to file a report, as you describe it, 94 bis requires you to file the full statement of any expert witness -- and this witness you are calling is supposed to be an expert witness -- not less than 21 days prior to the date when the expert is expected to testify.  That's what 94 bis says.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's how I read it, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
And what you have submitted is a statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
And is in breach of the provisions.
JUDGE SHORT:
Is in breach of the provisions.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Undoubtedly, Your Honour.
JUDGE SHORT:
So what's your provision then?  Are you saying that -- since you admit that you have contravened 94 bis and your opponent is not willing to accommodate you, what is your position?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Well our position is the following.  The rationale behind indicating to Your Honours in the pre-trial brief and at the pre-trial stage that we would call an expert witness was to help Your Honours understand the difficulties and the trauma that many of the witnesses, the first ten or eleven witnesses we produced, in this Court may have faced following their experiences during the genocide.  It was a contingency, should the case of those witnesses, for some reason, did not come up to proof or that Your Honours needed a little bit more explanation as to the difficulties they had in providing their testimony.  Having presented those witnesses, I can honestly tell Your Honours that I have no doubt that the evidence is up to proof.  

The issue then remains, what use would be the expert to this proceeding?  The expert, in my respectful position, would not only assist the Prosecution but would assist Your Honours in understanding the general context in which those rapes were caused and the cultural significance of rape to the Rwandan woman.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Phillips, that's not what we're talking about at the moment.  It may well be so that the report or the evidence of the expert may assist the Prosecution, the Defence, and the Court.  But my point is, having acknowledged that you are in breach of 94 (B) you have two options, either you wait for the 21 days to elapse, then call the witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
That's what I was talking about, Your Honour.

JUDGE SHORT:
If you still want to call the witness, you see, or maybe you would want to address us on whether non-compliance -- in spite of the non-compliance under Rule 5, you may still want this Court to make an order as to whether the witness can be called earlier than the 21 days.  But, you know, you must indicate what your position is.  Either you withdraw the witness, you withdraw your intention to call the witness, or you wait for the 21 days to elapse, or maybe argue that non-compliance of this rule has not caused prejudice to the Defence.  But you must the state what your position is so we know what to do from here.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, I'm grateful for that and that's where we were coming to.  That's why we set out our position as to why we decided to call the witness in the first place. 

Now, the issue is that we are at the end of the trial and we have clearly breached our obligation under 94 bis.  I make no bones about that.  I've always said that. The issue would determine whether or not we decide to ask you for an extension of time within which to present this expert or, indeed, close this case tomorrow would depend on the use of that expert.  

Now, that's why I started off with the background saying that this was the premise under which I listed this expert.  I have now looked at the position.  I have reassessed the position.  And I feel that, yes, Your Honours may or may not require further elucidation in relation to the background and the effects of the testimony you've heard on the witnesses that provided that testimony. 

Now, we have taken the view that that expert is not only of use to us but to this Court.  And even if it is to be called as a Court witness, she would still provide significant testimony to Your Honours.  And in that regard, I would be asking Your Honours to postpone the proceedings to accommodate our obligations under Rule 94 bis and call this expert at a later stage, rather than have her stand down at this stage.  

I suffer no prejudice if I her stand down.  And I really have to be up front about that.  As the Prosecution team we suffer no direct prejudice if we stand her down.  But in the interest of justice, and to further assist this Court, just like the investigator did, in understanding the reasons why certain witnesses would have had practical difficulties providing their testimony, and, indeed, the general context of what women in Rwanda went through and the cultural difficulties for them, I would recommend to this Trial Chamber that you accommodate the evidence of that expert, at your earliest convenience.  And that is really as far as we can go. 

In relation to the matter as to whether or not we can waive the requirement of 21 days, we cannot.  That's my reading of it.  I've always said that, and that's why I looked to my learned friend to accommodate me.  But if he cannot, it is his right.  We cannot take that right away from him.  He has 21 days, that's my understanding of the Rule, and I have to concede to that.  Through no fault of our own, we have breached that Rule, and if Your Honours decide that I close my case tomorrow, I will close the case, without prejudice.  But I would recommend that Your Honours listen.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is it for you to decide to close your case tomorrow or not?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I've just said I would recommend that Your Honours make provision at some future date to listen to the testimony of the expert witness.  This is -- the substance of my proposal is we are not sure whether Your Honours are mindful of granting my learned friend's request for an adjournment before he starts his case.  If you are mindful of granting that adjournment, then I would not be asking that the expert be recalled, if you are minded to grant my request that you grant her testimony.  I would not be requesting that you recall her specifically to hear her testimony.  What I would say is that if you grant them the adjournment, then we arrange it in such a way when we reconvene for the Defence case.  Perhaps we can put the expert witness on for a half day, you can take her testimony then, and we deal with it then, rather than asking to convene in two weeks or three weeks.  That's what I'm trying to avoid with this 21 day business.  I'm clearly in breach of that, but if Your Honours are mindful of my request, then we can deal with it in the next session, unless I can help Your Honours with anything else that is my submission. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Songa, this response which you have filed on that 94 bis(B), you are required within 14 days of filing of the statement of the expert witness to file a notice to the Trial Chamber indicating, one, whether you accept or you do not accept the witness qualifications as an expert, right; whether you accept the expert statement or whether you wish to cross-examine the expert witness.  Have you done that?  Or the response that you have filed is in line with 94 bis?  

Two, do you want us to accept your response as in compliance with 94 bis(B)?
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I confirm that the response is in line with Rule 94 bis(B) in the sense that our response states that we do not accept the qualification of the witness as an expert, and we give our reasoned opinion.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor?
MR. SONGA:
Yes.

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
If we were to proceed, as suggested by the Prosecutor, that is to defer the taking of this evidence by this expert until after the break, would you suffer?  Would you object to that or would you suffer any prejudice?
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, I would like to determine to see whether I understood you clearly.  Is it at the end of the Prosecution evidence or at the end of the Defence evidence?
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Before the beginning of the Defence evidence.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Before the Defence evidence is coming on.
JUDGE SHORT:
Let me make the question clear, of, suppose, after hearing the two witnesses of fact that we are to hear now we were to direct the expert witness cannot be taken at this time for the reason that the notice (unintelligible) was not granted but that we will leave the Prosecution's case technically open for that particular witness to testify before the commencement of the Defence case.  Would you suffer any prejudice?  Would you have any objection to that position?
MR. SONGA:
I do not believe so, Your Honour.  However, I hope that the Prosecution document based on which we worked will remain the same; that is the curriculum vitae and the report that we received.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
After deliberation, we have decided that this witness would be called at the -- before the beginning of Defence evidence, and when the witness is in the witness box, Defence counsel will be at liberty to dispute the qualification of the expert.
JUDGE SHORT:
Can we have a response from you both?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Your witness, expert witness, would be called to the witness box before the Defence evidence.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we are grateful for that indulgence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And at that time the witness is in the witness box the Defence would be at liberty to dispute the qualifications of the witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, yes.  We may just draw your attention to the guideline on the rules for the remuneration of an expert witness which provides us with a definition under Article 1 of an expert witness.  It's on page 4 of your rule book, and it might be interesting to see how the Tribunal sees an expert witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will do that at the appropriate time. 

Now, Witness AF is available, has he come?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
They are both available, AF and W.   Would you like to take AF?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
AF, please, call the witness AF.  

Yes, Professor.
MR. SONGA:
Excuse me, Madam President.  You asked whether the parties had any reaction to your decision.  The Prosecution reacted but the Defence didn't.  May I say a few words?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. SONGA:
This is just to remind the Chamber that in one of my statements I said, in answer to a question by the Honourable Judge, that if the expert witness has to appear subsequently, we should make sure the document tendered by the Prosecutor remains as it is.  I didn't hear the Chamber's response on that matter.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
There is no response on that, Professor.  The report which is before us and for which we can make a decision is the one which is now filed.  Any other report that may be filed will be dealt with even when it is filed, but for now the report for which the decision and the ruling has been made is a report filed before the Chamber at the present moment, and the witness is a witness who is the owner of that report.  That is all that the Chamber can say at the present moment.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  Can you hear me? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am hearing you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are reminded of the oath you have taken to speak the truth.  

Professor, you have the floor for remaining cross-examination.

MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
WITNESS AF
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	My first question to you, Witness, is still related to the date of 14th April 1994.  When 
Bourgmestre Sikubwabo promised or threatened to kill all Tutsis who are fugitives and had assembled in the church, you stated that after hearing what he said you decided not to flee because you didn't know where you could go to, to be safe.  Is that correct?
A.	I stated to you, that after hearing Sikubwabo's statement I remained inside the church with other people who were with me.
Q.	You state that at midnight the girls who had remained in the rooms of the parish were raped; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is what happened on the night of the 14th of April, 1994.  The girls who remained in the rooms of the priest were raped and the others were killed atrociously; they were actually slaughtered with machetes.
Q.	How many girls were in the rooms?
A.	I did not count the number of girls in those rooms.
Q.	Can we say that there were many of them, a few of them?
A.	I never took stock of the number of girls who had sought refuge in those rooms, but there were many of them.
Q.	What proportion of those girls were crucified after having been raped?
A.	I did not have the opportunity to do an estimate of the proportion.  I stated to you that one of the victims who was raped was cut up with machetes and she spoke to us explaining the fate that she had been subjected to.
Q.	That girl who gave you the information, was she among those who were thrown in the banana plantation?
A.	Yes, she was thrown in the banana plantation that was opposite the church.
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, the distance between the church and the banana plantation?
A.	I did not measure that distance, but for those who know Mubuga Catholic Church, the centre door, which I mentioned earlier, is opposite the road leading to the presbytery.  When you are in front of that door, you see that road, and that was where the banana plantation was situated.  However, I did not measure that distance because, as far as I was concerned, it was not necessary.
Q.	Would you be in a position to tell the Chamber today what that distance was, roughly?
A.	As far as I'm concerned, it is difficult to give estimates of that distance, because it would require that I should be present on the scene in front of the church.  I stated to you that when you are standing in front of the central door, you can see the banana plantation.  As to the distance separating the two locations, I would be running the risk of going wrong, because I did not measure that distance.
Q.	Is that your answer to all questions relating to distances or is there a particular distance that you can give with some degree of accuracy?
A.	I stated to you that an exact answer can only be given after the distance would have been measured.  If you get to that location and see the location, you would be able to give that distance.  But if you do not measure that distance, and you've not been there, you run the risk of going wrong.
Q.	Witness, that person who informed you, where did you meet him or her?
A.	In that banana plantation opposite the church.
Q.	In concrete terms, you left the church to go into the banana plantation?
A.	It doesn't mean that I left the church to go into the banana plantation.  The fact of the matter is that after the assailants left, we could get out of the church to find out whether there weren't any Interahamwe in the vicinity.  It is under those circumstances that I met that person and I spoke with that person before she died.
Q.	Was that during the day or at night?
A.	It was in the evening.  Night hadn't fallen yet.
Q.	Let us try to sum up what you've said.  Those girls were raped at about midnight and the girl who informed you informed you in the evening.  That must have been the following day, then?
A.	Yes, that was the following day, the 15th, after the attack launched by Mika and his companions on the church.
Q.	Witness, you stated awhile ago that after the assailants left you went out to monitor the situation.  When did the assailants, the same assailants who had raped the girls at night at the church leave the scene?
A.	I believe you're mixing up things here.  I stated that those girls were raped on the night of the 14th of April 1994, and after that Mika and the other assailants launched the attack on the church in the morning of the 15th of April.  If you ask me when those who raped the girls left the scene, I wouldn't be in a position to answer that question because I was not with the girls.  I stated the circumstances over which we learnt what had happened to those girls. 

If you want more precise information on that, you should ask Mika.  He is the one who knows the hour when they left the scene.  What I remember is that they returned to the church on the 15th, in the morning.
Q.	Very well, then, Witness.  When you make mention of Mika, was he one of those who raped the girls in the rooms of Mubuga parish at midnight?
A.	I stated to you that when they attacked those in those rooms on the 14th, the night of the 14th, some of the assailants had come earlier to loot the property in the presbytery and among the looters was Mika, Sikubwabo, Vincent and the others.  They came to loot the property and the food that 	
Father Marcel had refused to give the refugees.  That is proof that they had no pity for the people inside the church. 

Secondly, when they were opposite the church that is Mika accompanied by Sikubwabo, when Sikubwabo said they were going to seal the fate of the refugees inside the church, Mika did not oppose Sikubwabo's plans.  It would therefore appear to the public they were friends, they were together.   

We should also bear in mind that the morning of the 15th of April, when the attack was launched on the church, Mika was present.  You can, therefore, establish the link.  So during the looting Mika was present and he, indeed, had the intention of exterminating the people who were inside the church.  But if you were to ask me whether I saw him, I would state to you that I was not present.  I have already informed you that we were told of what had happened to the girls, and it was one of the girls who had been thrown in the banana plantation who informed us.  If you want to know what Mika did, and if you were to ask me what I witnessed with my own eyes, I would say that was the attack of the 15th of April 1994. That was what I saw with my own eyes.
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

Who is Claudine?
A.	Claudine was the girl who was raped and thrown in the banana plantation opposite the church.
Q.	What was her surname?
A.	I only knew that first name, because that was the name we used.
Q.	When did you know her, Witness?
A.	I believe I gave you the answer to that question.  I said that I knew that girl when she was a student, and I had known her earlier in Mubuga because that is where she used to go to pray, just like myself.
Q.	Did you know her parents?
A.	Her parents were dead.
Q.	Did you know her before they died?
A.	I did not know her father, but before her death I saw -- before his death, I saw her mother.
Q.	Did she have brothers?
A.	Yes, she had brothers.
Q.	How many brothers?
A.	I do not know the number of brothers she had.  I only know one of them who studied with us.
Q.	Did she have sisters?
A.	Yes, she had.
Q.	How many?
A.	I do not know the number.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We are still dealing with the 15th of April.  You've made mention of a gang composed of the conseillers Mika, Vincent, Mugwa, Ryandikayo, gendarmes, Sikubwabo, a gang, you saw arrive at 6 a.m. at the church; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  That gang also consisted of many other youngsters.  That gang attacked the refugees who were in Mubuga church in the morning of the 15th of April.
Q.	Why do you call those people a gang?
A.	I call them a gang because they were composed of criminals.
Q.	Did you take note of the number of people you saw attack at 6 a.m.?  Who attacked the church at 
6 a.m.?
A.	I think I answered that question yesterday.  In view of the way they rushed at the church, and the fact that that was in the morning, nobody could have had the idea of making a tally of the number.  All we knew was that there were many of them.  Given the construction of the church, they were numerous because they circled the entire church.  What I noticed was that they were coming to kill all of us.
Q.	Were they wearing any particular kind of clothes, Witness?
A.	They were wearing different kinds of clothes, some were in civilian clothes, while others were in military uniform.  There were even some youngsters who were wearing banana leaves.
Q.	And those in civilian attire, Witness, were those clothes uniforms?
A.	I would like to point out to you that, as regards their attire, I did not have the time to properly observe in order to ascertain the attire they were wearing.  In view of the situation that was prevailing at the time, it was not possible to see the clothes they were wearing exactly.  What we observed was that when they got to the church, they would try to smash in the doors of the church, and that is what we noticed.  As regards the clothes worn by the military or civilians, they were wearing all kinds of clothes, and it isn't possible to say that such-and-such a group was dressed in this particular way or the other because they were wearing different kinds of clothes.
Q.	How was Mika dressed?
A.	Mika was in military uniform, and in Bisesero, when I saw him again, he was still wearing a military uniform; same with Sikubwabo.
Q.	Do you remember the colour of his cap?
A.	I don't recall the colour of his cap.  What I do remember is that he was wearing a military outfit that was different from civilian clothing.
Q.	Do you also state that, Mr. Witness, that you organised a resistance?  Can you tell us about this resistance?  How was it organised?
A.	As I said yesterday, we refused to be killed atrociously.  Those killers intended to break open the doors of the church to find us inside and to cut us up using machetes.  They also had, you know, axes, they had clubs and other traditional weapons they wanted to use to kill us.  And when we realised that we were going to be killed ruthlessly, we tried to prevent them from doing so.  We tried to prevent them from breaking open -- forcing open the doors to the church, and so they decided to use grenades.  And that is how we took bricks that were on the walls of the church and that is what we took to use to defend ourselves and to stop them from coming to meet us inside the church and to torture us therein.
Q.	Those bricks of the church walls; did they form part of the church building or were they bricks that were heaped somewhere?
A.	I explained this to you yesterday, that the wall of the church -- at the far end of the church wall, there were bricks that were not bonded with the cement, and these were the bricks that we used to defend ourselves.
Q.	Please, explain a little bit how these bricks were detached.  Is it that the wall was beginning to collapse or to be destroyed?
A.	No, the church wasn't being destroyed yet.  I think I explained this.  I said that at the far end of the church walls, there were bricks.  I am not the one who built that church.  I am telling you how we found the church.  We realised that the bricks didn't bond with the cement and, therefore, we used them.
Q.	Did you succeed to move them with your own hands?
A.	I told you that those bricks were not bonded with the wall or with the cement.  It was at the far end of the wall, that is at the top of the wall, and that is how we removed those bricks with our own hands.  Thank you.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You state that you locked the doors.  Can you tell us about how you locked the church doors?
A.	Well, it was magic.  They locked it just as the doors were locked when there was no war.  We, therefore, were able to lock them up and somebody couldn't open them from outside.  We did this as it was customary to do.
Q.	Did you have keys?
A.	We had keys.
Q.	Who had handed them over to you?
A.	I don't know who had given those keys.  I arrived and I found refugees and I did not ask how or who had given them the keys.  Probably it might have been the reverend fathers themselves or probably the person who was responsible for locking up the church.  The fact is, when I arrived those who were inside the church already had the keys with them.
Q.	Were the assailants able to enter the church?
A.	The assailants of the 15th of April, in the morning, were unable to enter the church.
Q.	When did they succeed to enter the church?
A.	I was not in the church when they entered but I heard that on the 17th of April they succeeded in breaking open the doors of the church, and, therefore, entered the church and exterminated the people who were inside that church.
Q.	On that day of 15th April, what was the duration of the assault?
A.	The attack lasted for a long time, because it ended in the afternoon at an hour I cannot recall, and people had like lost their minds.
Q.	When, Mr. Witness, you say that this stopped in the afternoon, did you see the assailants leave or go away?
A.	If they didn't go away, I wouldn't have said that they went away.  So the attack ended and they went away.
Q.	Were you able to count the dead when the assailants went away?
A.	I was unable to count them, but there were many corpses that were victims of the grenade explosions, of bullets, as well as victims who had died from suffocation because there were very many people and the people were jostling with each one another; tear gas was also thrown in there, and I must say the church was full of corpses.
Q.	Did you recognise any of them?
A.	Yes, there were even members of my family who had taken refuge there and who were found there.  They died during that attack.
Q.	Without giving us their names, who are the members of your family that you met there?
A.	There were my maternal and paternal aunts, there was my cousin's wife, and other persons that I knew who were not close relatives and whom I found inside the Mubuga church where they had taken refuge.
Q.	Of those victims that you knew, whom could you say were killed by this or that assailant?
A.	It would be very difficult to say who killed whom.  The killers had guns, they had grenades, and when they were shooting at us and when they were throwing the grenades it was difficult to know exactly who had shot the gun and who had just thrown the grenade, but we could see those who were throwing those grenades and shooting at, in any case.  They were not shooting rubber bullets.  They were real bullets designed to kill.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  After the assailants went away, what did you do?
A.	After they had left, in the night of 15 April, I was able to leave the church and I went away.
Q.	Where did you go, Mr. Witness?
A.	I left the church.  I was accompanied by a few refugees, and one of my companions suggested that we cross the Nyumgwe forest to go to Burundi, but in the morning we were still at Bisesero and those who had taken refuge there told us that there was nowhere to hide, so we joined them and we remained there until the French came.
Q.	Who did you see at Bisesero?
A.	There I found other Tutsi refugees.
Q.	Were there Mubuga assailants that you recognised there?
A.	They came often.
Q.	I do not know if I have asked you this question, but which is the hill to which you went?
A.	I told you that we went during the night of the 15th and we arrived at Bisesero on the morning of the 16th.  With respect to the place we first of all reached, I think I recall that we hid in a valley where there was a (unintelligible), but I don't know the name of that place and where we were hiding at Bisesero.  We still had intention to wait for nightfall to continue our journey right up to Burundi.
Q.	Mr. Witness, where were you on the 13th of May 1994?
A.	On the 13th of May 1994 you are asking me where I was.  I was at many places.  In the Bisesero region I found myself in different places, because during that period there were attacks that were being launched against us and compelled us to keep moving.  But I can give you a number of places. 

At the beginning of the attack I was on the Muyira hill and that is where the assailants found me.
Q.	Did you spend the entire day in Muyira?
A.	No, I did not remain at Muyira the whole day.  I said that there were attacks that were making us go to different places while the assailants were killing people.
Q.	Which weapons did you see on the 13th of May?
A.	In whose hands and where?
Q.	We are on the 13th of May, you are at Muyira, and you were seeing assailants come.  Were you able to assess the type of weapons that they were carrying on that day?
A.	With respect to the weapons that the assailants were carrying, I am not a specialist of military weaponry to know which type of weapon was in the hands of the assailants, but I can tell you that the assailants had guns that they were using to shoot us.  We also noted that the assailants were also using grenades to attack us.  There were also other assailants who were carrying clubs that were embedded with nails, others with swords and long knives, others with stakes and all kinds of weapons.
Q.	You also state, Mr. Witness, that even dogs were used to chase you?
A.	Listen, assailants used all kinds of arms.  They also used dogs to chase us in the valleys where we were hiding.  Their goal was said to chase, search, and kill, and they used all the means available.
Q.	Thank you.  In your statement you talked of a certain Gorate Mukongoga (phonetic).  Does that name ring a bell?
A.	Yes, that name rings a bell.
Q.	And what does it remind you?
A.	That was the name of a person that I knew and who was with me during that period but who, unfortunately, was killed.
Q.	Who killed her?
A.	She was killed by a certain Musema.
Q.	Thank you.  You also talked to us about Sikubwabo's child (phonetic).  Under what circumstances did you see him in the month of May?
A.	In the month of May I saw him in the attacks that came to kill Tutsis at Bisesero, in particular in attacks that originated from Gishyita, given that Sikubwabo and Mika came from Gishyita and they were both leading the attacks coming from Gishyita.
Q.	You also talked in your statement of a businessman called Kabanda.  Does that name mean a thing to you?
A.	I know that businessman.
Q.	What happened to him during the events?
A.	He was killed.
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber who killed him?
A.	It is Sikubwabo who shot at him in collaboration with Mika, who was with Sikubwabo then.
Q.	Can you explain to this Court how Mika collaborated with Sikubwabo to shoot at Kabanda?
A.	As concerns that collaboration, that wasn't the first time they were collaborating, as I said.  Mika and Sikubwabo, in Kinyarwanda it is said that if you see a leopard, the tiger is not far.  Mika and Sikubwabo were always together as if they were wedded to one another.  When they flushed out the trader called Kabanda, they shouted and the people shouted, "There he is, he's the one.  We have found him."  Those assailants tried to look for people in their hiding places, and when they discovered Kabanda, he tried to flee.  It is Sikubwabo who shot Kabanda first when the assailants shouted, and if I say that he collaborated with Mika, it was because when Kabanda was flushed out, everyone started shooting at him.  But Interahamwe who were with the assailants said, "There, it is Kabanda."  They were even waiting for him, and they noted the bravery of Sikubwabo because he used to be a soldier. But Mika also shot at Kabanda and they said immediately that the head, he should be beheaded so his head can be shown to Kayishema, so that probably Kayishema should say, "Hey, they have killed a very important person."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Were you eyewitness to the killing of Kabanda?
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Honourable Judges, when Kabanda was killed, I was a witness of that, because I was hiding somewhere and the assailants were looking for people, and when they discovered him and when they shot at him, up to the point he fell, I was witness to all of the above.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you see Sikubwabo and Mika firing at Kabanda?
THE WITNESS:
I saw them because, after having discovered him the Interahamwe were the people who were armed with guns, others with traditional weapons, and when those Interahamwe shouted, "Sikubwabo," and Mika should shoot," and I was seeing them, when they shot.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you see whose shot was effective?

THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, as to who effectively - as to who's going to effectively kill Kabanda is difficult to say because it is everybody who shot at Kabanda because they didn't want him to escape.  So people acted in a hurry because they didn't want Kabanda to escape from them and they knew that if Kabanda escaped it would be a major failure, because that was somebody they had been looking for a long time.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Songa, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when one listens to you keenly, you seem to be saying that several persons shot at Kabanda but that people were saying that it was Sikubwabo who said he did, because he was bragging about his courage.
A.	I told you that when Kabanda was discovered -- Kabanda was a trader, Mika knows this very well, he was his neighbour at the Gishyita centre.  Kabanda was a popular trader to the extent that from the very beginning of the genocide people started looking for Kabanda.  Mika and Sikubwabo hated Kabanda a lot in the centre where he was doing his business, so when they discovered him, immediately the Interahamwe shouted, "Yes, it is Kabanda."  So they shouted and those who were holding guns and from what I saw on the 15th when they attacked the church there were people that I knew very well, it wasn't the first time that I was seeing them, so immediately Kabanda was discovered, they shot at him and people tried to stop him from escaping.  If it's as to whether it is, Sikubwabo or Mika, who shot at him first, I don't know.  But what is clear is that both of them shot at him, and he fell.

1600H
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	I would like to read your statement on page 7 of the French version, and you will tell us if what you are telling us now reflects that portion of your statement, and this is the passage: "This is how I saw Sikubwabo, Charles, shoot at the trader, Kabanda, Assiel, of Gishyita, in the month of June 1994.  He then ordered his militia to cut off the head of the victim, so that he can show it to the préfet, Kayishema, in order to receive his reward, because that gentleman was very much sought after.  I also saw him kill Muganga.  The bourgmestre, Sikubwabo, even shot at him and he lost part of his finger."  

Now, what you are testifying before this Chamber, and this passage of your statement, are they the same versions?
A.	The excerpt that you have just read is not different from what I have just said, but I would like to further explain what happened so that everyone should understand me well.  As concerns the declaration that -- the statement, an excerpt of which you have just read, those instances or those moments that I went through at Bisesero cannot be summarised in nine pages of a statement.  When we were making a statement, it was on the basis of the questions that we were asked.  It is possible that when I gave the answer that you asked me, questions were being asked concerning Sikubwabo, and I think that is the important -- that is why it is important to have people come and testify, so that they can explain what they meant.  Now, have you said somewhere in that statement where I have stated that Mika wasn't present somewhere?  

Probably there is a problem that might have been created by the way the witness was led by the investigators, because they asked only questions that were of interest to them.  Now, since you have asked a question concerning the responsibility of Mika during the genocide, if I have to explain things in detail, I think that I will rather be compelled to write a book of about a thousand pages or to stay in this witness box for more than a week.  I think there is no incoherence here.  I think that is why people are required to come here to explain themselves.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Witness, don't write a book.  In fact, you will do your best to help if you respond briefly to the questions that are put to you.  Giving long stories always tends to confuse the evidence.  Please answer the question.  If you don't understand it, ask for the question to be repeated again, and then give a brief answer of that question when you can.  Don't elaborate on answers.  That does not help your evidence.
MR. SONGA:
May I proceed, Your Honour?

JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Yes, Professor. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would also like to draw your attention to the transcript in the Kayishema and Ruzindana trial where you gave testimony on 3rd of March 1998.
MR. SONGA:
With your leave, Madam President, I would like to verify whether I have the right documents that I can submit.  

Madam President, once more I'm going to have to crave your indulgence because I have only the French version.  However, we promise to provide other versions in due course.  I would just like to quote a passage which is not longer than a page of the transcript.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor, please proceed.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	A question is put to you, Mr. Witness, "Kabanda, did you know him?"  Your answer, "He was killed."  Question: "Do you know how he was killed?"  Answer: "Yes, I know."  Question: "Could you please tell us?"  Answer: "Kabanda was killed in June.  The assailants were going back.  It was in the evening.  He had come out from his hideout thinking that the assailants had left.  Then the assailants, who were with Sikubwabo, bourgmestre of Gishyita, when these assailants saw him, saw Kabanda, they shouted, 'Kabanda, here is Kabanda, here is Kabanda.'  Then it is bourgmestre Sikubwabo who had a reputation as a sharpshooter who shot at him, so he fell."  

Mr. Witness, this is the passage which, in our view, contradicts your statements before this Court and confirms the written statement whose passage we have read out to you.  Do you have any comment on that?
A.	Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  I do not see any contradiction at all.  Actually, it provides supplementary information to my previous statement.
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, you stated a while ago that the answers that you gave to the investigators depended on the orientation that was given by these investigators.  It so happens that in the written statement, not only were you asked to talk of Sikubwabo, but also you were asked to talk of Mika, and the passage that you devote to Mika is as follows.  This is on page 8 of your statement.  "As for Conseiller Mika" -- and I might add that you say this just after talking of Sikubwabo -- "As regards Conseiller Mika, before the 1994 massacres began, well before, he trained militia from September 1993.  He, himself, participated in the training of Interahamwe in Nyungwe forest.  He recruited young Hutus in general, usually idle boys for the training.  It is he, himself, who used to say this with a lot of pride.  He also distributed weapons to the population.  He participated in the Mubuga killings.  He was close to the bourgmestre.  I used to see him all the time with his gun amongst the attackers of Mubuga and Bisesero."  Is that your statement?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I think that if I were to return to this matter regarding the fact that Kabanda was shot by Sikubwabo and Mika, I do not see any contradiction.  As I emphasised during my testimony, each time, Mika was in the company of Sikubwabo, so I do not see what is surprising if I were to say that Mika was with Sikubwabo when he was killing Kabanda.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I asked you whether you confirm your statement?
A.	It is, indeed, my statement.
Q.	Did the way in which the investigator put the question to you prevent you from citing Mika as having killed?
A.	I have explained to you that one cannot say all that one has been witness to.  There are things that you will find in my statement and others that you will not find in the statement.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In this same statement, your refer to training in Nyungwe forest.  Where is this Nyungwe forest situated?
A.	Nyungwe forest is situated in Rwanda, and enters Kibuye préfecture in the former Gisovu commune and extends to Gikongoro préfecture and Cyangugu préfecture as well, if I'm not mistaken .
Q.	Did you know the exact location or site of the Interahamwe training?
A.	On that point, I believe it is Mika who is best placed to tell you the exact place where the Interahamwes were training.  I have never been to that place in the Nyungwe forest because I was not an Interahamwe.  It would not have been possible for me to know this place unless I were led there to be killed, but perhaps the person who used to take people there can tell you this in great detail.
Q.	Compared to the centre of the Gishyita, the place where Mika's house was found, could you indicate the approximate distance of Nyungwe from vis-a-vis the centre of Gishyita?
A.	I do not think that I can estimate this distance for you.  Mika lived in Gishyita commune and that part of the forest that entered Kibuye only reached as far as Gisovu commune.
Q.	Apart from Mika, himself, who is supposed to have told you that he was training Interahamwe, were you able to obtain the same information from any other source?
A.	Apart from what Mika, himself, stated, there were also other people who used to say this.  Especially in Kigali it was said that Nyungwe forest was used by the powers currently running the country.  It was a hidden place, and the people in power did not want it to be known what they were doing.  Everybody was saying that Nyungwe forest had been used for Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi.  I have never been to this forest.  This is all received information which I got from other people.
Q.	My question -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we hope that you will conclude your cross-examination before 4:30, before we rise for a short break.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
The hour is already over.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You started at five past three.
MR. SONGA:
First of all, I am certainly going to end before the break, and barring that, I would accept any decision that you might render.  I think that it will be easier for us to take the floor because we will not have the expert witness, but I shall make an effort to end at 4:30.  I think I will be able to.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I was saying that my question was aimed at determining whether, apart from Mika, there was another source from which you obtained information to the effect that Mika participated in training the Interahamwe in Nyungwe forest, if you could limit your response, your answer, to this sole aspect?
A.	I had learned about this.
Q.	How did you learn about this?
A.	This is how I learned about this.  Towards the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, when there was a problem with political parties, after the creation of CDR and MDR, anybody who was in Rwanda could see that there were problems.  And in 1994, the situation proved that the genocide that took place was not spontaneous, but had in fact been carefully planned.  That is the reason why in Mubuga, where I often went, that is where I received such information when I engaged in discussions with my friends regarding the overall situation of the country, and Mubuga was not far from Gishyita.
Q.	Witness, when you state that Mika participated in the training of the Interahamwe, would it be possible for you to explain this?  Considering that he was in CDR, it is difficult to see how he was training the militia of the MRND?
A.	As I explained to you yesterday, the MRND party predates the CDR party.  The Arusha Accords were signed between the party in power and the RPF Inkotanyi.  Those who did not wish for power-sharing at the time between the government and the RPF Inkotanyi made sure that the MRND would not be perceived as the party that refused the power-sharing, and those parties like CDR were then created, but in fact there was no difference between the MRND and the CDR, at least insofar as their activities were concerned.  That is what I wish to explain to you clearly.  Radio stations like RTLM were created to raise the awareness of the Hutu population to their problems so that, when the time came, the killing would be sparked off without any difficulty and so that everybody would understand that the Tutsi was the only enemy, so the fact that there was collaboration between the partisans of this CDR 
-- the militants of the CDR and MRND, was not surprising.  The Impuzamugambi and the Interahamwe did nothing good in 1994.  Their programme was the physical elimination of the Tutsi, and they carried this out.
Q.	I would have preferred the answers to be more brief and concise.  I shall ask one more question.  When you state that Mika, himself, participated in the Interahamwe training, what does this mean?  Did he train the Interahamwe, or was he, himself, trained as a Interahamwe?
A.	Look, the leaders of the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi were first trained, and subsequently they raised awareness amongst the others.  So he was trained, and then he carried out training.  That is obvious, because everybody knew the program and what had to be done.
Q.	Where were they trained?  Still in Nyungwe?
A.	Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to repeat this: I was not with them.  Mika was there, he was trained, he can explain this to you.  I wasn't there, but in our region it was said that he was undergoing training in Nyungwe forest.  It is possible that he was trained elsewhere.  It is entirely possible because considering the cruelty that characterised their actions in 1994, it might be said that they received training, advanced training, but I can tell you that it is he who can best answer this question because it is he who received this training.  I wasn't there.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I would like to make a present of five minutes to Judge Muthoga before the break.  I would like to thank the witness for his availability.  I would like to thank Madam President and Your Honours for your patience in listening to me, thank you. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Merci for the present.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Professor.  Professor, won't you tender those documents which you had confronted with the witness?
MR. SONGA:
Of course, Madam President.  Thank you, Madam President, for reminding me.  We did intend to do that, and we promise to provide the English version after the break.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The transcript of 3 March 1998 in Kayishema case is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 32 and to be kept under seal.  No, this is a public document: 3 March 1998, F for the French, and E would be for the English version.
(Exhibit Nos. D. 32F and D. 32E admitted)
MR. SONGA:
Your Honour, we would also like to tender in the written statement.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you have a copy of the written statement? 

MR. SONGA:
We do, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Written statement of this witness dated 29 August 2002 is entered as Exhibit D.  33, to be kept under seal, E for English, and F for the French, and K for Kinyarwanda. 

And the written statement of this witness dated 22 March 1996 is entered and admitted as 
Exhibit D. 34, under seal, E for the English, F for the French, and K for the Kinyarwanda.
 
Professor, is that all?
MR. SONGA:
I have concluded, Madam President, and I thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination, Mr. Prosecutor? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for assisting us with your testimony.  We wish you a safe journey home.  

Mr. Issa, please assist the witness to the door.  
(Witness excused)
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor Songa, I have a question for you.  When we were discussing the expert witness, you expressed concern about the possibility of a change of the report.  Judge Muthoga told you that what we have before us is the report that has been filed, and, therefore, that is what we will deal with at the appropriate time.  

In view of your concern about the possibility of another report being filed, would you be prepared to take the witness tomorrow based on this report, if you have the opportunity to cross-examine the witness and challenge the witness's qualifications and the substance of the report?
MR. SONGA:
I am in a quandary, Your Honour.  

Your Honour, I was saying that I am in a quandary because I already have a mindset based on the decision that you rendered to the effect that we would come back at the beginning of the Defence evidence.
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.  I was only inquiring.  I was only inquiring since you were concerned about the possibility of a change in the report and certain changes being made before we come back, but if you want to stick to the decision we have already taken, that is fine.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will take a short break for 15 minutes.
(Court recessed from 1632H to 1706H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing in the Court is resumed.  Good evening, Mr. Witness.  Can you hear me?
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
How are you feeling today?
THE WITNESS:
I am feeling better.  I don't have any problem.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That's very good.  Mr. Witness, you are reminded of the oath you have taken the other day that you shall speak the truth.

Professor Songa, please continue with your remaining cross-examination.  This is Witness W.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Before questioning the witness, I would like to point out a small mistake that slipped into the disclosure.  My legal assistant said that the statement of EE was put in the place of AF's statement, and immediately that was noted, we contacted the registry to notify them of that error.  We would like, Madam President, to ensure correction thereof.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Where is the correct statement?  Professor, do we have copies of the correct statement? 
MR. SONGA:
You have it, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So the correct statement of this witness dated 8 June 1996 is entered and admitted as Exhibit D. 33, to be kept under seal, F for the French, E for English and K for Kinyarwanda.
(Exhibit Nos. D.33F, D. 33E and D. 33K admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the second witness statement of this witness, Witness AF, dated 2 December 1998 is entered and admitted as D. 34, under seal, F for French, E for English and K for Kinyarwanda.
(Exhibit Nos. D.34F, D. 34E and D. 34K admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the previous statements which were inadvertently entered as Exhibit D. 33 and Exhibit D. 34 are hereby cancelled

Professor, go ahead with your cross-examination of Witness W.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Remembering that we agreed you'll take an hour, and the other hour you make a gift to me.
MR. SONGA:
I take note of that, Your Honour. 
WITNESS W
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have a few questions that may require that we backtrack a little bit.  This will also enable us to recall what we were talking about two days ago.  My first question is as follows:  Can you remind us how many attacks took place on 11th of April 1994?
A.	Why do you want to take us back, whereas I made a statement in that respect and which was entered?
Q.	I did crave your indulgence, Mr. Witness, and I think I explained why.  I just want us to refresh our memory.
A.	Does it mean that we are going to start all over?
Q.	No, I will have only two or three questions.  That should bring us back.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, instead of wasting time, please answer the question asked by the Defence counsel.
THE WITNESS:
On the 11th April there were three attacks, if my memory doesn't fail me.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	From your previous statements, if I do recall well, I think you said they came in the following succession: Kiziba, Nyarutovu and Ngendombi?
A.	Yes, that is how the attacks were carried out.
Q.	Thank you.  You also stated, Mr. Witness, that the Nyarutovu attack ended around the evening at about 5.30 p.m.; is that correct?
A.	It is rather the attack of Ngendombi which ended at that hour.
Q.	Thank you.  You will also recall, Mr. Witness, that I asked you a question to find out what was the first hill on which you took refuge at Bisesero, and if I noted your answer well, it was Nyirandagana, is that correct?
A.	It was rather the Nyirandagano hill.
Q.	Thank you for that correction, Mr. Witness.  What was the distance of that hill from the Bisesero hill?
A.	That colline is also located in the Bisesero secteur.
Q.	My question, Mr. Witness, is to find out at what distance it is located vis-a-vis the Bisesero hill?
A.	In any case, between the two hills, there is a cellule, but I did not measure the distance approaching the two hills.
Q.	And which is the cellule that is situated between the two hills?
A.	Nyirandagano is found in the Gitwa cellule, and the next cellule where you will find the Bisesero hill is the Uwingabo cellule, those are two neighbouring cellules, but the two cellules are found in the Bisesero secteur.
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 14th October 1997, you appeared as a witness in the Kayishema case, if I noted this well, and the question asked whether -- where you went on the 11th April was asked, and you said something other than Nyirandagano.  Will you allow me to read the excerpt of that transcript to you?  

The question is, "Where did you go?"  Answer: "The others and myself went to Bisesero."  
Question: "When you talk of Bisesero, what do you mean precisely?"  Answer: "There is a hill called Bisesero and it is on that hill that we went."  "Why did you choose to go to the Bisesero hill?"  "The hills were high and many people had gathered there and we could find where to hide there." 

In my understanding, Mr. Witness, there is a difference and a gap.  There is a discrepancy between what you testified before the Chamber and what you have just testified and what you testified before this Court in 1997.  Do you have any explanation for that discrepancy?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honour, we have an objection in relation to the passage that has just been read to the witness.  There is no reference provided.  My learned friend mentioned the Kayishema case, which it is indeed true that this witness did testify in that case, but there is no reference given as to the passage.  We don't have copies of the transcript, and, in any event, the passage has to be placed in the proper context.  

Now, "Where did you go?" is how my learned friend started asking the question.  There is no reference being made to the particular date that he's referring to, so how do we know that passage refers to the 11th of April, which is the issue in dispute.  He has to place the passage in its proper context and make the proper references.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  What is your response, Professor? 
MR. SONGA:
(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are not getting the translation.
MR. SONGA:
I think if the Prosecutor had listened to me keenly, he would have heard that I talked about the 14th of October 1997 and the question and answer passage that I'm quoting from.  So, Madam President, I think I did mention the date and the date is 14 October 1997, and the question and answers that I quoted will be seen if you move a bit up the transcript, and you will see that the questions refer to the date of 11 April, and if the Prosecutor will want to be edified further, I think we will go back to the questions that came earlier on in the transcript and I think that will clear the air.  Madam President, I can avail the Chamber of the passage in question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do you have a copy of those transcripts?  

Mr. Issa, please get the transcripts from counsel.
MR. SONGA:
I prepared them, Madam President.  I am ready to make them available to you and to the registrar.  As for the English version, you will find it on pages 82 and 83.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, this transcript is dated?  Where is the date?  We don't see the date on this transcript.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And may the interpreters be given copies of the documents, please?
MR. SONGA:
In the French version, I have the date 14 October 1997.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In the English transcript, we don't have the date.  And Professor, do you have an extra copy for the interpreter? 
MR. SONGA:
All that we have has just been given to the registry services, and certainly the interpreters can be provided with copies thereof.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, we don't see any date on these transcripts. 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I have been told that there is a technical problem when the English version is photocopied because the date doesn't appear on the English version, but in the French version the date does appear, and I think the characters of the typing is so clear that we cannot question the date of the hearing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What date did you say, Professor?  This transcript is dated what? 
MR. SONGA:
It is dated 14 October 1997.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, do you have any objection to the date? 
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
No, Your Honour, we don't dispute that this witness testified in Kayishema on the date given.  I don't know why there is no date on this transcript, but I don't dispute that part of it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor.  Go on, please.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I think you have already heard the question, but I can go over it.  You realise that there is a discrepancy between the testimony before the Chamber and the statement that you made on 
14 October 1997 in the Kayishema case.  We are waiting your explanations for such discrepancy.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please read out the question once again.  Read the passage to the witness, the answer to the question from the transcript of 14 October 1997.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Madam.  Thank you, Madam President.  I think that in order to reassure the Prosecutor, I will go further up in the transcript so that the date of 11 April can appear.  We are dealing with a question that begins as follows: "Could you talk to us about what happened in your region -- in your region on 9th of April?"  Answer: "Yes, I can."  "Please do?"  Answer: "On the 9th April the war broke out at the place called Rurebero," which is what is written in the English version, and in the same question, "at the time the situation wasn't very serious.  We thought that these were people who simply wanted to attack or capture the Tutsi.  It was only on the 11th that the situation became serious, that the war became serious."  Question: "Can you stop there, please?"
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, you are omitting passages on the English translation on page 82.  That is where you are reading, isn't it?
MR. SONGA:  
Page 82 is what we have in the English version, Your Honour.  I am reading the French version, 
Mr. President (sic), and my concern is, if you want to understand me, my concern, therefore, is to reach an answer which will mention the date of the 11th April, because that was the Prosecutor's concern.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Read in full from where the answer starts.  "On the 9th April the war broke out at the place called Rurebero," and then go on.
MR. SONGA:
"The assailants were led by the man who was bourgmestre.  His name was Charles Sikubwabo.  There was also Conseiller Mika and a certain Useengwimba and Muhirwa.  At that time, the situation was not very serious.  We felt -- we thought that these were people attacking, trying to capture Tutsi cattle.  It was only on the 11th that the war became serious -- that the situation became serious."  Question: "Can you stop there a moment, please?  Who were the people being attacked on the 11th?"  Answer: "It was the Tutsi who were being attacked."  Question: "They were being attacked by whom?"  Answer: "It was the Interahamwe and a certain Hutu, and amongst them there were gendarmes from Kibuye and the communal police."  Question: "Who was leading these attackers?"  Answer: "It was Bourgmestre Sikubwabo and Mika."  Question: "Now, where did you go?"  Answer: "The others and I, we went to Bisesero."  Question: "Now, when you say Bisesero, what do you mean?"  Answer: "There is a hill known as Bisesero, and it is to that hill that we went."  

I think, Madam President, that I can stop reading the passage at this point, and at this point I would like to ask the question once again to the witness.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
I have an objection, Your Honour, I think my learned friend should actually read that passage until it ends at the words "places to hide".  It's actually very misleading for him to actually stop where he stopped, and it is very pertinent to the purported contradiction that he seeks to put to the witness if he doesn't read a substantial part of that quotation, the idea being that there is only one hill called Bisesero, as opposed to several hills, and that is very material to the proposition that he's putting to this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, read the next question and answer.
MR. SONGA:
I can carry on with the reading up to where I would want to end, but I was convinced that the witness, in his statement, was very specific to say "hill", and not "secteur", but if you want me, I think I can continue to read the passage.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Continue, Professor Songa because you will see in the lines that follow there is plural involved, not just singular, and obviously the context must be the context seen in the whole passage, not just part.  Go on.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Question: "Why did you choose to go to the Bisesero hill?"  "There were high mountains.  There was an altitude, there were many people there and we could find places to hide."  

Should I continue?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
No, not necessary.  Can you stop there if you want to ask your question.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I shall put my question to you again.  It concerns the first hill to which you went.  In your statement or your testimony before this Court, you talked about Nyirandagano hill.  In previous testimony of 14th October 1997, you referred to Bisesero hill.  I think that there is a discrepancy here.  How can you explain that?
A.	Thank you.  I think I explained this to you.  When you asked me about the events of the 15th, in particular Gititi hill, I told you that we did not always stay on the hill.  That is why we went off to several hills.  I told you that we went to Bisesero hill.  I told that you they were high mountains.  I did not say that there was just one mountain in Bisesero.  There are several mountains, including Nyirandagano hill.  You put the question to me regarding Nyirandagano hill and you asked me where we spent the night.  We went to Bisesero and we spent the night in Nyirandagano.  We could cross a hill, or we could go to a hill, and if a problem happened, we would move to another hill.  I think that my answer is there.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You have just mentioned Gititi.  You say that when you arrived in Gititi, you were attacked by a group of individuals who were waiting on the opposite hill.  What was the opposite hill called, Mr. Witness?
A.	I do not know the name of this hill.
Q.	And what was the distance between the place where you were and the hill opposite?
A.	These are neighbouring hills.  The distance was short.
Q.	Can you give us an approximate value?
A.	When you ask me about distance during this trial, I wonder how a person could measure distance using a tape measure.  We were meeting people who were attacking us.  How could we then go to measure this distance or that one.  If you want to know the distance, come.  I shall show you these hills and then you can measure the distance using a tape measure.
Q.	Mr. Witness, the hills have not moved.  If you give the distance as it is today, it would be quite sufficient.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, he has given the answer that he doesn't know the distance between the hills.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
In fact, Professor, it's an impossible distance you're asking the witness, because he has to make up his mind is he going to start from the top of the hill, or the bottom of the hill to the next hill, or is he going to talk about the distance as the crow flies, or is he going to talk about on ground, on land?  It's a difficult question.
MR. SONGA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Thank you, Madam President.  I note that the question is indeed difficult.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that Mika killed your sister, is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Mr. Witness, in a previous statement, you listed the victims that you knew, victims of the attacks.  Does the name of your sister appear on this list?
A.	My sister's name does not appear on this list, and I explained yesterday the ten people whose names are mentioned are really a small number in regard to the members of my family in all.  I explained to you that the making of lists was superficial.  We did not even know that these people who came to see us were working for the Tribunal.  That is the reason why the list of ten people -- I gave this list of ten people offhand, so it is not only -- these are not the only people who died in Bisesero, and these are not the only people who died in my family, so I did not include my sister's name.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, if you go to the list in your statement, attached with your statement of 22nd of March 1996, what would you say about a name that is here at No. 6?  

Mr. Issa, can you please give a copy of this statement to the witness?  

Mr. Issa, let me see it.

Show it to the Prosecutor

Have you seen the highlighted portion?  Have you read the name which has been highlighted?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I have seen the highlighted portion.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This name is -- how is this name related to you?  How is this person related to you?
THE WITNESS: 
She's my sister.  She was my older sister.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Issa, please take the document and give it to Professor.
Professor, please proceed.

BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's remain with this list.  The person indicated under No. 4, is there a statement wherein you describe the circumstances of his death?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, has the witness got that list, because the one we showed him was not numbered?  Can you give him a numbered list, a list with numbers?
(Pages 22 to 36 by Trevor Gerbes)































	1745H
MR. SONGA: 
We shall see to that, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. SONGA: 
And I would request that the witness keep the list with him while I ask a couple of questions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, do we have the English version?
MR. SONGA:
I shall verify, Madam President.

The English version, we have a copy of that, but we had already previously tendered this as exhibit.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Is it the same as page 439 of our materials?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, give it to the Prosecutor -- the witness.  Give him the English one. 

Yes, professor, please proceed. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, so now you have the list.  The person whose name appears under No. 4, my question regarding this person is, is there a statement amongst those that you have made before this Court wherein you describe the circumstances of the death of this person?
A.	Are you referring to the Kayishema trial or are you referring to this trial?
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am referring to this trial.
A.	I said this when you asked, putting questions regarding the persons whose name appears on this list.  I said this when I was talking about people whose death I witnessed and in respect to other people whose death I had not witnessed.
Q.	I shall make my question clear, Mr. Witness.  You made two statements to the investigators of the ICTR.  In these two statements, do you at any time describe the circumstances of the death of the person whose name appears under No. 4?
A.	I asked you whether you were referring to the Mika or the Kayishema trial and I answered that it was -- it concerned the Mika trial.  I told you that I did not give detailed information about the death of the person whose name appears on this list.
Q.	Do you mean that you did provide information at some point in any of the two statements?
A.	I said this day before yesterday, when you asked me whether I had been an eyewitness to the death of certain persons listed here, and I explained.
Q.	Madam President, with your leave, I would like to repeat this question one last time.  If we take the statement of the 22nd of March 1996, apart from the fact that this name is on this list, in this statement, is there a passage which relates the circumstances in which you saw this person being killed?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, you wouldn't ask that question without letting the witness read the statement and be satisfied that there is or there isn't, because obviously he has not written (sic) the statement now.  So, you will have to let him read the statement and then ask him the question, if you want to ask him.  Unless you want it put it to him that there is not, in which case it is a different position. But if you want to ask him whether there is any place he has referred to, then you must let him read the statement.
MR. SONGA: 
I am in complete agreement with you, Your Honour.  I think he has the statement before him.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
So, Witness, read the statements that you have to be able to answer the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you read or write?  Can you read the statement?
THE WITNESS:
Would you please give me a French version of the statement?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, please, the French version of the statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Your Honours, I am very troubled about the purpose of this exercise that this witness is being put through at the moment.  If I recollect his evidence in relation to this list, it is that he recognised two people on that list where he had witnessed their killing.  I don't recollect him ever implicating the Accused in those killings, so --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Phillips, let him read the statement.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can object to the question when asked. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Tell us when you are finished, Mr. Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Have you finished?
THE WITNESS:
I have finished. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, please now ask your question in relation to this statement. 
MR. SONGA: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is my question.  In the statement that you have just perused, were you able to find any passage which describes the circumstances in which the person whose name appears under No. 4 of the list that was shown to you was killed?
A.	I did not see any passage.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you believe that you have -- that you talked about this in the other statement of the 29th of August 2002, for which I request that the registry make arrangements to bring it to you?
A.	I think I do not believe that I mentioned the circumstances of the death of this person, even in this statement.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I do not know whether you still have the list before you.  If not, I would be grateful if it were given to you because I have another question to put to you.  Do you confirm that you have the list, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes, I have the list which is part of the statement of 22nd March 1996.
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you please look at the name of the person -- the person's name which appears under No. 10 and to check your statement of 22nd March 1996.  I hope you still have it with you, and I hope you will check to determine whether you discussed the circumstances under which this person met his death. 
A.	Yes, I saw the name that appears under No. 10, but I think that in the statement which I have before me, I did not mention the circumstances of his death.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, professor, please proceed.
BY MR. SONGA:
Q.	Did you, in your opinion, mention it in the subsequent statement of the 29th of August 2002?
A.	Regarding the person whose name appears under No. 10? 
Q.	Exactly.
A.	I mentioned this name in the second statement, but I did not give any details.  I said that his little girl, who was still being breastfed was the one that Mika hit against a stone and that she died of that.  I do not believe I said anything more in relation to this man.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We shall continue.  Witness, you state that you saw Mika Muhimana in the month of June in the Redemi mines in Bisesero and you add, "Some refugees were hiding in the mines and others in the forest."  Is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	In what circumstances did you see Mika in the redeming mines?
A.	I saw Mika at the time when people were being shot at.  Some assailants killed people with bullets, others killed them with traditional weapons, including stakes, and I also saw Mika at the time when the baby was seized from this young lady, the wife of the gentleman whom I mentioned.  It is Mika who took this baby and hit it against the stone.  

I also saw Mika come up when the girls were found out and taken towards Ruzindana.  One of the young -- the breasts of one of the young girls were cut off, and for the other a stake was pushed up her genitals and into her stomach.  Mika was present when this happened.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will try to request -- I request that you try to make an effort to limit your questions -- your answers to the questions because we are short of time.  Were you in these redeming mines?
A.	I was in a bush; I was not in the mine itself.
Q.	I don't know whether you are in a better frame of mind now, but I would like to ask you how far your bush was from the Mika when you saw him?
A.	In any case, he was not far from me.  I explained to you well before that in regard to these distances I had not taken the time to measure them, but I could see him where he was.
Q.	When you state that Mika took a baby and threw the baby against the stone thus killing her, from whom did Mika take this baby?
A.	Mika took the baby from the baby's mother.
Q.	And where was the mother?
A.	The baby's mother was hiding in a hole in a pit with her baby and she had just been discovered in this hole.
Q.	And what happened to the mother?
A.	The mother of this baby was also killed.
Q.	Have you talked about this beforehand, Mr. Witness?
A.	I made a statement to this effect in my witness statement.  Mika took the baby and hit the baby against a stone.  I said this in my June statement.
Q.	Mr. Witness, my question was whether you had discussed the death of the mother.
A.	I did not talk about it because nobody asked me questions about them.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state Mika was wearing a shirt with the MRND symbol on it.  How was this symbol?
A.	There were shirts that were worn.  These were African print shirts, and on these shirts there were circular drawings in which the party's arms, the MRND party's arms were drawn.  They were worn before the creation or before the advent of multiparty politics.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you state that the assailants on that day also took young girls or caught young girls, and this is your statement before the Court:  "That Mika and Joseph were at the origin of the arrest of these young girls."  Do you confirm this statement?
A.	I do not understand your question when you say that Mika and Joseph were at the origin of the arrest of these young girls. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, this is because I am reading my notes of the previous session and I believe I understood you to have said that Mika and Joseph were at the origin of the arrest of the girls in Nyiramurego.  Would that help to refresh your memory?  Do you confirm or do you deny this? 
A.	I did say this, and I am going to explain to you clearly if you wish. 
Q.	All I ask of you is that you should confirm.
A.	I said that.  I did say that, but do not ask me part of the question.  Let me give you details about the question.  You are trying to misinterpret my statement.
Q.	Please go ahead. 
A.	I stated that during the Nyiramurego attack, people were found in pits, and some of these people were killed with machetes.  It is Mika, Ruzindana and Joseph, the little brother -- the younger of Ruzindana who were at the head of this attack.  I also said that Mika killed this baby by hitting the baby against a stone.  I also said these young ladies were discovered and that one was killed using a stake and the other had her breasts cut off; and that other young ladies were also discovered and taken towards the place where Ruzindana was and it is at this place that they were killed.  This is what I said.
Q.	I will rephrase my question, Witness.  When you state that Mika and Joseph were those who ordered the arrest of those girls, what did they do precisely, such that you state they were at the origin of the arrest of those girls?
A.	Now, I stated that many people were flushed out of that area, and when they were flushed out, Mika opened -- was opening fire on people.  Mika was not alone; there were many other people with him.  You are asking me whether -- explain how I came about that, how I can explain that Mika was at the origin of the arrest.  Were you there on that date to state that he did not participate in that attack?
Q.	Witness, it is not for you to put questions to me. 
A.	But you, yourself, should put questions to me that are clear enough. 
Q.	I will make an effort; you can count on me.  

Witness, you state, for instance, that Ruzindana cut off Beatrice's breasts; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And who thrust stakes into Immaculee's genitals?
A.	It was other people who were with Ruzindana.  It was not Ruzindana who did it in person.
Q.	You state, Witness, that the last time you saw Mika was in late June, and on that day you first saw him in Gitwa and subsequently in Uwingabo;  is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Before that period of late June, had you seen him in the same place?
A.	I had seen him in the various locations, but that was in the month of April.
Q.	Is there a written statement amongst those you gave the Tribunal indicating that you saw Mika twice on that location, the first time in April and the second time in June?
A.	In my statement of 1996, I believe I made mention of that.  I made an allusion to that.
Q.	Did you keep that statement in front of you?
A.	I still have it in front of me.
Q.	With Madam President's leave, please look for the passages in question.
JUDGE SHORT:
Professor, which passages are you asking him to look for?  The passage in which he said what? 
MR. SONGA:
The passages in one or the other statement wherein he asserts that he saw Mika in Gitwa and in Uwingabo in the month of April.
JUDGE SHORT:
So his answer was that he saw Mika previously in other places.  You put the question whether he had seen Mika in those places, those two places you ,mentioned, but his answer was that he saw Mika previously in other places without specifically answering your question.
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor, can I assist the witness? 
MR. SONGA: 
Absolutely, you incarnate justice, it will be in the interests of all of us, Your Honours. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
K0260982 answers your question? 
MR. SONGA:
If you allow me, Your Honours, I will verify the passages.  Which passages did you refer to Your Honour? 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Page 7, page sept of the English text. 
MR. SONGA:
Of the first statement?
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Of the statement of --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
29th August 2002. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Professor  --
MR. SONGA:
Yes, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
-- was your question restricted to the statement of March or is it both statements?
MR. SONGA:
We are referring to two statements, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Now, the statement on page 447 -- 448 of the bundle, does it answer your question?
MR. SONGA: 
I am still looking for the passage, Your Honour.  Neither I nor my assistants have found the passage, Your Honour. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
"In Gitwa" -- can I just read it for you? Are you asking for the passage which indicates that the witness saw Mika in Gitwa; is that correct?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, can you repeat your question, please? 
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, Your Honours, to ensure you understand the question properly, I will perhaps place my question in context to justify it.  After reading the two statements by the witness, Mika was seen by the witness once.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, the witness has only been given the first statement of 22nd March 1996, he has not been given the other statement, the statement of 29th August 2002.  So repeat your question. 
BY MR. SONGA: 
Q.	My question was very simple, Madam President, to my knowledge and I am putting this question to the witness directly, Witness, you stated that you saw Mika in Gitwa and Uwingabo and that was in the month of June.  However, testifying before the Chamber, you stated that you saw him twice at the same locations, that is, Gitwa and Uwingabo, the first time in April and the second time in June.  I state, again, that my question is simple:  in which of the two statements did you provide information that you saw Mika in Gitwa and Uwingabo in April?
A.	I'll explain myself very clearly.  If you read my statement of the 22nd March 1996, you would have noticed that we are talking about perpetrators of the genocide who are very well known and who are about seven or eight in number.  In taking my statement, a general question was put to me.  No specific questions were asked regarding individuals.  The question was a general one.  I spoke of three police officers, Sikubwabo, and Mika as well as Muhirwa.  We made mention of all those people, generally speaking.  Furthermore, the various locations where we saw Mika between April and July are well known to Mika himself.  He knows that he was in various locations.  Don't dwell on the statement of March 1996.  If you look at the third page of that statement of March 1996 towards the end, you would find that I stated that I saw Mika in Uwingabo cellule.  And in the second statement, it is stated that I saw Mika in June in Gitwa and in Uwingabo.  That was in late June.  You are dwelling on Gitwa hill and yet it is precisely on that hill that Mika used to come regularly to pick up Kabanda -- to look for Kabanda. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for all the explanations you have given.  I will ask a final question for purposes of more information.  

Gititi and Muyira hills, are they close to one another?
A.	Between those two hills, there are other hills.  They are not very close to one another.
MR. SONGA:
Madam President, I believe I have covered all the aspects tackled in the witness statement.  

Witness, thank you.  

Madam President, Your Honours, I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, professor, for the surprise. 
JUDGE MUTHOGA:
Thank you for the present. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Phillips.
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. SONGA:
I also thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence has come to an end.  We thank you for having come to Arusha to testify before this Tribunal.  We wish you a safe journey home.  
(Witness excused)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are the counsel for the parties available tomorrow morning?
MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:
We are, Your Honour; yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Professor, are you available tomorrow morning? 
MR. SONGA: 
We are always at your disposal, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, professor.  

We adjourn for the day, and resume tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m.  Thank you.  
(Court adjourned at 1827H)
