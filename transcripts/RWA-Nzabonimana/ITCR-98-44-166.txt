MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Byron presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 14th of September 2005, for a pre-trial conference in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, 
Case No. ICTR-98-44-I. 

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Could we have appearances, please, starting with the Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon to the parties and to the registry.  The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, Gregory Lombardi, Takeh Sendze, and Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the Defence, starting with Karemera. 
MR. SOW:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon to members of the Chamber.  I am Félix Sow, co-counsel for Édouard Karemera. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Your Honours, and good afternoon to the Prosecutor.  
I am Chantal Hounkpatin, counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I'm with my co-counsel, Frédéric Weyl, and our assistant.  I forgot to extend my greetings to the registry.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good afternoon, Mr. President and members of the Trial Chamber.  I'm Peter Robinson representing Joseph Nzirorera.  Also assisting me today is our legal assistant, Leopold Nsengiyumva, who is seated to Mr. Nzirorera's left.  We're also assisted by our two interns, Russell Hopkins and 
Gina Mehnse-Datse, and today we also have our Kigali-based investigator, Dick Prudence Munyeshuli who's sitting in the first row of the gallery. 

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Robinson. 

After the last conference meeting, and as you are probably aware, the Chamber has filed today written decisions on the Defence motions challenging the indictment as regards to joint criminal enterprise liability, and these motions have been denied. 

We have a final written decision on the Defence motion for the continuance of the trial, and this motion has also been denied. 

We have decided on the Prosecutor's motion for special protective measures for Witnesses G and T, and this motion has been granted in part.  And we've also filed a decision on Joseph Nzirorera's motions to compel inspection and disclosure and to direct witnesses to bring judicial immigration records; this was granted in part. 

The Chamber is going to deliver, in a moment, further oral decisions, and the remainder of the current pending motions will be addressed this week by the Chamber.  In addition, to expedite the proceedings and enhance the rights of the Accused, the Chamber has instructed the registry and the language unit to provide their assistance after the adjournment of today's session in the interpretation of decisions on the indictment and on the continuance of the trial. These decisions will, therefore, be orally translated this afternoon.  The Chamber would like to take this opportunity to thank the court staff members for their assistance in this regard. 

Our oral decisions.  First, the decision on Defence motions objecting to the proposed amended indictment of 24th August 2005.  The Defence for Ngirumpatse and the Defence for Nzirorera filed respectively on the 6th and 7th of September 2005, motions requesting the Chamber to order that the Prosecution filed -- file an amended indictment in compliance with the decision on defects in the form 
of  5 August 2005. 

Now, in accordance with the Chamber's scheduling orders, the Prosecution filed its response to Ngirumptase's motion on 8th September 2005 and orally responded on Nzirorera's motion during the pre-trial conference of 9 -- September 9th, 2005.  The Defence for each Accused was additionally heard by the Chamber. 

The Defence for Ngirumpatse contends that the insertion by the Prosecution of the word "including" in place of the word "among others" is vague and does not comply with the Chamber's order 
of 5th August 2005.  It adds that using phrases such as, and I quote:  "The Prosecutor is unable to specifically identify each and every participant in the joint criminal enterprise", "This is the best information available at this time", are also vague.  It also contends that the Prosecution added new charges at paragraphs 18, subparagraph (iv) and paragraph 24.8.  The Defence accordingly requests the Chamber to order the Prosecution to remove the above-mentioned phrases and add, where appropriate, the identity of persons or dates.  

The Defence for Nzirorera contends that the Prosecution added new charges at paragraph 6, subparagraph (iii) and paragraph 18 of the amended indictment.  It requests that these new charges are stricken out or, should the Chamber allow them, that further initial appearance and the possibility to file additional preliminary motions should be granted. 

The Defence Nzirorera also argues that the Prosecution did not comply with the Chamber's decision by failing to name any of the MRND office holders at paragraph 18, subparagraph (i).  It argues that the Prosecution failed to elaborate on the issue of command responsibility, as requested by the Chamber, and it did not provide additional details, neither about the meetings at paragraph 24.8 of the indictment, nor about the attacks at paragraph 62.12. 

In its oral and written response to the Defence motions, the Prosecution contends that it has complied with the Chamber's ord -- decision of 5th August 2005 in conformity with the ICTY's jurisprudence and did not add any new charge.  Concerning the elaboration and command responsibility and attacks at paragraph 62.12, the Prosecution declares that it was unable to elaborate further and that it is sufficiently pleaded in the indictment. 

As a preliminary matter, the Prosecution argued in its oral submission that these Defence motions were alleging further defects in the form under Rule 72 of the rules.  While the Prosecution did not draw any explicit conclusion from that statement, the Chamber does not share the Prosecution's view.  It could not be admitted that the Prosecution could file an indictment not amended in accordance with the Chamber's order, and the Defence should be prevented from complaining because of time limits set out in Rule 72 or because the time limits set out in Rule 72 have expired.  The Chamber will therefore consider the matter under Rule 73 of the rules. 

With respect to the use of the word "including" and phrases such as:  "The Prosecutor is unable to specifically identify each and every participant in the joint criminal enterprise" and "This is the best information available at this time", the Chamber is of the view that the Prosecution complied with the Chamber's decision of 15th -- of 5th August 2005 in conformity with the relevant jurisprudence.  

Considering the alleged failure to name any of the MRND office holders at paragraph 18, 
subparagraph (i), the Chamber recalls that the indictment must be read as a whole.  At the end of the said paragraph, it is specified that, and I quote, "The Prosecution is unable to specifically identify each and every subordinate of the Accused.  This is the best information available at this time."

The Chamber does not consider that the additional information provided by the Prosecution at paragraph 6, subparagraph (iii) and paragraph 18, subparagraph (iv) of the indictment constitutes expanded factual allegations amounting to new charges.  They are evidentiary matters to be addressed at trial.  Contrary to Ngirumpatse's contention, paragraph 24.8 does not contain new charges, since in the indictment of 23rd February 2005, it was already pleaded that, and I quote, "Joseph Nzirorera organised a fundraising banquet for the Interahamwe at the Hotel Rebero in Kigali."

The Chamber, however, is concerned that in the same paragraph 24.8 the Prosecution did not provide more specific dates, time frames and locations about the alleged meetings.  The same applies about the attacks pleaded at paragraph 62.12 of the indictment and the pleading of command responsibility. 
While the Prosecution cannot be compelled to disclose information which is not in its possession, the Chamber strongly recalls that it is not acceptable for the Prosecution to omit material aspects of its main allegations in the indictment with the aim of molding its case in the course of the trial, depending on how the evidence unfolds. 

The Prosecution is expected to know its case before it moves to trial and should provide any additional details in its possession to put the Accused on proper notice of the charges against them.  Under 
Article 20 of the statute and Rule 54 of the rules, the Chamber will, therefore, be ready, where appropriate, to take all the necessary measures in the interests of justice and to guarantee the rights of the Accused.  For these reasons the Chamber denies the motions.

The second decision is on the Ngirumpatse motion to exclude 143 Prosecution witness statements filed on the 4th of July 2005.  
The Defence for Ngirumpatse claims that the 143 Prosecution witness statements for rape witnesses filed on 4th July 2005 were not disclosed in a language that the Accused Ngirumpatse understands within the 60-day time limit as prescribed by Rule 66(A)(ii) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  It requests, therefore, that the Chamber excludes all these statements. 

The Prosecution responds that, first, there's no ruling entitling the -- there is no rule entitling the Chamber with the power to exclude disclosure of statements.  Secondly, it argues that since none of these witnesses are going to be called during the year 2005, the Defence will enjoy enough time to prepare its case.  

The Chamber recalls, pursuant to Articles 19 and 20 of the statute, it has to guarantee a fair trial, including that the Accused has sufficient time and facilities to prepare his or her defence and the right to be tried without undue delay.  The Chamber may, therefore, issue orders under Rule 54 of the rules, which are necessary for the preparation and conduct of the trial.  Contrary to the Prosecution's assertion, while this is not the sole remedy, the Chamber has the power to exclude any evidence which has not been disclosed in accordance with the rules. 

In the present case, the Chamber observes first, that the statements were disclosed to the Defence within the time limits prescribed under Rule 66 of the rules.  But of the 143 statements, only 57 are in French, the remaining statements being in English.  Rule 66 states -- Rule 66 witness statements are normally part of the documents related to charges against the Accused.  Pursuant to Article 20, subparagraph (iv), subparagraph (a) of the statute, they should therefore be provided in a language that the Accused understands. 

The Chamber is concerned that, in this situation, the Prosecution failed to comply with its disclosure obligation by not providing the statements in a language that the Accused understands.  The Chamber, however, notes that these witnesses are not intended to be called before 2006 and that the Prosecution will probably be relying on Rule 92 bis of the rules and not call them to testify.  

In view of these statements -- of these circumstances, the Chamber concludes that the exclusion of the statements is not the appropriate remedy in the instant case at this time.  The motion falls, therefore, to be rejected. 

Now, that concludes the decisions that are being delivered at this time, and, in those circumstances, we think that the conditions precedent to commencing the trial are -- are not satisfied and that we could not proceed to schedule the commencement  of the trial. 

At the last sitting, we had indicated that we would expect the parties to prepare themselves for a commencement date on the 19th of September.  The Prosecutor, with support from the Defence of Ngirumpatse, had suggested that we should start on the 21st of September, that's the Wednesday of next week. 

Now, we have thought about this quite a lot, and unless there is a really compelling reason not to do so, we think the trial should start on the 19th of September.  And what I would like to find out, are there any compelling reasons which would make it impossible or impractical to achieve that objective? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, speaking on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera, I would like to first inform you that we have not received the written decisions that you referred to.  And so we're not aware of the reasons why the motions have been disposed of or any -- denied, or any particular comments or indications within those decisions I think it would be helpful for us to read those before proceeding.  

But on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera, we have a number of motions to exclude evidence or exclude testimony of witnesses in the first session, and I would like an opportunity to present those motions.  I'm prepared to do them orally if that's what the Court prefers, or I can do them in writing.  I'm prepared to do them today, if you want to hear them. There's nine of them and, if not, I suggest if you intend to commence the trial on the 19th, that we sit either tomorrow or Friday so that those motions can be heard. 

I think there are serious violations of the rules with respect to disclosure as to several witnesses the Prosecution wishes to call in the first session and that these matters ought to be heard and decided as soon as possible, so that the session can proceed smoothly when it proceeds. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Are there any other (inaudible)?  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, I understood the Court when it said it wanted to start on the 19th and that the trial should start unless there was compelling reasons that made it impractical to do so.  My concern is that the decisions that were rendered today put us in an awkward position, and that's because in order to prepare for this trial session, we've had to coordinate with three different states in order to arrange for the testimony of Witnesses G and T.  And as I speak to the Court right now, I still don't know what is contained in the Trial Chamber's decision because I haven't received it yet. 

We have attorneys that are present outside of this jurisdiction to make arrangements for the testimony of these two witnesses.  I've spoken to him on a daily basis for the last week, and the information that he gives me is that the national authorities are pestering him in order to find -- well, I don't mean to mischaracterise it as pestering, but they are concerned that the information that they need in order to put in place the video link is not forthcoming. 

Even as I speak to you today, I can't say what witness will testify in what order next week.  It all depends on what arrangements can be put in place in order to arrange for the video-link testimony of these two witnesses.  So as a practical matter, we're in an awkward position to proceed on Monday. 

My suggestion is that we start on Wednesday.  I'm not sure if I would characterise the reason as compelling, but I think all of the parties in the Trial Chamber are going to be disadvantaged if we start this trial from a position of unpreparedness.  And it's not unpreparedness for trial per se, it's to take the testimony of the witnesses that have been brought here.  We've been ready to start the trial since the beginning of the month.  We have witnesses here ready to testify, but we cannot put in place the practical mechanisms to receive their testimony without the advanced notice that these decisions that were rendered today provide. 

So in response to the Court's question, the Prosecution is ready.  The Prosecution adopts the position of readiness, but as a practical matter, we would be very much disturbed and would prefer that the trial start on Wednesday, which would give us, at least, two days breathing space to make the arrangements that are appropriate in order to take the testimony of our witnesses in an organised manner.  That's our primary concern, simply being able to organise the order of witness testimony, the exhibits that will be used, and so on and so forth, so that we have no hiccups as we proceed with the trial. 

I believe the last time I addressed the Court I also made the parties and the Trial Chamber aware of the fact that our lead witness, a witness who was in position number one to start the trial, is not presently in this jurisdiction.  He was called away because of a family emergency, and he is not due to return until Sunday.  

Even with respect to his return on Sunday, I, as a team leader, am placing pressure on him to return on Sunday.  And if he returns on Sunday, he will not be a position to start giving testimony on Monday.  So it's a practical matter for all parties and for the good administration of this trial, my recommendation is that we start on Wednesday.  But I leave that matter to the juris -- to the discretion of the Court.  The Prosecutor is ready to proceed, but I think we would all have a much more comfortable and organised beginning of this trial if we started on Wednesday as opposed to Monday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.

Are there any other comments that you need to consider? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Given where we're at in our discussions, I would ask for a small adjournment of 15 minutes so that I could have time to consult with the other Defence teams following the Prosecutor's comments and your comments.  It would be beneficial to us to consult with one another to come up with a common point of view.  

We are here, since the 5th of September, ready to proceed.  You put forth a date of the 19th of September.  If we could have just 15 -- perhaps 10 minutes to consult with one another so that we could come up with a solution and then get back to you, Mr. President. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Well, we've heard the comments that have been made.  I thought that I would just make a comment on the -- on Mr. Robinson's concern.  

We, as presently advised, are not disposed to consider the applications to exclude testimony as matters which are preliminary to the commencement of the trial -- precedent to the commencement of the trial.  We think that those applications which (sic) should be made during the trial, at the time when the witnesses proffered to give evidence.  So we do not think that that's -- that is a reason for trial postponement.  

The applications could be made orally.  If you thought that you had particular legal submissions which would be better presented if you gave written notice of them, then you'd be at liberty to do so, but the applications could be presented orally at a time when it is relevant to the trial proceedings, but having said that, we would now take a short break to permit the consultation on both sides of the table. 
(Court recessed at 1525H)
(Pages 1 to 8 by Jean Baigent)

(Court resumed at 1546H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As we resume, I've been informed that during the recess, the break that we had, the written decisions have been circulated.  Is that correct?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President, we have received the written decision. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Ms. -- Madam Hounkpatin, did you have anything you wish to say at this stage?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Your Honour.  I have a lot of things to say at this juncture.  I requested you to grant us an adjournment so that we could consult with my learned friends here in this case, and I would also like to confirm that we received the written decision.  Of course, we didn't have the time to peruse it as we should and take proper cognizance of it to be able to argue it today.  But our concern here today is that we are in a status conference, and before the break, you indicated a day for the commencement of trial.  And the Prosecutor told us that he was prepared, but he was not prepared at all because no witness is available for this trial on the 19th of September.  That's in three, four days' time.  

Now, under those circumstances, Mr. President, could you imagine the situation which the Defence is put?  We were ready, as I said.  We were ready, we were available in the Chamber, we were ready since the 29th of August.  On the 29th of April we had scheduled a pre-trial or status conference that was postponed to the 5th of September, and that conference, I can't say whether it took place on the 5th of -- of September, because we had another day, that is, today's date.  And if we accepted this date, that is, if accepted the date you're proposing, if we were to tell you that we would be ready to defend the Accused on the 19th, whereas the Prosecutor is saying that he is not ready, he doesn't know which witness is going to come on Monday, it would not be -- tally with the reality of the situation in which the Defence says (unintelligible) of the Defence.  You have caused the final (unintelligible) as far as the commencement of the trial is concerned.  You also have all the data to understand our motion that we forebear from beginning on the 19th under the present circumstances, under the present set of circumstances, at least for the Defence.  The Prosecutor at least should tell us which witnesses are here, in which order they are going to appear on the 19th.  

And yes, we have to have preliminary discussions, the pre-trial discussions that is a little bit more constructive in terms of how we go about the rest of the trial.  Well, so far as we are concerned, there is tremendous dissatisfaction concerning about the 19th.  Now, the reasons we are advancing are totally different from the reasons from the Prosecution.  We're surprised they're not ready for the 19th.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  I just wanted to add one thing, Your Honours.  Perhaps it was a mistake in the -- either I misspoke or the translation wasn't quite accurate, but just to correct the record, I did not state previously that the Prosecutor was not ready.  I've stated that we were ready.  We've been ready since the 5th of September when this case was first set down for the trial.  Witnesses have been here in Arusha since, I believe, it was the 19th of August.  So there are actually four witnesses that are here in Arusha that we can bring before the Court. 

What I said and what I'd like to clarify is that we would have much more efficient administration of this trial if we started on Wednesday as opposed to Monday.  It's not a question of not having witnesses ready to go, but the witness that is the most appropriate witness to testify first is not here.  And as a practical matter, I cannot schedule -- I cannot at this moment provide a scheduling of the witnesses because it's going to require me to contact national authorities and work out the modalities with them, because the scheduling of all the witnesses is contingent upon when Witness T and when Witness G will testify.  So once I can lock in their testimony, then the other witnesses will be built in around their availability. 

If the Court and the parties should recall, I made an application some weeks ago, not only concerning the start of the trial date but when we would finish with this session, because it's of concern to us that we be able to take both Witness T and Witness G this session.  And as things are now scheduled, we will finish on the 28th of October.  So it would actually be helpful for me today to know if there's any possibility of extending the session as well as the issue of whether we start on Monday or on Wednesday, because that will be factored into the discussion that I will have this evening in order to set a date for the testimony of Witness T and Witness G.  

So let me simply reiterate, we are in a position of trial readiness.  I think it's in the best interests of all concerned, including the witnesses themselves, that we start on Wednesday, but I rely on the discretion of the Court to make that decision.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we had worked together with the parties fixing the duration of this trial session, and we had certainly determined that it would conclude on the 28th of October.  Now, that is the current position, but I would imagine that within that, there is a certain degree of flexibility which may have to be exercised depending on the particular circumstances of the case on that date or as we approach that date.  But it's not possible at this time, I think, to revisit, or to modify that decision because it is also contingent on what is going to be happening in other cases.  And so it's too early, I think, for us to make a statement as to whether or not there would be an extension to the 20th of October if it is required at the time.  I think we'll have to work towards that as -- as time goes on. 

We, somehow or the other, having heard your position about readiness, we see it slightly differently.  You see, a lot of the issues that -- that you complain about would resolve at the start of the case.  I don't think -- see any advantage for just sitting on the fence for an extra two days.  The particular problems -- and I think all of us have experience in trial preparation, and I just don't see that there is a particular advantage to be gained for waiting for those extra two days.  

A trial - a Prosecutor has to have -- prepare for contingencies.  And if the witness that you wanted to call first is not, in fact, available, then you have to find another witness to start first.  You've indicated that you have four witnesses in Arusha.  This is a trial where -- where we're not a jury.  The decision is not going to be made immediately after the hearing of the witnesses, and so there's a level at which the order in which these witnesses are called cannot be critical to the final outcome of the case.  So we would think that you should make adjustments.  

What is of interest to the fairness of the trial is that the Defence have an idea or have -- or are informed of the witnesses who are going to be called.  I believe that -- that the decision on the protective measures of Witness G and T puts you in the position where you should know very quickly what dates are likely to be scheduled to their testimony.  And that information could be communicated to the Court and to the Defence as soon as that is available. 

You see, the point is what is quite clear that even if there is a degree of inconvenience, nobody has said they're not ready to start on Monday, and we think that we should go for it, and we would like to start on Monday.  If there are problems that develop, then when -- we will react to those problems and try to respond in a manner that is fair to any problem that anybody has.  But we think that we could iron out the problems during the trial, and we would like to start. 

So in those circumstances I think we would -- we would order that the trial commences on Monday.  And that also gives us, I would think, a better opportunity to address the issue which you referred to, Mr. Webster, in terms of completing a certain group of witnesses during the trial session.  So I think that for all -- all those reasons, it's better for us to start.  And then we don't know what unexpected circumstances we are going to face during the trial, and I think that the earlier we start, the better it is to everybody. 

I do not know if there are any particular orders that we need to make.  I don't -- as far as we are concerned, we think that if there are any issues -- yeah, we, from our point of view, would respond to any communication to our case manager, to the trial coordinator if there is a need for our direction on anything for trial readiness.  We -- from our perspective, we think enough information exists.  

The only issue, really, that is outstanding would be for the Prosecutor to prepare the -- his ordered list -- order of appearance of witnesses.  And I would imagine that -- that that -- Mr. Webster, would you be embarrassed if we ordered that to be filed by tomorrow?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Tomorrow afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Tomorrow afternoon, yeah.  Then we'll make that order that that should be filed by tomorrow afternoon. 

Is there -- are there any other matters?  

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I do have a few other matters that I -- I think that since this is the pre-trial conference, I would like to raise them at this time, and if you want to defer them, you can just interrupt me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And let me know.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will hear you.
MR. ROBINSON:
With respect to the scheduling of first session witnesses, I want to call the Trial Chamber's attention to some particular problems that we believe exist that should be thought about in advance.  

First of all, I would want to state unequivocally that the Defence for Nzirorera is not ready for trial on Monday for the reasons that we've stated before, that the violation of disclosure by the Prosecutor has made it impossible for us to adequately prepare for the cross-examination of these witnesses.  I understand you want that discussed when each witness is about to take the witness stand, and I certainly will be prepared to do that, but I just want to make the record clear, since you did say that nobody has objected to starting on Monday, September 19th, that we most vigorously do object to starting on Monday, September 19th, for the reasons we've stated in our written motion for continuance.  And we are unprepared especially to defend a rape case where we don't know the allegations and have not had even one day available for an investigator to begin the investigation.  

But apart from that, with respect to Witness T, the Trial Chamber has made a request for cooperation to the government of -- to a government which has custody of Witness T that was executed on the 25th of February.  This would be the same government that would be producing him for the video conference and cooperating with the Prosecution to make its witness available.  Yet the many statements taken by the government from this witness, including in-court testimony, have never been provided to us.  And we believe that it would be grossly unfair to have this witness testify in this session when we don't have the disclosure that's been ordered by the Trial Chamber. 

Secondly, there is still pending a written request to interview persons with information concerning Witness T filed on the 25th of July 2005.  You've already ruled that the information from these witnesses are exculpatory and should be provided to the Defence and that the identities of these witnesses should be given to the Defence so they could contact them to be able to get the information necessary to prepare for the cross-examination of Witness T.  But since there's been no ruling on our request to interview those persons, we've been unable to do any investigation or contact with those witnesses to be able to be in a position to cross-examine Witness T.  And for those reasons we think it's impossible for Witness T to testify during this session and in accordance with respecting the rights of the Defence. 

With respect to another witness, Witness HH, the Prosecutor can confirm that the Rwandan statements of this witness, which are -- which I'm advised are extremely voluminous, we only learned of the identity of this witness on the 14th of August, and we've been unable to investigate in Rwanda and meet with other witnesses because of the problems with our investigator and who has been told by the Rwandan government he's not allowed to investigate and to interview witnesses in the prisons.  

I note in one of your motions that I read very briefly, you say I could have another investigator do that, but I don't have another investigator to do that.  The other investigator on our team is not able to travel to Rwanda because he's a refugee, and so we've had no opportunity since we learned of the identity of Witness HH to investigate his statements, and we have no disclosure of his Rwandan statements.  And he is somebody who, I believe, has been sentenced to either death or life imprisonment for many, many crimes committed in Rwanda.  So we don't believe that this witness is in a position to testify until those conditions have been satisfied. 

With respect to other witnesses, we would note that there are approximately 29 statements yet to be translated for Witnesses ALG, UB, GOB, and HH, and that as part of our motion to exclude the testimony of those witnesses, ALG and UB, in particular, we'll be bringing to the attention of the 
Trial Chamber materials which have not been disclosed to us under Rule 68 in breach of the Prosecutor's obligation.  And we'll be making a request that those materials be disclosed to us in unredacted form so that we could contact witnesses who have the exculpatory information before commencing a cross-examination of those witnesses.  

You've asked me to leave those issues till right before the witness testifies, but I predict that those matters will -- could possibly result in the witness not being -- not being able to give testimony at the time required. 

Finally, the last issue I'd like to raise at this pre-trial conference is I would like to make a motion to limit the number of Prosecution witnesses pursuant to Rule 73 bis (D).  That rule provides that the 
Trial Chamber or the designated Judge may order the Prosecutor to reduce the number of witnesses if it considers that an excessive number of witnesses are being called to prove the same facts.  And I cite you to the Bagosora decision entitled "Order of Reduction of Prosecutor's Witness List" on 8 April 2003, in which they order the Prosecution to reduce its witness list from 182 to 100 witnesses.  And they said that including witnesses on the list which the Prosecution does not firmly intend to call places an unmanageable burden on the Trial Chamber and the Defence.  With respect to the 143 sexual assault witnesses that the Prosecution has given notice that it intends to call, I would ask that you make an order reducing that number to 10.  Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the interpreters take this opportunity to have counsel reminded to be slow so that the interpretation can keep the pace with their submissions.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphones overlapping)...I can respond to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, while your headphones were off, the interpreter requested that there be a little slower speech to facilitate the interpretation.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No problem. 

Let me begin with the disclosure matters for Witness T.  The Prosecutor can only disclose what we have.  We've made best efforts to obtain all of the information that Mr. Robinson has alluded to.  I believe some of it has already made its way to him.  Everything that we have in our possession with respect to Witness T that we're under an obligation to disclose has been disclosed.  

As a practical matter, we can only do our best, Your Honour.  We've made efforts to obtain the -- the transcript of the trial in Belgium that Mr. Robinson has referred to, but he, as well, can make efforts on his own to obtain that information.  It's not within our control, but we've made requests to the Belgians.  They're under an order from this Trial Chamber, actually, to provide certain information.  And the only thing we can -- the only thing we can provide to -- to the parties and to the Defence are -- is the information that we ourselves control.  But we've made best efforts in that regard. 

Concerning Witness HH, I have a long file of correspondence that documents our efforts to obtain the Rwandan judicial records of Witness HH.  We have retain -- we have obtained records.  I believe they arrived maybe two or three weeks ago, and this is after making requests over a period of almost a year and a half.  And what we received from the Rwandan government was disclosed to Mr. Robinson.  So he may be disappointed with the quantity, but we have disclosed everything that we have. 

Mr. Robinson also claims that there are disclosure violations with respect to Witnesses ALG, UB, GOB, and HH.  All of those are translation problems, and it's my understanding that with the exception of perhaps two investigators' notes, everything exists in French or in Kinyarwanda, which is the language that the Accused speaks, which is where the legal standard must be applied.  So admittedly, there are documents in Kinyarwanda that have not been translated into English, but as a practical matter and as a legal matter, the -- the bulk of those materials are in a language that the Defence -- excuse me, that the Accused understands.  

If you give me one moment, I can check with my associate legal officer, but the last time I looked at this issue, which was sometime last week, there was only two documents that were only in English.  Everything else was in French or in Kinyarwanda.  And we've made efforts to have these materials translated.  We are in regular contact with the language section.  We've sent reminders.  We've followed up on things, so we've made best efforts in that regard.  

As for the motion of limiting the number of Prosecution witnesses, clearly that is premature.  And I think if the Defence or the parties were interested in narrowing the issues for trial, they would be a bit cooperative on -- in our discussions of clarifying what can be admitted, what the parties can agree to as a preliminary matter before going into the -- the Prosecution evidence.  

With respect to these allegations of sexual violence, the parties were invited to make certain admissions concerning the widespread nature of sexual violence.  We have a motion pending before this Court for judicial notice.  Those are the more appropriate avenues of narrowing the issues for trial, and I would invite Mr. Robinson to reconsider his position that he admits nothing, not even the most elemental facts or exhibits.  And if the emphasis or the concern is to narrow issues from trial, I think the parties, or the Defence more particularly, could be a bit more forthcoming and more forthright in dispensing with issues that are not contentious.  

As for the number of witnesses, yes, we have listed 143 witnesses.  We will be making a filing in due course to eliminate the witnesses that are not going to be called, and we will do that at an appropriate time.  It will not happen today, but we can assure the Trial Chamber that we are looking at this issue, and we will make an appropriate filing in due course.

1615H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it would be helpful if you made some attempt to give a time window, I'm not asking for a date, but a time window within which this will be done. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, the most practical and -- and the deadline that we can -- we can keep to would be the end of November.  Because, at the conclusion of this trial session, we -- we have planned missions to Rwanda and would be able to meet with witnesses and make a definitive choice.  If there's an urgency to have this sort of information before the end of November, the Court can make a suggestion.  

We've already looked at the list.  We certainly have every intention of reducing the number of rape witnesses.  I can give the matter some more thought this afternoon.  And perhaps tomorrow when I make a filing with respect to the -- the witness -- the order of witness testimony, I can clarify some issues with regard to the witness list.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I don't want to carry pending motions if it's at all avoidable.  Is it necessary for us to adjudicate the motion you just made orally right now, or could I invite you to withdraw it and bring it to our attention at a more appropriate time?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, the motion that I made was under 73 bis(D), which is entitled "Pre-Trial Conference," and it's one of the things that is supposed to be ordered at the pre-trial conference.  Now, if you want me to withdraw it and make it at some other time, I'm happy to do so, so long as it's not understood that I've waived any of our rights.  

But as far as I'm concerned, that motion should be adjudicated at the pre-trial conference, under the rules, and I'll abide by any order that you wish to make, including the request that I withdraw the motion and make it again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  When -- I -- I withdraw the phrase "withdraw."  I didn't mean it -- I just didn't want us to be in a position of -- of carrying it.  Part of the reason for that was that the Prosecutor has indicated that he intended to address this matter with a view to apparently giving some of the relief that you were asking for, and it just seemed to me that it would be reasonable to have this matter dealt with after the Prosecutor has made his filing.  So it was in relation to that, that I didn't want to have to -- a pending issue which appeared to be pending for a very long time.  Well, it seemed that there was a date when it would be more reasonable for us to adjudicate, and that was the reason for my comment. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand, Mr. President.  I want to cooperate.  I think also it's important that it be noted that we can't begin to investigate the hundred and forty-three witnesses while that list is subject to change.  I don't think anybody would want us to do that.  So, from our point of view, we feel that that matter should be adjudicated as soon as possible so we can commence our investigations.  But if you don't want to have it on your list of pending motions, if that's the concern, I'll cooperate with the Trial Chamber.  But, from a legal point of view, I want to make it very clear that we're prejudiced by the current state of affairs and we don't want any delay in adjudicating that decision. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, in view of this, can you give us -- can you give a slightly earlier date when you could consider this?  I think it's reasonable for you to have an opportunity to make the submission to which you referred in your comment earlier.  But, obviously, the sooner it's done, the better.  You had suggested that -- that -- you gave two dates.  You gave a date at the end of November, and then you suggested giving some further thought overnight.  Is there some period between those two periods that we could look at as a sort of point where we could consider this matter?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  I propose to -- to make the filing by the end of this trial session, on the 28th of October.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Webster, I have before me 73 bis, paragraphs (B), (D), and (E). 

You have that?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I also refer to the scheduling order we made.  

Do -- is there anything you'd like to say with regard to the list of witnesses in view of the provisions of those rules?  
MR. WEBSTER:
As a -- excuse me.  As a preliminary matter, Your Honour, there's nothing in the rules that puts a finite number on the number -- on the number of witnesses that is appropriate or inappropriate.  And if we've listed 143 witnesses to prove our rape charge, it's because we thought -- we've made a determination that that is what is necessary.  And at this stage it's premature, and Mr. Robinson has not articulated a basis to suggest that the number of witnesses is excessive to prove the same facts.  

Now, I've already made an indication that we will review the list.  And in -- in the interests of a good administration of justice and to conserve the resources of the Tribunal, we will eliminate names.  But I think it's inappropriate -- or, it's not -- it's not reasonable to put us in a position to do that now or to do that before we have conducted the necessary follow-up investigations.  

In terms of narrowing the issues for trial, which is fundamentally what is at issue here, focusing on the same facts, if the Court is in a position to concede -- or, that the party is in a position to concede that there was widespread sexual violence in Rwanda in 1994, then, of course, we can dispense with a great number of the witnesses.  But our -- our obligation under the -- under the terms of the statute, in order to prove the crime on the indictment, is that we have to prove that there are widespread and systematic rapes for the rape charge -- for the rape count, or that these rapes were committed as part of a widespread attack against a civilian population.  And we assume that burden of proof.  Mr. Robinson, or the Defence, have put that in us -- put us in that position.  

We have a motion pending for judicial notice on this very issue.  And I think the appropriate course to follow is to resolve that judicial notice motion first and to ask the Defence, or Mr. Robinson, if there's anything in our list of admissions, which is also under -- governed by 73 bis, that he would like to consider because that will substantially save the resources of this Tribunal.  If we are calling 143 witnesses, it's because we are attempting to prove the counts on this indictment that the Court has just approved today.  

So I'll simply repeat what I stated earlier:  By the end of this trial session, we'll make a determination.  If the Court puts us in a position and orders us or gives us a finite date, we will comply with it, but I think the most appropriate path to follow is to await the end of the trial session and await our submission.  We've agreed that it's in the interest of justice for us to do that, but it's not appropriate for -- for Mr. Robinson to suggest that it's -- it's something that needs to be done at this moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if we can -- Mr. -- Mr. Weyl, are you on the same subject or on something else?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I didn't hear your question because I have a problem with my headphones.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I was asking if you were on the same subject that we were just discussing or was it something new. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I wanted to deal with this specific matter because I am not quite happy with the manner in which the Prosecutor is presenting the matters.  I cannot remain silent for the record when the Prosecutor says that he's doing his best.  He is doing his worst, in our view, we submit.  He's doing everything in his power to make things difficult.  And what should be looked at first, he's suggesting, be looked at afterwards.  

Mr. Webster is very crude in his pronouncements.  He has just said, Mr. President, Your Honours, that if you allow my judicial notice motion, I will then consider my -- a hundred and forty-three witnesses, but I will maintain my 143 witnesses if you do not allow my judicial notice motion.  I think he is holding you hostage.  

I need to know how to behave, and this will be dependent on the list of witnesses.  This is not -- it's not a very faithful manner of behaving.  He is talking about a decision which has not been rendered because of the needs of the parties but because of the proceedings that need to be done.  He needs to come here with a serious list.  He has come, and he says that if you aren't going to reduce his time limits, he's telling you, Mr. President, if you allow my judicial notice motion, at that point in time, I will tell you whether I maintain my 143 witnesses or not.  

This is unacceptable because, once again, we are experiencing the idea that the Prosecution believes and depends on constant surprise.  This is unacceptable.  

And when you were saying, Mr. President, that you had understood that we were ready for trial, maybe this was a problem of translation or interpretation.  Ms. Hounkpatin said a moment ago that we were in the hands of the Prosecutor, that we were in such a situation and also would rely on decisions which you will render in a situation which has been ongoing for seven years.  And we need to benefit from the time that we have by having testimony which is manipulated, in -- in a way of -- in a manner of speaking.  This is unacceptable, and on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse's Defence, let me submit that we do not understand this as being the Prosecutor's desire to ensure that we have a fair and equitable trial.  

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Yes, you see, we had a proposal to address this issue, which we thought couldn't be dealt with by making a scheduling order.  We were thinking that we would give a date by which the Defence would file a written motion on the application for reduction of witnesses, that the Prosecutor would be allowed to file his response on the 20th of October, and the Defence would have five days to reply.  So in that case, we would now have certainty as to the process by which this matter would be addressed.  We do not -- we are not going to be able to address it right now, and I would imagine that if you file your motion -- is it ten days before the -- before the 20th of October?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Five days. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Five days before the 20th of October.  What date is that?  Yes, the 23rd of October?  The 23rd of October.  And then Mr. -- the Prosecutor would file their response on the 28th -- 

Twentieth is a Sunday?  Thank you.  It's the 24th.  Yeah, the 24th of October.  The Prosecutor would -- would file a response on the 20th of October.  We had originally thought that we would give you another five days to reply and that -- that would, in our view, address -- address this issue of the number of witnesses.  Would that be an appropriate schedule in order for us to meet?  

And, in that case, what we would do, instead of limiting it to you, all of the appli -- the orders will be in your application, Mr. Robinson.  We would extend liberty to all Defence teams, if they wished to also make submissions on that date -- by that date.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I -- I, obviously, will comply with the scheduling order, but I think our position has to be that any delay in limiting the number of witnesses is prejudicial to the Defence and we would prefer to have the matter decided immediately.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. -- Mr. Sow, did that address the concern you were going to make -- to raise?  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  That is why I didn't feel it was necessary for me to return to the matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

With regard to the issues -- for -- about disclosure and the allegations of violation, that is not a matter which we can adjudicate on -- now.  We have heard from the Prosecutor that there has been compliance with his disclosure obligations.  As we have mentioned, these are matters which could result in different remedies during the trial.  I think the Prosecutor has had adequate notice of the complaints of the Accused.  He has expressed a view that those expressed are groundless, and we will have to make our rulings if and when these matters arise during the trial.  I do not think that this is a reason for postponement.  

Are there any other issues?  Are there any other issues?  Any other issues?  

Mr. Robinson, I think we've addressed everything that has been raised in your submission. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I don't think there has been any discussion of the timing issues I raised with respect to Witness T and Witness HH, in particular.  And if you want to postpone that to the time you see the order of witnesses, that's certainly an option that's available to you.  But I think it's something that's more appropriately decided at the pre-trial conference, to give some guidance to the Prosecutor before he makes his order of witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Robinson, you see, we cannot do anything at this stage because we'll be acting in abstract, without information.  The Prosecutor has heard what you have said.  He knows what the rules are, and one will have to act on the premise that he will make a reasonable response to the points that have been raised.  I don't think there's anything the Chamber can do at this stage.  If at the time these witnesses appear there are problems, then we will adjudicate at that time.  I don't think there's any order that we should make on these issues at this time.  

Is there any other business that needs to be addressed before we adjourn, close today's session?  Well -- 

Yes, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
One last point of curiosity.  What Trial Chamber -- what courtroom will we be appearing in on Monday?  And I hope that I will be told to come back to this courtroom, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster -- Mr. Webster, I can give you -- I can give you a short-term lift --
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and tell you that we will be here on Monday. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are actively exploring the use of the courtroom that we'll have for the whole trial, and we now know that we have access to this courtroom next -- during the course of next week.  

Okay.  Those circumstances, and hopefully on an upbeat note, I can close our session today.  So we now raise.
(Court adjourned at 1640H)
