MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 25th of August 2008, for a status conference in the matter of the Prosecutor vs. Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Hometowu.  

Appearances, please. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the Prosecution, Don Webster, Alayne Frankson-Wallace, Saidou N'dow, Gerda Visser, and 
Takeh Sendze.  Good morning to the Chamber and to the parties and to the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
For the Defence of Mr. Édouard Karemera, I am Dior Diagne.  With me is Félix Sow and 
Ms. Fatou Ndour.  Mr. Karemera has excused himself for two minutes, Mr. President, and he will be back to the courtroom.  On this note, I would like to say good day to all of you. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm Frédéric Weyl, representing Mr. Ngirumpatse and assisted by Marina Yetongnon.  As the Chamber would notice, my client is absent, and he is still hospitalised in Moshi.
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, Your Honours, good morning.  I am José Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi.  I am co-counsel for Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, who is right here.  And with me is our assistant, 
Mr. Léopold Nsengiyumva, Mr. President.  I am obliged, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

The purpose of the status conference is to decide how we are going to proceed with our case.  We have received and published the medical report which we've received concerning Mr. Ngirumpatse, and I presume that everybody has access to the same information.  So, in the light of that, are there any submissions or suggestions as to the most appropriate and effective way of advancing?  

I would like to mention in the context of that that there is already a schedule for the hearing of video link conference from Canada, which is already scheduled for the 29th of September, and I think that we have to make a special decision with regard to that activity, in addition to -- separately from any other decision that we take on other -- other aspects of our proceedings. 

So I don't know if anybody has any suggestions or submissions that they would like to start. 

Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour.  Well, we -- as we stated earlier, we wish Mr. Ngirumpatse a speedy recovery.  It's unfortunate that he is ill.  I don't think the information we received from Dr. Epée changes anything materially with respect to the way the Chamber addressed this issue last week.  I take note of the decision that Mr. Robinson shared with us, and then recalling, as the Chamber did, paragraph 15 of the Appeals Chamber decision in our own case, it seems as if we would not be able to proceed in the absence of Mr. Ngirumpatse at this stage.  

So I will simply rely on the Court's discretion with respect to when we should come back together.  One month would take us to the 15th of September, so it's possible that we could reschedule a session until the 15th of September and have three additional weeks.  I am not sure how much sense that makes, if it's likely that Mr. Ngirumpatse would need more time to recover.  I don't know.  It really depends on the medical assessment, and only Dr. Epée could help us with that. 

But, having said that, the three weeks or month that we are losing now don't have to be completely lost.  We are all able to continue work on the case.  This Court has several decisions that have to be decided, one of which is an application from Ngirumpatse's team for an extension to complete their Rule 73 ter filing.  And when that motion for an extension of time was made, the presumption was that we would be going forward with the trial.  So if we are off for an additional three weeks, I would think that the three weeks that Ngirumpatse has requested should really provide enough time for all 
Rule 73 ter submissions to be fully -- to be filed in their entirety.  

At last count, the Ngirumpatse team had listed over 300 witnesses, and the Nzirorera team had listed over 200 witnesses.  So it seems to me that the month that we're off provides an opportunity for the Defence teams to expedite their investigations and to clarify -- to offer us some clarifications on which witnesses would actually be called to testify.  So the time that we're off from court doesn't mean that it's time lost in advancing the case.  It actually provides an opportunity for us to make a very clear assessment of what the evidence -- what Defence evidence will be offered for the duration of the trial.  

So I would urge the Chamber to decide some of the outstanding motions, and at the top of the list would be the current applications for extension of time to complete Defence investigations.  And I would hope that in another three weeks those -- particularly with respect to Ngirumpatse's witness list and Nzirorera's witness list, that we would have some clarifications. 

But beyond that, we are in the Court's hands.  And I would hope, once again, that Mr. Ngirumpatse has a speedy recovery and that we are able to resume as quickly as possible. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl, I can recognise you. 
MR. WEYL: 
Your Honour, allow me first and foremost to thank Mr. Webster for his wishes of speedy recovery, which will be well forwarded as I will be going to see Mr. Ngirumpatse at Moshi tomorrow, and I will make sure I extend those unusual greetings from the Prosecution.  And, in the same manner, I have extended the wishes which you generously extended to him during the last session last Monday.  And I generally subscribe to Counsel Webster's submissions, but I have two comments to make. 

First, the medical report from Dr. Epée gives a clue as to the minimum time for Mr. Ngirumpatse to hopefully recover and to be in a position to attend the proceedings, which is different from what we knew or were advised about last Monday, because we have an idea of the time he has to spend in hospital.  And, also, the Trial Chamber would certainly be in a better state to set things, because now we can look forward to an adjournment of one month.  

And let me point out that Dr. Epée said that rest period would be minimum one month, but perhaps we should look forward to a greater time limit, depending on how fast Mr. Ngirumpatse would recover.  But we have to say he would be unavailable for at least one month from last Monday.  

The second comment I have to make in regard to Counsel Webster's submission is that we do not -- we shall leave no stone unturned to be up to speed.  And last week, if I was alone, it is because 
Marina Yetongnon was away.  And I hope that we will continue to work hard, as we've always been doing.  And since the Trial Chamber has to be convinced that we are working absolutely hard, it is obvious that if there is any respite emanating from any adjournments, we certainly would be dispensed of attending proceedings.  We are going to make the best use of the time afforded us.  

And the Trial Chamber should be advised that I'll be going on mission to Rwanda in two days, hoping that mission will be productive.  There is somewhat -- there is a delay with the administrative formalities in respect of the witness and victims protection unit, and we hope that these issues will be resolved, and that the vagaries will be overcome.  We are trying to do our level best to achieve our objectives. 

Mr. President, these are the comments I have to make. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour, I would like to share with you the concerns caused by the unfortunate plight of Mr. Ngirumpatse, and this has had some impact.  As you are well aware, our witness (sic) had already made it to Arusha and were forced to leave, and, as you are fully aware, sir, a new wave of witnesses were expected today.  Mr. Daff from WVSS, whom I can see in front of you, would certainly explain.  And we had to make sure these witnesses do not board their flights at the last minute for Arusha.  

And, as far as our team is concerned, sir, there was quite some damage, unfortunately.  Nobody is to blame.  These things do happen.  People take ill, and we do understand and make do with the situation.  And we understand that we need to review our cards to ensure that we have a specific date and also to make sure that the witnesses who had given notice of their availability -- for instance, a witness who had secured leave, and you know leave is granted once a year, and this witness was -- would be unable to come, and this witness had to testify for Mr. Karemera, and we wonder how we are going to secure their return.  

I hope, Mr. President, that you would make it a bounding duty to help us out of this predicament which has come up and which has hit our team.  And this is a source of concern that Mr. Karemera's team wished to voice and share with you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

And, sir, I believe that, as much as possible, we should strive to be more specific in the review or the planning of the proceedings.  I understand Dr. Epée has given Mr. Ngirumpatse a minimum of one month of bed -- bedrest before he can come back to the courtroom.  We are not physicians, and neither are you, sir, but I believe the Trial Chamber should consider setting aside a period to assess over one month Mr. Ngirumpatse's health so as to determine how new dates should be set.  

And, as I was saying -- or, as I had said, sir, earlier, I did not know if my witnesses who had come to Arusha, and those who were expected, would be rescheduled as again.  And I believe that, as far as Karemera's team is concerned, and who is alone in this plight, I believe you should consider scheduling these witnesses at different times of the year based on their availability and the goodwill of their employers and other factors so as to ensure that Mr. Karemera is not punished by this situation, which is nobody's fault. 

So, initially, I thought I should share my concerns with you and to repeat that, as far as setting the resumption is concerned, I heard Mr. Webster mention three weeks.  Right now we are somewhat confused with our calculation.  The medical report has mentioned one month of bedrest, and for somebody who is still in hospital, to whom we wish speedy recovery, Mr. President, this should, however, not deter us from being -- from anticipating on events, from being preemptive, and to seek ways and means of setting a new date so as to enable all and sundry to review their plans as a result of Mr. Ngirumpatse's unfortunate and unpredictable illness. 

Mr. President, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. NIMY: 
Your Honours, first, we are concerned.  We have three issues to raise.  Firstly, obviously, for that matter, we cannot miss this opportunity to extend our deepest sympathy to Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who is ill, and we wish him a speedy recovery.  

Secondly, regarding the calendar itself, specifically the set video link from Canada, we are somewhat bound by the outplay of events.  If all goes well, and if by the 29th of September the Court is able to meet, as far as we are concerned, we do not have any problem with that. 

Thirdly, sir, this I gather from witnesses we meet during the recess, and this specifically was during the last recess, there is a problem, sir.  There is a problem.  Our witnesses are increasingly terrorised by Kigali, and this is very serious, and for their families who are in Rwanda, because most of our witnesses still have their families back in Rwanda.  And the government of Kigali is virtually -- or literally hunting them down, and the witnesses have advised us to give you notice.  And we have seen cases of key witnesses who were very enthused but who have drawn back at the last minute because of the fear of certain reprisals on their families in Rwanda. 

Mr. President, we wish that you exercise your discretion, your powers, to remind the authorities of Kigali that they have no right to intimidate witnesses in any manner whatsoever, and that for those of us of the Defence, this is an issue of the greatest essence, to ensure that our witnesses are allowed to exercise their rights.  
These, I thought, Mr. President, I should recall.  I am hoping that this matter will be dear to you and that you are going to recall -- or remind the authorities of Kigali that, as far as the Tribunal is concerned, you take this matter very seriously. 

I am obliged, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL: 
Your Honour, on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse, I would, of course, want to join my voice to the last remarks made by Mr. Nimy.  We are facing the same difficulties, and that is in line -- as a matter of fact, it is worse; that what we have presented to the Chamber with regard to the protection of our witnesses, we are, indeed, facing serious difficulties with witnesses who are pressurised and coming under threats themselves and their families, and I would like to second the request made by Mr. Nimy, that you should use your authority to ensure, as far as possible, the integrity of evidence and the possibility for witnesses to -- to present their evidence using witnesses of their choice and with the need, therefore, to be ensured security and protection and guarantees. 

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm a bit surprised by the comments offered by Mr. Nimy and Mr. Weyl.  I've not received any communication from the Defence suggesting that there were any improprieties with respect to their witnesses.  This is news to us.  But beyond that, these are just blanket accusations against the government of Rwanda.  

I recall that when we were in the Prosecution phase of this case, the Prosecution had -- was able to articulate very specific complaints against the Defence teams with respect to various specifically identified witnesses, and this Chamber consistently advised the Prosecution at that time to -- to document our complaints and to make motions to support our applications.  So I would suggest if the Chamber could make a similar suggestion to the Defence at this point, if there are incidents that the Defence would like to complain of, they should document them and they should follow with motions.  But even short of that, they can communicate directly with the Office of the Prosecutor.  

This Chamber has already issued witness protection motions for the Defence, and recently a 
no-contact order for their witnesses with -- of Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera.  I can assure the Chamber that the Prosecution has not even begun to attempt to investigate those witnesses.  We've had no communication with the government of Rwanda with respect to the witnesses for 
Nzirorera or Ngirumpatse, so I'm quite surprised by the allegations that have been made.  But I would urge the Defence teams to contact us.  We have an interest in the integrity of these proceedings and in ensuring that this Chamber's protection orders are respected.  And we would certainly follow up on that if we had very specific information. 

But beyond that, rather than making blanket and unsubstantiated allegations, I would advise the Defence teams to file motions with specific information that can be investigated.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, I would like, in this regard, to remind the Prosecutor that we have previously, at least twice, raised the issues regarding difficulties our witnesses were -- were facing.  If it is true that 
Witness RQU had to come here for cross-examination by the OTP, or by the Prosecutor, was unable to return, because when he went back to Rwanda, he came under persecution to an extent leading him to hiding.  

We also have the case of a witness who appeared here, CKB.  Once he returned to Rwanda, the witnesses to whom they talked about their testimony, especially the Prosecution witness, those were, indeed, the people who went and provided the information that they had come to Arusha to testify.  

You have the situation of XCU who had to appear before this Court and who, as we speak, is unable to return to Rwanda.  I am persuaded that this is not imaginary in nature.  It's important for us to face things as they are.  We have to look at things the way they are.  We are well aware that once we have the list and identities of our witnesses, if there are investigations which are made in Rwanda, the Rwandan authorities are informed.  And we are aware of this. 

So we are going to find ourselves in this situation where, as we speak, we have problems to bring witnesses here from Rwanda because all today have to leave Rwanda, and it is an extremely serious situation.  And I am not talking about teams which are -- who are already having their witnesses appeared, and we have done so.  And I will have three witnesses who find themselves in a situation where their security is endangered, and as a result, they are forced not to return to Rwanda, or, in any event, when they return to Rwanda, they were forced to leave. 

I was saying a while ago, Your Honour, you will notice that when we bring witnesses here, we are compelled to do so with lots and lots of care and circumventions to ensure their security, because you never see witnesses here who are going to go through the official channels or Rwandan authorities.  I'll be surprised by that. 

In any case, up to now, we have tried as hard as we can.  But we have noticed that their security has been seriously threatened.  I believe that, for now, this is a motion, but this is something which we have gone through and which we continue to go through.  And, therefore, even the witnesses who have to return to Rwanda today, we are not sure that they would be able to appear before this Chamber again.  So we have to deal with this in as diligent as a manner as possible for the best possible solution.  

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think we will rise and take a few minutes to consider our response to the various matters which have been raised this morning before making a scheduling order. 

There is just one matter which I -- I had flagged the specific issue of the video conference that had been scheduled for the 29th of September with the idea that I might have heard something as to whether consideration would have been given to special arrangements for that conference, regardless to the overall status of the trial.  I don't know if I should accept that the remarks made by Mr. Nimy are an implication that those proceedings would go on with special approval from Mr. Ngirumpatse, if that's required. 

But, in the meantime, I don't expect to have an answer right now.  What we will do, we will just rise for a few minutes and consider the issues that have been raised. 

Yes, Mr. Nimy. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour, I would like you to also consider two items.  Your Honour, the video conference billed for the 29th is part and parcel of the proceedings, and we cannot avoid that situation.  Although I am aware, Your Honour, you are raising this issue because the organisation of a video link is difficult, but I think we have to be logical.  If not an audience -- if this -- if the Court is not in session, then it is not.  And I can't see how this wouldn't affect the rights of Mr. Ngirumpatse. 

Secondly, Mr. Peter Robinson has sent a submission in which he was praying you to adjourn the trial, at least for three months, by including jurisprudence.  If that request has been made, it is probably because we are unable to carry on with the trial on the 29th, or to resume proceedings in the absence of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And that is what I wanted to let you know before you adjourned in order to examine it. 

MR. NIMY: 
I'm sorry, Your Honour, since I raised this issue, I would like to be specific.  I mentioned that if on the 29th of September everything returned to normal, that is to say, Mathieu is well and that the trial can resume under those conditions, we can consider the video conference -- the video link. 

Of course, if at that date Mathieu continues to find himself in the situation in which he is to do -- he is today, it will not be possible to have a video link because the trial would not be possible.  A video link out of a trial is something we cannot consider, and I would like to thank Dior who took that off my lips and what Peter Robinson also expressed in his submissions.  Therefore, there will be no video link out of the trial proceedings in which Mathieu Ngirumpatse participates.  That is clearly what I am saying, Your Honour. 
MR. WEYL: 
Your Honour, maybe a tiny word on that issue.  A few contributions, both with regard to witnesses who are all over the world or in Rwanda, the situation forces us to review and reschedule, that is for the same reason that the video link from Canada has also been scheduled, though it is not predictable.  29th of September is in one month's time.  Dr. Epée's report shows that for now she does not believe that the trial can resume in the presence of Mr. Ngirumpatse before one month, and that is leading us up to the 29th of September, thereabouts.  Maybe in subsequent reports she is going to tell all that one month is not adequate, and we may have to consider two months.  Then we would be able to analyse. 

But if we are basing our arguments on the possibility of one month, then there will be no major obstacle for the video link to be held within the framework of the trial.  Those are the possible scenarios we can look forward to.  That is to say, minimum one month, we are agreed.  If in 15 days she tells us one further month, then maybe we will have to adjourn the video link which was planned from Canada. 

If she tells us that -- that things are going to come to end by the end of September, then the video link could be maintained.  And that raises another issue about the rescheduling of all the other witnesses who are not easy to mobilise and as -- which Ms. Dior Diagne already talked about. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I have a practical suggestion, which is that the video link be rescheduled for the first day that we would resume in -- towards the end of October, and that way there would be less speculation of Mr. Ngirumpatse's health.  And to the extent that long-term planning is required in order to set it up and get the co-operation of the state authorities, it may simply be easier to reschedule it now for the very first day that we resume with the following trial session.  But I leave it to the Court's discretion.  

Clearly, the Defence have made themselves clear, that they would not consent to special arrangements to receive evidence with the video link outside of the context of the trial session itself.  So, just for logistics and planning, it may be wise to make it the first witness that we hear when we resume for the third session, which I believe is scheduled for the 27th of October.  But I leave that for the Court and the registry.  Thank you. 
MR. NIMY: 
Your Honour, no, I believe Mr. Webster didn't quite comprehend.  In any event, what I said -- I am not saying we are not ready for the video link.  If the video link had to be held on the 29th of September, we would be ready.  We are, indeed, ready.  

The issue here is, indeed, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So this is no speculation on the situation of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  It's a real and true situation.  It's no speculation. 

If Mr. Ngirumpatse is not there, there can be no trial.  That is the basis.  Quite simply, we're saying if Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse is here, and if he is here on the 29th of September, we would have to -- well, we will be ready for the video link.  And if it is not there, there will be -- and if he is not here, there will be no link -- there will be no trial.  If there is no link -- if he is not here, there will be no link, and there will be no trial. 

Now, if we are looking at dates in October, basically, that is not a bad choice.  If it is in October, and the idea is to adjourn further, then there is nothing in setting a date.  So we'd lose nothing in which you have all the items necessary for us to set specific dates.  

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Yes.  We will rise for a short while to consider our decision.
(Court recessed at 0955H) 
(Pages 1 to 10 by Joe Reynosa)










(Court resumed at 1038H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you for waiting on us.  We have considered the issues that have been raised this morning in some detail, and we think that the best method of proceeding would be to schedule to have a status conference on the 15th of September.  So we will continue.  

We will now formally -- we'll now formally adjourn the proceedings until that date and we will resume with a status conference.  That status conference will be preceded by written exchange of information which would include updates on the medical reports that are available on the health of Mr. Ngirumpatse, which will enable proper decisions to be taken at that time.  We would expect that 
the parties would be ready to proceed shortly after the status conference if the health position of 
Mr. Ngirumpatse permits it.  So, there should be some preparation for proceeding on or shortly after that date.  In that context, we think it would be more appropriate to make decisions concerning the video conference during that status conference.  So we will, at this stage, not interfere with the current schedule of the 29th of September. 

Lastly, with regard to the issue of the complaint about the security of Defence witnesses made by counsel for Nzirorera, and to which there was some seconding, we should -- we recall that, as of now, Nzirorera has not made an application for protection to the extent that the witnesses should be anonymous and it may be a result of statements made by Counsel Robinson that his client had the intention of making such an application.  We don't think that even if statements of that nature were made, that would necessarily bind the litigant.  

As of now, however, the Court has directed that the information concerning the potential witnesses be kept and filed confidentially, so the public have not got access to that information.  And the Prosecutor has -- is bound by the so-called "no content order" which was issued recently.  Protective measures have been made in regard to the other accused persons in this trial.  What we think should happen is that information -- evidence should be adduced, backed up by legal submissions to inform any other actions that the Chamber needs to take.  For example, the witness who did not appear for cross-examination, we have not received any evidence concerning the position.  We have had a few remarks made about it, but that does not put us in a position to make any judicial orders.  So we would expect that -- well, I should mention in that regard that that is an important issue that needs to be flagged, because at some stage the Court would have to decide whether to exclude the testimony of that witness if it is not subject to cross-examination.  So it's an important issue that that matter needs to be properly resolved in the absence of any evidence basis.  It is difficult for the Court to make any further orders or directions at this stage.  So we indicate that the Defence is at liberty to apply with supporting evidence if the intervention of the Court is required to guarantee the integrity of the trial and to assist in ensuring that the witnesses are protected.  

If there is no further business, we can take our adjournment until the 15th of September. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I thank you, Mr. President, for the decision you have just rendered.  We would, nevertheless, need some details; the -- more so as we have been accustomed to coming with Mr. Daff of the witness protection section, and have envisaged a status conference for the 15th of September, which is in about less than three weeks.  

Mr. President, I had envisaged before we adjourn to point out to you that we had considered proceeding with our trial immediately after the status conference, if Mr. Ngirumpatse's health allows us to do so.  But I have some practical questions, Mr. President.  Would you also suggest that we schedule the appearance of our witnesses in Arusha on that date of the 15th of September because, as you know, from now to that date, you have just said it's about two and half weeks, regarding the witnesses who have just left and the others who have not been able to come back and others who would -- whose appearance would have to be scheduled?  

Mr. President, I think Mr. Édouard Karemera's Defence team should be given two and half weeks to take stock of that situation.  This poses a problem to our team and this is as a result, Mr. President, of what I have been accustomed to telling you, as of the 5th of December 2007, we are working under circumstances that are untenable, Mr. President.  We are having to bend over backwards and we are working under considerable pressure.  If we have a status conference on the 15th of September, I do very well understand your decision because you are ultimately thinking of medical updates that have to be made, but I believe that you should factor into your decision the situation of Mr. Karemera.  

So, my question to you is as follows:  Would you ask Mr. Daff of the WVSS, here present, to arrange for our witnesses to come to Arusha bearing in mind the deadlines of the WVSS and also our own deadlines, these witnesses may not be here in September.  You should bear that in mind.  

I would like you to state clearly in your decision that Karemera's Defence team, in view of this rather unexpected situation, should arrange for those witnesses to come by that date.  It is not always easy for them to be available, so you should specify whether our witnesses should be brought to Arusha by that date of the 15th of September. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought that the position was clearer than you have interpreted it to be.  The decision to schedule a status conference rather than resumption of the trial implied that what would be occurring on our resumption would be a decision as to when and how the trial would proceed.  We said it would be on the 15th of September that we will consider the date upon which the trial will resume.  However, the circulation of written information before the status conference would provide an opportunity for preliminary consideration of the available medical information which should give advance notice whether Mr. Ngirumpatse would be available during the week of the 15th or not.  It is really at that time that the expense of bringing witnesses to Arusha could be justified.  So what we will expect is that in the meantime, that your Defence team would make tentative arrangements that would enable you to respond to a decision that was taken on the 15th of September.  It may very well be -- and if that -- WVSS, if they got instructions, would be able to bring the witnesses here on two or three days' notice if advance preparation had been made.  But I don't think that is appropriate for us today to direct that the expense of bringing them to Arusha on the 15th should be incurred until we have a bit more information that would justify such a decision.  So what we expect now is preparatory work and a decision on the 15th of September. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, your indulgence.  I would like to simply point out to you that that is not what we heard from the French interpreter and that is why your decision posed some problems to me, because we have met precisely for that and that is why I have asked for some clarifications because we were told that there would indeed be a status conference on the 15th of September, but that all the teams should be prepared to resume proceedings immediately thereafter, and that is why I wanted you to clarify the situation regarding witnesses.  The interpretation that we received this time around, Mr. President, made your point clearer.  

I would like to point out at this stage, Mr. President, that the arrival of witnesses could be arranged as you have suggested, that is, on the basis of written submissions and exchanges.  On the basis of such exchanges, we can determine what we could do as of the 15th of September and WVSS could also 
tell us whether it is possible to arrange for the witnesses to be brought to Arusha.  Of course, 
Mr. President, as I have told you, WVSS can only disclose information provided by the witnesses themselves.  And let us keep our fingers crossed, and at the date of that status conference we can then arrange for the witnesses to come to Arusha three days later.  But I would, therefore, be in a position to say that at that point it may not be possible.  I do not want us to be scapegoats in this matter.  We should try to organise the appearance of witnesses in a concerted matter (sic).  I say concerted because we can only make a concerted decision on the basis of the availability of witnesses and their own schedules.  I would like the Chamber to bear all that in mind and do everything to make sure that the Karemera team is not put under pressure at that time.  And I again crave the Court's indulgence for any misunderstandings regarding what I have just said.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I think the matter is now clear, and we take our adjournment until the 15th of September.  Unless anybody else has anything else that requires to be addressed.  
Okay.  In that case, we take the adjournment. 
(Court adjourned at 1057H)
