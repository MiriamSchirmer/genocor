MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Could the Registry introduce the case coming before the Trial Chamber this morning, please. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 9th of April 2003, for the continuation of the Defence case, when Prosecution counsel, Ms. Ojemeni, will continue with the cross-examination of expert witness, Professor François Xavier Bangamwabo (DW27), in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registrar.

May we have the appearances of the parties, starting with the Prosecution, for the record, please.
MS. OJEMENI:

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  

May we also have the appearance of the Defence, for the record, please.
MR. HINDS:
Good morning, Your Honour.  Lennox Hinds, representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Juliette Chinaud, research assistant, and Emilien Dusabe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel. 

Witness, the Trial Chamber, again, reminds you of the solemn declaration you made last Monday and that you'll continue with your testimony today on that same solemn declaration.  Yes, professor.

Okay, we'll start your cross-examination. 

Professor, if you can be very precise and brief, so that we would like to see how far we are to go, and we would like to go fast so that we come to the end of your testimony in the course of the day. 
Yes, learned counsel, Ms. Ojemeni for the Prosecution. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS OJEMENI:
Q.	Yesterday, we adjourned on page 27, and I'm moving on -- at page 27 and I'm moving on to page 28 of the English text.
A.	Which part's it in the report in French, please?
Q.	It's page -- should be on page 20, the French text.  Page 20 starts with the sentence, "Current or former local civilian authorities", and that can be found on page 20 of the French text, under item 5, first paragraph.  The last four lines of the French text, under item 5, the first -- the last four lines on the first paragraph. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a continuation from page 27.
MS. OJEMENI:
It's a continuation of the item --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
-- "Massacres of civilians following the 8 February" --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
-- "1993". 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, have you found it?  Look at item 5 on page 20, the first paragraph, the last four lines of the first paragraph.  And I'm drawing your attention to the sentence "Current or former local civilian authorities around the combat zones were particularly being targeted because they had failed to succumb to RPF pressure and anyone who fell into their hands was eliminated".  

My question is this: how many of these civilian authorities were killed? 
A.	Let me indicate that most of them fled, and when I refer to the authorities who were unable to flee, be it during this period or periods prior to that particular date, there was the example of the bourgmestre of Kinigi, but there were also other authorities, in particular, those who were captured in Ruhengeri town; they were assassinated.  And I have mentioned the case of the president of the court of appeal.
Q.	Witness, my question, then, is how many were killed and how many survived? 
A.	I did not carry out an inventory, but the situation was such that all fled, and those who did not flee were assassinated.  I have given the example of Thaddée Gasana, because in many cases the others were able to flee.
Q.	And what is your source for the information you have given on this page concerning the people who were killed and the people who fled?  What is your source?  Please answer just the source.
A.	There's this letter of the préfectural committee of Ruhengeri which mentions the case of Bourgmestre Gasana, but it also mentions the former bourgmestre of Nyamugali commune in Ruhengeri, obviously.  This was Nicodéme (sic) Barezi.  I can spell the name if you so wish.  The surname is B-A-R-E-Z-I, Nicodémus.  And he was the bourgmestre of Nyamugali commune in Ruhengeri préfecture.

As for Gasana, he was working at Kinigi.  I don't know whether I have to spell that name or whether it's easy to spell.  Gasana is spelt G-A-S-A-N-A. 
Q.	Okay, witness, what is your source for this information you have given the Court?  What is the source?
MR. HINDS:
Asked and answered, Your Honour.
MS. OJEMENI:
He has not answered.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The answer has been a letter with regard to the -- a préfectural letter with regard to the bourgmestre of Kinigi and others.
MR. HINDS:
Absolutely.  That's his answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But not with regard to the other general comment as phrased in the first question. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court the source for the information regarding the civilian authorities that survived this attack by the RPF or the civilian authorities that died?  Can you give a figure and then -- I mean, can you give a source of your information? 
A.	For this passage, I'll refer you to the annexes.  It's SOS Rwanda-Burundi.  It also features in the annexes.  That's the reference.  

Now, as for the situation of the local authorities, I have given as a source that they are facts.  Rwanda is a small country -- I know the region -- and all the local authorities, who were able to do so, fled, and those who were not able to, in the case of Barezi and Gasana, were killed.  Those are two.  And I do not think that there is any local authority who did not flee and who remained alive.  I do not think that there are any figures for these facts.  But the general situation is that the people fled, the leaders fled, and I think there was the figure of about 1 million displaced persons in the préfectures of Ruhengeri and Byumba -- about one and a half million people.
Q.	We are still talking about the civilian authorities.  We will get to the other facts later. 

Could you tell the Court the place and date Gasana and Barezi were killed?  The place?  You have indicated that of Gasana, Kigali.  Where was -- which date was he killed? 
A.	It was not Kigali.  He was killed in his commune of Kinigi in Ruhengeri préfecture.
Q.	Okay.  I take that correction.  Then can you tell the Court the date he was killed, Gasana, and how he was killed? 
A.	He was killed during the attack after the 8th of February, during the attack.  It was not before the 8th of February and it was not after the 23rd February.  It was during that attack.  As for the precise date, I do not know of it.  But all the people who died under those circumstances, I do not have the dates of their death, but we know that it was during that attack that he died. 
Q.	Now, witness, you talked about people who returned and were subsequently killed.  And you mentioned Fabian -- F. Maniragaba of Kigombe commune, and I presume you are talking about Fabian Maniragaba; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, I mentioned him. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court when he was killed? 
A.	As for Maniragaba's case, I wish to excuse myself.  And once it was realised that he was still alive, when the report had already been prepared and sent to the Tribunal -- this is in regard to Fabian Maniragaba.  He is still alive, and a verification of my sources confirmed to me that, indeed, he was alive.  But he was detained as many of his former colleagues were. 
Q.	Witness, why did you not bring it to the attention of the Court?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who's this one?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I was --
MR. PRESIDENT:
F. who?
MS. OJEMENI:
Fabian is spelt F-A-B-I-A-N, and Maniragaba is M-A-N-I-R-A-G-A-B-A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He's indicated as "F. Maniragaba" in the report?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  That's the former bourgmestre of Kigombe commune.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He's alive? 
MS. OJEMENI:
He's alive.  He's in prison in Ruhengeri.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can go on with your questions.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, why did you not tell the Court?  If you discovered that you made some errors in your report, why did you not point the errors out, including this particular one, to the Court before you started your presentation on -- I mean, testifying on this report? 
A.	I intended to inform the Court during the testimony.  I'm not aware of the proceedings -- or procedure for the Court.  I didn't know whether I needed to write a letter, but I had intended to mention this during my testimony. 
Q.	But this was one of the people you mentioned during your examination-in-chief as somebody -- one of the bourgmestres who were killed when they returned from exile, two days ago. 
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  That was not in the direct testimony at all.
MS. OJEMENI:
He referred to people, bourgmestres, who were killed.
MR. HINDS:
Counsel, I have the floor, making an objection with respect to how you are mischaracterising this witness's testimony.  He did not on direct examination make this statement or assertion that you've made.  If you have some record, produce it. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the records are very clear on this issue.  He did indicate that some bourgmestres were killed.
MR. HINDS:
We are not talking about some.  You've mentioned a particular individual, counsel.  Be specific. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court why you did not point this name out when you were testifying on the bourgmestres that went on exile, came back and were killed? 
A.	I specified under what conditions I did not do so, and I said that I was expecting to do so during the testimony when we were going to deal with the issue.  And if I find another mistake, I'll indicate it.  But each time a verification arrives or reaches me, I don't know whether one can write letters.  But I do admit that there was, indeed, an error on my part, and that I did not wait for you to tell me about the error.  I was mistaken for not having mentioned it before you did.
Q.	Witness, when -- in your testimony when the Defence of Kajelijeli was examining you, you mentioned -- referred to bourgmestres who were -- went on exile, came back and were killed, and you were -- you gave evidence on this particular page.  And my question is this: why did you not mention this particular name as somebody you subsequently learnt was alive? 
MR. HINDS:
Asked and answered.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we take note of the answer the witness has given on this point, and, indeed, in the examination-in-chief this page was referred to. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, witness, still on the same paragraph, I refer you to the signing of the Arusha Accord, "were hunted by RPF", and those should be line --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're on which page?
MS. OJEMENI:
I'm still on page 28, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
Second paragraph, where the name "Maniragaba" appears.  It should be the fourth line after the name "Maniragaba".  And it reads: "In Ruhengeri like in Byumba, officials who entered the so-called demilitarised zone after the signing of the Arusha Accord were hunted by the RPF and those who were unable to escape before the 6th of April were murdered in cold blood".  Could you tell the Court again where and when this happened? 
THE WITNESS:
As I have specified, in the demilitarised zone, this is where these events occurred, and by "demilitarised zone", I mean it was the area which was under the control of UNAMIR. 

Now, as for the insecurity situation in which these authorities found themselves, I would mention cases which I didn't mention in the report itself but which were well known.  I'll give the example of some bourgmestres who were victims of attacks.  This was reported in the Rwandan press at the time.  I would mention the case of the bourgmestre of Bwisige commune in Byumba préfecture, who escaped an attack in his commune in Bwisige.  Maybe I can spell the name.  It's B-W-I-S --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe the witness missed the "I.
THE WITNESS:
-- G-E.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Repeat it, please.  The interpreter says you may have missed an I.  Could you repeat please? 
THE WITNESS:
Bwisige.  There's an I between the S and W.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That's not the one he missed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell it out again, please?
THE WITNESS:
B-W-I-S, S -- yes, one S -- I-G-E, Bwisige. 

I'd also mention the bourgmestre of Cyungo commune.  This is also in Byumba préfecture.  Cyungo is spelt C-Y-U-N-G-O, Cyungo.  He also survived a grenade attack on his residence. 

And to give you the other bourgmestres of Nyamugali and Kirambo communes were obliged to flee from their own communes and to live as displaced persons, the same as the Cyungo commune; in other words, they left their regions.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Just answer my question, please.  My question is just when and where,.  I did not ask for names.  When and where, and you understand my question very well.  Just give the dates and that's all.
A.	Well, since you so desire, I would describe the period after 1994.  In Kibungo commune -- I'm giving that particular example -- the family of the former préfet of Byumba and the former bourgmestre of Cyungo, Kayijuka (phonetic), his family -- those members of his family who were in Kibungo were all eliminated at Kinihira; and that was after the 6th of April.  The former bourgmestre of that commune, Theofield Baragahorine, an interim -- acting bourgmestre, he was killed, but those members of his family who were still in that commune were eliminated; in other words, his widow and, I believe, three of his sons. 

The former bourgmestre of that commune, Innocent Mujegitiki (phonetic) was assassinated during that very period after the 6th of April, or around that date.  The former bourgmestre of that commune, Jean Baptist Ndangura (phonetic) was assassinated, together with part of his family, which was with him, on their return from exile in 1997. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
... are you addressing?  This was after? 
THE WITNESS:
I'm dealing with 19 -- I spoke of the authorities who were hunted down and who were forced to go back into exile or live with displaced persons.  This is local authorities after the 6th of April.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but your passage here talks about before 19 -- before 6th April.  I think that's the essence.  Go on, counsel.

MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, my question is on before 6th April.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And I'm drawing your attention to that.  But we have finished with the upper part; we are now dealing with the lower part, and I read out the particular statement and I asked you to give us dates and when it happened.  I didn't ask for names.
A.	I do apologise, but we're still in this period of time after the 6th of April.  The cases which I've just mentioned, these killings took place at Kinihira.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are talking -- what do you want to talk about?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I'm addressing 1994, and I'm asking you questions on 1994.  Your -- and my question is directly on this issue, the fact that some civilian authorities were killed, and I'm asking you what are the dates and how were they killed.  Secondly --
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel.
MR. HINDS:
I think we should be very specific on what we want this witness to answer --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- because he is floundering around, trying to give as much information.  So if the Prosecutor would just read the sentence carefully and ask him a question about it, so we know what he's testifying about.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, we are on civilian authorities that he said were killed by RPF.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, which time frame do you have in mind?
MS. OJEMENI:
I've limited him within 1994, 1994, and he mentioned April, and, to be precise, between April and July of 1994.
MR. HINDS:
That's a separate question.  I thought we were prior to April.
MS. OJEMENI:
I've haven't asked a question, counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Well, counsel, everybody needs to understand, and I'm not just making objections.  I thought we were dealing with the period prior to April 6th, 1994.  Now, if you are asking about between April and July, it's a different question; so we are all flipping and flopping. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I haven't asked the question.  I'm just saying it's now I said, maybe, I'm limiting between April and July.  But my previous question was before April 6th, that referred to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that was before -- that was what you were addressing --
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and I think the witness gave some answer, and we even interrupted him to say, "Well, are you supposed to address -- I thought you were supposed to address events before, before 6 April 1994".  Now, if indeed you are addressing the period -- the period of April to July 1994, then, of course, his answer will be correct.  So that's why we want to know.  I think counsel is right to know exactly what time frames are you addressing in your question. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, initially I asked a question before 6th April, and let me now rephrase my question and limit it to before 6th April before I proceed to the next stage.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, witness, can you tell the Court the civilian authorities that were killed by RPF, as you've represented in this paragraph, before 6th April 1994? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Your Honour, the interpreter wishes to intervene at this point in time, by your leave?  In the text, in French, the word used is "après", which is, in English, translated to "after".  In the English text, however, you have the word "before", "before April 1994"; in the French it's "après Avril 1994".  So there's a discrepancy in the two texts.  One says "before", the other one says "after".
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour.
MR. HINDS:
I think, Your Honour, the witness prepared his report in French.  We may need to ask him what he meant with respect to that passage, and that should be dispositive of it.  I mean, he wrote it in French.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, let me ask the question.  I've taken what the -- the correction that the interpreters have just given.  Let me rephrase the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I hope it's a correction.
MS. OJEMENI:
It's the -- it's here in the French text. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's clear?
MS. OJEMENI:
I said it's here in French, "après".  It's here in the French text, so the mistake might have been that of the translators, because it's the original.  So I will then rephrase my question.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I still draw your attention to the particular statement --
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Go on, counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I'll break the statement into two -- I'll break the statement into two.  The first part talks about after the signing of the Arusha Accord, and it states, first:  "In Ruhengeri, like in Byumba, officials who entered the so-called demilitarised zone after the signing of the Arusha Accords were hunted by the RPF".  

And my question is this: can you tell the Court the officials who entered this zone who were hunted by the RPF; can you tell the Court the names of the officials who entered this demilitarised zone after the signing of the accord and were hunted by the RPF? 
A.	Generally, all the authorities were able to get back to their regions, their communes or secteurs, but, specifically, I gave two examples of authorities who suffered attacks and who had to flee their communes.  Already, before 6th April 1994 --
Q.	What are their names?
A.	Pardon?
Q.	The names, please, just names, and we'll get to the next stage.
A.	I gave the examples of the bourgmestre of Bwisige and the bourgmestre of Cyungo -- the bourgmestre of Cyungo.  To come back to that period, later on there were elections that were organised in those communes.  There were election campaigns in which the RPF participated, and after the elections, insecurity became generalised in those regions where the RPF had lost elections, and those authorities were forced to leave the region in order to ensure their security.  I used to see the bourgmestre of Butaro in Ruhengeri; I used to see the bourgmestre of Kirambo in Ruhengeri.  They had lost their place in their communes.  The bourgmestres of Cyungo and Bwisige, in particular, had left their communes, as I said earlier on, and these are things that can be verified. 
Q.	What are their names?  I asked,, names, please?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour; asked and answered. 
MS. OJEMENI:
He hasn't answered the names of these bourgmestres.  He hasn't stated the names, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Sometimes for reasons of security, for some people who are still in the country, I don't know if I may be allowed not to mention their names.  This can be verified, but I don't know if this is valid. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think they can be mentioned, but we would also be interested, counsel -- this is not an eye or factual witness.  We would be more interested in the source, whether any information as it's given -- we would like to know what kind of source he has, whether it is himself or somebody else, or where, because he's not testifying as a factual or eye-witness to these events.  That's the most important -- we should not lose sight of that, otherwise his evidence could have a lot of complications and there may be problems.  So, source, where he thinks it's himself, he should say himself, he should say himself.  He's not testifying as an eye-witness or as a factual witness; he's an expert. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that should be borne in mind in the answers being given by the witness himself and -- because that should be borne in mind, unless the witness turns into a factual witness, which is -- might be a different thing.
MS. OJEMENI:
Very well, Your Honour.  And the witness -- might I crave your indulgence to ask the witness to just answer the questions.  I mean, that way we can move forward.  And I have been asking for sources, and I've not been getting concrete responses.  He's always dancing around the question.  So let me move and see how far I can get with that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Be brief, witness.  Give whatever information you want to give, but in very brief, clear terms, and do not develop, but at least be very, very, very brief and precise to the questions being asked. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I'm doing my best, Mr. President.  It's just that sometimes the questions themselves are so confused that I need to try to explain, and sometimes they are so complex that I cannot answer very briefly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And whenever you're not very clear about a question, please do not hesitate to have it explained or repeated.  That's extremely important.  We really want to move fast.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court the source of your information in this statement that I've drawn your attention to? 
A.	Can you remind me of that passage, please?
Q.	The passage talking about the civilians who were hunted down by the RPF and the killing of the civilian authorities that survived the RPF attack after April 6th, 1994.
A.	You want me to mention the names once again or the communes?
Q.	The source, the source of your information, that civilian authorities that were hunted down before 6th April 1994, and the civilians authorities that survived that were subsequently killed when they came back from exile. 
A.	I was in the country at that time and I was in that region at that time.  I met a lot of people during that period because I was directly interested in knowing what happened, but also because I knew people in that circle.  These are facts that cannot escape my attention, and these are also facts that you can check on.  If I give certain cases, situations, you can actually check to find out if this or that authority was killed during that period, if he fled, or if he was put in prison.  When I give names, communes, these can be verified to see if this or that bourgmestre indeed suffered such persecutions.
Q.	In fact, witness, your source is first-known knowledge, is it? 
A.	I have said in my affidavit that the experience -- the situation I experienced and that my social-political analysis of the time, my experience of the time enables me to form an opinion which could be corroborated by information, particularly the letter from the Ruhengeri préfectural committee, for example, and also in the annex, the committee for fighting against impunity and injustice, it's also there.  

Once again, the cases I'm referring to are cases you can verify.  If I mentioned such-and-such commune, you can go and verify it to see if that bourgmestre is still alive, and if not, when did he die or whether he's in prison; if he was in prison, has he been freed; and so on and so forth. 
Q.	Witness, in effect, your source is personal knowledge; false or true, please? 
A.	It's not my personal experience or personal knowledge.  I said information that was going round during that period on radio, and then I gave the case, the specific case of this Ruhengeri region, about what was happening with regard to the local authority.  It's not purely personal experience, but it's an opinion that I can form in reliance on a certain number of data.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And what is the data, media? 
MR. HINDS:
Asked and answered, Your Honour.  I mean the witness is -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
It's not clear, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He said radio, newspaper.
MR. HINDS:
Absolutely. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, witness, we move on to page 30, English text.  Witness, what is the -- who is Bugesera?  I'm on item 7, which is on page 22 of the French text.
A.	Bugesera is not a person, it's a region. 
Q.	And when were these Tutsis and -- civilian Hutus and Tutsis killed?  Date, please.
A.	I have listed areas where ethnic violence took place, killings of civilian population.  Bugesera, I believe, was end of 1991.  Kibirira, I think, was in 1992.  Mutura was after the arrival of UNAMIR in 1993.  Kirambo, still within the period of 1993.  That was when I was talking about insecurity in the demilitarised zone.  Kinihira was also end of '93.  And there, again, it was after the Arusha Accords.  And then I added "et cetera", because there are other regions where these kind of civilian killings took place and which went to increase the tension.
Q.	And it was just the RPF that killed them, no other group killed them? 
A.	I did not say that all these killings were -- all these killings that I have listed were committed by the RPF.  I only listed them and added that these killings, or some of them, were exploited for political purposes.  I never said that the RPF perpetrated all these killings. 
Q.	We move on to page 31 of the English text.  Could you give --
A.	What would be the French page? 
Q.	We're still on page 22, under item (2), 8(2).
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, it's on page 31 of the English text, and it's 8(2).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry? 
MS. OJEMENI:
It's on page 31.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
And it's item (2).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Item (2) okay.

MS. OJEMENI:
8(2).
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you give the source of -- what is the source of this quotation by Rutaremara?
A.	The source is Radio Rwanda, because it was in the course of a meeting which was held at Kinihira between the RPF and the president of the RPF and the president of the Rwandan government, and it was during an interview during that occasion that he made that statement.  My source is Radio Rwanda.  I did not indicate this, but when I said "stated", I can now give that source as being Radio Rwanda.
Q.	Now, can you give examples of the use of excessive language that you said was used and is under (3), the paragraph next to (3), item (3)? 
A.	Yes, I can give some examples.  There was a day -- I am thinking about Rutaremara -- who said -- I believe this was at Hôtel Diplomate -- in Kinyarwanda, the equivalent in French would be the following: "To see the Rwandan authorities fighting each other for power is like a group of dogs" -- can I say it in Kinyarwanda so the interpreters can give it the equivalent?
Q.	Just, what is the source of what you want to say?  What is the source?  At present it is media, so?
A.	It was on Radio Rwanda.
Q.	Witness, I draw your attention to page 32, under item 10; still on page 23 -- it's page 24 of the French text.  English text is page 32, item 10.  You're talking about -- under item 10 you are talking about events before April 1994, and you mentioned "embargo".  Which embargo are you referring to? 
A.	That is item 10?
Q.	Yes.  My question is simply, which embargo are you referring to in the context of April -- events of April 1994, that took place before April 1994? 
A.	I'm talking about the military embargo, because the international community, the Security Council, had voted an embargo -- had placed an embargo on the sale of weapons to Rwanda, so Rwanda could no longer purchase weapons.  It was a military embargo.
Q.	Is that the date May 17th, of the embargo?  Is it not May 17th? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of which year? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, it's under item 10.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
May 17th of 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
THE WITNESS:
No, with the Arusha Accords, the parties signatory to the accord could never -- could no longer arm themselves.  The embargo covered everybody.  All the parties that are (sic) signatory to the accord no longer had the right to continue arming themselves, and this was part of the quest for peace. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the date is May 17th; it can be checked. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	We are now under the "Role of Media". 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the significance of that date, counsel, that you admitting? 
MS. OJEMENI:
That it doesn't fall within the context of events that took place before April.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, okay.  The --
MS. OJEMENI:
The use of the embargo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The use?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, may I? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
MR. HINDS:
The issue is that the witness says the embargo was consistent and pursuant to the Arusha Accords.  The Prosecutor is saying that it was one year later, May of 1994, and that is a distinction and she says that it can be checked out.  That is the distinction.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It can only be checked out through the witness.  What does the witness say?
MS. OJEMENI:
Well, he's saying that --
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, what is the date of this embargo you referred to in this paragraph?  The date, please. 
A.	Here, in actual fact, in my thoughts, I was making reference to the Arusha Accords which prohibited the belligerent parties to arm themselves.  And among the missions of the UNAMIR -- it include among other things, the control of movement of arms to Rwanda, and the signatories, as I said, were not allowed to arm themselves.  

Maybe the term "embargo" makes us think about this formal aspect of signing a document.  But, in my mind, I was thinking about this provision in the Arusha Accords which prohibited the parties that were signatory to the accord from continuing arming themselves.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what would be the date?  If you had some time frames -- if you could put some time frame to the embargo from your evidence, or your information, if you can.
THE WITNESS:
I'm referring to the Arusha Accords, which were signed in August 1993.  That accord prohibited the belligerent parties from arming themselves, and it's as part of that that I was saying that the Rwandan government was strictly controlled; whereas, the RPF -- with the RPF there was no efficient control.  And here I have sources that can corroborate this assertion. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, in effect, you are not referring to the embargo on arms -- on importation of arms; is that what you are referring to, as previously you mentioned the embargo by the Security Council, that the Security Council had imposed on the Rwanda -- Rwandan forces and RPF forces, but now it looks like you are talking about the accord and not the embargo anymore? 
A.	Well, it is obvious that I'm not referring to the resolution of the Security Council, because this was subsequent.  I'm using "embargo" in the general sense of the word by referring to the Arusha Accords. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Except, witness, you don't seem to have given that kind of balance in the report that you've just given when talking about the embargo, because I think here, in your explanation that you've just made, is that the embargo applied to all the signatories of the Arusha Accord.  Well, there could be a question of supervision, as you have done.  But if you look at this sentence that you have on this matter, it would appear to be it applied to one person or to one party; would that be correct?  The last paragraph on page 30, 32.  I don't know what page would that be in the French text, your own original copy.
MS. OJEMENI:
It's on page 24, and that's the paragraph I have drawn his attention to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The last page -- the last line, at least in the English, in the English text. 
MS. OJEMENI:
It's the same in the French text, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Do you follow? 
THE WITNESS:
Well, maybe there's some confusion here.  You are talking about some balance --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, what I'm saying is that going by the -- if one read the sentence on this matter, that starts with the word, "However FAR was very weak", and, you know, so forth.  It doesn't give the impression that you have just given that the embargo, if at all, did apply to all the signatories to the Arusha Accord, and the kind of, you know, effect on the supervision mechanism that was put in place and as it applied to the parties.  If you look at this sentence as it is put here, it would appear that that kind of balance that you have given in your answer is not there; is it not? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I fully agree with you, but that would appear in other paragraphs subsequent to this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, page 32, under -- no, sorry.  We are on "Role of Media", which is under page 24 of the French text, and 33 of the English text.  Witness, can you tell the Court the dates of the quotations you've referred to on page 34, 35, 36 of the English text, and as 25 -- on 26 of the French text?  Can you tell the Court the dates of the quotations? 
A.	The quotations that you see there are before 1990.  These were publications that came out before 1990 and 1989. 
Q.	And how widely circulated is this publication? 
A.	It was clandestine.  Most of these publications, if not all of them, were published outside the country, but they were brought into Rwanda clandestinely, and you would not find in newspaper kiosks. 
Q.	Where were they published, the publications?  Where were they operating from? 
A.	It depended on the -- on the specific publication.  They were published either in Uganda, in Europe, United States.  Impuruza, for example, does not mention where it is published. 
Q.	You are referring to publications by Alexandra Kimenyi; is that correct?  Which is spelt -- Kimenyi is spelt K-I-M-E-N-Y-I?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Repeat, counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
K-I-M-E-N-Y-I.  And the first name is Alexandra.
THE WITNESS:
Kimenyi.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Kimenyi, you are referring to his publications.
A.	Yes, among others. 
Q.	So the quotations are from various journals, are they? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And what are these journals, if you -- if I may ask?  Can you mention the names of the journals, and can you put them against each quote? 
A.	Well, these are quotations which I took from -- on Interethnic Relations.  I have indicated that.  For example, the first one, the quotation (a), page 229, it is on page 229 of Interethnic Relations.
Q.	So your source is Interethnic Relations book, is it?  That's your source, all of them? 
A.	These quotations, these quotations were taken from Interethnic Relations, Interethnic Relations, which took it from various newspapers. 
Q.	Now, witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Interethnic Relations, the book?
MS. OJEMENI:
The book he wrote, he co-authored.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He co-authored. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, my question is this.  It's interesting to note that you only talked about the publications by the extremist circles of the Tutsi diaspora, which you said were provocative.  And you were in Rwanda between April to July 1994, you are aware that RTLM, that have publications like -- sorry, there are publications like Kangura, that were inciting songs like Bikindi -- from Bikindi, who are -- which are all carried out by Hutu extremists.  Kangura in particular had inciting publications and you never mentioned it in your report, you only concentrated on Tutsi extremists.
MR. HINDS:
Objection.
MS. OJEMENI:
Why?
MR. HINDS:
Objection as to form, Your Honour.  There are compound questions that are being asked.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is not an ordinary witnesses; he's an expert.  If he has --
MR. HINDS:
I understand.  The Court is now instructing the witness to be brief, and she gives him a compound question.  I'm just trying to -- okay.  We'll let the witness answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you, counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	My question, is why, why did you concentrate on only extremist Tutsi publications without making any reference to the publications by the Hutu extremists?
A.	I do not know.  I think that the question is indeed complex, compound, but there are stages of presentation.  The first step is the one dealing with the media, which we said prepared the conflict.  And in the media we have outlined elements which generated tension and conflict.  As for their content, and, in particular, regarding the subject which recurs, in other words, the debate around the subject of the monarchy, the period of 1959, it's these quotations which illustrate the content of the media of the time.  

I don't think it's true to say that I do not mention the other media.  I mentioned them, but in order to say that they participated in a debate, the debate around the concept of 1959, the 1959 revolution, because, as we see the media, they are media which deal with 1959 and they deny the positive effects of 1959; they deny the revolution.  And, as I've had the opportunity to say, they qualify them as unfortunate elements for the country of disorder, and so on and so forth. 

As for what you've mentioned, the RTLM, you have mentioned Kangura, I also mention these, but I do not mention them in detail, because in the newspapers, I'm interested in the ideological aspects of these newspapers.  And in their articles I see there confrontation with the opposition, and in contrast to what had been already written regarding the 1959 revolution by these media, and possibly which would be mentioned by Radio Muhabura, I mentioned them, but I also placed them in compartments.  I put them in opposition to one another.  I placed Muhabura opposite the RTLM and the other newspapers in opposition to Kangura.  I am looking at the ideological field in which they are fighting, the ideologies which are eminent or are coming out of what they say in their articles. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But since under paragraph -- this paragraph you are talking about the role of the media in the interethnic relationship, and you have gone to specifics to mention and to give a few troubling examples that could have gone a long way to make interethnic relations even more strained, don't you think a mention of other publications that could have not helped in this regard would have been placed here, because if that is what you intend to project, the role of these elements, the role of the media?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
May I?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let the witness go, and then we'll come back. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand your question, but what I'm saying is that here I talked about the debate as it emerged, as it emerged in the media mentioned on page 24 of the French version, the content of those media as they emerge.  And then after that, I situated the various media, especially those which were the most affected, the most concerned, the most mentioned: RTLM, Kangura, we need also to add Muhabura.  But I looked at them ideologically speaking in order to draw attention to their comparable roles.  So when I refer to these media which prepared the conflict, it's a debate which is somewhat problematic with regard to the revolution of 1959.  And I place RTLM opposite Muhabura; I place other newspapers, such as Kangura and other newspapers from within, so that they consider them face to face, opposite one another, because we need to realise the fact that they are fighting between their selves regarding what was said about the revolution of 1959, and they are taking diametrically opposed positions.  What arises is that often the extremist -- one part is considered as being extremist and the other is considered as not being extremist.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you talk of a debate, a debate is always two-sided.

You wanted to say something, counsel?
MR. HINDS:
I think the witness has pointed it out, Your Honour --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- that in the report -- the report has the media over about seven pages, and he juxtaposes them; it's not just on one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have read the report.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are very aware of the report, and we know where these other publications are, but what we are saying is, was it not the right place because these are issues that are being ventilated -- that's what we are asking the witness.  But we are familiar with this report.  We'll go back to it again. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we are still on the role of media, and I'm still under item 1.  You also mentioned the techniques used by the extremist circles of the Tutsi diaspora, and you refer to them as resorting to lies, denying facts, or minimising them, or else engaging in exaggeration and manipulation, and where in your report did you talk about the technique used by the Hutu extremists like Kangura? 
A.	I didn't go into the details of Kangura, because my intention was to draw attention to the participation or contribution of both sides in the conflict.  Given that what was said or affirmed or denied by the media of the diaspora that I referred to, it's the position adopted which brought about this debate, this conflict, or maybe what we could call this disagreement.  

What I would like to add is that one needs to be able to do, and I have realised that this is something which should be considered by the Court, by the Tribunal, because what is in Kangura is very well known by the Tribunal here, because it is -- it has been accused -- I'm meaning the journalist per se.  

But what I want to draw attention to is possibly being able to compare, which I did not do -- compare the two parties, place them in opposition to one another and see what comes out of that.  But I do not mention Kangura; I am drawing attention, rather, to these media which are rarely spoken of in the context of Rwanda.  I didn't deem it right to go back to Kangura because this is a newspaper which has been discussed at great length in this conflict.
Q.	Witness, as an expert witness, you didn't deem it necessary to compare the two sides of the story so as to enlighten this Court on the real situation in Rwanda within the period that is in the temporal jurisdiction -- within the period of the temporal jurisdiction of this Court?  You are talking about events, the issues of interethnic relations, and you're testifying on the role of media, and you don't think it is important that as an expert, whose report will form record of this case, that you owe the Court the duty to debate, at least to compare the two sides and to show the Court the real position within this context, within the period that you're discussing in your report?  Is that what you are telling the Court? 
A.	No, I think that you need to understand what my mission is.  My mission is not to study the media, as such.  My mission, or terms of reference, was to see the impact of the media on interethnic relations.  The part that I wrote about is adequate for one to be able to understand that these media on both sides of the divide contributed to ethnic awareness, which was much sharper or, rather, more conflictual than what it was before 1990.  

So the elements which I provide, the ideological framework within which these media developed, and which I refer to, enable us adequately to understand that they contributed to the exacerbation of interethnic relations.  And I've said that whether some go for the revolution and others are against -- and I've mentioned the terms they used and I referred to the techniques that one needs to examine in more specific cases -- this showed what the impact was, and I think I've been successful in doing that, in showing that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take note of the witness's answer on this subject.  You can go on, counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, isn't it true that there was abundant publications by the Hutu extremists, like Kangura, RTLM, within the same context that you discussed -- you've discussed the Tutsi -- the Tutsi extremists in diaspora?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he has answered that question, counsel, and we take note of the answer. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, page 37 of the English text.  That should be page 30 of the French text.  My question is on the publication Impuruza.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page?
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 30, and it's under -- still under the "Role of Media".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 37? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of the English text? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Thirty-eight of the English text, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thirty-eight?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And my question is on the impact the media -- or the media you have referred have played -- the impact on the Rwandan population.  Can you give proof of the impact? 
A.	You're speaking about Impuruza, but on my page I don't see anything referring to Impuruza. 
Q.	Page 38; I've moved on to page 38.  I'm on page 38 of the English text; I'm looking for the French text. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Perhaps somebody can help me.  I'll get to -- it's under the text, that second paragraph on page 38, and I'm on the second paragraph.  This text could be interpreted in an infinite numbers of ways, but given the nature of this work, and it's scope I shall pose only a few questions, and the questions are on the impact.
THE WITNESS:
Is it on page 30 of the French text?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Twenty-eight for the French text.  I think paragraph one, two, three.  One, two -- it starts with the -- have you located it, witness?  Twenty-eight, I think, paragraph 2, starting with what looks like "SOS"?  Seen it? 
	(Pages 1 to 23 by Geraldine O'Loughlin)



































	1030H
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You have suggested that the literature that you have referred to above had an impact, and I am asking for your data, statistical data, in proof of this impact.
A.	I cannot speak about analysing a text.  One cannot measure its impact in statistical terms.  One can rather measure its impact by considering the reactions expected, given the strength of the character of the content, the terms used and the message which is transmitted.  Here Kimenyi's point is being analysed and we see the terms that are used in reference to the enemies, Rwandans from the interior who are pro-government.  If we look at the terms used, one can consider that they can have none other than a negative impact.  

If we go back to page 27 and we use the terms utilised, and I am going to look at the translation, I think one can understand.  I wrote that they treat them as boars, ngurube, wild cats, greedy beasts, termites, rascals, wicked, good for nothing, traitors, thieves, ignorant folk pretending to be clever, pot-bellied dogs, enemies, predatory vultures, vagabonds, rubble.  The head of state was referred as Umuhinze, which we have already seen, I think yesterday or the day before, and the country is not Rwanda, is not a state, it is Bwidishyi which is spelt B-W-I-D-I-S-H-Y-I.  Bwidishyi, in Rwandan tales was an imaginary country or land which was inhabited by imbeciles, persons who are unreasonable.  

Now, if someone used such terms in reference to the Tutsis, I would also consider that to be serious, but here these are terms which are used in reference to the Tutsis that they are going to fight.  I did not mention the positive aspect, how they referred to friends, but here this is how enemies are referred to.  So how do you think people who are going to read this are going to react?  It is on the basis of that that I said that here there are questions which I raised, which, in fact, suggests a rather disquieting answer. 
Q.	And according to you, Kangura or other media publications by the Hutu extremists did not use such words, such terms, hence it was not necessary to mention Kangura in your report. 
A.	Yes, that is not my position.  Once again, I am saying that people which you already know and were used by Kangura, what I am doing is to bring what can help us to understand the general context.  I am not repeating what Kangura said, but what it wrote was widely commented on.  I said that I wanted to bring into the discussion something which could show a face or facet which is rarely referred to and bring about what it created or helped to create in a situation in Rwanda.  I am not repeating what has been said by Kangura, but I am bringing something else which can help us understand that dialogue and help us possibly to share the blame because I think that is the issue. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe as an expert, you might not know how courts operate. Kangura may have been talked about in the press or even in the course of the trial in some other cases.  It doesn't meant that this particular Trial Chamber at which you are testifying as an expert, knows about Kangura and what has been written in Kangura.  

So it is not quite correct to say that or to assume that the Trial Chamber would know what might have been written elsewhere in other publications.  Even if for example, it knew, that is not evidence before this Trial Chamber.  That kind of information would still be required, if you deemed it to be important in your report, in order to inform the Trial Chamber, using your expertise to put the information you want to put before it.  So don't assume that Kangura is known to this particular Trial Chamber or to the Tribunal as a whole.  It may be that these issues are being discussed or dealt with elsewhere, but they are not common knowledge, or even if they were common knowledge, they would not necessarily be part and parcel of evidence in any judicial proceedings of this kind. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, in your view, the obligation on media --
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you go by the record.  So --
THE WITNESS:
I take due note of your observation, Mr. President.  But I think you need also to understand my intent. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, in your view, the publications by media or by Hutu extremists make similar impact on the Rwandan population, as you have just testified, in respect of the publication by the Tutsi extremists.
A.	I would place myself at the ideological level, as I have said here in the report; namely, that the Rwandan political scene, just like any scene, has a space for at least limitation.  There is one side and there is another side, and there is a centre.  This is why I was saying that I am bringing all these people within the same space and with regard to the extremists, it is the media on the Hutu side, the media which is for the 1959 revolution, and they mention this quite brutally and abruptly and very strongly, and maybe even in terms which make one think of a certain level of extremism.  But if one were to analyse the political and ideological framework within which all this is situated, one can judge all kinds of extremists and that is my point of view on a case by case basis.  But situating them on the same political terrain, they are playing the same game, and as in western countries, there is the extreme left and extreme right.  

In the Rwandan case, there is also probably an extremist left and an extreme right, but particularly in a conflict situation, each party will accuse the other of being extremist.  So it is under such circumstances that I can answer your question by saying that, if there were extremist elements in these media, they can be identified, but I myself concentrated on the ideological aspect and the impact that this was making on inter-ethnic relations.  

In Kangura, for instance, it was against, for instance, the RPF.  It is true that what the media of the RPF was writing did not please the other camp.  And then the definition of the extremist in this context does not necessarily concern what is qualified as extremist.  In fact, you need to just simply take one position and then identify the extremist part.  I wanted to bring the two together within one space and see the elements upon which they agree or converge, in other words, the 1959 revolution, and then we see the differences.  Some draw the 1959 revolution towards them, the others rejected, and it is in this context that I am operating.  I am not praising anyone and I am not denigrating anyone.  I just wanted to consider all the elements which could be seen in this political context, but I am not denying that there was extremism in Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Be very brief.  Some of it you have already explained, Witness -- Professor.

Could you go on, Counsel?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I refer you to page 40 of the English text, under Radio Muhabura.  It should be 29 of the French text.  Could you give the Court the -- could you give your data for the conclusion you have drawn under Radio Muhabura? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, please. 
Q.	For the proof of the conclusion you have drawn under Radio Muhabura, on what data did you base your conclusion on Radio Muhabura -- the role Radio Muhabura played in exasperating the inter-ethnic relations? 
A.	In considering what was conveyed by the radio, what has already been mentioned in the print media which I referred to, and from which I have mentioned some passages, I said that by virtue of the position in relation to 1959, in relation to the way in which the regime was criticised, and the authorities were criticised and how they were presented, it is on the basis of all that and on the position of the ideological position, especially the way of referring to 1959, which, in the eyes of the majority of the Rwandan people, was rather a representation of a happy occasion, an event which led to its liberation.  And that is what I am saying, that these broadcasts brought about a certain amount of disquiet within the population and revived or re-incited tensions which had come to an end or ceased to exit at the time of the revolution. 
Q.	Did you conduct any study on Radio Muhabura and RTLM? 
A.	The points of view which I expressed are points of view which are derived from the radio broadcast I listened to, but also from the ideological position adopted and what others said about them.  For instance, I give the example for Radio Muhabura, the lives of eminent persons such as this Belgian Ambassador to Rwanda, he has a point of view which he expressed, or this minister for defence, the Belgian minister for the defence, who speaks about it here and it is all quite in true conformity with the reality.
Q.	And all that form the basis for this conclusion you have drawn on RTLM, on page 40 still, which you said that -- where you said that RTLM did nothing but denied or rejected the lies broadcast by RPF, Radio Muhabura and the publications by the diaspora media, its situation can only be well understood in context.  And my question is, on what -- I presume it is this data, the basis you have just explained on the issue of Radio Muhabura that you based your conclusion as I have read.  Is it the fact that certain things were said by ambassadors that you have mentioned, and the radio and things that you heard from people?  Could that be the basis for drawing the conclusion that I am drawing your attention to now? 
A.	My conclusion is derived from what I had already said, and I don't think I have to repeat it, that these media were placed in a particular ideological context, and what I said regarding RTLM is that the RTLM was in that specific context.  It placed itself in relation to 1959, and then in its words, it adopted a position in relation to Radio Muhabura and people who supported Radio Muhabura believed that it was the vehicle.  And what I understand, from its position, is that one cannot understand the RTLM unless one situates it within this framework of ideological combat, and the quotations which are there come in fact to confirm what I am saying, that, however, Radio Muhabura and the RTLM can be indeed compared in the sense that some of them -- some people see one as an extremist and the words or what is said by one shows the other as an extremist, although diplomatic terms are used to express that opinion. 
Q.	Witness, is it not true that RTLM broadcast messages asking people to go for the enemy at roadblocks, churches, and so on and so forth?  Sorry.  To go for the enemy at roadblocks, churches, and certain areas where Hutus hid.  Putting it in this context --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where Hutus hid? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Hid, where Hutus hid -- to hide. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Yes, Hutus or what?
MS. OJEMENI:
Tutsis. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is what we want to understand.
MS. OJEMENI:
I am so sorry, Your Honour.

BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I take it again.  My question is this, given what you have just said, could you now confirm if indeed RTLM made broadcast such as this: messages asking people, Hutus to go for the enemy at roadblocks, churches, schools, between April and July 1994; and if yes, what was the impact on the Hutu population?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Hutu population? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Hutu population.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand the question, but I will simply say that I personally did not hear any such calls or exultation.  This call that we should attack the enemy at the roadblocks, I don't know if the enemy was on the roadblock, but I will say that I did not hear any such call to go and kill the Tutsi.  I did not hear any such call. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And you were within Ruhengeri préfecture within this period of April to July 1994? 
A.	I was within the Ruhengeri préfecture, not at the préfecture. 
Q.	And you heard -- you listened to RTLM, didn't you, within this period? 
A.	From time to time I would listen to RTLM, just as I listened to other radio stations.  RTLM was not my only source of information, nor my preferred source of information.  I listened to RTLM from time to time.
Q.	Now, could you tell the Court the source of this information?  On page 41 of the English text, regarding RTLM -- it should be 29, starting from page 29 of the French text and towards the end of the page, where you stated and I quote:  "With respect to extremism and openness, it should be noted that RTLM offered its airwaves to the leaders of the opposition who made statements contrary to its own without censoring them."  What is your proof?
A.	These are radio broadcasts that we heard.  I don't need to say I personally listened to 
Mr. Ndasingwa's statement.  I have listened to the debate of Mr. Kavaruganda.  There was a programme of political discussion on RTLM, and that was the only programme that I was interested in, the political debate which was led by Gasper Gahigi and other people.  These are people who participated in the discussion on RTLM, and these are things that you can verify.  So, when I said that from time to time I listened to RTLM, I had in mind mainly political discussions and not factual information, factual news, sorry.
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 42, English text --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will be taking a break at the usual time at eleven and --
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I draw your attention to the last paragraph, particularly the sentence that starts with "After 1959 there was real harmony".  That you can find at --
A.	Not yet, what is the page in the French version?
Q.	That is what I am looking for.  You can also find it, it would be the next page. 
A.	Yes, but I need to know what you are referring to.  Is it on Item 3?
Q.	Yes, it is under Item 3 still, and the sentence starts with "After 1959".  It is on page 29.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 31, last paragraph, four lines from the top.  It is 31, first paragraph, I think about four lines from the top in French.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	My question is on your conclusion that after 1959, there was real harmony in inter-ethnic relations, all the time that it was accepted that all citizens were equal before the law.  And my question is, Witness, quota system was in place during this period and how can you conclude that all citizens were equal?  How are quotas compatible with equality?  How can you conclude?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, that was ventilated all of yesterday, the end of the day, and I object.  That is asked and answered.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he did give his views on that.  I think it is on record, we can come back to it.  What we were discussing, the period between 1959 and '73 leading on to '90, yesterday.  This is with regard to the quota system, if you have something else, you could raise with the witness. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I think the two situations are quite different.  I could check that during the break, but they are quite different.  I use the same reason but they are quite different, they are not the same; but I can continue after the break, if it is convenient.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a break for 15 minutes and when we come, we'll continue with the cross-examination of the witness.  You might have to go on up to --
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I think so, like I said yesterday, it all depends with the way the witness answers.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we now make a target for the lunch break?
MS. OJEMENI:
I will definitely finish this morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So that we can come back this afternoon for re-examination.  Let's see whether we can get that far. 
MS. OJEMENI:
I will move faster because most of the questions I have have been answered. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So we will adjourn for 15 minutes and resume our work at a quarter past eleven.
	(Court recessed from 1100h to 1115H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed, and we continue the cross-examination of the witness by the Prosecution.  

Learned counsel, Miss Ojemeni, could you proceed? 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you turn to page 44 of the English text, under the role the media and the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page?
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 44 of the English text, under the media and the international agencies, and I will try and move as fast as I can, Your Honour, and be brief. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And please, Witness, answer direct please.  Just go straight to answer to any question I pose and be brief.  I draw your attention to the book you referred to by C. Braeckman, and it is on page 44.  You quoted a passage from the book.  Can you tell the Court the title of this book, just the title, please?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, for the French, it is page 31.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Braeckman is page 32, first paragraph and in the English, where can one locate this book?  
MS. OJEMENI:
It is 43. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Forty-three?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, and French, it is 31 and 32. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the English starts from 33 to --
MS. OJEMENI:
Forty-three to 44, but I am on 44, first paragraph.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Which should be 32, like Your Honour mentioned, in French.  It is just the title.
THE WITNESS:
In fact, I apologise because this is a passage that I found in a document which I haven't annexed, maybe I should have added that, but maybe it is a passage that we can also find in the book.
 BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And my question now is:  Did you examine the passage in the book referred to by C. Braeckman? 
A.	I was telling you about the source where I got it from, and what is contained therein can be confronted to others. 
Q.	Your conclusion then is wrong because in that book, Braeckman complains that access was restricted, that they were restricted access to the RPF zone.  So your source -- your conclusion here is wrong and even in the passage, it is alluded to that. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I am totally confused about what counsel is saying.  Can she just succinctly lay out, if she is quoting a statement which is false, quote it correctly, succinctly, and then ask the witness to respond.  I don't know what she is talking about.  She is testifying that something he said is wrong.  I don't know what she is referring to specifically, and it is improper the way she is doing it.  If she wants to confront him, she should be asking about the statement and get his response, and then whatever she has to contradict. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, maybe to get the information from the witness -- maybe, Counsel, you can go back because in your first question that you raised with regard to Braeckman, I think we seem to have heard the witness say his source was different.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we would like to -- he mentioned a source, we would like to get that source clearly laid out, and then, of course, you can move on to the next -- this was your second question.  You can put it back to him with regard to the disparity that you want the witness to comment upon, and any further information you would like to give on that document.  But we would like to get back to the source, first of all, what he mentioned was the source; it wasn't very clear. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court the source of this quotation by Braeckman? 
A.	Yes, I got that quotation from a document which you have in the annex, that is a document from the CRI, and that is Annex No. 4, on page 3.
Q.	In this passage, referring to page 43 and 44, where you discussed the role of media and international agencies, you suggest there that the international media were manipulated or were often manipulated, and that they defended the rule of RPF and in order to substantiate your quotation or your assertion, you quoted the passage from C. Braeckman, where you said that she noted this issue, that is the assertion in her quotation and the quotation in this passage.  I have asked you your source and you have mentioned the source, and I have asked you if you have examined the passage, because your assertion does not conform with the passage. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does not confirm with the passage, where?  
MS. OJEMENI:
Passage from the book, Your Honour.  I am referring to the book by C. Braeckman, but he has told the Court now that he did not read the book, he just quoted it from a source.  So I am now putting it to the witness that his assertion is wrong, based on the passage in the book he has just listed, but the entire passage says something to the contrary
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope you have the passage. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  I don't have the passage here, but I read the book. 
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.
MS. OJEMENI:
So I am just referring him now, I am asking him.  I don't have the passage with me here, but I am bringing it to his attention that it is wrong. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, this is improper.  You cannot, you cannot impeach a witness without confronting the witness with whatever you allege.  If the witness makes a statement which you say is false, you then confront the witness with the contrary document.  You can't just do so by making assertions, I read it, I believe or -- I mean, it is improper.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I undertake to bring the passage.  I am not attempting to impeach him yet.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He can answer that question, but for formal impeachment, then you have to bring forth the record. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Exactly.  Yes, Your Honour. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to see that contradiction.  Is it a contradiction between the sentence that introduces the quotation and the passage itself?  I think that is your point. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What I am suggesting to you is, in effect, that the passage is contrary to the content of the passage itself in the book.
A.	Well, I don't know how the translation was done, but what I have in French is very clear, and I noted that Collette Braeckman defended the position of the RPF in the beginning.  She defended the position of the RPF at the beginning of the conflict and notes the following:  And here, I note that Collette Braeckman is one of the journalists who defended the RPF position, and here obviously, the passage that I am citing is a passage which indicates the inadequacies of the RPF and words.  She normally presented the RPF in a positive light, but here she has presented something to the contrary.  So there is no contradiction.  On the contrary, what is highlighted here is the change of position in relation to events, I mean the position of the journalist in relation to the events.  So there is no contradiction.  I don't know how you read the quotation. 
Q.	But I suggest to you that Braeckman, in that passage, did mention that she was restricted access.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  The Prosecutor simply cannot proceed to try to impeach the witness this way.  It is improper.  She hasn't laid the foundation; she hasn't presented him with a prior contrary statement.  She is not testifying.  She cannot do that under any of the rules. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, it is a suggestion I am putting forward to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your point is made.  If you want to follow it up, then you have to bring it with concrete information.  And in fairness to the witness, he would also like to react to something that is specific. 
MS. OJEMENI:
At some point I will do that. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, we move on to the Alison Des Forges, the comment you made about Alison Des Forges.  It is on page 44 paragraph 3, and I quote, still referring to the role of the international agencies and media. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thirty-two in the French text, third paragraph, for the witness page 32, third paragraph.  Located?  It is 32 with regard to the French text and paragraph 3.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You refer to the report by Alison Des Forges, and you stated the attitude, you are referring to the role of media and international agencies.  "I shall take the example from the report of Alison Des Forges which, as cited by J. Karero, is most surprising but typical of all reports that had been written on events of April 1994".  And I ask you once again, have you read this report? 
A.	Well, the question as it is put is not very clear to me.  Once again, I did not read the report itself.  I have seen it quite often, but what I am discussing here is not the content; it is the problem with the method as it is referred to by Karero.  And Karero is in the annex. I gave Karero in the annex, that is the annex --
Q.	I take that your answer to that is you have not read the report, but you lifted this particular comment from another -- from Karero, J. Karero's book or report.  I don't know; am I correct? 
A.	Well, at least the presentation of the method used, I got it from one Karero, which I have presented in the annex. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you read the report, that is the question?
THE WITNESS:
No. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And you relied on the passage in preparation of your report, didn't you? 
A.	Which passage are you referring to?
Q.	The comment made by J. Karero about this report from Alison Des Forges.
A.	I relied on him to make reference to the attitude of international organisations which were interested in Rwanda, because he talks about that attitude or attitudes in plural. 
Q.	We move onto page 45.  My question is just on source.  Could you give the Court the source of this statement?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  If the witness relied on Karero, the conclusion will be based on what Karero said.
MS. OJEMENI:
On the attitude.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, on the attitude as reflected here.
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	On page 45, could you tell the Court the source of this conclusion on sites.  There were no sites north of the line of demarcation, and so the question could be asked, who killed over half a million people north of this line after 6th April. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which paragraph, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
I am on page 45 of the English text, I am on the first paragraph.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
THE WITNESS:
Which page is that in the French version?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, it is your record, I think you should find it faster.
A.	No, you are making reference to the English version. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is page 32, down in paragraph 3, it mentions reference made to Melvern, it is towards the end, towards the middle, slightly below the middle way of paragraph 3, on page 32.  Have you seen it? 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Please, it is just the source, could you tell the Court the source?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The English is 45, Counsel, first paragraph. 
THE WITNESS:
In the reference, I made reference to Linda Melvern.  She is a journalist who wrote a book and she drew a map of sites in her book.  I think it is at the very beginning of the book, a map of genocide, and when you look at the map, to the north of that line, that is the line going from Ruhengeri along the Kigali road, Ruhengeri-Kigali road and which goes through the Byumba préfecture, and through the north of Kibungo -- the préfecture of Kibungo, there are no sites indicated there.  The sites are to the north of that line.  The sites referred to are genocide sites.  

Well, it is not the term "genocide" that I am interested in.  The fact is that there is a reality, people died, a lot of people and I am mentioning half a million to the north of the line, and when we extrapolate that from -- based on the data of James Gasana, who made reference to three million deaths, to the north of that line, in any event, it is more than that.  And to the north of that line, there is no indication of possible deaths or killings.  It is as if there were killings only to the south of that line.  That is the point I wanted to make, and that is a map that you can find if you follow the reference with the indication of sites of genocide.  That is all.  That is the only reference. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, can the witness -- I have been given a target to meet and the witness should be so directed, so that we can move fast.  I only asked for a source. 

MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  The witness gives a source, and he gives the reason why he cited that particular source.  I mean in all fairness, if we are trying to find out information, I don't think he has given extraneous information.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, he gave his source and he explained his view, the meaning of what he is trying to address.  The only thing I think, he can be very brief, state succinctly what he wants to state.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I refer you to page 48, English text and it is 35, French text.  In the English text it is the first paragraph.  In effect, I will take the first three paragraphs -- the first two paragraphs.  I just want the source, and if you have any for the conclusion drawn therein. 
	(Pages 24 to 36 by Sithembiso Moyo)


























	1145H
MR. PRESIDENT:
You want him to address which paragraph, Counsel, in English?
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 48, the first paragraph, starting with "Supporting the RPF and then by actively supporting".  I want him to just give the proof, the source, if he has any proof to that effect.  That should be page 35 in French text.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 45.
MS. OJEMENI:
Forty-five, first point.  And it should it be --
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Yes, I believe the problem must have been at the level of the literature, otherwise, the reference -- I've made reference to James Gasana.  I also make reference to James -- to Gasana, but also to Melvern, Linda Melvern, who is also mentioned.  Those are the principal sources on these issues.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	On the next paragraph, starting with "Mr. Dallaire", could you also mention the source and how many UN sources you've consulted in arriving at this conclusion? 
A.	The sources which are available to me are Linda Melvern, where she makes reference to the two cases, the case of the famous fax, the famous fax message on arms caches, and then information on an anonymous letter on the preparation of genocide.  These are elements, information that I got from Linda Melvern, who is a reputable journalist.
Q.	The next one is the last paragraph on that page. 
A.	The last paragraph, which goes all the way to page 36 of the French version? 
Q.	Yes.  My question is also, what is the evidence and how do you prove that the UN was aware of your assertion in this paragraph?
A.	No, in this paragraph, I'm rather asking if the United Nations was aware of some information given by General - Major-General Nsabimana, who was the chief of staff, the information that was given to Colonel Marchal, which is taken up in Linda Melvern concerning a possible RPF attack.  This information was given, I believe, two days earlier.
Q.	Witness, the content is very clear.  It starts with, "Another equally unreasonable example was the famous unanimous letter purportedly written by a group of high-ranking FAR officers to Dallaire on
3 December 1993 which gave the details of the plans and preparations for the genocide."  

So you relied on it in posing your questions?
A.	No, I was answering -- I was reacting to the last paragraph, which is on pages 35 - 36.  Now, to answer this question, I ask myself questions about the fact that such great importance is accorded to an anonymous letter.  It is indicated it is an anonymous document.  Based on this anonymous letter, there is an alleged -- or there is an assertion that the genocide is being prepared, and it is specifically the importance accorded to an anonymous letter that I'm raising those questions.
Q.	Move on to page 50.
MS. OJEMENI:
I'm trying to find the French text, Your Honour.  It should be on page 37 up to -- no.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thirty-six. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, it is under -- it is the last paragraph of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Item 2, before "multiparty".
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, just before "multiparty".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Then that is the paragraph above.
MS. OJEMENI:
Under "UNAMIR", the last paragraph under "UNAMIR". 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It will be page 36, the last -- the third paragraph on that page. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In French. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And my question is simply on the -- just this sentence where you mentioned that the aggressors declared -- I guess you are referring to RPF when you say "they" from the point the aggressors -- let me take this whole sentence.  The sentence starts from page 49 of the English text, and it reads thus: "The conflict that broke out on 1 October 1990 in the name of ideas drawn from feudo-colonial 
times" - oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, "... rekindled the mistrust, doubts, suspicions and tensions, from the point the aggressors declared they were fighting in the name of the Tutsi, one of the ethnic groups."

Did that actually happen, and if yes, what is the source? 
A.	Well, obviously, mistrust, doubts, suspicion and we also mentioned tension as the war was getting closer.  During that period we see an increase in tension and disagreement which contrasts with the situation that prevailed before the war, that is, before 1st October 1990, and the use of the ethnic factor is also present because the problem -- the ethnic problem has often been referred to during that conflict.  So what you have there is simply the conclusion of the entire portion which went on before, which we analyse in the previous chapters from the standpoint of the media, political standpoint, which led to this -- which all led to this, and the conflict raised all these problems.
Q.	Does that then explain why the Tutsis, all Tutsis were regarded as the enemy in 1994?
A.	I don't know who considered all the Tutsis as enemies.  I never had that kind of information.
Q.	But RPF was considered enemy in 1994, isn't it?
A.	Yes, obviously.
Q.	We move to page 56.  It's page 41 of the French text.  And my question is on item 2, line -- the first -- line 4, starting from the top of item 2.  And it's on -- the fact that you use the words "armed conflict" when you describe the attack -- the plane crash.  And I'll read the particular sentence and it says "secondly" -- the second line starting from item 2, "the reality".  "Secondly, that the attack did not take place in a country where the situation was normal and peaceful but in a country which was grappling with an armed conflict in which Habyarimana was one of the main protagonists."
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are trying to locate the pages.  Can you now start again? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 56.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We did in English 56, yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Item 2, "the reality", second line.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And the French is 41.
MS. OJEMENI:
Is 41.
MR. PRESIDENT:
First paragraph or second one?
MS. OJEMENI:
Second paragraph.  It should be the second line, "ensuite".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, if you can go -- you can start all over again, please, what you are reading out.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You are discussing about the plane crash and the situation in Rwanda when the president's plane crashed.  

The second line reads: "Secondly, that the attack did not take place in a country where the situation was normal and peaceful, but in a country which was grappling with an armed conflict in which Habyarimana was one of the protagonists."

And my question is this: When the president's plane, that is the President Habyarimana's plane crashed, was there really an armed conflict in Rwanda; true or false, please, or yes or no?
A.	Rwanda was in a situation of war.  The war had not ended, the war that had started on the 1st --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, I didn't hear the date but the war that started during that period ... 
THE WITNESS:
-- had not yet ended and we were trying to install the mechanism for peace, lasting peace, but definitely the war was not over.
Q.	But the Arusha Accord was in place, wasn't it?
A.	Yes, but the fact is that you did not put a question to me on that issue.  We would have seen how the accords operated, what was their impact on the country.
Q.	So even with the accord, you are saying that there was no peace within the period that the accord was in place in Rwanda?
A.	There was no peace; there was a conflicting situation of tension.  Peace had not yet been installed because the process containing the accords had not yet been implemented and the accords had not been implemented.  The institutions that were provided for in the accord should have been set up, and the accord was not moving; it was not being implemented.
Q.	We are talking a period after -- before 6th April, isn't it, of 1994?
A.	Yes, you are putting -- you are asking me a question relating to the period when the plane was shot down, what the situation was.  That is the question, and I am telling you that specifically at that time the country was in a period of tension.  Every -- all the information that -- before indicated this because the provisions of the Arusha Accords have not been implemented, and it's because there were problems that these accords were not being implemented, and also taking into account the conditions under which they were negotiated and signed.
Q.	So, in your view, before -- on the 6th there was an armed conflict in Rwanda, 6th of April?
A.	I answered by saying that there was no war; there were no gunshots, and so on and so forth, but a conflict situation persisted and it was complicated and tense.
Q.	But such a situation you recall -- you regarded -- you regarded as an armed conflict?
A.	When the peace agreement failed, can one say that the conflict is ended?  Was the conflict terminated, whereas the process which was supposed to do away with it had broken down?  That was the situation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we would like to understand -- understand, Witness.  We follow your evidence with regard that there was no -- there was tension, but in the English  -- in the English text, it could be perhaps wrong translation.  The wording used or the words used, "were grappling with an armed conflict", what do you make of that?  That's what the English text says. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  What I'm saying is that -- is exactly that, but in the sense that I make a distinction between war and conflict because in a war there's an active combat but conflict is a socio-economic situation which is also political, but the demarcations are there.  We are dealing with a situation which is conflictual and tense.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we understand the conflict could be socio-political but "armed conflict", what would that denote? 
THE WITNESS:
The belligerents had not come to a settlement.  That is what I mean. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we move on to 58; page 58.  I'm on the second paragraph on page 58.  This starts with, "According to statistics".  That should be the last paragraph on 42 -- no, it's not.  Yes, page 42, French text. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's page 42, last paragraph, in the French text, Witness.
MS. OJEMENI:
And it's 58, English, the last paragraph.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have located it. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you are talking about the Hutus here and my question is -- your suggestion in this paragraph is to the effect that the people who died were killed by RPF.  My question is, how about the people who were killed by the Rwandan forces or Interahamwes?  How many Tutsis were killed by groups other than RPF?
A.	I have no statistics and that is why I didn't use them.  I cannot give you any figures on that.
Q.	But, indeed, there were people killed by other groups other than RPF?
A.	Yes, but I'm staying with the attack of February and here I'm bringing out the elements to which I referred in developing my view.
Q.	Why did you -- why did you not consider it necessary to also mention data on people killed, like Tutsi killed by Hutus or Tutsi killed by Rwandan Armed Forces, in your report?  All through your report your illustrations were of people killed or atrocities committed by the ones committed by -- in your view, they were committed by RPF.  Why did you not mention the atrocities or killings by the Rwandan forces or Interahamwes in your report?
A.	In the report I bring out the losses amongst the Rwandan population in general, the Rwandan people, but in this specific case, if I were to limit myself to that, I am mentioning what happened within a limited time frame and the impression that gave, especially the consequences with regard to numbers.  But, once again, let me say that I'm mentioning some elements which are generally not spoken of specifically, elements which the international organisations for human rights are not normally interested, or if they are so interested, they are inhibited, and this was seen systematically.  As for these victims, these are definitely victims who are innocent, they are Rwandan, regardless of the perpetrators of these attacks.  But my reasoning here is that I'm not making a census or an inventory of the victims.
Q.	Witness, do you agree with me that all through the report you've attributed the killings of either Tutsis or Hutus to the RPF in this report; yes or no?
A.	No, no, no.
Q.	 (Previous translation continued)...  where you mentioned Rwandan forces or Interahamwe or other killers of Tutsis or Hutus in this report. 
A.	I did mention, at a given point in time, the tensions which followed the killings of civilians.  I'm going to look for the particular place. 
Q.	Under what?  I will help you to find it. 
A.	It's item 7 in the French, page 22.  Because we have spoken about these problems, and if I'm not mistaken, a question was put to me there regarding the killings of Hutu and Tutsi civilians, and that that aspect increased tensions. 

Now, here I'm talking about all of these civilians who died outside the periods of military attack.  I mentioned both Hutu and Tutsi victims, regardless of the perpetrators of those killings.  I was also saying that this was considered under political light, but I have already mentioned the killings of civilians without incriminating the RPF, as you claim, or without incriminating the government forces. What I was interested in was the impact on these civilian populations who were not involved in the battlefield, irrespective of their ethnic group and irrespective of the perpetrators of those massacres. 
Q.	Do I -- I draw your attention that in that particular paragraph, "politically motivated murders", you stated and I'll quote: "Another facet of the problem was that the international community only focused attention on Tutsi victims, though the death of Hutu who were of the opposition, that is, distanced from or opposed to the RPF, was greeted with indifference."  So you cannot really say that the focus -- your focus was not on RPF in this paragraph. 
A.	No.  What I want to underscore in this paragraph is as follows.  It's the fact that there were --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where are you reading from? 
MS. OJEMENI:
It is page 30 in the English section -- in the English, 30, under item 7. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
"Politically motivated murder."
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, the last sentence in that paragraph. 
THE WITNESS:
The aspect that I'm underscoring about the issue is the following.  It's quite laudable that there were international investigations regarding the victims, and that's quite normal and laudable.  But the problem is this: The investigations were biased; they concerned one certain category of victims, whereas the other category was not benefitting from any interest.  So the consequence of that attitude is that it created, amongst some, frustration because they were not being interested in and there was, therefore, this bias within the international community.  So this is why I'm not saying that I'm going to insist on the RPF.  

I'm saying that there was a certain category of victims on which there was great interest and another category of victims for which one was not interested, for various reasons, but within the population this attitude could only bring about questions being posed or doubt under some tension.
Q.	Witness, you hate RPF, don't you?  You've really demonstrated that in this paragraph on page 58 that I drew your attention to.  What do you say to that?
A.	To what specific passage are you referring, please? 
Q.	I'm referring to page 58.  I drew your attention to it earlier on and it's on --
MR. PRESIDENT:
What page is it in the French, please?  Forty-two? Forty-two, last paragraph in French; 42, last paragraph in French, and 58, last paragraph on that page. 
THE WITNESS:
So is it the paragraph which goes from page 42 to 43?  No, I don't have any feelings of hatred or anything like that towards the RPF.  It's simply a result of an analysis after observation.  I'm not expressing my sentiment or feelings in that analysis.  This is what I can see, that there is certain political leaning and there are conclusions and events which lead me to formulating those conclusions.  I did not mention members of my family, and so on and so forth, in order to draw -- or to allow you to draw that conclusion.  I do not hate the RPF.  I don't despise it.  I consider it as I find it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
With the Court's permission, I would like to draw -- read certain parts of this paragraph, to draw this witness's attention to certain parts. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which issue? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Same paragraph. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you said you haven't demonstrated here that you don't hate the RPF, and I will refer you to certain questions you posed and certain statements you also made in there.  You are a professor and you are an expert; I will leave you to draw the conclusion from these statements that I will read and the questions. 

The first one is, "What about the shock of having 1,000,000 displaced persons living in inhuman conditions?"  That is the first question.  

"And I talk from experience.  I was part of a team which undertook the initiative to seek assistance for the displaced persons and that was how I was able to visit the Nkumba and Cyeru camps in Ruhengeri préfecture, and the Miyove and Ngarama camps in Byumba préfecture.  I travelled to the Nyacyonga and Mugambazi camps in March 1993, in search of my family.  Words cannot describe what I saw.  How could the Rwandan people react vis-a-vis the RPF, the cause of this misery and distress, and which wanted to cause even more misery and distress?  How could the RPF not keep up its offensive given the inertia and indifference of the international community vis-a-vis this situation?"

What do you make of this? 
A.	What I saw in these camps, I am relating what I saw, is that -- this is what the humanitarian agents saw.  The fact that I saw these things and I described them in that fashion -- whoever saw the conditions under which these people were living knows very well that they were living under conditions as I have described them here.  They did not have any shelter; they did not have any food; they didn't have any water; they didn't have any medical treatment -- some did exist but it was very limited.  And you can imagine camps of 300,000 people.  This is why I was saying that they had to go and harvest in the neighbouring fields what they needed to eat.  

One cannot describe these conditions as having been decent or acceptable.  So the fact that I put it in these terms demonstrates that I'm saying it in the same fashion as any agent of the International Red Cross Committee would have done, as an agent of Oxfam would have done.  I'm giving a description of what I saw.  I'm not expressing my feelings.  

What I was saying is that the people living under these conditions would have questions such as the ones I have put here.  I was saying that I could not find any words which were correct and exact to describe the conditions under which these people were living.  I didn't say that I didn't find any words to describe my own feelings.
Q.	I refer you now to another area, and that's page 60, English text.
A.	And in French, it's -- 
Q.	Where you are talking about atrocities committed by RPF, you cited Mr. Gérins. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 44, paragraph 1, about -- where Mr. "Somebody" Gérins is mentioned.  It would be about beyond ten lines, ten lines as you go down.  Have you seen it? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I'm aware I mentioned some Rwandan names.  I'll give it to the -- just to move faster, I'll give it to the stenographers later. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, I draw your attention to this particular paragraph, that's the first paragraph on page --
A.	What page? 
Q.	Forty-four of French, first paragraph; 44, French text, and then 60, English text.  My question is just on the atrocities that you have attributed to RPF which you said Gérins witnessed.  My question is: who is Gérins, spelled G-É-R-I-N-S?  Who is he?
A.	Mr. Gérins is someone who had a ranch in the touristic area of Kibungo to the east of the country.  He was living there.  He had a ranch, and he would receive tourists close to the Kibungo park to the east of the country.
Q.	And who was the owner of this ranch in 1994?
A.	Mr. Gérins was using that ranch.  I don't know whether he was the owner, but he was the one who was using it.
Q.	Was he not the manager of Habyarimana's ranch in 1994?
A.	I don't know anything about that.  I am not aware of what Habyarimana had as property or those who worked for him, but this man was in that area.  He was managing the ranch.  I don't know whether he was the owner or not. 
Q.	Well, I put it to you that he was the manager of Habyarimana's ranch.  And now, having told you this, whether you take it or not, but given the information, is this surprising to you that such a man should make the comment that you have represented on this page regarding the atrocities that you referred to as having been committed by RPF?
A.	No.  When I analyse a document, and I mentioned the case of Nyetera, and when there is an element which involves the RPF, I have the feeling that this element is referred directly to Habyarimana.  That was not my question.  But this man gave his testimony, and now these relationships between he and Habyarimana, I was not aware of them, but they obviously did not stop him from testifying to what he saw.  

But the issue would be, rather, to see whether this can be confirmed by other investigations, but it is certain that this person can give his point of view and talk about what he saw, especially the facts that he recounted.
Q.	Witness, even on this page it does not show that Mr. Gérins saw what you've stated or concluded that he saw, and I will draw your attention to that fact.  Your conclusion is this:  "It was generally thought that only the Interahamwes were capable of such a deed," referring to the atrocities that you said RPF committed, "And yet, can one imagine Tutsis killing themselves as the RPF approached?  Well, the Gérins saw some!  Mr. Gérins provides important testimony on how massacres committed by the RPF were filmed and then blamed on the Interahamwe."  That's your conclusion. 

Now, the quotation is this: "Between the 31st and 28th April, I saw with my own eyes a C-130 plane hedgehopping over the whole Rusumo-Kibungo zone.  It seemed to be photographing or filming the region and was not bothered at all by the RPF army.  It was therefore working in connivance with the army, preparing documents on those armed bands who could not be identified from the air.  It is therefore possible that actions by the RPF and their way of operating were attributed to the Interahamwes." 

"It seemed" and "it's possible", can you explain?
A.	That's not it.  When I said that they saw these things, I did not transcribe the passage here but Gérins confirms that he did see these people committing suicide.  The passage concerning the questions, I think this is important testimony which shows so-and-so and so-and-so.  That's a different matter.  But the second quotation does not illustrate the fact that Gérins saw people committing suicide.  

And another point is that the fact that he saw this, he is mentioning it in another part of the quotation.  I didn't take the whole quotation, but he does confirm that he saw people committing suicide when the RPF was approaching. 
Q.	Witness, as an expert, you are telling the Court you did not transcribe the passage before arriving at the conclusion you arrived at; is that correct?
A.	What you're saying is not correct.
Q.	Now, who is Wende, that you've also relied on, further down in the passage in this paragraph?
A.	Wende was a South African journalist.  He's a reporter who visited Rwanda during this period of time, and I believe he was also working for the BBC, but in this instance in Rwanda, he wrote two chapters in his book which we have at page 59 of the present report: "True North.  African roads less travelled".  He's a South African journalist.
Q.	You relied on his report in your -- I mean, his publication in your report.  Is this the source that you relied on in also concluding that the RPF committed atrocities?
A.	No, that really is not a conclusion and that really is not what I said.  In fact, it's the same Kibungo region and he was surprised that they could see fresh bodies, people who had just been killed, and that it was difficult to attribute that to the Interahamwe when the region had been under RPF control for three weeks.  That is why he had doubts.  That is what I have cited.  He was wondering how these killings could be attributed to the Interahamwe because that was the idea that was widespread at the time.
Q.	Witness, return to page 63, that's for the English text; page 46, French text.  And my question is on French text, page 47, but English is 63.  I draw your attention to page -- where you mention page 18 -- sorry, page 17.  You mention page 17.  It should be the second paragraph on page 47.  You put "p17: RPF, at least 200,000 people have been killed in six weeks." 

My question is what is the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 63, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
And the third line to the bottom.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Third line from the bottom; okay, right.
MS. OJEMENI:
Reading "p17: RPF", then inverted comma, "At least 200,000 people have been killed in six weeks."
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What is the ethnicity of the 200,000 people that were killed?
A.	All these figures, starting from page 46, I believe all the way to page 48, making reference to the reports which are in the annex, to give an example of a report on victims which is normally overlooked, which is very rarely referred to, I said that there are certain aspects that are highlighted and certain aspects that are overlooked, and I gave the example of this report which gives details, details of testimony on killings which the RPF is guilty of, because very often it is said extensively that that was not the case. So I took these -- so what I gave on page 46 - 48 was to give indications of reports on violations of human rights and killings which happened on that side.
Q.	Witness, my question, you can see I selected a particular killing of 200 (sic) people, and you cited your source.  So I'm not interested in the rest.  It's just this one that I'm interested in and I've asked you a question: What is the ethnicity that the author mentioned in that publication of the people -- I mean regarding the people, 200 (sic) people you mention in this particular paragraph, what is the ethnicity of the 200 (sic) people mentioned in this paragraph and what is their ethnicity?
A.	I think I have just answered your question.  Maybe you are not satisfied with that answer.  I'm placing this passage among a number of -- as part of a whole which I got from a document, and annexed to this is number 4, and I explain why I put it there, that it is to give an idea of violations, of killings of persons during that period.  I don't know where they are classified.  I don't know where they are generally classified.  And the report attributes this to the RPF.  And when you take the totality of all these victims, you realise that it is considerable and that these are not isolated crimes.  Sometimes there are hundreds, sometimes thousands.  So it is just to illustrate this aspect.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you say to that?  If you know the ethnicity, you can say so; if you don't know, you can say so as will.  We have followed the rest of your evidence.  Can you answer counsel's question? 
THE WITNESS:
In the quotation that she referred to, I cannot refer to that question because I do not know.  That is page 17 of the report on page 63.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You do not know the ethnicity of the alleged victims?
THE WITNESS:
As it is given, I do not know.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And is it your evidence that you did not consult this Le Soir of 19 May 1994 before quoting -- stating this quote in your report?  Is it your evidence that you did not?
A.	No, I did not consult that newspaper.  Once again, I'm coming back to this point.  I wanted to give a general impression of these reports -- from these reports which are given in the annex, I give a case that illustrates killing of the civilian populations by the RPF.
Q.	Is it your evidence, Witness, that you don't know whether the author stated that it was the RPF that killed these people, nor -- or whether the author also stated their ethnicity?
A.	Let me go to the document, because we have it.
Q.	I'm talking of -- do you have the Le Soir of 19 May 1994 that you referred to here?  That's my question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How do you spell Le Soir, Counsel? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Le Soir is L-E -- sorry, Le Soir, L-E S-O-I-R.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Slowly.  L-E --
MS. OJEMENI:
S-O-I-R.  Your Honour, it is indicated on page 64.  He mentioned the source of this quotation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
On page 64?

MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, of the English text.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, I did not refer to the newspaper Le Soir.  I said I referred to the report that was written by the Centre for Fighting Impunity.  That is annex No. 4.  We have it here.  And the passage is on page 17 of that report, and I read it as follows.  I am going to read it.  Colette Braeckman, referring to the offence, the RPF attack, wrote as follows:  "At least 200,000 people have been killed in six weeks.  The HCR is talking about refugees being deliberately shot as they try to leave the country, villagers gathered together in schools and cut into pieces with machetes and people thrown alive into the Akagera river with their feet and wrists tied together." 

So it is this report which is quoted by Colette Braeckman, and Colette Braeckman, as you can also see, refers to the HCR which made reference to the RPF deliberately shooting refugees leaving the country.  So I did not consult Le Soir.  That was not my intention.  My intention was to draw attention to the  report which I have supplied in annex.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And you've also told the Court you did not even consult the book written by Braeckman but it was included in another source that you used; isn't it?
A.	Well, that is something else.  I've said that and I don't want to come back to it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I need an answer to my question, whether yes or no.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which was your question? 
MS. OJEMENI:
My question was, because he's quoted something by Braeckman and I'm asking him whether -- whether his answer is still that he did not consult the book written by Braeckman, because it's not the book he's reading from; he's reading from somewhere else.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  This has been asked and answered.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no, not with respect to this aspect.
MR. HINDS:
Which aspect? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The one that is under discussion.  He did talk about reference to Braeckman with regard to a particular issue.
MR. HINDS:
And that is what she is going back to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  He didn't answer that question.
MR. HINDS:
All right. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to know whether Counsel is talking about reference to Braeckman in this case, in this particular case.  In this particular case, I did say that my reference is not Colette Braeckman.  I made reference to someone who was quoting Colette Braeckman and who was quoting from other sources.  It's not only Colette Braeckman; he quotes other sources.  And in order not to give just a small quotation I gave -- I supplied the whole reference in annex.  The document is attached as an annex to this report.  

Now, to come back to the book that we saw yesterday, I did say I have not read that book and I have not changed. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You've answered my question in respect of this particular issue that is before the Court now.  

Witness, move to 66, 67; I'll take two paragraphs together, and what I want is just the source.  Sixty-six, item (c), item (f), and the paragraph below it, all linked together to UNAMIR.  Could you tell the Court your basis for the conclusions?  It's 49 of the French text, runs into page 50 of the French text, item (c), item (f), and then the next paragraph up to where you are discussing about UNAMIR.  All of them, all these paragraphs are in respect of UNAMIR.

Can you tell the Court your source for the information in those paragraphs?
A.	For paragraph (f), I did not note it but that is a reference to Melvern because she is closely interested in that situation and she analysed it.  So it's Linda Melvern that I made reference to in the references. 
Now, the next paragraph -- I did not clearly understand counsel's question.
Q.	Item (c), do you have an answer for item (c) on page 66, page 49 of French, which is also on UNAMIR, General Dallaire?
A.	Paragraph (c), all those points -- in all those points I'm referring to Linda Melvern, from (a) to (f) and possibly --
Q.	 (Previous translation continued) ...  the date the events took place?
A.	The date of each event? 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	Well, I would not be able to be precise, but for item (a), for example, I know is the 7th February.  I'm sorry.
Q.	(F), I directed you to particular paragraphs first. 
A.	Well, there, I don't have it in my memory but these were the few days before the interim government was set up.  There, the army was under the command of Colonel Gatsinzi.
Q.	Now we move on to the same page, on 67.  You talked about it was after the agreement in Arusha that Tutsi in an area became arrogant, and you quoted what some of them told some people, and Wende is your source.  My question is, is killing the Tutsis -- is the killing of over 500 (sic) Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994 an appropriate measure to be taken for people who are arrogant, as you stated in that paragraph?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETERS:
Can Counsel please repeat the question for the interpreters? 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You highlighted the quotation from Wende, which talks about the killing of Tutsis --
A.	No, it does not talk about killings.
Q.	 (Previous translation continued) ... the arrogance of Tutsis after the agreement at Arusha?
MR. HINDS:
Counsel, could you give us a page and paragraph, please?
MS. OJEMENI:
It is page 67.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is page 67, second paragraph.  He seems to be addressing the quotation which appears at the end in highlighted.  Got it? 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	My question, I'm asking your view: Is the killing of over 500,000 Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994 an appropriate measure for people who were arrogant, as indicated in Wende's quotation?
A.	I would like to point out two things:  I'm not referring to them as arrogant.  Here, I'm only quoting a passage which illustrates what I wanted to demonstrate. 

The other point, I did not say nor insinuate that that is how things ought to happen.  The point I wanted to make is that the situation had evolved in such a manner that there was inter-ethnic tension, and this journalist who came to Butare was referring to a situation of tension, a situation of conflict.  I don't know if trouble here would encompass killings, problems, tension.  

But what is said there is not my own view but it reflects what I was saying, that -- to the effect that the conflict had set up -- had pitted one ethnic group against the other.
Q.	Witness, page 67, which is 50 in French, you quoted Gasana, paragraph 2 on page 68.  That's paragraph 2 also on page 50 of French text.  You quoted Gasana talking about how millions of lives (sic) lost their lives, and you did not state who killed them.  My question is: Is it cows that killed them as he was discussing there?  So who killed them?
A.	No, the cows are not the perpetrators of these killings, obviously.  But for Gasana, the RPF cleared a space for its cows, cleared a space by killing extensively, and that is what he says in his analysis.
Q.	I'm referring to your own conclusion that this partially explains why such a small country lost millions of lives.  That's what I'm referring to.  And who killed these millions of lives?
A.	Gasana gives an overall figure, 3,550,000.  To say who killed all those people, I think we are in a very specific situation.  And it is this conflict as it evolved, a generalisation of the tension, which led to this loss of human lives.  

There were Hutus who lost their lives and Tutsis who lost their lives.  There were Hutus who were perpetrators of these killings and Tutsis who were perpetrators of these killings.  But I cannot say 
it's X or Y.  The fact is that there was a situation, an explosive situation, such that as we had seen with the death of the president giving the tension that prevailed, the fear, the despair, and the reaction of people that the president has been killed even though he was protected, escorted, so what will become of us?  That is the reaction to the antagonism that I referred to, such that there was spontaneous reaction, there was a spontaneous reaction relating to the explosive conflictual situation that developed during that period. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, with regard to the conclusion drawn to your attention by counsel, you say you are quoting, relying upon Kasana -- or Gasana, I beg your pardon.  I have in mind the sentence that starts with "This partly explains".  You see -- are you accepting wholesale what Gasana is saying?  

What's your own assessment of whatever is being said, I mean, using this one as an example because it's true figures have been mentioned here and there, but then how do you evaluate and how do you help us?  Because we are interested to know your opinion, and you are the one testifying here as an expert.  

So, do you agree with whatever is being stated, and if you agree, what are the reasons?  So, what do you say in this last paragraph, for example, in a nutshell, in one or two minutes, one minute, if you understand the issue we are raising? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand.  My first point is that Gasana is a specialist; he's an agronomist, specialising in development issues, and then he became a politician.  He has analysed this situation.  He's been an active actor, and then he left the country.  My viewpoint on this analysis is that is very relevant, very relevant because he is one of those people who tried to assess the number of victims, which is between 2 and 3 million, if not more. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But what is more relevant, is it correct? 
THE WITNESS:
It is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why would you say that?  How would you reach that conclusion? 
THE WITNESS:
I'm referring to his arguments, the train of his arguments because, specifically, a reference has been made to cows and the cows indeed needed space.  And we saw in the media the reference to the situation, the pre-1959 situation such that when you consider the policy of moving people from their properties in Kibungo and Byumba prefectures, you realise that indeed the RPF wanted a popular or grassroots base so as to be able to easily breed their cattle.  

When -- towards the end of the events, when you look at the number of victims, well, obviously, this is not a determinant but what you realise is that the accumulation of all these facts caused or brought about a considerable number of victims.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't want -- we follow your evidence but we would like to see the -- make a distinction between deductions on events and actual information that you like to portray, you are in a position to portray to us an expert.  

Let's go on, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, looking at the time --
THE WITNESS:
Well, the information that I can give is that as we have analysed in the course of the previous chapter, there was tension which developed and led to a situation which I refer to as uncontrollable, where all the authorities were overwhelmed, where all the security agencies were overwhelmed and --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am asking about the data, not the -- with the scenario, we have it. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, looking at the time, will I be obliged to use --
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long do you still have to go on? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Three more questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please go on.  Please go on.  If you think you are likely to -- How much time will that be required?
MS. OJEMENI:
Fifteen minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, then we can delay. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, Gasana was once a member of RPF; was a member of Habyarimana's government, defected to RPF and left.  Am I correct?
A.	No, that is not correct.  No, that is not correct.
Q.	Now, Witness, I bring your - I draw your attention to page 69.  That is on the demistification of the key terms used in the conflict.  It's page 51 of the French text.  

Witness, it is your evidence that you relied on media in some of the conclusions you drew.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I relied on the media or on books.
Q.	Why did you then interpret words like Inyenzi, Inkotanyi on the -- why did you limit the interpretation of Inyenzi, Inkotanyi to the dictionary meaning or the ordinary meaning, without including that they were used to referred to Tutsis by the media in 1994?
A.	I have no evidence of any newspaper in which the term Inkotanyi or Inyenzi made reference to the Tutsis.  Obviously, the trend when you want to take advantage of a situation of confusion, but Inkotanyi, Inyenzi on no account -- on no account are equivalent of Tutsis.
Q.	Witness, are you telling the Court that you never at any point in time heard RTLM referring to Tutsis as Inyenzis or Inkotanyi? 
A.	I never heard anyone in the newspapers or in the media saying that the Tutsi are Inkotanyi or they are Inyenzi.  I never saw that equivalence being made.  I never heard any such thing.  

I heard about Inkotanyi when they were talking about soldiers of the RPF, but I did not hear anywhere where they said that Tutsi is equal to Inyenzi. 
Q.	Are you telling this Court that even from the people of Rwanda, the Hutus, you never heard any reference to the Tutsi made in form of Inyenzi; that the Tutsis in 1994 in Ruhengeri prefecture, where you were residing, that you never heard anybody call the Tutsis Inyenzi?  Is that what you're telling the Court?
A.	Yes, that is what I maintain.  That is what I'm saying.
Q.	And it's also your evidence that you never heard the word Inyenzis being used by RTLM in referring -- in reference to the Tutsis in 1994?
A.	No.  I said that Inyenzi -- or I've said in the report that Inyenzi is sometimes used to refer to Inkotanyi, but I'm saying that I had never heard anyone define Tutsis as being Inyenzi.  That is what I'm repeating.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I refer you to Kangura publication -- before I draw your attention to that, Witness, is it also your evidence that before 1994 you never heard the word Inyenzi used in reference to Tutsi in Rwanda?
A.	Never.
Q.	I refer you to Kangura of February 1993, and it's in French.  The editors are Célestin Mirasano, Sibomana, Nabantu, and Noël Hitimana.  I spell Célestin Mirasano, M-I-R-A-S-A-N-O, and Sibomana Nabantu is spelled S-I-B-O-M-A-N-A  N-A-B-A-N-T-U.  Noël Hitimana is spelled H-I-T-I-M-A-N-A.  And it's at page -- the second page of this document.  I would like you to read this document to the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the date? 
MS. OJEMENI:
It's February 1993, Kangura No. 40.
MR. PRESIDENT:
February? 
MS. OJEMENI:
1993, and it's Kangura No. 40.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HINDS:
I don't know what Counsel is attempting to do at this point but all she can do is show the -- or have this witness read the document and ask him whether or not he has ever seen it or whether or not -- whatever he knows about it.  If his answer is no, that's the end of it.  She cannot introduce the document that way.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I wanted to show -- I just read the document.  I wanted to show it to the witness.  You can't pre-empt me.  I haven't done anything.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and you need to see it also.  You can show it to the witness.  The date, February? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Kangura No. 40, February 1993.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Kangura.
MS. OJEMENI:
No. 40.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No. 40.
MS. OJEMENI:
February 1993. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is a monthly paper?
MS. OJEMENI:
I guess so.  It should it be, Your Honour.  They are usually in numbers. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we object to the document on the following grounds.  The document is not a publication but a translation of a publication.  The publication is normally printed in colours.  This is not.  It's printed in Kinyarwanda, the language.  This is in French.  And this is clearly -- someone has lifted from whatever the publication purports to be, and this is not the publication itself.  This is a translation of a publication which was in Kinyarwanda, but whatever this purports to be, it is not the publication.  And so this document which the Prosecutor has is not the publication that she purports and is, in 
fact -- has set the foundation for.  It is not the publication.  So we object. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, we have established procedure in this court and I thought my learned friend's objection would have come if I wanted to tender the document, and that's what we've always done.  So the witness would have -- it is left for the witness to tell me that he doesn't recognise the document.  But as the document states clearly the publication number, it is left for my learned friend, if he wants to verify, to verify.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  She is offering a document.
MS. OJEMENI:
It is entirely in the hands of the Court.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the Prosecutor is offering a document which she purports to be a publication, which it isn't.  So we start from that premise.  She cannot offer -- I mean, whatever she wants to do with the document is another question, but she cannot make the proffer that she is making. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid, Counsel we cannot go -- the document cannot be given to the witness in the light of that, unless of course you have the document itself and then we can have the certification of copies if they are available, but I think, in fairness to the witness, he must have a document that is authentic.  We are not saying it is not, but going by the rules of procedure that obtain in general issues of evidence and documentations -- and in documents in general terms.
MS. OJEMENI:
As the Court pleases.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, it is interesting to note that under your interpretation of Interahamwe you mentioned the meaning of components of Interahamwe, the words that make up Interahamwe, and this is on page 69 of the English text. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Sixty-nine of the English text, which is also page 51 in the French text. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Then you numbered them.  Gutera, for instance, means -- has several meanings:  (a) to plant, (b) to throw, (c) to attack, (d) to appear.  And then you also mention hamwe, which means together -- (a) together, (b) same -- same place, (c) in an identical manner, you said.  

Then the compound word Interahamwe, and according to you, the compound word excludes (a), which is to plant -- it excludes (a), (b), (c), which I believe you are referring to the (a), (b), as you've demonstrated on page 69, and according to you, Interahamwe means only people of the same age group but it doesn't mean people who attack together.  What do you say to this?
A.	Interahamwe means those who have the same view because they are together, people who have the same height, the same gait and possibly the same objectives.  It means they are together.  They stand in solidarity.  It does not mean those who attack together. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I refer you to the meaning of ukubohoza.  What does that mean, which is spelled
U-K-U-B-O-H-O-Z-A?
A.	Which word? 
Q.	It's still on the same page 70, English text, which is 52, French text.  It's spelled U-K-U-B-O-H-O-Z-A.  You referred to the MRND youth wing as ukubohoza; is that correct?
A.	No, I don't see where that passage is. 
Q.	English text, page 70.
A.	Yes.  So can you now repeat your question?  I found the passage.
Q.	Is that the name of the MRND youth wing as you've stated there?  Isn't it ukubohoza?
A.	No.
Q.	Is that the name of the MRND youth wing -- I mean, the MDR youth wing?
A.	No, it is not the name of the youth wing of the party. 
Q.	So what does that mean then?
A.	That word -- I believe I've used it already -- but the word simply means freedom; freedom.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where is it?  I'm sorry, I can't --
MS. OJEMENI:
It's on page 70, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, 70. 
MS. OJEMENI:
And it's the second paragraph.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Second paragraph, mm-hm.
MS. OJEMENI:
The sentence which says, "He then formed a group of youth wings called Interahamwe; their purpose was to brainstorm on a political opening ..."
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  Thank you.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And MRND against -- I mean, "MDR youth wing", then comma, ukubohoza.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and he says what does that term mean, he says.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, what does the term mean?  If it's not the name of MRND, what does the term mean?
A.	Here I would like to apologise because there is a portion of my text which is missing.  But ukubohoza is a Kinyarwanda term -- maybe I should spell for the stenographers.  Ukubohoza is 
U-K-U-B-O-H-O-Z-A.  Just a moment.  

I have already used this word when I made reference to political parties.  That is why I did not explain it here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can tell us.  We will find it out on the record if it is here.
THE WITNESS:
It means "freedom", simply.
MR. HINDS:
My staff here is telling me that there is a problem in the translation between the French and the English as it relates to this word ukubohoza, ukubohoza. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
And maybe we should just have the witness read out that portion, the sentence in French, and so that it is translated from the booth.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Starting from where, "He then formed a group"? 
MR. HINDS:
Okay, starting with "On the political scene", going right down to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ukubohoza.
MR. HINDS:
-- ukubohoza.  If he could start that in the French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you read that out, using your French original text, starting from "On the political scene".  I don't know how that will look. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  "On the political scene," it appears this gentleman, Anastase Gasana, who had the idea of a youth league of the MRND which our MRND member ... (No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's going on?  The English translation.
MR. HINDS:
Could we start over again?  I think that there is some question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
English interpreter? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Your Honour, there was some disturbance here.  If the speaker could start all over again.  We are sorry about that, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
It is half past 1:00 and I would like to have this matter finalised before we go for our lunch break.  

Okay, can you repeat; can you start all over again, Witness? 
THE WITNESS:
"On the political scene it appears that it is Mr. Anastase Gasana who brought the idea of a youth league of the MRND which another member of the MRND, D. Murenzi, operationised at the end of 1991 of his own volition.  He then formed a youth group called Interahamwe, whose objective is to carry out a brainstorm for political opening required by the party if he did not want to be swept away by the increasingly aggressive youth of the MDR through the ukubohoza."

In fact, I have already used the ukubohoza and I explained that it means simply freedom, and in this specific case, the context of political parties, the MDR wanted to bring towards itself the militants or the members of the MRND, and that is what is referred to as the ukubohoza, or freedom.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, ukubohoza, does it also mean taking something by force?
A.	In this specific context, that is what that means within the socio-political context of the time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And was it the name used by the MDR youth wing? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, in the beginning it was used by the youth wing of the MDR -- or, rather, the politicians of the MDR, because they said they needed to free these people because they were prisoners of the regime.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think this is what you are saying here in this sentence, isn't it? 
THE WITNESS:
No, the name, it refers to the process or the technique.  So the MDR youth were going to free the MRND using the liberation technique which is referred to here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, what was your question? 
MS. OJEMENI:
My question was whether ukubohoza -- I asked him if ukubohoza also -- the meaning of ukubohoza also means taking something by force, and he said yes, it does in this context.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
The last question, Your Honour. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, what is your view about the killing of over 500 (sic) in Rwanda in 1994, who killed them and could you tell the Court what your view is on this killing of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994?
A.	As I have already said, in 1994 we found ourselves in a rather peculiar situation.  In 1994 there was -- it was not only the death of Tutsis.  Hutus also died and possibly Twas.  My view is not -- is that it's not 500,000 Tutsis who died.  There were a lot of Rwandan victims and I don't distinguish -- I don't make distinctions of Hutus and Tutsis.  

There were a lot of Rwandan victims who were victims of that conflict which was serious and generalised, this conflict which affected all the structures of the country.  And my feeling is that there was a lot of hatred, a lot of passion.  I don't really know how to describe that.  And that goes beyond the purely Tutsi problem.  It affected the whole Rwanda and affected so many circumstances, and it goes beyond a simple execution.
Q.	Is it fair for me to say that the over 500 (sic) Tutsi that were killed by -- over 500 (sic) Tutsis who died in Rwanda in 1994 were killed by Interahamwe and soldiers and Hutu population?
A.	Once again, I think it's more complex than that because we need to look at what Interahamwe is.  We've seen that.  We've looked at the term, but you didn't allow me to take you to the end -- all the way into the analysis that I have in mind.  Because we are in a context of generalised disorder where there were possibly soldiers of the armed forces who were on mission and killed civilians, RPF soldiers who killed civilians, armed groups which were formed all over the country, without necessarily belonging to political parties.  

What we normally refer to as Interahamwe has nothing to do with the original Interahamwe which we have seen.  So this has to do with all those people who probably had weapons and who were out because they were not employed, because there was a situation - a problem of unemployment.  So that is much more complicated than people who just got organised to go and kill.  Because, once again, if we are talking about 500,000 victims who were killed in that they were Tutsis, I don't want to refer to this but Anastase Gasana makes reference to government sources of 2 million, and Gasana mentions 3 million.  

So you see there it's much more complicated, that in 1994 we have to look at things that happened before and things that happened after, not limited to the three months.  So there were victims who were Hutus and Tutsis and there were all sorts of killings. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  This marks my cross-examination and I apologise to the Court for being --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  No, no, no.  We will stop here and we come back at 3:10.  We will adjourn these proceedings 
to 3 o'clock -- to 10 past 3:00, to 10 past 3:00.  When we come back, we will have the re-examination of the witness by the Defence.  

Any idea, Professor Hinds, how long you are likely to be?  We are not tying you to a specific time frame but we just want to have some idea.  If it could be shorter, it would be appreciated.
MR. HINDS:
I will make every effort to finish my re-direct today, but bearing in mind that we have had over a day and a half of cross on nearly everything the witness has said.  But I'm going to make every effort to be as short as possible.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please try to be as short as possible so that we can finish the testimony of this witness today and then see how we programme our work for tomorrow.  It might help these proceedings if the testimony of this witness was ended today, and tomorrow we start with getting into how does the Accused start his testimony.
MR. HINDS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Taking note of what you said yesterday.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, since we are on this point, I think it may be helpful so that we all have a road map of how we are getting from here to the end of the session.  I have in mind and I've spoken to -- I've not been able to finish my preparation of Mr. Kajelijeli -- I anticipate taking about four hours to do that -- but bearing in mind that I think we all need to know what is on the landscape.  

Is the Prosecution proceeding with a rebuttal case?  I think that we need to know that.  I don't think that we need to be blindsided.  We need to know where we are going.  

The Court has given four weeks for us to complete whatever we are doing on the end of the Defence case and then whatever the Prosecution intends to do.  Now, including tomorrow, we have nine specific days; all right, two weeks and one day, including tomorrow.  So in terms of organising ourselves, I'm planning to proceed with Mr. Kajelijeli tomorrow afternoon, depending on how we proceed here, if we are -- with the indulgence of the Court, depending upon my situation with preparing him.  

If I am allowed -- if we are not able to finish his preparation, I'm prepared to start with him on the understanding that I can finish the preparation.  I will be dealing with the preliminaries and finish the preparation over the weekend.  If that is all right, we could proceed.  
I'm looking now at the amount of time that we have.  I'm just looking.  My estimate is two days of him.  That's what I am projecting.  But I'm willing to move as quickly forward as possible to get him started.  But if I'm not able to finish the preparation in -- tomorrow morning, that's my plan, I'm going to make an application to the Court that I could work with him over the next three days, because all I'm going to be dealing with is preliminaries anyhow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I think the Prosecution has taken note of what you have said and we will see this evening how we organise our work for tomorrow, taking into account all that, Counsel, you have said.  But what is important is that surely tomorrow the testimony of the Accused will have to start within the time frames which we will have to discuss and have them agreed upon this afternoon, but we plan -- the Trial Chamber plans that the testimony will start tomorrow, at some stage tomorrow.  We will hear you, we will hear the Defence on this particular aspect with regard to the arrangements of preparation.  And then this could be carried on farther on Monday.  We seem to not to be sitting on Friday to enable everybody to do other things and then maybe to prepare for more effective work next week. 

So, then we will start -- resume our work at quarter past 3:00, quarter past 3:00.  But the conclusion of the re-examination in chief and the Judges' questions should be programmed by the end of this day.
MR. HINDS:
I hope so.

	(Court resumed at 1519H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not on) 

Sorry, the proceedings are resumed and we continue the testimony of this witness.  Re-examination for the Defence, Mr. Hinds, learned Counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
I apologise to the Court for my delay but I left my robe upstairs; it was not a protest. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, yes. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Professor, in your testimony on cross-examination, you said that you selected sources for your report in order to make a new contribution.  What did you mean by making "a new contribution"?
A.	By bringing in a new contribution, I mean looking at aspects or elements or the one side which is generally, which is generally ignored or not emphasised, when it is a matter of the Rwandan conflict or its consequences; these things which don't generally appear in the media.
Q.	Now, during your cross-examination, you were accused of omissions, that is, failure to provide a balanced report with respect to events that impacted on the Tutsi population.  Can you share with the Tribunal the reasons why you provided information and data in the form that you did within your report?
A.	My intention was in no way meant to become biased or appear biased.  I was trying to bring out elements, which I said, seemed to have been neglected or which are not taken into account adequately, especially with regard to the relations between the various ethnic groups, because I do not -- I did not deny what is affirmed on the other side, and I am not seeking to contradict what others have already said or what is already quite well known within the media.  I sought to bring in new light by emphasising, for instance, how the relationships between two ethnic groups have been tainted by an ambiguity or mistrust on either side or at least how this situation of doubt of an equal fraternity has developed.  So I was looking at these factors which are not emphasised, because this situation and its development enables one to understand the real roots of the Rwandan conflict which led to the tragedy that we witnessed in 1994.  I did this with a desire to bring something which can contribute to our having a general overview of the situation which prevailed in that country.
Q.	Now, Witness, you talked about the historical background of inter-ethnic relations and in particular you, in your -- in the first chapter of your report, you talked about mythology, Rwandan mythology.  What was the relevance of the Gihanga myth, in your opinion, to events of 1994?  What is the relevance of the Gihanga myth?
A.	The relevance of this myth in relation to the events of 1994 is evident, because in 1994 the ethnic groups involved were essentially the Tutsis and the Hutus, and the Gihanga myth speaks of relations and goes to the very origin -- I am speaking about mythical levels, of the relationships of these two groups.  This myth used a variance which could differ depending on their regions or the individual in question, but the essence remanded the same.  This myth explains how inequality between ethnic groups living within Rwanda, how inequality invaded society.  It's the mythical, in quotes, "father" who gave authority over the others and that this ought to have been like that.  He gave that authority on the basis of the qualities of one individual to whom he gave the authority and by punishing the shortcomings of those who are condemned to domination.  Now, these myths were still to be found in the 1940s and 1950s, and with the development of time, that did not lead to a review of the myth.  

The relevance of this myth is that it enables one to understand how the system of inequality which marked Rwanda at the time of 1959.  It shows how or tries to explain how the system practised this inequality which was perceived as natural or normal.  From the point in time where the dominated group accepts or resigns itself to domination, there is no problem, but from the time there is a non-acceptance of that domination, and this is still contained within the myth, we would then move onto a conflictual situation because there would be individuals wanting to maintain the status quo as seen in the myth, whereas others would want to remove themselves from the influence of the myth.  

What happened in 1959 and after 1959 is that there is no myth or the negation of the myth which is present and that attitude orients people as to whether they want to go back to the situation as presented by the myth or whether they are going to contest or challenge that situation. 
(Pages 64 to 65 by Judith Baverstock)
















1530H
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, what was your source or sources for the Gihanga myth, as you describe in your report?
A.	I said that it was a myth, within the framework of Rwandan literature, because there's this proper literature, but that is oral literature, which is not written, in which tales were told in the evening or during the day but, generally speaking, it was in the night, the evenings, and it was, first of all, within this context that tales of these myths became familiar to me.  But, to be more specific, because we may have to give reference to someone who wants to read the myth and see it, ascertain whether these myths were codified.  I do not mention this in the bibliography, but we can find a version, a detailed version in the book "Interethnic Relations", a book of which I'm a co-author, in the chapter authored by Maniragaba.  Maybe I can spell the name, it's spelled M-A-N-I-R-A-G-A-B-A.  So, for someone who wants a reference in order to do a check, there is also in the chapter a review of all -- no, not all, but a certain number of versions, a critical and comparative review of the Gihanga myth.  Also it was a phenomenon which is found amongst some historians.  I've mentioned the "Cannon of Lacger", I think I'll spell his name, also, for the purpose of the record.  The initial is L and there's the de, D-E in the lower case, another name spelt capital L-A-C-G-E-R.  This was a historian who refers to the role of this myth.
Q.	Now, Professor, you described and attempted to distinguish the feudal system as understood in the European context from that of Rwanda.  Can you summarise for us what you meant by the distinctions that you made between serfdom and feudalism, within the Rwandan context?
A.	I said that each time a surname was linked to a given situation there is sometimes a problem of connotation and the like, but what I insisted on, in drawing that parallel, was a situation of domination, a situation of pressure exerted, a situation of exploitation, which characterised the relations between ethnic groups.  On the one hand, Tutsis were said to be about ten percent and Hutus, who were about 85 percent, and the Twa, who were approximately one percent.  So what I was insisting on was the domination relationships, and I think these can be illustrated. 

I have already said that the situation was such that it was necessary to find someone, if one was unable to find someone, well, in any case one was forced to do so, so there was a situation of dependency amongst the people and this was anchored in the system.  And in the Rwandan language we referred to it as ubuke, which is spelt U-B-U-K-E.  I believe this can be translated as serfdom or a system of having clientele, but this was also parallelled by another system which is Ugawetdra.  I hadn't mentioned this but this was an aspect which harks back on the forced nature of the services provided by the subject.  And when I'm referring to dependency, this was a situation which was widespread.  There was a system of serfdom or clientism, the king had below him all the country and directly there were the chiefs, with his servants, his Abagaragu, so the chiefs had underneath them subchiefs and these subchiefs, administratively speaking, were responsible to the chiefs for whom they were clients, given the situation under which the chief became chief.  So, the king, the chiefs and the subchiefs, outside the administrative service, they would have, each one of them, servants at home.  Under the subchiefs there were what was known as Igisonga.  These would be -- subchiefs are known as Igisonga.  I can spell that word for you; the singular is I-G-I-S-O-N-G-A.  They had heads of hillsides under them, but each one had a servant, be it male or female.  So, on the other side there was the Hutu or Tutsi population, but each of these chiefs, depending on the hierarchy, would be responsible to the superior.  Now, at the lower levels there would be Tutsis who generally had economic heritage, cattle, and then you would have Hutus.  

Tutsis who were rich, because these Tutsis were rich they had economic power in hand so they had servants, Hutus who were in their service, and by that I mean Hutus who were working for them, for a minimum recompense or salary but didn't have anything to do with human dignity.  Everyone was being placed under some form of protection or other.  

On the other hand, you would have the Hutu masses who were there, they didn't have cattle, those who did were fortunate; or Tutsis who had nothing and they, this category of people needed to look for protection from the more powerful.  So what happened was all this mass was mobilised.
Q.	Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's re-examination, it's not a question of clarification.  This is new evidence that is being laid here.  We would appreciate clarification arising from issues that are raised on cross-examination; we take note of that.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, I'd like you, as you testify, look at me from time to time, so that I can give you an indication of whether or not I'd like you to go forward with the testimony or I'd like you to stop. 

Now, Witness, can you demonstrate, on a piece of paper, this Ubuhake (sic) system that you are describing, how that laid out with respect to the role of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I think this is not re-examination, this is new evidence.
MR. HINDS:
No, this isn't new evidence, Your Honour, there were a lot of questions asked concerning feudalism, serfdom, and I'm now asking this witness to, in fact, lay out in a --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have some idea of history.  We understand his evidence.  We want some clarification.  This is not a factual witness.  We'd like him to illustrate, in general terms, the principles on which his report is based, some of his findings are based on.
MR. HINDS:
Absolutely, I'm dealing with opinions and asking this expert to lay out in graphics.  You don't want me to do that, then I won't.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we don't.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, with respect to a Shebuja, who is a Shebuja, S-H-E-B-U-Z-A (sic), in the context, you testified about a Shebuja in the context of the feudal system.  Am I mispronouncing the word?
A.	Are you talking about Shebuja.
Q.	I thought it was S-H-E-B-U-G-A, oh, J-A.  I'm sorry, S-H-E-B-U-J-A, Shebuja?
A.	Well, Shebuja, I would say, was the master.  I'm not talking about a sovereign, as such, because this would take us to a different level, but this would be the master or the boss, the dominant individual in that dependency relationship.
Q.	Now, Witness, you were asked a number of questions concerning whether or not slavery existed in Rwanda during the period that you referred to in your report at page 8, and I would like you to explain to the Tribunal what you meant when you used the term "slavery relations" in the context of Dr. Kandt, K-A-N-D-T.  Page 8 is in English, and page 5 in the French.
A.	Yes, it's page 5 in the French.  In this context Dr. Kandt is specifically referring to the reality.  He's describing the reality that he found when he arrived and he's describing those relations.  He notices, in particular, that there's a relationship which exists; for instance, the Hutus did not dare or didn't have the right to speak in the presence of their masters.  So the domination was to such an extent that they could not even speak in the presence of their masters and their dependency was, as described by 
Dr. Kandt, and was tantamount to oppression and deprivation from all one's rights.  So the oppression was, for instance, not being able to speak because the other was there, and then the inability to enjoy one's rights.  This was in society.
Q.	So, Professor, when you talk about "slavery relations", were you using the term "slavery" as in the context of the United States or apartheid South Africa?  What was -- just so we understand what, conceptually, you were talking about?
A.	I used this term in a specific situation because they had slavery, for instance, in the United States where the owner purchased the slave and this is also different for -- I'm sorry -- this, is also different from the apartheid system, but this is different because it's a relationship which involves extreme domination, total domination, I would say, where a Hutu could not live independently of a Tutsi who was said to be able to protect him.  In fact, he was placing himself under the protection of that gentleman whilst knowing that he was going to be protected, since he was Abagragu of one such person.
Q.	Now, Professor, you were asked about your knowledge of the ten commandments of Hutus, which was published in Kanguru(sic)?
A.	Kangura.
Q.	Kangura.  Now, can you tell the Tribunal why you did not include these ten commandments, whether it be the ten commandments of the Tutsis or the ten commandments of the Hutus in your report?
A.	I would say that that did not seem to me to be very important.  Maybe what I could have used, to be able to compare them with the ten commandments, would, rather, have been the ten commandments of the Tutsis published in the 1960s when reference was made to the ten commandments from Kangura.  I asked myself a question about which context the author had written those commandments, especially because that seemed to me interesting, taking, more or less, the same title, the ten commandments of the Hutus or the Tutsis.  It's not that I was unaware of something, but certainly the ten commandments of the Tutsis were not at my disposal for me to be able to use them and compare them.
Q.	Now, Professor, you were asked questions concerning the relevance of the disparity in educational opportunities that you showed in a table that was dated 1956.  And can you share with this Tribunal why you included that data in your report at page 15 in the English and page 10 in the French?
A.	I did that because I had developed the idea of the inequality which was, amongst others, reinforced by the Europeans when they took possession of Rwanda.  I'm talking about the Germans and then the Belgians.  We know the instruments of domination used earlier, that was the cattle.  I mentioned the role of schools, which produced persons with certificates who obtained work with those diplomas or certificates.  Now the problem was to find out under what conditions the ethnic groups present had access to those instruments of exercising economic power.  I did so in order to demonstrate how the situation was at school and, consequently, how it would reflect on the workplace and how about 85 percent of the population and how 15 percent of the population had access to this new power market.  

What we realised was that there was, in fact, inequality right from primary school, but this inequality is strengthened when one goes to the level of secondary education when the majority group becomes minority and vice versa, which translates this inequality to show that the school system perpetrated this, at least in reference to this table; we were using this table to illustrate that aspect.
Q.	And what are the economic implications of this disparity in schools within the population, what is the economic impact?
A.	The economic impact is that Tutsis who already had economic power, which is the cattle, are also going to have economic power represented by finance, money; in other words, they are the ones who are first to have employment because they went to school and that's quite obvious.  I gave the example of the chiefs, and this was clear, it was 43 against one or two.  And when it came to employment, apart from the chiefdoms, Tutsis were in 80 percent levels whereas Hutus were below 20 percent, and when you look at representation at the population level you see that disparity.  So economic power is usurped, as it were, by the group which benefited most from education.
Q.	Now, Witness, you then juxtaposed a study of 1956 with a data that you showed the Tribunal that was derived from 1987 and 1988.  

Question:  What were you attempting to show with respect to statistics relating to higher education in 1987 and 1988 and what relevance did that have to 1994?
A.	What I wanted to do was that I had a double objective, a dual objective.  The first was to respond to the accusations according to which no Tutsi went to university, among other accusations.  

Then another fact, which I wanted to bring out, I wanted to bring out at the higher level, the reality of the situation and what I have, in fact, shown is the data on the table on page 27 in the French, there is a balance which is closer to the population distribution or proportions, even if we still observe disparities.  These disparities are seen, one is aware of them, but they do not pose a serious problem because there were many possibilities at that level.
Q.	Now, Witness, you were asked whether or not this disparity that is reflected in the chart at page 37 in the English and page 27 in the French, of your report, whether these figures -- whether you had any figures of 1994 and you said that there wasn't much difference. 

What is the basis of you making that statement that the figures that you showed at page 37 in English and 27 in the French, in fact, did not materially change in 1994?
A.	The first observation one needs to make, in order to respond to your question, is that the data on page 37 -- well, 27 in the French, 37 in the English, are data which were collected at the time when the quota system existed; in other words, what was referred to as regional and ethnic balance.  This policy does not offer equality because there are factors which can be controlled.  Once the student enters the system, matters change.  So this led me to say that the situation had not really changed a great deal in 1994.  But in the interim there had been a committee or a commission to review the educational system, in other words, a reform of the educational system, and the mission of that commission was to evaluate the educational system and it looked at the possibility of abandoning or setting aside the quota system and, rather, deal with merit and not other considerations. I was part of that committee or commission, and I mentioned this in my CV.  

The recommendations of this commission were implemented in 1990 and from 1990 there was no longer control by the ministry, it was only the university which admitted students on the basis of merit.  And I was at the university all that time, I was a dean, and I was a member of the committee responsible for the admission of students in my capacity as dean.  

I should also mention that the element concerning region or ethnicity no longer played a role in the admission of students to public institutions, such as the university.  So, in 1994 there were as many Tutsis who could go to university because of their merit and who could continue to study within the university.  So the situation in 1994 for Tutsis could not be worse because it was the balanced system that had been suspect, but it could not be worse than when the quota system obtained.  But we see that Tutsis are above there at 1.19, above the theoretical quota, which was referring to balance.
Q.	Now, Professor, you were asked questions concerning A. Kagamé and his work as reflected in Kaunga Kalinga.  Can you, just briefly, share with the Tribunal -- this is page 16 in the English and I'll give you the reference in the French in a minute.  And it's page 11 in the French.  Now, can you share with the Tribunal what you were attempting to show with respect to this author, Kagamé, and his publication that he made in 1940 and then later on what his position might have been?
A.	I wanted to show that over and above the factual inequality that could be seen in society, ethnic inequality, Tutsis dominating the Hutu, there was an attempt to deny Hutus their role in the construction of the country.  When I say construction of state, I mean the construction in the formation of institutions.  In Kaunga Kalinga by A. Kagamé was what was considered an attempt by him at the time, notably by affirming that there were no Hutu kings but rather what were known as petty kings; in Kinyarwanda they are referred to as Wahinza or Unuhinza, U-N-U-H-I-N-Z-A, and the problem is not those who were there in 1940 who had already been integrated into society and been baptised Unuhinza because they were not really kings of their small kingdom.  The effect was, rather, a retroactive effect which was, in fact, denied or refuted even in the past.  So what I'm trying to talk about is the attempt to change titles of institutions, titles of authorities which no longer exist, and this is a serious attempt, it is a will to erase somebody from history, from the history books.  

So Kagamé, and as to whom Nahimana made compliments because he had provided information and so on and so forth, well, that is, indeed, true, but Kagamé developed in 1972 a book which includes material up to '72.  He acknowledged that there had, in fact, been kings and that even in the Tutsis kingdom this developed as a petty kingship and, subsequently, imposed itself upon others.  Now, if you read Nahimana's book you will see, also, the critique he makes of Kaunga Kalinga, what is negative is criticised and what is positive is praised, and I think that is something which is positive.
Q.	So, is it fair to say that Kagamé, in 1940, essentially took the position that Hutus had no history worth writing?
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. HINDS:
This is an expert.  I'm asking for his opinion.
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the objection?

MS. OJEMENI:
Two, the Witness has answered my learned friend's question; and, secondly, this issue was conversed during -- ventilated two days ago when the Witness was being examined, and it looks like he's introducing a new area in this matter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  There was some discussion about this author with regard to what appears on page 16 and, of course, also we do recall the answer the witness gave arising from the cross-examination --
MS. OJEMENI:
Exactly, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- with regard to the position of this author, if we followed correctly as quoted in the Nahimana book.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The year you mentioned yesterday was 1975, those were the time frames mentioned.  But I think counsel can raise that question because it's a wrap-up question with regard to what has been discussed.
MS. OJEMENI:
My objection now is the new question he is putting to the witness, it looks like he is reopening his 
re-examination because he asked a question based upon my question and the witness has responded.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think this is a wrap-up question that can be asked of the witness.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Except, Professor Hinds, learned counsel for the Defence, can you ask the witness to be brief with the clarification to clarify and that, really, is to illustrate what has been talked about for us to understand, unless it is very necessary we don't expect new evidence at this stage.
MR. HINDS:
I won't, Your Honour, quite frankly --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know we do, but at least the witness must be - we do not want to interfere with the witness, you must bear that in mind.  He's an expert.
MR. HINDS:
I've now forgotten the question.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry for that.
MS. OJEMENI:
This is what he does to me so he knows what he's doing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, go on, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Witness, I'm going into another area.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are at least following the elements, the intervention of both parties on this aspect.
MR. HINDS:
I was going to wrap up.  I'll go to another area.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, with respect to awareness of social discontent at page 17 in the English, which is --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope you're not going page by page, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
No, no, I have notes of areas that I want to focus on, okay. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Okay, which is page 11 on the French going into page 12 and, in particular, I want you to -- you were asked particular questions concerning sources for conclusions that you reached or that was cited in that portion of your report and, in particular, you were asked to give sources for this sentence, which was just predicate to the quotation.  And I read:  "Faced with the demand from Hutu leaders to the King Rudahigwa for more social justice for all the children of the Gahanga, the Tutsi class adopted a hard line, and a group of Court loyalists gave the following response:" I'm not going to read that response, I'm just asking you, can you give us the references that you used with respect to this particular part of your report?
A.	This part of the report comes from the interethnic relation -- the interethnic relations on this specific issue.
Q.	Now, you were asked whether you had undertaken any independent research to verify Nyetara's assertions with respect to marriages of Tutsi men to Hutu women.  That is at page 22 in the English and it starts at page 15 in the French and goes over to the top of page 16, the quotation of a 
T. Nyetara.  And the question I'm asking you, Professor, is did you find it necessary to conduct any secondary research, looking up government statistics and so on of marriages with respect to verifying Nyetara's assertions, as reflected in the last sentence of your quotation there?
A.	No, I did not find it necessary because in the context that he's making reference to there was no ideological institutionalised obstacle to interethnic marriages, as was the case in the old system where there were obstacles and, to go over, there was a complicated matter, wherein this situation it has been simplified, whereas sometimes marriages are without the knowledge of parents.  So there was no theoretical kind of obstacle to that.
Q.	Now, looking at Nyetara's other assertions that he made, did you form an opinion with respect to each and every assertion that is reflected there on page 22, as to whether or not there were any contrary facts within your knowledge base?
A.	I examined not only this passage, because I examined his entire document, the information he gives, there is the situation, there is a historical aspect, the conditions that prevailed, and I formed an idea.  The idea is that in his assertions he is close to the truth in his assertions, his analysis is close to the truth and what he says, very often, is relevant.
Q.	Now, with respect to the assertion that prior to July 5, when President Habyarimana took power, the question of the role of Tutsis in the post of director-general or secretary general of any ministry, was that a -- what Nyetara said there -- were there any contrary facts that you knew of that contradict Nyetara?
A.	Let me say that the first republic, before 1973, was marked by unconflicting crisis, but after 1973 we saw the entry of Tutsis into government and occupied high positions in the civil service.  So these are facts that could be verified if you look at the list of civil servants as of the time.  These were people who were known.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Witness, you were sharing with the Tribunal the effects of, or the impact of, politically-motivated murders, as you call them, that were targeting political figures by the RPF, and you attempted to tell the Tribunal some details concerning the statement of Ruterema (sic) -- Rutaremara, Rutaremara, that is his December 1993 statement.  What were you attempting to share with the Tribunal?  You indicated a source of the statement was Radio Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is on page --
MR. HINDS:
This is on page 31, on the top in the English, and page 22 in the French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe counsel can spell Rutaremara, it doesn't come out easily.
MR. HINDS:
It's Rutaremara, R-U-T-A as in apple R-E-M-A as in apple, R-A as in apple. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Do you have my question, Witness?
A.	Can you repeat the question, so many things happened in the interim.
Q.	Yeah, Witness, you, during cross-examination, were discussing the whole area of what you were talking about, politically-motivated murders, then you were talking about declarations made by leading politicians which often stirred up tension and hatred and in that regard you were talking about a statement made on December 1993 by T. Ruta -- by an individual by the name of T. Rutaremara and you weren't able to explain that during your cross, and I'd just like you to share with the Tribunal what you were attempting to illustrate.
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.  My question in respect of this was just on source.  I only asked the source.
MR. HINDS:
She asked the Witness concerning this particular area and I think he should be able, briefly, to share with the Tribunal what he was attempting to illustrate there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question was about source, if a source he gave.  I don't think you can go back to an illustration of the paragraph which was not an issue raised in cross-examination, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
So am I to assume that she accepts what is written as fact?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, she asked for a source, that's all.  Go on to the next question, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	You were talking about an embargo.  You recall discussing the concept of embargo and what you meant by that, an embargo, which impacted on the ability of the Rwandan army to function after the Arusha Accords?  Can you explain what you meant by that, the embargo, and that is at page 24 on the French.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, is this on a new issue again?  I did mention embargo and he also explained why, I mean the particular embargo he was referring to.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the Prosecutor cannot raise --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I think the embargo was raised and the witness explained.  If you have anything to follow up.
MR. HINDS:
But I have a right, if she raises it, to, in fact, in my opinion rehabilitate my witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go ahead, please.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you.

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, you were asked questions about the embargo which impacted on the ability of the Rwandan army to function.  I'm asking you to explain what you meant by that in the context of the Arusha Accords?
A.	Yes, when I used the word "embargo" it's not in the legal sense of the word, at least not as it was understood after April 1994.  What I meant was that according to the -- within the terms of the Arusha Accords the belligerent parties should not arm themselves and, consequently, the UNAMIR closely monitored the Rwandan Armed Forces.  The Rwandan Armed Forces were under this embargo and, therefore, could not rearm themselves; whereas the RPF -- and here I will cite James Gasana and I also quote Melvern -- the arms traffic continued on the border between Uganda and Rwanda.  So there was no control, UNAMIR could not control that side; whereas in Kigali it was easier, the Rwandan Armed Forces were within camps and could, therefore, not rearm themselves.  

What I want to emphasise is in the view of the population or the popular view was that there was an inequality in the treatment of the two parties; one was closely monitored, whereas the other one was in an area that was not controlled and which was porous to the infiltration of weapons, and people were aware of this.
Q.	Moving to the role of the media, at page 33 in the English, and 24 in the French, Professor, you talked about clandestine publications, that is publications that were done overseas, and in that context you mentioned Alexandra Kaminye, among others.  Now, what was the role of those publications, with respect to their impact on interethnic relations in Rwanda?
A.	On account of the themes that these newspapers focused on, on account of their emphasis, their content of those media, they mobilised a portion of the Rwandan population, particularly those in the diaspora, but when I say that the tone, the content, and the issues that were dealt with and the positions taken in relation to those topics, these were sensible topics and positioned in relation to a sensitive topic; as the revolution of 1959, the republican government; or the monarchy; these were very -- topics which were very sensitive to Rwandans at the time and even today.  So their role was to sensitise a section of the public opinion, but also be able to cover or sensitise international opinion.  I believe that was the objective, that is, that was to organise, to reorganise themselves.  I have -- I can't remember, there was another aspect to your question.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	No.  You have answered the question.  Now, in the context of describing the role of the media, you cited, as part of your sources, C Braeckman, which is in your annex form.  First of all, could you confirm for me that the source of C. Braeckman is in annex 4, unless I may be --
A.	Yes, the passage we are referring to is in annex 4.
(Pages 66 to 76 by R. Lear)


	1630H
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not by Braeckman
MR. HINDS:
Braeckman, B-R-A-E-C-K-M-A-N.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I thought it is the source that makes reference to Braeckman. 
MR. HINDS:
Well, I am putting him to annex 4 because I want to clarify that particular issue.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, if I may assist the Court, the witness has since said that this particular passage is in another source.
MR. HINDS:
I want to clarify that point so that we are clear on what the source is.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that is important.  Can you --
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, annex 4, I would like to -- is the reference to Braeckman, was that contained in annex 4?
A.	Yes, it is in annex 4.
Q.	In the French and on page 44, in the English; is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of the report?
MR. HINDS:
Of 44 of his report in the English and 32 in the French of his report, there is the reference to Braeckman at page 287.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is true.
BY MR. HINDS: 
Q.	Now, what is annex 4?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, after this question, we will take a break for 15 minutes.  I don't know whether you can make it shorter.
MR. HINDS:
Sure, I am going --
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, can you for the record, tell the Tribunal the primary source that you used which is annex 4, what is it? 
A.	Annex 4 has a long title.  The title is "List of members of RPF-Inkotanyi, RPF-Inkotanyi"  Inkotanyi is I-N-K-O-T-A-N-Y-I, and then "slash APR, Rwandan Patriotic Army, suspected of having premeditated and committed crimes against humanity who -- which are within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)".
Q.	This document, who is the author of this document?
A.	This document was prepared by the magazine, "VZWSOS Rwanda-Burundi".
Q.	And is it within that particular document that there is reference with respect to Braeckman, 
	C. Braeckman?
A.	Yes, let me take a look at the reference.
Q.	Look at the page 144996, or 14499bis which is handwritten on the right-hand column.  Only three pages from the cover.  Do you see it?
A.	Yes; 96, yeah.
Q.	Count three pages from the front page of the document, the first page being the cover page, the second and then the third.  There you go; you see it?
A.	Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that's the reference to Braeckman. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can find -- see it.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Does that confirm the reference to Braeckman, and Braeckman is contained within this particular document?
A.	Specifically in this document, that is where I got the passage where I quoted Braeckman.  The book is "Rwandan History of Genocide", published 1994.
Q.	Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will take a break now, learned counsels.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When we come back, we will have about -- I don't know how far you will be able to go, Counsel? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel's microphone.
MR. HINDS:
I am planning to finish. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that would very good.  That will be very good.  So we will come at five to -- five to five.
MR. HINDS: 
But I am planning to finish at 5:30 and that is 5:00.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, 5:30 is okay just for time frame when we come back.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have about ten -- yeah, we come back at five to five, you should be able to finish at 5:30, that is what you said.
MR. HINDS:
That's what are my plans. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  All right then, we adjourn.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned.
	(Court recessed from 1705 to 1717H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Professor Hinds, could you please continue your re-examination of the witness.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Professor Bangamwabo, I am going to put a series of questions to you and I want you to look at me as you answering them because I intend to finish my examination with you in 30 minutes.   And I know you are happy -- you will be happy to leave here today.  So watch me, I will ask you a question, and you try to answer it as briefly as possible and as concisely as possible and we'll move to the next question.  Okay?  

Witness, I would like to ask you why you concluded that Radio Muhabura was a tool of the RPF?  If you want use a reference, it's at page 40, and in the French it is page 29.  Sorry.
A.	According to statements, here we talk about Voice of America, Radio France International, and so on, Muhabura gave that reference to the RPF, and ideologically speaking, it is -- it reported facts and ideology but also the activities of the RPF on the ground.  So it was that radio which identified itself as the radio of the RPF.
Q.	Now, Professor, I direct you to page 44, with respect to a conclusion you reached that (a), Des Forges represented dishonest reporting.  Why did you reach that conclusion?  That is page 44 in the English and page 32 in the French.
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.  My question on this particular issue was whether he read the book and whether he had amended -- I did not go further.  So I asked the question based on the conclusion reached. 
MR. HINDS:
The purpose of her asking a question about his conclusions was to suggest that he had no basis of, in fact, reaching the conclusion that he reached.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think the witness can answer that question.
THE WITNESS: 
In referring to that document, I wasn't dealing with the content, I was dealing with the methodology, the approach, when it looks at the general principles, especially by, as done by one Karera.  The methodology as it is presented, the report is biased because there are facts which in principle are not discussed.  Whereas it covers an area which belongs to the Rwandan territory, and the report is on the Rwandan situation.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did you arrive at the same conclusion concerning Linda Melvern's report concerning the maps of genocide sites?
A.	It's in fact the same conclusion, especially because for Linda Melvern it's a book which I read in-depth, and even the map showing the sites, in one part you see that there is no marking and on the other side you see sites which are indicated, and this unfortunately covers the same zone or area which is ignored by Des Forges.
Q.	Now, Witness, you made a statement that the country was grappling with armed conflict on April  6, 1994.  What were the belligerents, as they were, doing as you see it at that time or prior to that time, that characterised it as an armed conflict, notwithstanding, the Arusha Accords?
A.	What made me say that, is that, in principle, for an agreement to operate, there must be goodwill between the signatories of that accord; there must be an understanding.  But now, what we saw, is that the day after the signing of the accord, there was total disarray amongst the political parties.  Militarily speaking, one had to disarm; that's yes, that's true.  But I have cited Melvern, I cited Gisana amongst others, but it was realised that there was a movement of weapons which continued and possibly even movement of troops by one of the parties or the other.  And this is for us to see that what was being prepared was, in fact, nothing but war.  Politically speaking, we also saw a very dramatic and serious deterioration in the country, political deterioration.  All of this just proved or gave the impression, and that's my feeling, that the conflict in reality had not been done away with, as I have already said.
Q.	Now, Witness, what were the inescapable conclusions that you arrived at from Gerins eye-witness testimony at page 60 of the English, in terms of your report -- and let me find it in the French, that is in the section dealing with the armed conflict, its impact on the implications of events of 1994?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You are trying to locate the French text?  It's on page 40.

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	It is on page 44, isn't it?  I think it's page 44 in the French and page 60 in the English.  Are you with me?
A.	Yes, yes.
Q.	The question I am asking was:  What were the inescapable conclusions that you arrived at from reading Gerins eye-witness testimony, as reflected in your report?
A.	When I read this testimony and I compared it to others, my conclusion was that the massacres of civilians, be they Tutsi or Hutu, were not one-sided as is generally claimed, but it's certain that there were eye-witnesses who saw with their own eyes RPF troops massacre civilian populations.  In the two cases, that is what happened, because it is not mentioned that there was a fight between the RPF and the government forces, but it's because the RPF was the only force in place at that particular moment.
Q.	Assuming for a movement that Gerins was not the owner to the ranch but a manager of the ranch and the ranch was owned by President Habyarimana as proposed by the Prosecutor, does that - would that fact change the opinion or the conclusion that you reached?
A.	That wouldn't change my point of view because what Gerins said, if it came out that it was true, after all, there was no member of his family, this was a European who is said to have a Latin American wife.  So there is no link with forces him to support him to the extent of distorting facts.  What we know is that he saw things and he was able to report them as he saw them.
Q.	Now, Professor, concerning the report that you referred to in appendix 4, and as you spelt out some details at page 63, concerning the 200,000 people allegedly who had been killed in six weeks reported by the human rights committee, what was the identity of these people, were they refugees or who?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The alleged victims?
MR. HINDS:
The alleged victims, the 200,000 people allegedly killed in six weeks.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I thought the witness has said he didn't know.  That was his response.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I don't know if we are in the same -- the witness said he did not know with respect to ethnicity.  The is not the question that I am asking him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  You can answer that question, if they were -- whether they were refugees or --
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, refugees.  That's the question.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.
THE WITNESS: 
No.  It is said here that these were people who were fleeing the country.  They were people within Rwanda who were fleeing the country.  They were in fact fleeing from the combat zone.  So in that case, obviously, you will agree that they are civilians and not soldiers, and it's the UNHRC which is talking about the fact that there was deliberate shooting and therefore non-accidental on these people who are fleeing, people who were fleeing the country.  And these also were villagers who are gathered together and they were chopped up by machetes.  They were attacked and these were people who were fleeing.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Witness, I draw your attention to what, in your report, which is reflected at page 66 and 67, which is Linda Melvern's -- which was a reference at 67, 66 starting with A, B, C, D, E and F, and you indicated that this --
MS. OJEMENI:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
I indicated, I made reference to particular paragraphs; I did not go A, B, C.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Can you first of all spell out -- is it the French text, the Judges are trying to -- 
MR. HINDS:
Yes, it's at page --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Forty-nine?
MR. HINDS:
It's at page 49.  But it's really 48 and 49.  I am asking the witness, with respect to the Prosecutor raising questions about C and F, and he said the references were read from A to F, and I am asking him what he was attempting to show by this illustration.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, again, my question was on sources and date.
MR. HINDS:
The inference, obviously, is to raise questions about the credibility of what this witness is trying to say.  I am not going getting into anything fresh.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think what the witness has said is on record, and if the question was source that would be parameters within which it can be raised.
MR. HINDS:
I am asking witness, what was he attempting to show in this particular section.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it was stated in the section.
MR. HINDS:
No, he did not.  He was not able to do so.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In -- anyway, it doesn't arise from cross-examination.
MR. HINDS:
The issue was whether the FAR high command offered this collaboration to stop the massacres which was rejected by General Dallaire.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That was not raised.  He wanted source.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Witness, Professor, do you agree with Gasana's estimation of millions of Rwandans lost their lives during the conflict, at page 68 in the English and page 50 in the French, and if so, why do you agree?
A.	I agree with her on the number of victims, but as for the exact figures, 3,150,00, but I am not sure because to include data provided by the ministry of social integration, I believe it was involving refugees and their being integrated into society. I don't thing the figure would be 2,100,000.  At the end of 1994, the Rwandan ministry for rehabilitation and social integration spoke of 2.1 million, but Gasana goes up to 3.1 million.  So, I don't have any figures beyond the 2 million, and I am saying that the figure is a bit high.  The correct, the exact figure, because here we were dealing with estimates, it would be surprising that the figure would be above the figure given by the government, especially given that when the government was providing those figures, the problem of refuges in the Congo had not yet even been considered.  So my position is that the figure of 3 million cannot be considered by me as the truth, because when I compare this to the official figure given by the Rwandan government at the end of 1994, I come to be persuaded that the figure for refugees could not be above 2 million.
Q.	Witness, Professor, in the context the events of April 1994, how was the term Interahamwe used?
A.	In 1994, the initial application or use of that term had evolved, as did the socio-political situation, to the extent that the group which belonged to the MNRD Interahamwe which constituted a think-tank or a reflection group or a group of leaders -- obviously that's what it was, but in the general use, in the context of Rwanda what -- those who fought on the side of the Interahamwe used the term in Interahamwe in the specific case where there is a political bipolarisation, RPF and the anti-RPF group or pro-Habyarimana if you will, whoever belonged to the pro-Habyarimana group were considered as Interahamwe, young men and even some men in the mouths of some.  So the term Interahamwe had become manipulated and confused in such an extent that it acquired an extended meaning which was beyond its initial meaning.  But this does not mean that the initial reality intended expanded, as did the term itself.  So, there was also this situation of tension, disarray, disorganisation of youth and people who were less young who circulated and wanted to obtain some kind of power or force, and they could refer to themselves as Interahamwe without necessarily belonging to the party which initially had that group.
MR. HINDS:
That is the end of re-direct, Your Honour.  I still have six minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's quite good. Thank you very much, learned counsel.

Yes, Judge Ramaroson has some questions to the witness.
JUDGE RAMAROSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. Witness, you stated in your report that you had wanted to bring out facts which had not been mentioned, other events.  You, for instance, in your report, brought out the acts of violence perpetrated by the RPF.  What I want to you ask you, what I have noticed is that you have in your report completely disregarded -- you made a table or rather the killings of Tutsis by Hutus, and you only brought out the acts of violence or excesses committed by the RPF.  Why, for instance, did you not mention the cause-and-effect relationship?  I am talking about the events of 1994, I don't want to go beyond that, beyond the events of 1994.  Now, why did you not bring out this cause-and-effect  relationship between the killings of Hutus by Tutsis and the immediate reaction therefrom, if there was any, regarding killings perpetrated by the RPF?  We have the impression that you immediately rushed to the idea that it is only the RPF which committed these atrocities.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour, for this question.  I have partially already responded to this question by saying that I was trying to draw attention to aspects which had not been covered as much by the media.  In my report, I indicated the different events which occurred from 1994 and which gradually caught the attention of people and maintained a situation of mistrust and be it, and I said this clearly, be it the killings of civilians, and I am referring to those which are mentioned: Bugesera, Kibara and Mutura, that these are cases involving civilians on the side of the RPF.  Now, when you add all these facts together, you come to the explosive tension, explosive anger, desperation and anything else you may wish to call it which came about in 1994, when the deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents were announced.  So there is this fear which increased amongst the Hutus and the Tutsis.  There is fear, there is uncertainty, survival instinct, a whole series of feelings of this nature which arise and from the -- this is - this can be seen from the reaction of people, be they in a militarised zone or amongst the people who had found refuge in government areas in order to find peace.  

So, I developed my report in such a manner that I show that before the 6th of April, the situation was such that anything could happen, anything could have happened in that context.  I am not setting aside or disregarding the killings of Tutsis, I am not disregarding the killings of the Hutus, but my interest was that this needed to be considered, and these are facts which the media often do not refer to.
JUDGE RAMAROSON: 
I am not going to insist that, you know, that in your report you say nothing about the killings -- the killings of Tutsis, you say nothing, there is nothing there.
THE WITNESS: 
When I speak of civilians within the country, I have specified that these were Hutus and Tutsis.  In the areas controlled by the RPF, I did not mention that these were Hutus each time, but I recognised  that there were Hutus who died on that site.  
JUDGE RAMAROSON: 
In your report, you say that the official version was that there was the genocide of Tutsis or the genocide involving Tutsis and the killings of moderate Hutus, but that's only the official version, but the reality of the fact is something else -- you are saying that the reality was something else, and it's practically everywhere that the RPF committed massacres.  Don't go into details, I just want to know what is your opinion because at a given point in time you say, how could the Rwandan people react in the face of an RPF force who was perpetrator of this misery and this -- how could the RPF not continue to follow its nature?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I am sorry the quotation is being read rather fast and I don't have a reference. 
THE WITNESS: 
My reaction is that the situation is rather more rather complex than a mere presentation of a government which is preparing a genocide and then a RPF force which is there and not doing anything.  So when I am referring to this aspect involving millions of displaced persons living in conditions that I have referred to, the idea is that if the international community had been able to help these people and possibly ensure that the situation does not deteriorate, that the war does not continue, the RPF would have been able to have a sign, as if there is someone who is following the situation, and therefore the situation would not have degraded to that extent and there would not have been new displaced persons, new movement of civilian populations moving from left to right in search of peace.
JUDGE RAMAROSON: 
You spoke of Alison Des Forges by saying that her report is pure ascocry (phonetic) -- I don't have that word, immediately, and this is underlined in the official version, but you are not very specific?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, that is true.  I did say that there were many reports on the Rwandan genocide on the violations of human rights in Rwanda which -- and I gave examples a moment ago, they leaned to one side.  I said that here it is, you have something that you already know, and this is something which has already been analysed and presented in many reports, this is another aspect which you need to consider and involve with the Rwandan situation.
JUDGE RAMAROSON: 
I have concluded, Mr. President.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Judge.  

Judge Maqutu?
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have a few questions.  The first ones concerns your curriculum vitae, the others your methodology, and finally your approach, certain matters you highlight.  First, I was looking at your curriculum vitae and I find that if you look at page 2, "conferences and seminars," you have already lectured on conflict generation, prevention in Rwanda, which is an aspect of this topic.  You have also -- that is was on the -- in September 1991, and you've also lectured on this subject, which is also part of your report, "Multi-partyism, democracy and the role of the media" in July 1992.  And, furthermore, if you look at the same page '90 to 1993, Dean of the Faculty of Art, you see this, that is in your curriculum vitae.
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
And you have also laid down the fact that, with all modesty of course, that have a magna cum laude, that is in your MA in linguistics.  These are facts from -- that are true; isn't it?
THE WITNESS:
It was not for the masters, it was for the doctorate, and in French, it's what is known as (French not interpreted).  I do not know whether that is considered or is it equivalent to magna cum laude, which is the term you have used.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
In other words, you got a magna cum laude or a distinction in your doctorate.  Is that what I must conclude from your curriculum vitae and your brief summary of your curriculum vitae and the quality of the person you are?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, the doctorate mentioned I had was magna cum laude, and I mentioned that a moment ago, and that is what mark I received for my doctorate.  That is what you ought to bear in mind.
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
In short, I will conclude for purposes of my questions, that you have a first-class mind, you have thought about this topic, you have lectured on aspects of it and, therefore, for you to say that you are an expect of some kind is not to mislead, you have basis for that.  Would you agree with me?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I agree with you.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Now, we have agreed that you have a capacity to be an expert and you have actually dealt with that topic before.  Now, I will start my questions now:  your methodology, your methodology, if I am not mistaken is that of a participatory researcher because you were living in Rwandan and you have your own knowledge and your personal experiences plus the references you made to other people or authorities, past and present.  Is that is correct?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
So your method is what in research we call in our part of the world, what we call in our part of the world an anthropological method.  So, I will take it that in linguistics, history and context, social linguistics are important.  Correct?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, they are important.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Yes, now there are a few things that now I will go into, namely, that you are, of course, you are not just an ordinary expert who doesn't have the capacity to evaluate the information the gets.  Will I be correct, because you lived in Rwanda you have some in-depth knowledge of your own, quite apart from your research?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I agree with you.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Thank you.  Now there are a few questions that will follow that.  The first one is about what you said about these people who are called -- who have moved up the social ladder, the Kwihutura.  Would I be correct to say the Habyarimanas of the same family as President Habyarimana who went to Butare such as -- such us the prefect of Butare, were in fact the Icyihure that they came from same stock as the Habyarimanas who remained Hutu in the north, but they moved up the social scale and became Tutsi?
THE WITNESS: 
No, there is an error there.  There is an error because the way in which Rwandans give names to their children is not what is found in western tradition or in some countries, I think, I have seen South Africa, I have seen Kenya.
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
If that is the case, that's enough for me.  I will just tell you that I got that from one of the witnesses that gave evidence in the Tribunal, who gave the impression that President Habyarimana or that family was never quite accepted because it had Icyihure among them, although it was family Tutsi.  Now, I am just giving you that so that you should not be surprised where I got this, being known to a Rwandan source.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Now I come to the real issue.  In your -- in re-examination, you said, you formed --  the people that you concluded, such as -- you quoted in full such as Nyakatera and others, quoted from external, extensively, are people who are nearer the truth, but those who are after the point like Des Forges you said in no uncertain way, terms; is that is correct?
THE WITNESS: 
No, that's not quite it.  What I said was that these people whom I mentioned, I mentioned the aspects upon which or by which they draw attention; in other words, they are balanced, they see things on both sides.  Gasana is one who deals generally with the genesis of the parties and he does this without any bias.  He speaks of both sides.  But when -- 
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
But these are the most balanced in your view so that they are nearer the truth for that reasons.  That's all I wanted know.
THE WITNESS: 
It's not exactly in those words.  I am taking from these people what generally others do not consider or do not wish to mention.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Yes.  Thank you for that because now it brings me to the major problem that you saw, which Judge Ramaroson raised and which Judge Sekule also raised.  It seems that your report is half of what you could have said because you assumed that the Court is also is already aware of this mass of information from the media and other cases.  So you didn't bother about the Tutsi side of the story because it has been -- it was well ventilated elsewhere in your opinion; is that correct?
THE WITNESS:   
In my opinion, taking into account the media that we hear on the Rwandan situation, there is one aspect which is quite well developed and very well known, and there is another side which is not as well not known, and this report doesn't even mention that and that is what I wanted really to do.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
This is really this, you assumed that what is generally known to you and others who are knowledgeable and in the media and probably in other cases in the Tribunal, was something that we already know in this Chamber and you shouldn't bother about that because you wanted to give the other story which is kept away from us.  That's all I wanted to know.  Is that the premise on which your report is written?
THE WITNESS: 
I have not even tried to hide it, but I said that I wanted to bring out an element of balance, something which balances the situation and adjusts all the elements involved, because once again I have said this because I know for instance the trial --
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
I understand all that.  In other words, you didn't know that this Court is not entitled to go outside the record of what it has before it.  That's all I ask. That all it matters.  You are a non-lawyer, therefore, you didn't know this aspect.
THE WITNESS: 
No, I cannot go to the legal level.  I cannot speak of issues in that kind of term.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
That's why I am saying, simply, you didn't know that when matters are presented before us, assumptions should not be made that we already know something about Rwanda.  We go by what we are given in this Court.  As a non-lawyer, you didn't know this.  That's all I wanted to confirm so that we could read your report with greater sympathy.
THE WITNESS: 
No, I agree totally with you.  I take note of what you said.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Now, I come to the key issue.  There is one thing that a bit disturbed me.  Counsel for the Prosecution asked about the figures that you have been quoting which you have been quoting that the Tutsi were the privileged group, this first table of the '50s or something and this of '87 and '88 which you quoted.  You remember these tables, isn't it?  Now, counsel asked specifically about 1994, you said you had no data.  You remember that?
THE WITNESS: 
I said that I didn't have data on 1994, but I remembered, I said I remember the context in which the events developed.
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
But, sir, you had no right to do that, to deny the Prosecution the admission --  the information, because you in -- from 1992 to 1994, if you look at page 3 of your curriculum vitae.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page?
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Page 3, 7, scientific commission, the third one, this is "member of standing, standing consultative committee to project RUWA86 to 88 charged with the aim and  task of reforming higher education, teaching and research in Rwanda".  Now, all I am saying is, I was a bit disturbed when being a person who in fact participated in the reform of higher education, when you were asked by the Prosecutor, you said, "No, I have no data."  When in fact, one, you were dean from 1990; two, you served on a continuing basis in 1992 to 1994.  You see what I mean.  But when counsel for the Defence asked you, you showed that you, in fact, you do a great deal, from 1990 the quota system was even phased out. 

Now, I find this very disturbing this denial of information or this stinginess of information when asked by the Prosecution.  Could you comment on this?
THE WITNESS:   
Yes, I would answer by saying that I will be begin with my membership in the commission on the reform of higher education from 1992 to 1994.  That commission, that commission was still reflecting on the project of the reform of higher education which had not yet started.  This was a commission set up by UNESCO, UNDP and the commission had not yet filed any report.  It was a consultative commission which was independent from the university.  So we did not have access to the lists of students, the situation of students in higher -- institutions of higher learning.
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
But, you see, you were dean of the faculty of arts.  So what you say is a bit puzzling.  You didn't have to go to and collect information.  You were dean on the faculty of arts in 1990.  This is my little problem about this aspect.
THE WITNESS: 
What is the question which I need to respond to? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Microphone to the Judge, please.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
You saw the problem you gave me was that when you were asked by counsel for the Prosecution, you refused with this information.  You said you knew nothing and there was no data, but as dean of a faculty, you see, you couldn't be so ignorant.
THE WITNESS: 
I talked about the context, but I could not provide the figures -- that is what I said -- because I didn't have them in my possession.  I didn't have data from 1994, but, otherwise, as a person who lived during those times, I gave my opinion regarding the situation as it had developed, especially with the university which had obtained the right to recruit its own students; otherwise, I was not hiding any data because I didn't have the data.  The Tribunal can go and look for this and it will see that I am going along in the same direction.

JUDGE MAQUTU:
I had two final questions.  One, the letter you referred to on page 27 which was written in a war situation -- at 27 of the report in English, the translation.  It was referred to -- it was massacres of civilians following 8th February 1997 (sic) attack.  You see, you referred to the letter written by the Ruhengeri préfectural committee, right, which is -- which is where you lived.  And in French I am saying it's probably --
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Page 20.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Page 20 -- which is where you lived.  Her personal knowledge.  And one of the things that is made up by your report is that in war, lies and propaganda take precedence.  Now, I see that there is reference to chemical weapons, gouging of eyes, disembowelment of children, et cetera, et cetera, which you have quoted with such glee, and you use that letter as an authority.  Now, my difficulty is that you are researcher and you have shown in the war how propaganda soon seizes the combatants.  I find a little difficulty there.  

The other difficulty I have is that you  have specifically quoted passages that show the United States was one of the decision-makers in the -- that is, the United States of America, was, along with the RPF, responsible for the death of President Habyarimana.  This is what comes from your report; you see.  And because now this has a status, a higher status because it has been accepted here, it will be quoted all over the world by people as something very credible.  So I just wanted you to comment on the mischief, unless you have definite evidence that the United States was, in fact, involved in the death of Habyarimana, because you quoted it; it appears in this report which will perused like you have been perusing others. That is my difficulty.  I just want a short comment on this, the letter, which is clearly propaganda, speaking about chemical weapons; the fact that the United States of America, along with the RPF, were responsible for the death Habyarimana.  These are the little section where I would request you to make some comments, short comment if you can.
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I think that for the first point regarding the victims, that is in information which is contained in my report; that is, annex 4.  So that is something that can be traced.  The fact that there were victims -- 
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
I am saying the quality.  Have you evaluated it as a researcher before you put it in a report of your standing?  That is really the issue.
THE WITNESS: 
I processed them, I evaluated them, and put them in the appropriate context.  I gave the case of information coming from a place where there were victims; the victims were mentioned by name.  There were figures given and those victims were seen -- were seen by those persons who were there, who were present.  It was in Ruhengeri town.  So, probably, when we are talking about chemical weapons, maybe that is taking it a bit far, but probably they had reason to do so.  There was need for investigations to prove or to disprove that.  But, otherwise, people who had their eyes gouged out, women who were disembowelled, that led to a very difficult situation, a very incredible situation.  So these are facts.  Things that we saw in 1994 where things that had started existing well before. 

Now, on the second point --
JUDGE MAQUTU: 
If you saw this, why is this not in your report?  That is my problem.  Then finalise with this implication from a report that the United States of America was responsible for the death of Habyarimana, which comes in your report.  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE WITNESS: 
Well, let me just take a look at the passage in question to see the exact manner in which it was written, it was drafted.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
It is page 46, which plants into people's -- the readers, the possibility that the United States could be involved.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He does mention it is a possibility in the discussion.  Can't find it in French.  Sorry, Counsel
JUDGE MAQUTU:
It's paragraph 12, just about -- towards the end of the thing on (microphone not on).
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Judge Ramaroson says page 33.  What paragraph?  Third paragraph, Carrero.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
"Karekezi and Rashidi,(phonetic) former members of the RPF".  And it seems that it was not just RPF that was behind this (microphone not on) but also a major power, the United States.  Now that is the way I wanted to make.  (Inaudible)  Oh, just to put it on record, you see - it's page?
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's page 46.
MR. HINDS:
Page 46, in the English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
First paragraph, is that so, Counsel?
MR. HINDS: 
Yes, page 46, at the top of the page.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
And in French? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
French, it's thirty --
MR. HINDS:
Page 33.
JUDGE MAQUTU:
Yes, the paragraph reads as follows, "And it seems that it was not just the RPF that was behind the death that sparked off the events of 1994, but also a major power, United States or Belgium."  And you quote, of course, Carrero.  Now, my question you have heard.  Did you consider the effect of this on a report like this, from an expert, giving evidence from such an august Tribunal?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I understand, because the issue is to determine the deaths of President Habyarimana, Habimina (phonetic) which served as the trigger, the trigger, for what we refer to as genocide, the events 1994.  

In my understanding, then there is need, if we want to understand these events extensively, the motivations, the responsibilities -- there is need to know who was the cause of the trigger of those events.  A lot of assumptions have been floated: assumptions on the Hutu extremists; assumptions pointing to the RPF.  Here, I am giving my impression. ,and particularly, I am giving some information which are beginning to come up in a number of publications or statements.  I am not asserting I am not saying that it is the RPF or the Unites States.  I am giving the information on the statements, on the research on some, of the investigation of some of journalists, or human rights activists, and I am not making, I am assuming authorship of those statements.  I am saying it with some reservations.  I did say it "would appear", "it seems".  And these are -- this is information that can be confirmed or changed by the course of events or investigations.  The United States and Belgium: investigations could confirm this or prove the contrary.  

Now, there are these investigations which are ongoing, and if the perpetrator of this attack is identified, it will make some of the discussions unnecessary.  If it is, for example, determined that it was the Hutu extremists who carried out the attack, that would facilitate certain things.  There would no longer be any ambiguity.  If it is somebody else, then that will prove some other assumptions.  But for now, we have only assumptions that point to the RPF and some powers.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Right.  I have just two quick small questions and we will come to the end of your testimony.  The first question relates to your CV, and in asking this question, I do not intend or mean to disparage, or whatever, your position:  On page 2 of the report with the regard your work experience, where it states that from October 1991 to July 1994, you specify the academic positions, or the academic work you are doing.  Do you see that, Witness, Professor: "lecturer"," senior lecturer"?
THE WITNESS:  
Is that Item 4 or 5?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Item 4.
THE WITNESS: 
Very well. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We come from different background, or academic background, but this is what is indicated.  But you have been using the pretext of professor.  Is it -- I mean, how does it come about; I mean, going by what is indicated in this CV?   I just want to know, and, as I said, this is in no way intended to indicate any doubt whatsoever, but just as a matter of clarity, as a matter for complete information.
THE WITNESS: 
In actual fact, in the Rwandan system, the last position that I occupied in my university career was charge l'ecloe; that is, lecturer in charge of a course I had not yet reached the grade of  associate professor; I would have reached that stage in six months or thereabouts.  So I am not in the habit of referring to myself as a professor.  But it so happened that in the letters that I received, that was indicated.  Maybe counsel can tell you that very often I had protested because I do not want to be pretentious.  I fully agree with you.  Maybe that appeared in some letter which came, but it was not with the intention of presenting myself as being beyond what I am really are -- what I really am.  It's an error.  Very often I am referred to as a doctor; otherwise, I had not attained professorship.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last question -- this has been very brief.  The last question is something to do with Interahamwe:  When you were asked a question on these aspects by the Prosecution, you did give a number of things in, you know, a way -- in a form of definition of Interahamwe: people who have the same objective, they are together - I'm just using the substance.  But, but you went on to say at some stage in your concluding remarks that that does not mean who attacked together. Do you recall?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I remember.
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question is, why you do say that?  If people work together for an objective, or they are together, why would they not work together in order to attack?  Why were you so emphatic in saying that, "but they do not attack together", as a concept, not with reference to a particular place or to a particular group at a particular time?  Why would you take out that possible meaning in the definition of "Interahamwe", if you go by the broad definition given?  Do you understand?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I understand; I understand.  And what I want to say in answer to your question is that they could have the same objective, they could have the same objective of attacking.  That is possible.  But what I am noting is that in terms of the meaning of the word, in terms of the content of the word, the word "Interahamwe" has nothing to do with the sense of attacking.  What we have in Kinyarwanda I think is valid in English or French.  It's that you have the same word which is written in the same manner but you have various meanings. The term "Interahamwe" derives from the verb "gutarama", which is to appear to come up.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we understand the history, but the only thing that I wanted clarification from you, why would you remove or specifically state, "but they did not attack together", if, for example, a group of people who form that kind of objective, to carry out an objection, that you define -- as you gave as one of the definitions or the identification of the people who could come under the umbrella of the term "Interahamwe"?  That is all I wanted to know, and your clarification on that.  Do you want to add, otherwise, I think we have your answer?
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I eliminated some of the meanings, but I also know that I read a long time ago, in 1994 in Zaire, when I was in the refugee camps, we used to get some newspapers in which "Interahamwe" was translated as meaning those who attacked together.  I was thinking about that, and, linguistically, the term "Interahamwe" as it is used generally, it's not even in the physical sense; it's in the abstract sense.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, Witness, this makes the end of your testimony.  We thank you.  We shall have time at a later stage to consider and review your evidence together with all the evidence that is going to be adduced in the course of this trial.  But, once again, we thank you.  We shall read your report very carefully, we shall examine your report carefully.  Nothing is decided on that report.  We shall go carefully, at a later stage, into all those issues that have been ventilated in the course of this -- your testimony and when we hear counsels on this particular aspect.  So we will examine, we will consider your evidence, and deal with all the issues that will become relevant, and we wish to state that nothing is decided on the issues that are involved in this report.
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Professor Hinds, I am sorry, we will be a bit late today, but it might help us for, you know, in scheduling our work tomorrow.  So the -

MR. HINDS:
The next witness is --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness, you can go, please.  You may take your leave.  Thank you very much.  We will deal with some housekeeping issues which may not -- do not concern you.  Can you do it quickly, Counsel, because we do not know exactly when Mr. Kajelijeli is supposed to get back to the UNDF.  I hope there is still some time.  Yes, please go on.
MR. HINDS:
Well, you called on me; I was not about to say anything.  Do you want me to say something?
MR. President: 
Yes, please do.  We have to know how we do our work tomorrow.  You wanted some time?
MR. HINDS: 
I would like four hours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Four hours, all right.
MR. HINDS:
And at the end of that time, we will see where we are.  If we are ready to proceed --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Four hours, starting from which time, 6:00? 
MR. HINDS:
Six in the morning?
MR. PRESIDENT:
What time?
MR. HINDS:
No, 9:00; four hours starting from 9:00 in the morning.  Oh, is it 9:30?  Okay.  All right.  I was under the impression that Kajelijeli would be here and I would - rather, than us going to the UNFD.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
He could be here.  Why not?
MR. HINDS:
Yes.  It doesn't make sense for us to go there.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
He could be here.  Registry, can you confirm that?
MR. KIYEYEU:
He will be here, My Lord.
MR. HINDS:
So I'm thinking from 9 o'clock here --

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. HINDS:
-- we start working with him.  And by lunch time, we could inform the Chambers where we are.  I am hoping that we can proceed to begin him with the preliminaries right after lunch, depending upon how far I get in preparation, with the understanding that we will be able to work with him on the main part of his testimony during the weekend.  If not, if there is the ban for us talking to him and so on and so forth, we will just have to make the application for the morning on Monday.  But we would like to begin him, with the preliminaries, which we think, you know, would -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The four hours should give you time to deal with the substance. 

Prosecution, what do you say to that?  Any comment?
MS. OJEMENI:
We certainly don't have any objection, starting in the afternoon.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So, okay.  Then we will start in the afternoon.  Do whatever you can, you are able to do to get organised with regard to the defence of the Accused, and, for sure, we start in the afternoon at 2:30.
MR. HINDS:
Okay, that's the plan.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  All right.  So we will adjourn these proceedings until tomorrow at 2:30.  All right, then we will adjourn these proceedings until tomorrow at 2:30 in the afternoon, when we will start -- we will come and the Defence of the Accused person will start his defence -- or testify on his behalf in his defence, at 2:30.  So, until then, these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1725H)
