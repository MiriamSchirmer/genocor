MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I'm sorry, we can't hear Mr. Fry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's all right now.  They seem to have -- no.  No, it wasn't your fault. 
MR. FRY:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 26th of January 2006, in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same on both sides.  

Before we start the day's proceedings, there's a decision that we need to deliver on the motion to subpoena directed to Defence Witness 4/18.  

Yesterday, Defence Counsel for the Accused submitted an oral application seeking an order from the Chamber to invite the Rwandan authorities to communicate a subpoena to Defence Witness 4/18 by a set date, namely, 7th February 2006.  The Prosecution left the decision with the Chamber, but expressed concerns regarding the order of appearance of the Defence witnesses.  It must be recalled that on 17th January 2006 the Defence requested, by a written application, the Chamber to issue a subpoena order regarding Witness 4/18.  At that time the Chamber considered that good reasons were adduced for the unwillingness for this witness to travel to Arusha and that his proposed evidence would be relevant to the Defence case, but the Chamber also found that the taking of a video link testimony could properly address the Defence -- the witness's concerns and would serve the interests of justice.  

As a result of that decision, the registry enquired on the matter.  The Witness and Victim Support Section informed the Chamber that Witness 4/18 was not willing to testify via video link at all.  The Chamber is therefore of the view that a subpoena order is now warranted and will serve the interests of justice.  The Chamber wishes, however, to ensure that the right of the Accused to be tried without undue delay is guaranteed and that the Defence case will be completed within the time allocated, as decided in agreement with the parties.  Due to the particular circumstances of the case, the cooperation of the national authorities for the implementation of the subpoena orders within a certain deadline is necessary.  

For the above reasons, the Chamber grants the motion and instructs the Registry to prepare a subpoena addressed to the witness, designated by the pseudonym 4/18, ordering his appearance before the Chamber as soon as possible, and no later than 9th February 2006; orders the registry to communicate the subpoena to the witness and to the national authorities of the country in which the witness resides, no later than 7th February 2006; requests, pursuant to Article 28 of the Statute of the Tribunal, the national authorities that receive the subpoena to provide any assistance that may be requested by the Registry to facilitate the attendance of the witness.  

That's the decision of the Court on this issue.  Yes.  
MR. HOOPER:
Before we move to a video link with Kigali, just two matters that perhaps I can deal with.  The first relates to Witness 3/13, who was the witness before last, who dealt with Remera, you may recall.  And in respect of him, we read out his statement, but it hasn't been exhibited yet.  I provided Mr. Issa with the statement, a clean copy, this morning, and I'd ask that that be exhibited, under seal, as Exhibit D. 203.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal. 
(Exhibit D. 203 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER:
I was in contact yesterday with WVSS, who have told me that Witness 4/4 -- Witness 4/4, one of the professional persons, has now indicated that that witness will not be willing to provide evidence by way of video link, has rejected that course.  The Chamber will recall that there is a subpoena in his case and, essentially, my request this morning is on all fours with the submission or application I made yesterday in respect of 4/18, except, instead of 4/18, it's now 4/4, but all the other factors are present, an indication to reject the subpoena and an indication now not to avail himself of the opportunity of providing evidence in an alternative and perhaps more convenient form.  

And again, as with the previous witness that you've just dealt with, the Defence request the making of -- the attaching to the subpoena of a time limit, in order not to extend the length of time of this trial in any way and to bring all the witnesses within the time limit or expected -- or, indeed, time limit, in the case.  So I don't respond -- I don't apply at length.  I repeat, in his case, every argument and every observation that was advanced in respect of 4/18, except now in respect of 4/4.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the Chamber will take a few minutes to consider your application.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can we deal with that later, perhaps, in the morning?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. HOOPER:
As far as Kigali is concerned, I understand that the link is up and running and we can proceed to that witness.  I regret to say, as far as the public who, of course, are always welcome to these trials are concerned, I'm having to go into what is called a closed session with this witness, to protect her interests and her security, which she's very concerned with.  And I know, Mr. President, you've already indicated that all her evidence can be taken in that way.  It means, of course, only certain and private ears can hear that evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Yes.  For the benefit of the waiting public, the Chamber normally hears all testimony publicly, but sometimes it is necessary, for the protection of witnesses, to conceal their identity, to go into closed sessions so that their testimony is not available for -- to the public.  The witness who is about to testify has been the beneficiary of a protection order, and the testimony of this witness will be held in closed session.  

So we are going to go into closed session now, which means that the public has to be excluded from the court during this testimony.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 33] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
