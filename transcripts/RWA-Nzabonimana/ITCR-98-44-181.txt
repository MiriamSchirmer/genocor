P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 13th of October 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

As before we start, there are just two things I need to say.  Yesterday afternoon I'd indicated that we would have something to say with regard to the Witness GFJ issue which was raised.  Unfortunately, our enquiries have not yet reached a stage where we can say anything, and we are still continuing with our enquiries in that matter.  

Secondly, this is just an announcement for the participants in The Hague.  For the completion of the -- accurate completion of our record, if anyone in The Hague is going to speak, apart from the witness, they must first identify themselves by name, as the reporters should not have to just rely on their voice recognition to indicate who is speaking.  So anyone speaking from The Hague should identify themselves by name at the commencement of their intervention.  So I think that's enough of the housekeeping issues.  

Mr. Witness G, are you ready to continue your testimony?  Can you hear us?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, your testimony will continue.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took at the commencement of your testimony.  

Yes, Mr. Rapp.  
MR. RAPP:
Thank you very much, Mr. President, Your Honours.
WITNESS G,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, yesterday when we broke for the evening we were dealing with the transportation of number 1 to Gisenyi, and you described him -- the last segment of his travel as being from Cyangugu to Gisenyi, and indicated to us that you had been with him in Cyangugu.  And the question that I began to put to you at that time is, when you were at Cyangugu, did you have any opportunity to meet any leaders of the Interahamwe other than number 1?  
A.	When we reached Cyangugu, we settled down in a hotel, and then there was the chairman of the Interahamwe in Cyangugu, one Yusuf Munyakazi.  He came to visit number 1.  
Q.	And what did Yosuf (sic) Munyakazi say on that occasion?  
A.	On that occasion, he recounted to us how the Interahamwe of Cyangugu have been asked to help the Interahamwe of Kibuye, because in Kibuye, there were many Tutsis.  So the Interahamwe -- there were many Tutsi.  So the Interahamwe of Kibuye asked for help of the Interahamwe in Cyangugu and Gisenyi.  So the Cyangugu Interahamwe went to lend a helping hand to the Interahamwe in Kibuye, and they used buses which were rented.  So they went up to there.  They carried out some killings of the Tutsis who were in Kibuye.  
Q.	Did he say specifically where in Kibuye préfecture they had gone and committed those killings?  
A.	I believe he said that it was the secteur of Bisesero.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe the witness mentioned another name, but it got garbled in the wires.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, you mentioned Bisesero, but you also mentioned a secteur.  What -- would you repeat your answer in terms of the location of these killings?  

Witness, can you hear me?  Are you there?  
MR. FRY:
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  I've just been informed that the line has broken.  So just one moment, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can wait.  Mr. Rapp, I think we will just wait a minute.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, while we wait to -- for the line to be restored, there was the issue of the videotape of the Petit Kigali nightclub yesterday.  You had indicated that you might have a ruling on that.  Obviously I'm looking to conclude the direct examination sometime this afternoon, and we don't have to play it now, but at some point, obviously, we need to decide that issue to determine whether I can play it or not.  
(Ringing interruption)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the reminder.  We're not ready at the moment, but we will (inaudible) during the course of the afternoon.  

Okay, I think we're back online now.  

Mr. Witness, can you hear?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Yes, I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Rapp.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	And, Witness, I had just asked you to repeat the geographical location.  You mentioned Bisesero and you mentioned a secteur.  I just want to make sure we have that correctly.  The interpreter thought one place name had been garbled in transmission.  
A.	The Kibuye area is the Bisesero area.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  Now, before we go into closed session, I wanted to just deal with some detail on some matters that I think we can deal with in open session and, particularly, regarding the individual Accused in these -- in this trial.  

Witness, during the course of the questioning, I think on the first day, we talked about the violence that occurred in May 1992, and you described this as part of the violence between the political parties at the time, that occurred between the militias or the youth wings of the political parties.  I'd ask you, during that violence, was anyone killed?  
A.	In all this violence, there were, indeed, victims.  There were people who were wounded and even people who were killed.  The office of the prosecutor in the area in Kigali was making investigations about this.  
Q.	And do you know if there were reports that Interahamwe had killed individuals in particular situations?  
A.	You know, each time that there were confrontation between the youths of the various parties, even if there were killings or people were wounded, each party would do its best to protect itself.  In other words, they would disclaim guilt.  They would blame the other party.  And it was up to the office of the prosecutor to determine who was guilty in terms of provoking the confrontation.  
Q.	Well, just because I'm not sure you answered the question here, were there situations where, from your knowledge, Interahamwe had -- had killed other persons during the course of this -- this violence that occurred in 1992?  
A.	Yes, I can say that there were killings of people in these préfectures.  People were killed, and it was reported that it was the Interahamwe who had perpetrated those killings.  
Q.	Were any Interahamwe punished, convicted of any offences regarding these killings?  
A.	As far as I know, each time the prosecutor or the gendarmerie intercepted the actions of the Interahamwe, they would be put in prison, but one or two days later, they would be released.  
Q.	Well, in your answer to the question before the last one, you mentioned that the parties protected their own.  What did the leaders of the MRND political party do to protect their own, specifically any young persons who -- any Interahamwe who may have been charged?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to interpose an objection here on two grounds.  And I've been trying frantically to look through the indictment, and I may be in error, so I'll be a little more cautious than I have been, but I don't believe that this allegation, that the Accused or any members of a joint criminal enterprise protected Interahamwe from prosecution in 1992, is contained in the indictment.  And I believe that that's a material fact.  It should be in the indictment.  

Secondly -- and, again, I say this with some trepidation because I've been proven to be wrong, but I don't know of anything in this witness's previous statements that indicate that this would be a subject of his testimony.  And so I object on that grounds as well.  Thank you.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honours, first of all, the documents that we presented here in the case include letters that make reference to these interventions.  So the Defence is on notice of it.  

Secondly, I believe that in this witness's prior testimony, he has talked about the involvement of particular individuals, their role in contacting officials in order to obtain the release of accused Interahamwe members.  And we're looking right now at the specific allegations in the pre-trial brief, but we would submit that this is general background information about -- about the relationship between the Interahamwe and -- and the party leadership and is relevant background.  It's not alleged that these interventions constituted crimes in and of themselves but just form part of the context here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, is it your contention that this is not in the indictment?  
MR. RAPP:
That's correct, it is not in the indictment, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, thank you.  

Mr. Rapp, your answer is concerning us.  We had thought that this issue had been pleaded, and we'd hoped -- we expect you'd have been able to point us to where it was pleaded, but you have said it's not in the pleadings.  
MR. RAPP:
That is correct, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not in the pleadings. 
MR. RAPP:
It's not in the pleadings in the particular case.  I believe that it is in the statements of this particular witness because he -- I can recall with all of the volumes of it, he described the particular individuals from the different political parties that played the role of calling in to get people released.  And I recall that in -- in his declarations, but it's, to my knowledge, not in the -- in the pleadings.  And, of course, our position is, it wouldn't need to be in the pleadings.  But my colleagues have not found a specific reference to it in the pre-trial brief, nor in the declaration of the witness, the abstract of his statement that we submit as part of the pre-trial brief.  So let me withdraw the question under the circumstances.  

It may have been mentioned in the opening statement, but let's -- let's go on to -- to another subject, with the Court's permission.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, this is the question:  We were just talking about the question of violence between the -- between the youth groups of the various political parties, but during the period of '92, '93 -- well, '91, '92, '93, and up to 6 April 1994, had there been killings of Tutsis in Rwanda on -- on the scale of hundreds of Tutsis being killed?  
A.	From 1992 to 1994, there were many killings of Tutsis.  Killings took place in Gisenyi and Ruhengeri and even Kibuye, and in the Bugesera region.  
Q.	And do you know if anyone was punished, in the sense of being convicted, for any of these killings?  
A.	To my knowledge, no.  
Q.	Witness, during the course of your earlier testimony, you talked about the distribution -- well, of the 800 arms that came from the ministry of defence through Nzirorera, and 400 of those arms being -- excuse me, I misspoke -- through Mr. Ngirumpatse, these arms being distributed in late 1993, 400 of them then going to the Interahamwe in the secteurs of Kigali.  Do you know if there was distribution of arms to civilians in Rwanda before the occasion of that particular distribution?  
A.	Yes, there was another distribution of weapons before that.  The weapons were distributed by the ministry of the defence to the people who had left their areas because of RPF attacks.  
Q.	And how many weapons were -- well, first of all, how do you know about that?  
A.	I got that information from a colonel who worked at the ministry of defence.  His name is Laurent Rutayisire.  He was, I believe, in charge of documentation and internal security in Rwanda.  He told me that Colonel Bagosora had distributed 5,000 weapons in the northern préfectures and that those weapons were to be used for their personal protection because the RPF often attacked the northern region of the country.  
Q.	Witness, just two more questions before we -- before I ask the Chamber to go into closed session.  The first is, you've told us about this -- this mission that you were given around the 10th of April by those individuals at the Hôtel des diplomates to -- to ask that the killings stop in Kigali in certain secteurs and that the bodies be removed.  Were you ever given any other mission thereafter, any other request, by government or political or military leaders to -- to stop the killings?  
A.	To my knowledge, no.  
Q.	Now, regarding the -- the three individuals that are accused in this case -- Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Nzirorera, and Mr. Karemera, Édouard -- from your observation and knowledge, in the period of April, May, June 1994, did they have the power to stop the killings of Tutsis in Rwanda?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to that question on two grounds -- and if the witness can take off his headphones before I state those.  Okay.  Thank you.  

The first ground is that it calls for speculation on behalf -- on the part of the witness, and secondly, that it's a question that is for the Trial Chamber to answer based on concrete facts.  And it's an ultimate issue in the case, and I don't think it's appropriate for the witness, and it's an invasion of the province of the Trial Chamber for the witness to give such an opinion on that ultimate issue of fact.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honours -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, we think that the topic is a matter which ought to be enquired into.  You're asking an opinion, and perhaps you could address the question in a manner that would produce information to support whatever opinion he might have.  But we don't exactly overrule the question, but putting it in that form by itself just provides an opinion only and not -- not evidence.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, did you have an opportunity to observe the powers that were exercised by these three gentlemen -- Mr. Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, and Karemera -- during the period of April, May, June 1994?  

Witness, maybe your headphones weren't on when the question came through.  Did you hear the question?  
A.	No, I didn't have my headset on.  
Q.	Thank you.  So, Witness, did you have an opportunity to observe the power exercised by these three gentlemen -- Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Ngirumpatse, and Mr. Karemera -- during the period of April, May, June 1994?  
A.	Those people were members of the MRND executive committee.  They had considerable power.  At that time, the MRND was an extremely powerful party.  They also had the presidency of the republic.  The president was a member of the party.  For me, they had considerable power at that time.  
Q.	The question is, did they have sufficient power, from your observation and knowledge, to have been able to stop the killings of Tutsi during this period?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, excuse me.  I'm going to object.  And I apologise to the witness, but I ask him to take his headphones off for a moment.  Thank you.  

Mr. President, from this witness's testimony, he saw Mr. Nzirorera on one occasion, on the 10th of April 1994, and never saw him again.  I don't think that this witness is being asked -- has laid a sufficient foundation for the basis of his -- to give an opinion, especially as to Mr. Nzirorera.  And also I object to lumping all three of them into one question, but, more importantly, from all the facts that you've heard, there's insufficient basis for him to say anything concrete about Mr. Nzirorera's power, other than he's generally a member of the executive committee.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we're going to allow the question.  You see, this matter, whereas, in fact, the comments that you've made are pertinent and reasonable, at the bottom line, it really goes to weight of the testimony.  I tried to point that out to Mr. Rapp, but I don't think that we should exclude the question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp.  
MR. RAPP:
If the witness would return his headphones.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, now that the headphones are back on, the question has been allowed, and if you can recall the question, would you please answer it?  
A.	Those three Accused persons had the power to stop the massacres.  If they had agreed with the army and the gendarmerie, they could have stopped the killings well before the month of May.  But, in fact, what happened was that, instead of looking for means to stop the massacres, on the contrary, they sent people into the préfectures to incite and encourage the population to kill.  

	For the case of the MRND, I can speak about Minister Bizimungu, who I met in Kigali at the Interahamwe headquarters.  He told the Interahamwe that the government and the political parties support you and that they appreciate your work, and they encourage you to carry on.  They did not have the will to do so, but if they had wanted to, they could have stopped the killings.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, at this point, I would ask to go into closed session.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I don't have any objection to closed session.  I just want to use this opportunity to thank Mr. Rapp for, I think, doing a tremendously good job for leading this witness in public session and covering a great deal of material, and I think he's really done a service to everyone, so, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Mr. Rapp, do you want to say "Thank you"?  
MR. RAPP:
Yes, I want to thank my learned colleague for that compliment, and I appreciate that.  And I think I share the view that, to the extent that we can bring these matters out in public for the view of the audience and perhaps the world, that's -- that's a positive thing.  And when that's possible, we should do it.  I hope we haven't too compromised this witness's identity, and now we'll have, as I say, I hope, only about an hour or so of questions, maybe an hour -- certainly conclude by six with sessions -- with questions in the closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you.  I think the Court will also express appreciation for this because we support the general principle that this is a public trial, with testimony given in open session, as far as possible.  

We are going to go into closed session now, which means that the public will not be permitted to hear or see what transpires.  This is a measure designed for the protection of the identity of the witness, and questions are going to be put to him which could reveal his identity or his whereabouts, and we have deemed this to be not permissible for his safety and security.  So we have to ask the public now to leave. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript, pages 9 to 29, was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
