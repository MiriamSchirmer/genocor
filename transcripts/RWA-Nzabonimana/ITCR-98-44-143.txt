MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 12th of July 2005, for the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T. 

Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Madam Witness, your testimony will continue this morning.  You will be giving evidence on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you started your evidence yesterday.  Do you understand?  

So, Mr. Hooper -- 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Yesterday we were talking about Kabakubwa, which was a massacre site of considerable dimensions, and you were telling us that having spent three days at the préfecture after leaving the hospital, that you were present when Kanyabashi unleashed the soldiers and militias on the people who had been -- the several thousands of people who had been gathered there.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And, in fact, I can read from your evidence on a previous occasion in -- before this Tribunal, where you said this:  "It was absolutely horror, undescribable massacres.  It goes beyond understanding.  An incredible number of persons were shot down, massacred.  The kind of killing that went on at Kabakubwa can't be described.  There are no words to describe it."  Is that right? 
A.	I did not give that evidence before this Chamber. 
Q.	But you gave -- that was your evidence in December of 2003.  Do you accept that?  I've just read it to you word for word.  
A.	I thought if -- you were asking me if I'd -- if I'd come to give evidence in the Kanyabashi trial.  How do you want me to know, I didn't come to give evidence in that trial. 
Q.	Now, please listen to my questions today and try and answer them to the Judges, not to me, to the Judges as best you can.  I have just read to you a transcript of your evidence, taken from the transcript of the trial here in Rwamakuba in 2003.  The date of the transcript is the 11th of December.  Do you accept that you said those words; yes or no? 
A.	I know very well that I gave evidence in the Rwamakuba trial.  I did not give evidence in the Kanyabashi trial.  I recall, by the way, that at a certain point you asked me to leave aside what I knew of Kanyabashi and talk of Rwamakuba only. 
Q.	Can you just please answer the question.  Do you acknowledge that the words I have just read out were your -- was your testimony as an eyewitness of the Kabakubwa massacre; yes or no, please? 
A.	Please can you repeat what you just read?  
Q.	Do you really need me to do that? 
A.	Please, you can read it again.  
Q.	Then I will:  "And when you got to Kabakubwa," was the question, "what did you see there?"  Answer:  "It was absolute horror, undescribable massacres.  It goes beyond understanding.  An incredible number of persons were shot down, massacred.  The kind of killing that went on at Kabakubwa can't be described.  There are no words to describe it."  Question: " You were there when the massacre started; is that right?"  Answer:  "Yes, I was there."  Do you accept that those are your words in those answers? 
A.	There is no problem. 
Q.	Well, there is a problem because that massacre was on the 22nd of April.  There was only one massacre at Kabakubwa as the Prosecution in this case know and, indeed, is the case that's being advanced in another Chamber as we sit here this morning.  So, can you tell me this, if you were at the hospital -- 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I would like to ask Counsel Hooper to give us references of the document that he is quoting concerning the date of the massacre at Kabakubwa.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well, Madam Witness, just excuse me for a moment.  Can I submit an extract from the indictment against Joseph Kanyabashi, which is the joint trial now known as Butare, the amended indictment and, in particular, paragraphs 632 and 633.  I submit the document, the extract I have, as an exhibit.  I will just read it into the transcript.  It's very brief.  

Paragraph 632:  "On the 21st and 22nd of April 1994, Tutsis who are fleeing the massacres took refuge in a pasture in Kabakubwa cellule on the orders of Joseph Kanyabashi, who had promised to protect them.  Joseph Kanyabashi subsequently ordered his subordinates, notably conseiller de secteur and communal policemen on the one hand, and asked certain members of the Hutu population on the other hand, to go to Kabakubwa cellule to eliminate the refugees."  

Paragraph 633:  "On the 21st of April 1994, at around 4 p.m., the communal policeman and conseiller de secteur, assisted by Hutu peasant farmers and by militiamen, attacked refugees.  Subsequently, Joseph Kanyabashi called in reinforcements from the President Guard.  On their arrival, they took part in the attacks."  Now, that's the indictment.  My friend being a member of the Prosecution team at this Tribunal will have access not only to the opening note, not only to the -- all the amendments that have been sought to be made, of which this is a product, but also of the evidence that's been led in that case and also of the position of the Prosecutor in that case.  I formally submit this document as a Defence exhibit.  It is an extract of those public documents which the Court will have access to in any event.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Counsel.  Is there any final decision concerning the dates that are in question?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I can only -- I'm sure I don't need to remind my friend of her duty to the Chamber rather than to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence.  Exhibit number, Mr. Fry?  
MR. FRY:
D. 51, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
(Exhibit No. D. 51 admitted)  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, despite your very pointed statement, which we have in our bundle of statements dealing with Kabakubwa, and with your pointed references to the participation of Kanyabashi, Nyiramasuhuko and Shalom in it, it's right to say, madam, that you were not called by the Prosecution to give evidence in any other case here.  Is that right? 
A.	I would like to go back to the previous question.  You mentioned dates during which the Tutsis were attacked at Kabakubwa.  The Tutsis were not attacked only on a single occasion.  The refugees, first of all, were killed, and then there were other Tutsis that were killed.  They were not all killed on the same day. 
Q.	We have your statement, madam.  Were you at Kabakubwa when Kanyabashi started the massacres of thousands of Tutsis who he had purposely gathered there; were you present, yes or no? 
A.	I was present there. 
Q.	And were you also present at Butare hospital between the 17th and 18th of April and the 25th or 28th of April? 
A.	You are inventing dates that are not found in my statement.  I was there between the 18th and the 29th.  You should not change the dates.  Yesterday we talked at length about those dates.  And the genocide, you know, doesn't boil down to dates.  What is important is the genocide that occurred in Rwanda; that is what should be of interest to us here. 
Q.	And does that -- does it matter if you were actually there or not or is it something that you can make up if you want?  What's your opinion on that? 
A.	No, I am not inventing anything.  I cannot invent anything. 
Q.	Let me ask you one last time.  Were you at Kabakubwa? 
A.	I was present at Kabakubwa. 
Q.	Then you couldn't be at the hospital, could you? 
A.	Since yesterday, I have been giving dates during which I was at the hospital, and I also gave the dates on which I was at Kabakubwa.  I am here to answer your questions.  If you want me to, I can repeat my answers. 
Q.	In respect of your coming to Arusha and giving evidence, obviously you deal with the witness support people in Rwanda; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	What did you say?  
Q.	I asked you, is it correct that when you are in Rwanda you deal with the United Nations witness support people; is that correct? 
A.	I know nothing of it. 
Q.	Could you listen carefully to my question?  
A.	I am listening to your questions and I will provide answers to them. 
Q.	When you are in Rwanda you have dealings with the United Nations witness support people; is that correct? 
A.	Nobody gave me assistance. 
Q.	Well, you got here, didn't you, you were brought here by plane, by a small United Nations plane from Kigali to here in Arusha; is that right? 
A.	Did you expect me to come here on foot?  It is clear that I came here on board that plane. 
Q.	Well, people -- the United Nations has understandably got a group of people who deal specially with Prosecution witnesses, and you have had dealings with them in Rwanda.  They've seen you safely here, haven't they, and they are looking after you in your safe house; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	It is correct that I am provided accommodation.  Did you expect me to stay in the open air?  
Q.	We don't need clever answers; we just need simple, truthful ones.  When you are in Rwanda, who is your contact at the United Nations? 
A.	I am here to give testimony in the Rwamakuba case.  I am not here to joke.  Ask me how many people Rwamakuba killed.  Don't ask me in which plane I came or whom I saw.  I do not think that that should be the focus of our attention because I don't think I should waste our time for nothing. 
Q.	Do you want to answer my questions today?  Let me repeat this question to you.  You do your best.  
A.	I answer your questions. 
Q.	When you are living in your hometown in Rwanda, who is your contact?  Who do you contact in the United Nations if you have any problems or if you want to know when you are going to come here or who comes to see you when they want you to come here?  That's what the question is about.  It's a very simple question.  I don't need names.  Is it right that you have contact with the United Nations when you are in Rwanda? 
A.	Can you please repeat your question?  
Q.	I won't repeat the question.  Let me ask you another question.  Who is your contact in the Rwandese administration or government?  Who do you deal with on the Rwandese side of things?  Who is your contact there? 
A.	I don't have any contact. 
Q.	Well, at least you understood that question.  Now, I'm going to pass you up a list with names on it.  And the object of this list is that -- we all have such a list, at least I hope we do.  Maybe we don't.  

I'll come back to that.  I will come back to that later this morning.  

Now, you told you us that you've given evidence in cases in Rwanda, and you told us that you'd given evidence in the Dr. Gatera case.  Is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And Dr. Gatera was convicted of complicity in genocide and was sentenced, sentenced to death; is that right? 
A.	I do not quite understand your question. 
Q.	Well, you gave evidence in the Dr. Gatera case; you've agreed with that, and he was sentenced to death, was he not? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And that was a public hearing held in Butare; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	In 19 -- 19 -- 1997 to 1998, and perhaps into 1999, the trial continued over that period of time; is that correct? 
A.	If my recollections are good, that trial began in 1998, and I think it's been a while since that trial took place. 
Q.	That may be right, and I think it went into 1999, but whatever, it was a public trial in the sense that, obviously, the public were allowed to attend the hearings which were, in fact, fed on loudspeakers to the outside of the building because there was considerable interest in the trial, that's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And so all your evidence in respect of that and the people you named there was all heard by everybody, or anyone who wanted to care to listen, living in Butare.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And Dr. Gatera was quite an old man.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, he was of a certain age. 
Q.	He had been the first doctor, I think, qualified in Belgium -- in Rwanda.  And from 1994 until his arrest in 1997, he was dean of the hospital.  Is that right? 
A.	I don't quite understand what you said. 
Q.	He was dean of the hospital from 1994 till 1997, that is, the three years after the genocide under the new government, he was the dean of the hospital there; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I heard people say so. 
Q.	And having been sentenced to death and kept in prison, he fell ill and died before his appeal could be heard; is that right? 
A.	His trial did not wait for the appeal, he had been found guilty. 
Q.	Now, you also mentioned the name of another case that you'd given evidence in, which I didn't quite hear.  I got it down as at Rurangirwa.  Can you tell us what the name of the case was, please? 
A.	Counsel, you have the dossier, don't you?  
Q.	Can you just answer the question, please?  Can you tell me the name of the case that you think I have a dossier in, in which you gave evidence? 
A.	You are putting questions to me regarding dossiers since yesterday.  I have not been prepared to answer such questions because I didn't come here for that trial.  These people were condemned to death, their trials are over.  So you should put questions to me instead regarding the trial for which we are here today. 
Q.	Can you give us the name, please, of the case other than Dr. Gatera's case in which you've given evidence?  And can you spell it for us, please.  
A.	Which person are you referring to?  
Q.	Can you assist the Chamber a little better than you are trying at the moment?  You know very well the name of case I'm asking you about.  Can you give the name of it again?  You mentioned it yesterday; I didn't catch it.  Can you give that name now, and can you spell it for us, please? 
A.	I don't know what you are talking about. 
Q.	Well, I will ask you a last time.  You gave evidence, as we know, in the Gatera case, and you told us yesterday you also gave evidence in another case.  Will you give us the name of that other case, and can you spell the name for us, please? 
A.	Yesterday, I gave the name, you were here.  You had the name.  You took it down; you have it in your paper.  You can give the name.  There is no problem with that, is there. 
Q.	I don't want to sit here till ten o'clock tonight.  Will you please give us the name and spell it for us?  This is the last time I'm going to ask you.

MR. HOOPER: 
And, Mr. President, I've had no answer.  I'm requesting you, Mr. President, to intercede on behalf of the Defence to obtain an answer from this, I'm afraid, recalcitrant witness 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have noted the witness's behaviour.  I wasn't certain if there is anything I should do about that, but I would remind her what I had tried to explain yesterday on more than one occasion.  

Madam Witness, do you recall the oath that you took when you started your evidence?  The way evidence is given -- 
THE WITNESS: 
I remember, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The way you give evidence here is by responding to the questions put to you by the Prosecutor and the lawyer representing the Accused person.  Once you agree to give evidence, you have the obligation to answer lawful questions which are put to you.  The Judges decide what questions are lawful and what questions are not lawful.  The questions that we decide that are lawful, you ought to answer.  These questions have two purposes; one is to get information from you, and secondly, to help to demonstrate whether your witness can -- your evidence can be believed.  So some of these questions are aimed at testing the quality of your evidence.  The way you answer these questions will influence decisions that are made on these issues.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, it's your obligation to answer the questions that are put to you unless we decide that they were unlawful.  Now, please, conduct yourself accordingly.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, can I ask you this, forget the spellings because that, I don't know, could be an embarrassment, I don't know.  Can you just tell us the name again of the case that you mentioned rather quickly yesterday?  Can you give us the name again, please? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness, you are trying to attract my attention, what do you wish -- what do you wish to say?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I did not emphasise the matter of these trials in Rwanda because these trials occurred in Rwanda.  I am here for the Rwamakuba trial.  That is why I am before the Trial Chamber.  These other trials have been concluded.  I do not understand why we must return to them.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, you see, before I answer you I will allow the Prosecutor to make an intervention.
MS. FALL:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I think that this is perhaps something that should be viewed from a cultural standpoint.  It is clear that some witnesses are reticent about talking about trials where they gave testimony if these trials have been closed.  Perhaps this witness might be made to understand that she must understand all -- she must answer all questions which are put to her in this Trial Chamber.  I think this is a problem of understanding as to her function as a witness in the Rwamakuba trial.  But she must be made to understand also that she is to answer any other questions that the Defence puts to her in a cross-examination, even if these are questions that recur, and even if she feels that she's already answered the questions.  So I would like to ask our witness to answer all the questions put to her, except, of course, these questions are likely to reveal her identity.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor.  

Madam Witness, did you understand what the Prosecutor was saying?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In our -- in our court there are rules which govern the behaviour of the various parties.  And in a trial of this nature, or in any trial conducted under this system, the -- the -- there is a certain area of questions that are permitted.  Even if they do not appear to be directly related to why you are here, there is a connection which exists.

Now, I hope that the appeal made by the Prosecutor will assist you to understand that this is not something that is against you individually, it's just a system under which our trials are conducted.  Every witness has to answer questions of this nature.  Once you agree to come here, that's part of what you have to do.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, please guide yourself accordingly and respond to the questions.  I can assure you that if the lawyer of the Accused asks any question which is not permitted, I will stop him from doing so.  But the questions he is permitted to answer, you are obliged -- the questions he is going ask, you are obliged to answer.  Do you understand that?  
Please go on.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Was the case in which you gave evidence called Rurangirwa, R-U-R-A-N-G-I-R-W-A, or was that at least one of the people in that trial as a defendant? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, in terms of cultural difference, you know the difference between lying and telling the truth, don't you? 
A.	I know the truth; I do not know lies. 
Q.	And the reason you don't want to talk about Kabakubwa and the reason you don't want to talk about the Rurangirwa case, is because you've got something to hide.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I did not say that I was not in Kabakubwa.  I said I was there and that I was even shot at while I was there, so I did not tell you that I was not there. 
Q.	Now, I have got us some pieces of paper now, so if they can be distributed please.  
MR. HOOPER:
I think the translation booths have these from yesterday.  I hope -- if I'm not right about that, there is sufficient, I think, to go round again, but from the party, obviously being the Judges, one to the Prosecutor, one to the defendant (sic) and to the stenographers as well, please.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, if you could be provided with a biro or a pen, what I want you to do, please -- invite you to do, is to look at that list of names.  You needn't mention the names out loud, but what I want you to do is put a cross in the column to the right of those names if you know or think you know any of the people whose names appear there.  So if you know number 1, just put a cross to the right; if you don't know number 1, leave it blank, please.  

And we can see that you have indicated that you know number 7 and you know number 8.  Now, tell us about number 7.  Before you do that, just tell us this:  How long have you been working at the institution where you presently work? 
A.	I have been working there for eight years. 
Q.	So you started work there in 1997, is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And that's before you gave your first statement in this case.  Is that right? 
A.	I was recruited by this organisation in 1997, and I gave my first statement in the same year. 
Q.	You gave your statement after you'd started work there.  Is that right? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Number 7, please, how do you know that person? 
A.	I know this person because I was with her at the hospital during the genocide. 
Q.	Was that in maternity -- in the maternity wing or somewhere else? 
A.	We were together at the hospital. 
Q.	Was that in the maternity wing or somewhere else? 
A.	We were at the hospital. 
Q.	Were you together in the maternity wing? 
A.	We were at the hospital. 
Q.	Why don't you want to answer this simple question?  It's not a cultural problem, I hope.  
A.	I have not refused to answer your question.  I have answered the question by saying that the person was also inside the hospital. 
Q.	Which part did you know her?
A.	We used to meet at the place where the refugees were; that is, where the tent sheltering the refugees were found.  We could also meet at the maternity or in other parts of the hospital. 
Q.	Was she with you at Kabakubwa? 
A.	No, we were not together for the simple reason that this person never went to Kabakubwa. 
Q.	Have you discussed the Rwamakuba case with her, this case?  Nothing wrong with it if you have, but have you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you read any of her statements that she's made, for example? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You see, we saw that bit of a statement yesterday, one of your statements where you say, "I was hit" -- this is what you said in your statement, your witness statement, "I was hit by grenade shrapnel and wounded to my head," not shot at by Kanyabashi, as number 7 says, which suggests that you presumably must have read her statement about that.  Would that be right?  
A.	No, I did not read -- I have not read her statement. 
Q.	At the end or towards the end of your first statement you say, "The lady" -- number 7, I won't say her name -- "could confirm or invalidate my statement.  The other refugees whom I knew have all died".  That's right, isn't it?  Do you remember writing that? 
A.	Yes, I said that because we were together at the hospital. 
Q.	And you and number 7 both made statements in this case on the same day, the 11th of September 1997; is that correct? 
A.	I have no idea.

	1000H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Statements made by a man called -- a man from Mali called Sidibe, does that ring a bell with you? 
A.	I don't know anything about it. 
Q.	And if you look at number 5 on the list, are you sure you don't know that person? 
A.	I do not know this person. 
Q.	Keep the list in front of you, please.  You also made a statement on the 11th of September 1997 to     Mr. Sidibe.  All three of you made a statement on the same day, but you don't know anything about that; is that right? 
A.	I have no idea. 
Q.	And number 7 also gave evidence in the case of Gatera in open court, like you; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I heard this person's testimony. 
Q.	And she heard yours? 
A.	I do not know whether this person heard my testimony. 
Q.	Is number 7 a good friend of yours; would you say that? 
A.	No, this person and I are not friends. 
Q.	You are not friends?  Were you friends, have you stopped being friends or were you never friends? 
A.	We have never been friends.  I see her as a passerby. 
Q.	In one of your statements you describe her as a friend and colleague; is that wrong? 
A.	I am going to repeat what I just said.  That person is not a friend of mine and we do not work in the same department.  It is true that that person works at the same place and in the same complex, but the person is not my friend. 
Q.	So when in your statement it reads, "She is a friend and colleague," that is wrong is it, the friend bit anyway is wrong, is it?  
A.	No, I have never said before this Chamber that that person was a friend of mine. 
Q.	No, but it is in your statement, you see.  Did you tell the investigator that she was a friend of yours? 
A.	No, I never said so. 
Q.	Can we come to number 8.  Now, number 8, you mentioned yesterday, he was the person who told you that the man was called André Rwamakuba.  That is the same man as the name that appears at number 8; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  That is the person who pointed out André Rwamakuba to me, because the person knew Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Now, obviously, then you must have known that person when you were in the hospital in 1994, in April. That is right, obviously, isn't it? 
A.	No, I did not know the person at the time. 
Q.	Well, let me rephrase the question.  If he spoke to you at the time to point out that the man was called André Rwamakuba, it would, obviously, follow that you met him and saw him at the hospital while you were there during the genocide; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	I met him at the hospital while I was there, and that is where I knew him. 
Q.	Yes.  So, I thought I would say it.  All right, what was his job there? 
A.	He was one of the cleaners at the hospital, and we generally refer to them as workers of the hospital. 
Q.	So, you knew him as a cleaner; is that right? 
A.	No, the cleaning or maintenance I'm talking about can be done in different ways.  It could be cleaning, it could be maintenance in buildings or outside of the building.  And he used to work inside of the buildings. 
Q.	So, he was sort of a general maintenance man, cum cleaner, when you knew him in 1994 during the genocide; is that right? 
A.	I knew that he was working at that place and that he was one of the employees that did maintenance work and that ensured the cleanliness of the buildings, but I did not ask him what his precise job was. 
Q.	Well, we will come back to him a little later.  Did he carry on working at the hospital after the war? 
A.	I do not know ****************. 
Q.	*****************************? 
A.	No. 
Q.	We will come back to him a little later.  So, there you are, out of the nine names there, you know two, number 7 and number 8.  And you don't know anybody else at all; is that right? 
A.	I don't know anyone else. 
Q.	Now, the last name, that is name number 9, is someone who is not a witness in this case, number 9? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My list has an imaginary number 9. 
MR. HOOPER: 
That must be the marked one version that went up -- no, there is one to eight which omits --  
THE WITNESS:
I do not have number 9 on my list.  I have a list of 8 names. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I have any of the ones that are left please, because there were -- well, we can add the name anyway, it is not a witness and not -- no longer protected, as I understand it.  I see we have had a refined version omitting this name.   
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But, in fact, let me ask you about someone name ********************************************************, who was a witness in this case but is no longer a witness in this case.  Do you know her? 
A.	I have heard about her. 
Q.	Now, you have just heard about her.  Is it right, in fact, that you lived in a neighbouring secteur, I won't name the secteur -- no, a neighbouring cellule, I should say, much smaller area.
A.	No. 
Q.	Well, I will return to this shortly when -- I am going to need to go into some closed session, I think, with you, but I will try to stay out of that for the time being.
A.	Counsel, I do not need to give evidence in a closed session.  What happened did happen in broad daylight, so I would like to be able to give my evidence in the public hearing.  I do not need a closed session. 
Q.	Well, you were busy writing names down yesterday, so I assume if you don't want to be protected, there are other people who I have to be sensitive to.  So, it is not entirely your decision, I'm afraid, it would be much easier if it were.  So you don't mind saying anything in public, that's your position, is it?  If I want to refer to your address, for example, you don't mind that; is that right, where you live?  It would certainly save us a lot of inconvenience having to go into closed session.  Are you happy with everything being out in the open? 
A.	But you have just mentioned the name of a person who, according to you, would appear on the list as number 9 but which I don't have on my list.  Now, this person would need protection.  The person is an animal, is he?   
Q.	As I understand it, she is not a protected witness at present.  But if you want -- if you want to be sensitive about that, then we will go into closed session.  But I thought a moment ago you said let's have it all in public.  

Let me just go back to the other people on this list, the other names.  You say you don't know any of them, but they all work at the same institution as you, don't they, everyone of them, with, perhaps, the exception of number 8, who may no longer work there, but once did.  That is right, isn't it? 
A.	You were not well informed.  I think you have been misled. 
Q.	Well, not only do they all work at the same institution as you, but they are each and every one of them Tutsi; not only that, but they each and every one claims to have been at the hospital during the genocide and they are, therefore, all survivors in that (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) -- or in that institution.
MR. HOOPER:
	Can that be struck, I'm sorry, in that institution.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, are you honestly telling this Chamber that you don't know them, having worked there since 1997 for eight years?  You don't know any of the others; is that your evidence? 
A.	The institution for which I work is very big.  You can see a staff member go by without knowing him or her.  It is a big institution where you have many buildings.  And when you look at the buildings, they extend on and on -- they spread on and on. 
Q.	***************************************************************************************************
	***************************************************************************************************
	*******************************************? 
A.	I don't think you visited all of the buildings of the institution. 
Q.	Well, I was stopped from visiting one but I don't know how you know that.  Do you know what buildings I was allowed to visit? 
A.	How could I know that, Counsel?  
Q.	I was wondering myself.  Now, number 5 has the same job as you, does she not? 
A.	That is not true. 
Q.	Number 7, who you know, has the same job as you, more or less; does she not? 
A.	That is not true. 
Q.	********************* has the same job as you, does she not, same function? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And you don't know number 5, you have told us, but you know she does not have the same job as you; is that right? 
A.	No, that is not what I told you.  I do not know what her job is. 
Q.	But you know her? 
A.	I do not know her. 
Q.	On our plan ***************** and, indeed, visiting it, it is correct to say that there is a cafeteria which the staff can use.  Do you ever use that? 
A.	No, I do not go to the cafeteria. 
Q.	You don't go to the staff cafeteria, never, ever; is that right? 
A.	I never go there. 
Q.	Now, you've indicated knowing only 7 and 8 on the list.  Can I ask you this, just so that we know where we stand -- or where you stand on this:  Did you see, other than numbers 7 and 8, any of the others during the period that you were ************** during the genocide.  And I assume that your answer will be no, I didn't see any of them that I know; is that right? 
A.	I never saw the persons coming before the last two on the list, which means that I only saw the two persons that we talked about. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.  Now, you mentioned yesterday that you have given evidence, or are going to give evidence -- perhaps you can clarify this -- in Gacaca proceedings; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In which case? 
A.	I believe -- or I think you should ask me the previous questions at which I just answered so that I can clarify something. 
Q.	All right.  Have you actually given evidence before a Gacaca hearing? 
A.	Yes, I have already given evidence before the Gacaca court. 
Q.	And those are public hearings, of course.  So can I ask you this; in respect of which person or persons did you give evidence about? 
A.	I mentioned John Nahimana.  I have also mentioned Dr. Pascal, who subsequently was imprisoned on the orders of the Gacaca court. 
Q.	Is that Pascal Ndengejeho or another name? 
A.	No, I'm not referring to Pascal Ndengejeho, the name is simply Pascal. 
Q.	And apart from Nahimana and Dr. Pascal, have you given evidence in respect of any other persons in Gacaca? 
A.	Yes, I have talked of other persons in my evidence. 
Q.	Can you briefly -- or can you give us their names, please? 
A.	I am afraid that this may not be possible. 
Q.	And why is that? 
A.	That is my wish. 
Q.	Well, I am going to invite the registry, please, to hand you this piece of paper.  And in a few minutes we will probably be taking a break, and I want you to please write down the names of people so that at least it is not in public, the people other than Nahimana and Dr. Pascal that you have mentioned, as you have put it, in the Gacaca proceedings.  So you will have 15 minutes or so to consider that and to write them down.  And if you could write in capital letters, it will help us read them.  Now, Dr. Pascal, I take it, you mentioned him in the context of things he did at the hospital; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Though he is not a name that ever appears in any of your statements that we have.  That is right too, isn't it? 
A.	But, Counsel, I have just told you that I mentioned that name recently -- 
Q.	I'm sure that is --  
A.	-- in the Gacaca courts. 
Q.	I'm sure that is right.  Now John Nahimana, where does he fit in?  Was he at the hospital too? 
A.	He was a stretcher holder at the hospital, and he used to transport bodies on his stretcher during the events. 
Q.	And, again, that is a name that you have not mentioned at all in any of your statements, statements where you say that you can't remember any more names; is that right? 
A.	Well, there is nothing that says that we have to mention all of the criminals in one and the same statement.  When you give a statement, you provide answers to questions that are put to you. 
Q.	Are you or have you ever been a member of the organisation called Ibuka? 
A.	I don't even know of that organisation. 
Q.	Never heard of it? 
A.	No. 
Q.	It is the principal survivors' organisation in Rwanda.  You never heard of it; is that right? 
A.	Well, I hear it being talked about over the radio like everyone else, but no one has come to see me about that association or organisation. 
Q.	Well, that was not quite the answer you gave a moment ago when you said you never heard of it, you have heard of it then? 
A.	I have just told you that nobody has contacted me personally to talk about that organisation.  However, I do concede to you, you know, that people do talk about this organiation, or the organisation is mentioned in press releases or in the news over the radio. 
Q.	And have you been a member, or have you associated with, knowingly, people who are members of a group called Abasa, A-B-A-S-A.   
A.	I do not know that group Abasa.  A-B-A-S-A. 
Q.	And that is my last question at this juncture.  You mentioned Dr. Twagirayezu,                                     Dr. Emmanuel Twagirayezu.  Indeed, in your evidence you mentioned seeing him twice on quite separate occasions in the company of Dr. Gatera and Dr. Rwamakuba; is that right?  You saw him twice during these events; is that right? 
A.	I saw him walking side by side with Dr. André and Dr. Gatera.  They were walking along side one another and I saw them. 
Q.	Was this at a time when you say Rwamakuba was doing wicked things? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Because you say in your statement, your second statement, the one you like, you say, "I also saw     Dr. Rwamakuba walking together with Dr. Twagirayezu, who was also Hutu.  But I do not remember seeing Dr. Twagirayezu participating in killings nor speaking against the Tutsi."  Is that right? 
A.	I did not see -- I did not say that I do not remember.  My statement indicates that I did not see this person do anything against the Tutsis.  I said that I saw him walking side by side with the Accused; that is all I said. 
Q.	But that was at a time, you told us in your evidence, when Rwamakuba, Gatera and Twagirayezu, with him, was selecting and getting Tutsis killed; isn't that right? 
A.	Yes, that is what happened. 
Q.	And you mentioned him now twice, rather than once.  Tell me this, Dr. Emmanuel Twagirayezu he was put on trial, wasn't he, in Buture in 19 -- in 2000 I think it was; is that right? 
A.	I know that he was tried, but I cannot tell you what date -- on what date this happened; I cannot tell you the year either. 
Q.	Did you attend any of the hearings of the trial, his trial? 
A.	Yes, I did.  Yes, I attended his trial. 
Q.	And number 5 on our list gave evidence, didn't she, against him? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	And so did your chum -- well, your colleague anyway, number 7, she gave evidence against him, didn't she? 
A.	There were many witnesses who took the stand.  I cannot tell you who was a witness and who was not.  These were people who saw him committing crimes.  I did not see him committing crimes, and so I could not accuse him, or give testimony against him if I had not seen him committing any crime. 
Q.	Well, you attended the hearings.  Did you notice ************************ also gave evidence against             Dr. Twagirayezu?  Did you see her giving evidence; all of them, of course, working at the same institution as you.  
A.	I did not see this person because I didn't attend the trial every day.  I think I went there once or twice. 
Q.	And the Rwandese court that sat on that case came to a judgement and they disbelieved those witnesses, and they released Dr. Twagirayezu, didn't they?  He was found not guilty and released.  And he works today in Kigali as a doctor; is that right? 
A.	I would like to explain this matter to you.  If he was not found guilty, or if he was released -- if he was released it does not mean that he was found not guilty.  We know that he paid money so that he should be freed.  We know also that he will be called before the Gacaca courts. 
Q.	He had a hearing before the court of first instance in Butare.  There was no appeal by the Prosecutor, and those witnesses were not believed.  See, there is a little group of you there in Butare who put your heads together and make up false stories, making false allegations against people from time to time, one of which is André Rwamakuba.  That is right, isn't it? 
A.	What you say is not true.  
Q.	All right.  That is where I can leave it there at the moment.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short mid-morning break of about 15 minutes and resume just before 11 o'clock. 
(Court recessed from 1040H to 1104H) 
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, can we go into closed session for a few minutes.  It won't be longer than that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will go into closed session now.  

Madam Witness, do you understand what that means?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  But as far as I am concerned, the closed session is not important.  I'm ready to continue to give my evidence in public, as usual. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, Mr. Hooper had suggested this morning that the purpose of the closed session was to protect not only the witness who is giving evidence at the moment, but people whom he thinks are entitled to protection who are not in court.  What do you think?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I don't have any objection as to our going into a closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Madam Witness, counsel for the Accused has indicated that one of the reasons why a closed session was necessary is that there are other names that he intends to mention who are entitled to protection.  So, it is not your interest alone that is being considered at this time.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  But I am under the impression that some other person's name was mentioned during the open session and we didn't think about that person's security. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The person's who are entitled to security are those who are protected by protection orders from the Court -- from the Chamber.  You have heard it said in court that that person is not the beneficiary of an order of protection from the Chamber, so that is the reason why the name was permitted to be mentioned in open session.  But there are other persons who the Court has made orders in relation to, and we have to take proceedings -- to take steps to ensure that they have the benefit of protection.  

In any event, as a witness in this trial, you are obliged to obey the directions of the Court.   Now, I have given you an explanation to explain why the reason for the decision, but the decision is that we will go into closed session for a short time.  And when that time is finished, we will resume in open session.  

We go into closed session now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 19 to 22] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 11 to 18 by Donna M. Lewis)



















MR. PRESIDENT:
We now resume into open session.

Yes, Madam Witness, have you something else to say?  
THE WITNESS:
I would like to say something.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may go ahead. 
THE WITNESS:
When we went for the break the Defence counsel asked me something on Emmanuel Twagirayezu, and the counsel said that there are witnesses who lied in his trial and that it is because of the lies of the witnesses that the Accused was released, but for what I have heard, the sentence was -- when the sentence was rendered in the first instance, he was declared innocent but much money was paid and all those who were at the Bench at his trial were dismissed.  Twagirayezu was released but the decision was taken that there be a retrial and the witnesses who appeared at his trial came together to give false testimony before that court.  And that is what I wanted to clarify, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Normally, the procedure is this, that you answer questions -- it is not normal for witnesses to make statements of this nature.  The normal procedure would be for you to respond to questions from the lawyer who is putting that to you, and then the lawyer on the other side would have an opportunity to assist you to clarify matters which, in the lawyer's opinion, requires clarification.  Do you understand?  So in general, this is not a procedure which is usual in our trials, but we have permitted you to make the statement and we can now proceed.  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  And thank you for that.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But it is right, isn't it, Madam Witness, my understanding of Emmanuel Twagirayezu's position, he was acquitted.  He then went to Belgium and retrained -- for retraining or further training as a doctor.  And he now works in the central hospital in Kigali and there has been no retrial; is that right, isn't it?  
A.	He is awaiting trial.  
Q.	And are you going to give evidence at this time?  
A.	I am not going to give evidence at that trial.  It is the eyewitnesses; those who saw what he did that are going to testify.  I cannot testify to events that I didn't witness.  
Q.	But you have told us yesterday you saw him twice with André Rwamakuba and Gatera selecting people to kill, when they were doing that?

Well, let me move on.  You were in maternity, I understand, during most of the time that you spent at **********************.  You were in the maternity wing; is that correct?  
A.	I will go back a little bit.  If that person was moving about with André Rwamakuba and I didn't see him do anything, this does not stop other persons for having seen him do what he did.  And to address your question, yes, I was at the maternity.  
Q.	And by the time the killings started in Butare, your sister had had the premature baby; is that right?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And as we touched on yesterday, it is not the case, as you appear to say and do say in your first statement, that you were at the hospital as a refugee.  You went there, you tell us now because you were to look and care for your sister, look after and care for your sister; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, it is true that I did not go to the hospital as a refugee.  I went there to look after my sister who was not well.  
Q.	And I think you know and accept that you didn't mention your sister's name at all in your first statement?  You accept that, don't you? 
A.	I don't agree with you.  
Q.	Well, I don't see how you can disagree with me, I have the statement and there is no mention of your sister in that first statement nor of your brother.  So will you accept it from me that you make no reference at all to either one of them as being at the hospital in your first statement made in 1997?  
A.	I don't agree with you.
Q.	Then let me just pause there.  Are you saying you did tell the investigators that you were there to look after your sister and that wasn't put into the statement; is that what you are saying?  
A.	I mentioned this fact, perhaps the investigators did not take it down in writing, but on every occasion where I have been interviewed, I have mentioned my older sister's name because I was there because I was looking after her.
Q.	Well, I agree it's a peculiar omission if you were looking after your sister that you describe yourself as a refugee and make no reference to her in your first statement, but will you accept for me that there is no reference to your sister in the statement that we have, your first statement, will you accept that?  
A.	I don't agree with you because I went to the hospital before hostilities broke out, at least in as far as the hospital is concerned and I was there to look after a sick person I was looking after my older sister.  I have always mentioned this fact when I have been interviewed by the investigators.  
Q.	Was it the case that your sister wasn't there at all?  
A.	She was there.  
Q.	Do you know what date she had the baby?  
A.	No, I don't remember the date.  
Q.	Had she had the baby by the time you arrived to look after her or did she have it afterwards, and if so, how many days after that, can you remember?  
A.	I didn't keep all these details in my mind.  I know that I went to the hospital to look after my sister who had given birth. 
Q.	Did the baby have a name?  
A.	A child cannot be named before he left the hospital.  You know, in my culture, it is a child's father who gives him his name.  
Q.	Well, I accept that.  Do you know how premature your sister's baby was, can you remember that?  
A.	If I remember correctly, she was seven months pregnant.  So the pregnancy was not full term.  
Q.	So the baby would have been two months premature.  Was the baby put in an incubator?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	The time you spent there looking after your sister, you stayed by her bedside, in the main; is that correct?  Most of the time you were by her bedside; is that correct? 
A.	No, I was not with her most of the time, but I used to sit by her side.  I used to go to her to see her and to help her on some occasions.  I had to go and make porridge for her.  
Q.	Well, obviously, you had to go and make porridge for her and sometimes you go away to use the toilet.  What other times would you be away from her? 
A.	Please repeat your question.  
Q.	Aside from going and getting food for you and her and using the toilet and tending to yourself, what other times and reasons would there be for you to be away from her and not by her bedside?  
A.	If I had stayed with her all the time, I would have left in the vehicle that I mentioned.  At one point in time I was granted written authorisation, which indicated that as a person looking after a patient I was authorised to leave the room or the ward where I was to find food for her.  Thus I could move about using this written authorisation.  
Q.	Yes, we will come to that again, and I understand that.  I also understand that you had a brother who was in the surgical ward that you obviously would have gone to see from time to time.  But, why were you -- where else did you go in the hospital and why?  
A.	Would you please repeat your question?  
Q.	I think you heard it.  Where else would you go in the hospital?  Where else would you go in the hospital and why, apart from porridge, the lavatory and seeing your brother?  
A.	I could be in the corridor or at the place where the refugees who had come from Gikongoro were located.  I could also be taking a closer look at what was going on, that is in regard to the killings that were taking place inside the hospital.  
Q.	These were killings of Tutsis; is that right?  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you look, obviously, like a Tutsi, don't you?  
A.	You yourself can decide.  
Q.	Well, I am asking you, please.  
A.	In my language, it is said that a person who has eyes can see, so you don't have to show him everything.  I am a Tutsi.  
Q.	And would you agree that it would be apparent to any Rwandese person looking at you that you were a Tutsi, just from using their eyes to see?  
A.	I am a Tutsi.  Moreover, during the genocide I never sought to pass for anything else.  When I was asked what ethnic group I belonged to, I always said that I was a Tutsi.  
Q.	Just on that last answer, are you saying that you were confronted by anyone and asked what your ethnicity was in the hospital?  
A.	No, no one put such a question to me at the hospital.  However, the question was put to me elsewhere in the other places that I went to.  
Q.	You were obviously a young woman of 19 of obvious Tutsi ethnicity, attractive, if I may say so, and now you are saying that you were wandering around with those soldiers all over the hospital, those militia, in full sight of everyone?  Is that what you are saying?  
A.	If I had gone -- if I had passed in front of the Interahamwe or all these other people whom you mentioned, I would have been killed.  
Q.	So why were you wandering around the hospital rather than staying in the relative safety, perhaps, of your sister's room by her bedside?  
A.	Do you want an answer to that question, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	I did not stay in that building, thank God, because my elder sister, my brother and other people were killed there.  So if I hadn't left that ward or that building, I would have suffered the same fate.  It is because I went out that my life was actually saved.  
Q.	So where did you go for most of the time that you were in the hospital?  
A.	Sometimes I would be in the maternity or in the kitchen making porridge.  I could also be in the corridor or in the plastic shelters that had been set up in the pediatric unit to shelter the refugees.  I could also be in the surgery where my brother was; those are the places I could go to.  
Q.	All right.  Now, how much time did you spend in the sheeting?  
A.	I didn't spend much time there. 
Q.	In your fourth statement made in March 2003, which I am going to read from, you say:  "I managed to escape the killings again because I hid in small rooms inside the maternity ward for several days."  I will repeat that for you.  "I managed to escape the killings again because I hid in small rooms inside the maternity ward for several days."  And that statement in English is at HF31.  Is that right that you hid in small rooms inside the maternity ward for several days?  
A.	No, it is not true.  In 2003, in my statement I said that I was able to move about, thanks to the authorisation that had been granted me and on this written authorisation, it was indicated that I was looking after a sick person.  
Q.	Well, you may have had this bed guardian certificate to be in the hospital -- as an authorisation for being in the hospital, but it says -- and I have just read it to you very clearly, that you were saved from the killings because you hid in small rooms for several days in maternity.  Now that could only have come from you, and as recently as March of 2003, did you hide in small rooms in the maternity for several days to escape the killings?  
A.	No.  
Q.	So that is untrue what has been written in this statement, that is not something you said, rather.  Is that right?  
A.	I did not talk about small rooms in 2003.  Counsel, I think you should tell the truth.  
Q.	All right.  Do you know which room number -- could you possibly remember, that your sister was in?  
A.	She was in the ground floor ward. 
Q.	All right.  You don't perhaps remember the room number.  Let me ask you this.  You were there with her for much of 10 or 12 days, as I understand your evidence; is that right?  I mean, you get there on the 17th or the 18th and you tell us you leave on the 29th now, how long before your sister was taken?  Sorry, if you leave on the 29th, how many days before that was your sister taken away, can you remember?  
A.	I do not remember.  However, she had already been taken away.  
Q.	I am sorry, I missed the answer there.  I missed the answer because my receptor went off.
MR. HOOPER:
And, as I understand it, the witness said she didn't remember how many days before she left that the sister was taken away.  Thank you very much.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, in any event, you were obviously there for at least a week; it would seem, possibly longer with your sister.  How many other -- your sister was in a bed, was she?  
A.	That's right.  
Q.	And the baby was in an incubator, was that in the same room or in a different room?  
A.	It was in another room.  
Q.	And can you remember, looking back, being by your sister all that time, how many other beds were there in the room that your sister was in, approximately?  
A.	Counsel, in all fairness, I didn't count the beds that were in that room and under the circumstances, I couldn't do that.  ********************************************************** I think even if one works at the hospital, one is not necessarily able to determine the number of beds that are in a room.  
Q.	Yes.  I am not asking you to be absolutely right about it, but just give us an idea how big the room was that your sister was in.  For example, was it -- from your answer, I take it there was more than just your sister in that room.  How many other beds were there, two beds, 10 beds, 20 beds, a big ward with 30 beds, approximately, very approximately?  Can you help us?  
A.	You really mustn't say a room, it was a ward.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, again same question.  Was it a couple of beds, 10 beds, 20 beds, 30?  Can you help us?  
A.	Look, I was not able to count the beds, so I do not know how many beds there were.
Q.	Well, let me ask you this.  Was it more than four beds?  
A.	But I have just told you, Counsel, that I didn't count the beds. 
Q.	Was it 20 beds or four beds?  
A.	To tell you the truth, I cannot answer you by giving you an answer -- a number, sorry, about -- pertaining to the beds.  I was there to look after a sick person.  I was not there to count beds.  I think you should accept my answer and understand my situation.  
Q.	Let me ask you again.  You were there for a week or so in that ward, not just a visitor, you were living there.  You spent your nights there, didn't you?  Where did you spend your nights?  
A.	I spent the night there.  
Q.	Were there just four beds in that room or were there more than that?  
A.	I am telling you in all honesty that I did not count the beds.  And I think you should be able to understand that and stop harassing me with that question.  
Q.	Well, I don't want to harass you with the question.  How big was the room?  Was it as big as this courtroom that you just sat in today?  
A.	No. 
Q.	How big was it?  
A.	It was an average size room; it was not as big as this courtroom.  
Q.	Not quite as big, so pretty big then, was it?  
A.	I have just told you that the ward was not as large as this courtroom and that it was average in size.  
Q.	All right.  I am going to pass you out the photograph and I am going to ask you to mark on the photograph approximately, or specifically even, where your sister was, if you can.  We have a plan and we know where the maternity is, and this is a photograph of the back of the maternity.  
MR. HOOPER:
Does anyone in the interpreters' booth want one of these photographs?  They are rather precious objects.  I see the hands have gone up in the middle booth.  All right, I will send one to you.  And I have got one here for the gentleman in the middle booth.  Oh, it's two hands gone up now.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to put a question, if you will.  We have received a fair number of documents from Mr. Hooper.  I would like to know why Mr. Hooper does not give these documents to the Prosecutor a little earlier so that we can analyse and study them.  That is all I want to ask Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I will deal with the other matters which were only translated last night which we will see later, which is the reason why Ms. Fall only got them this morning.  This photograph as with all my photographs have been available for inspection, as the Prosecutor knows, I hope, since -- before the first day of this trial.  At no time, despite several invitations, has anyone from the Prosecution come to inspect any of the photographs.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, looking at that photograph, do you recognise it as a photograph of the back of the maternity unit at the Butare university hospital?  
A.	Yes, that is the back view of the maternity, but I would like you to show me a photograph showing the front view of that building so that I can show you where my sister was.  
Q.	Well, I have shown you this one because on a previous occasion you indicated a window at the back of the maternity ward.  That is why you are looking at the photograph now of the back of the maternity ward.  Are you saying that this picture or this photograph does not show a window that would indicate where your sister was, yes or no, please?  
A.	Yes, one can see the window, but I think that for you to be able to understand the configuration of the premises, you should also give me the other part of the building, that is the front part so that I can show you precisely the location.  
Q.	Well, I don't think we need that assistance, and we know where the maternity block is, and we have a Prosecution exhibit bundle which shows photographs of the front and the back of the maternity.  Now, unfortunately, there are no copies of this particular exhibit for witnesses, but I can hand you mine and the registry -- the registrar can show you the photograph that the Court has of the front and back of maternity.  So can I pass you up my bundle looking at page 53, and can I invite you to point out photograph number 6, which representatives the front, and photograph number 8 which is a partial photograph of the back?
MR. HOOPER:
Can you show those please to the witness?  Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So that is front and back as you can see of the maternity block as we have and we have seen already.  All right.  Do you have difficult with those?  I have plenty of other photographs if you would like see some other photographs.  
A.	Do you want me to make comments on photograph number 8 or do you want me to show you the place looking at this picture?  
Q.	Well, let me ask you this.  Looking out at your sister's ward window -- room window, were you looking out towards the back or the front of the maternity or neither?  
A.	When one was in the room where my older sister was, you could see the frontage of the maternity and not the rear or back part.  
Q.	That's very interesting.  You now say that your sister's room was not at the back but at the front; is that right?  And is there a picture there -- let me see if I have another photograph for you to mark.  Excuse me for one moment. 

Do you have a photograph in front of you that shows the room where your sister's room -- shows the window of your sister's room, please?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you just hold it up so we can see which photograph you are looking at?  
A.	You want to know in which room she was or should I show you the picture that has the room in which she was?  
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	I am going to give you further explanations so that you better understand.  If you look at the windows below, there you have a small room where patients with problems are sent, and then you have a room where you have other patients.  I think I have given you ample explanations. 
Q.	Can you mark it on that photograph with a cross, where you say your sister's room was, please?  We will give you a pen, if you don't have one.  Thank you.  
A.	Can I put that cross on the picture which is in the bundle that I have before me?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	I am going to put a mark on the photograph showing the back part of the maternity.  
Q.	Once you have made up your mind whether it is at the front or the back, will you please put a mark?  
A.	She -- it was here.  It was from here that I can identify -- from this window that I can identify the place where she was.  
Q.	You have marked that.  And can I have my book back, please, as well.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Madam Witness, for doing that.  Can I ask you to mark it with a clear cross?  There is no mark that I can see on the photograph.  

For the record, you have put a cross on the top of the lower window, second in from the right on the back, facing the back of the maternity block.  And while we are looking at that, can we just be clear because a moment ago, you told us that your sister's room looked out over the front of the maternity.  Did you change your evidence?  
A.	No, I have changed nothing.  
Q.	Why did you say your sister's room looked out over the front of the maternity just a minute or two ago?  What's your --
A.	From the situation of the maternity there are windows behind and in front, and I have shown you -- I have indicated -- I have put a mark on the window that faces the back and which is where my elder sister was.  
Q.	Thank you for doing that.  And so we are clear, this is not in the basement or a basement; it is on the ground floor as you enter from the rear of the maternity wing; is that correct?  
A.	No, the basement is indicated by the small window that you have below, but my sister was in one of the rooms on the ground floor, that is, you see the windows at the middle.  
Q.	Thank you very much.
MR. HOOPER:
And can that be an exhibit please, the marked photograph of the -- photocopy of the photograph of the rear of the maternity where this witness's cross is indicating her sister's room or ward as Exhibit D. 52.
MR. FRY:
D. 52, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, Exhibit D. 52.  
(Exhibit No. D. 52 admitted)  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you know someone called Esperance Mukamurenzi, Esperance Mukamurenzi?  
A.	I do not know that person.  
Q.	A Tutsi lady who was at the maternity at this time, ever come across her while you were there?  
A.	How could I meet her if I didn't know her?  
Q.	You arrived on the 17th or 18th of April.  How long after your arrival did your brother arrive at the hospital?  
A.	I did not keep count of the days.  We used to just see the days go by, we no longer had any notion of time.  
Q.	Well, you have been very specific with us as far as dates are concerned.  When did your brother arrive, please?  
A.	Have I stated it somewhere?  If you don't see such a date anywhere, this is because I don't know exactly at what time he arrived, be it the date or the hour.  
Q.	All right.  How many days was your brother there before he was taken away?  
A.	I have just addressed your question.  We were not in a position to count the days.  The days came one after the other.  In any case, I do recall that it was raining and as far as that detail is concerned, I am very certain about it.  
Q.	When it was raining, was he taken away on the first day that he arrived at the hospital?  
A.	No, he stayed at the hospital for some days.  He wasn't taken away on the day of his arrival.  
Q.	I am going to pass you up a copy of our page 47, which is a sketch of Butare hospital, as we believe it existed then, save for one building which we know about, and I want you to look at that.  This is going to help you, I hope, with the sketch because you may not be familiar with sketches.  Can you indicate on this plan the ward where your brother was?  Did your brother have a bed?  
A.	Yes, he had a bed.  
Q.	You can't help us as to how many other patients or beds there were in his ward, I suppose, can you?  
A.	I was unable to count them.  Listen, in 2003 when I came to testify in this trial, I did not recognise this diagram or sketch; it is a rather complex diagram for me.  There is nothing I can say about it.  I cannot recognise the position of certain things in this diagram.  I, therefore, have no comments to make thereon.  
Q.	Can I just pass you up a photograph and ask you if you recognise what part of the hospital that is, and, if so, whether it represents the surgical wards or not, as in 1994.
MS. FALL:
Counsel, a question please, was that picture taken in 1994?  

MR. HOOPER:
Obviously not.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you recognise that part of the hospital?  
A.	I can see the physiotherapy room.  It is the only room that I can identify here. 
Q.	And what are those long buildings in the photograph?  What do they represent?  
A.	If I try to understand and unless I am mistaken, I can say that my brother was in the building which is rather near the physiotherapy room.  
Q.	Well, if you are confident in that answer, can you put a cross on the place where his ward is, approximately, a big cross that we can see?  Thank you very much.  
A.	Since the photograph does not show other buildings well, I would like to tell you that you can't really see the buildings as they are today.  
Q.	Then lay that photograph aside and let me have it back.  We can all follow the sketch.  And I appreciate you may have difficulty with it, but, am I right in saying this -- are you listening to me please, Madam Witness?  
A.	Yes, I am hearing you very well, Counsel.  
Q.	We have hospitalisation wards marked and between maternity -- the maternity wing and the chapel and we have got them clearly indicated on our sketch plan.  
A.	Yes, I can see that clearly.
Q.	And as I understand, one of these wards is for women and one of them is for men.  Is the one for men the one that is nearer to maternity or is it the one that is nearer to the pediatrics ward?  
A.	The reason why this sketch is very complex for me is that there is a surgical unit that is assigned to men and another to women.  It is not easy to see this on this sketch unless I were to be allowed to use my own words to describe them.  
Q.	Well, we know where the surgery is because we have that indicated at number 8 on the plan, which is by the side of the big open area where we understand there were very many refugees kept there in tents and sheeting.  Is that where the surgery ward was that your brother was admitted to or is it somewhere else?  
A.	My brother was not in the -- surgery. 
Q.	You tell us in your own words where he was, *************************************, so you help us.  Where was he?  Let's imagine that you start at the entrance to the hospital where the administration block is and you walk in, where do you go to get to your brother's ward?  
A.	I am going to try because the sketch does not show where the women's room was or where the men's room was, but I can show you the location where I believe was the precise place of the building in which my brother was.  In order to make things easy for you, I can put a mark on the building. 
Q.	Yes, please.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  As that is coming up, perhaps I should just deal with this because we are breaking off, I think, any moment now.  
For the record, you've, marked -- you've put a cross on hospitalisation ward marked number 11, the longest of those blocks and you've put a mark on the bottom left-hand corner of that hospitalisation ward which is next to number 9, pediatrics.  So it is on the bottom, left-hand corner of hospitalisation ward marked as number 11 of which there are three on the plan, it is the one closest to pediatrics.  Thank you very much.  

And finally, as that's going out, Madam Witness, can I ask you this.  Before we rose this morning, I provided you with a piece of paper and I invited you to write down the other names of the people in respect of whom you were providing information in Gacaca proceedings.  Did you manage to write any names down for us or not?  
A.	I did not write down any names because the person against whom I gave evidence -- well, there was very little that I said about that person.  I just said he took part at meetings referred to as the crisis committee.  I didn't deem it necessary to write down his name on a piece of paper because I didn't say much about him.  
Q.	All right.  Can you tell us his name now just before we rise for lunch?  Thank you.
A.	That man is a medical doctor and his name was 
François Ngabonziza, N-G-A-B-O-N-Z-I-Z-A. 
Q.	Thank you very much.
MR. HOOPER:
That is all of my questions for the morning, and may that last marked plan be D. 53, please?  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence D. 53. 
(Exhibit No. D. 53 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will now take a break for lunch.  During this adjournment, as in all other adjournments, you still remain a witness and you are not to discuss the case with anybody; do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I won't discuss with any person, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court recessed at 1237H)
(Pages 23 to 33 by Sithembiso Moyo)





(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MS. FALL:
(No interpretation) 

He said that -- he invited us to come and inspect the exhibits.  I'm sorry, but I didn't want to react immediately, because I thought that maybe I had forgotten.  But I also see the opportunity of the break to do all the necessary verifications, and I would also like to ask Mr. Hooper to tell us at what moment or reference of a document of any invitation was given to come and inspect the exhibits. 

I think this is something which is important for us, because we waited for him to do so.  He didn't do it.  His reason why up to this date we do not have any document that was given to us by the Defence, I think that obligations are reciprocal.  And I would also like to invite Mr. Hooper to tell me at what time we had to -- he did this invitation.  At no time am I saying -- that is why I didn't want to -- to take the floor because I wanted to make sure that I wasn't wrong. 

We did all the necessary verifications; we don't have any reference whatsoever of any invitation that was done by the Defence to come and inspect the exhibits. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, when I referred to that this morning, I was specifically talking of the photographs.  And I don't know in that context whether that is a matter that's in dispute. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that when -- if there was a decision taken by the Bench, that documents should be mutually disclosed -- both the Defence and Prosecution.  I believe, that as far as we are concerned, we respected that decision.  We were waiting to be invited to come and inspect the documents in their possession.  To date, nothing has been done and this morning when learned counsel spoke and I asked why a bundle of documents was disclosed to us this morning, apart from the photos, I asked -- it was the first question I put as to why those documents were disclosed to us only at that time.  I think we can check the transcript, and Counsel Hooper responded by saying, "We invited the Prosecutor to come and inspect our documents and, to date, no one has come," and I think that's the problem.

I didn't want to intervene because I wanted to make all the necessary verifications to be sure what I was saying.  But unless Counsel Hooper can refer to a communication, we have not been invited to inspect the exhibits and the documents -- the documents in the Defence's possession. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I stand by what I understood I said this morning, that dealing solely with the photographs, and that's all I dealt with this morning directly, that the photographs have always been here for inspection.  And I've carried them around and I've even been with the Prosecution with the photographs and offered them.  There's been no interest expressed in the photographs. 

In respect of documents that I'll come to shortly this afternoon, I explained this morning that those documents were only translated yesterday and, in fact, last night.  And it's only with those translations and with a clear appreciation of what they say that the Defence have been moved to decide to use them, and it's at that point of an intention to use, that the disclosure rule comes into operation.  And I've disclosed them.  I've disclosed them in two languages -- three languages, and that's my position. 

We'll come to these particular documents shortly and the Chamber will perhaps be better placed to appreciate the position that I'm -- I'm expressing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It hadn't occurred to me that Ms. Fall was making an application.  I thought she was rebutting a comment that you had made this morning.  I'm not certain.  Is there -- was there an application made this morning? 
MR. HOOPER:
If there's a rebuttal, it's on -- it's on a misunderstanding of what I said this morning.  I -- I have never said -- and I've never said that the Prosecution were invited to inspect the documents.  I've only said that they've been invited to inspect the photographs, and it was in the context of the photographs being produced this morning that the Prosecution raised this matter. 

They also then referred to documents and I've done my best this morning and, again now, to explain what the position is in respect of those.  And I fear it's just another mis -- one of these misunderstanding that arises between us. That I'm certainly not suggesting that I've made a specific invitation to Ms. Fall or the Prosecution to come and inspect documents; that's not the case. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think you've always told us here that the problem of disclosure was an important problem in your eyes, and each time you've asked us to comply with the rules.  We have done so.  I consider this (unintelligible) as a serious problem and it is important that Counsel Hooper sees it likewise.  

Regarding the pictures, indeed, Counsel Hooper carries many photos with him -- not saying that he wished to enter them as evidence.  He can show us pictures in as much as a tourist might show you, "Here's a photograph of the hospital."  But at no time did he invite us to come and inspect the photographs, and I do not think there is any misunderstanding on my part because this morning when he showed the photograph, I responded by saying that we had documents disclosed to us this morning and why therefore don't you disclose these documents much earlier to us. 

He responded that, "We had invited the Prosecution to come and invite -- inspect the documents, but no one came."  I think this is established and I should like to ask the Chamber to invite Counsel Hooper to also comply with the ruling that you made on the reciprocity of disclosure.  And if it's a question of making an official request, we can do so.  We have always tried to settle problems by agreeing, but this is a problem that perhaps has been taken too lightly by Counsel Hooper because the obligation lies with them on that side, and I should like them to understand that it is a reciprocal obligation. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I appreciate the reciprocity point, and I hope I've met it. 

With the Court's leave, can I recommence -- sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think that the matter has been elucidated, so we now have an appreciation on what has transpired in this matter.  At this stage, I don't think it's necessary for the Bench to make any additional rulings in addition to those that we've already made on this issue. 

So I invite Mr. Hooper to continue his cross-examination. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In your evidence yesterday, Madam Witness, you said, and I quote: "At the hospital, I -- I witnessed -- I witnessed terrible massacres"; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How many massacres did you witness? 
A.	Could you repeat the question, I don't fully understand it. 
Q.	How many massacres did you witness at the hospital? 
A.	You -- are you referring to the number of times I saw André Rwamakuba? 
Q.	No, just how many massacres did you witness at the hospital? 
A.	I didn't count the number of times. 
Q.	In your first statement you refer to killings -- or selection, rather, of people in order to -- to kill them and you say the people with André Rwamakuba and Dr. Gatera carried clubs and hoes.  There were many of them; they were wearing civilian clothes.  And you add, "They opened up the pregnant women".  Is -- is that something you saw? 
A.	Let us make a correction first in what you just said.  You spoke of hoes -- used hoes or small hoes.  They weren't small hoes, they were small hatchets.  And as to opening up the pregnant women, disemboweling the pregnant women, I witnessed it myself. 
Q.	Yes, and that's just something you forgot to tell us about in your evidence, is it? 
A.	No, I haven't forgotten that detail. 
Q.	And -- and when you last gave evidence you forgot about it then, didn't you?  And you were asked about it later, in fact, by me and you then remembered it again like you've done today.  And this was something that was done with André Rwamakuba, is that right -- and Dr. Gatera, is that right? 
A.	But that is not what I have stated. 
Q.	How could you forget to mention such a thing if it ever happened? 
A.	I did not forget to mention it yesterday.  I answered all the Prosecutor's questions and I was only answering the questions that were put to me. 
Q.	Well, can you tell this Chamber when you witnessed such a thing, please? 
A.	As I told you, we were not paying attention to dates.  The days followed one another and resembled each other, so I did not note the date.  But I was a witness of the genocide perpetrated at the hospital as others indeed were, but I did not note that detail. 
Q.	You didn't note that detail, the disemboweling of pregnant women.  Where did that take place? 
A.	You are saying I did not note that detail, no, that was not what I said.  Put questions to me, but do respect my answers. 
Q.	Where did that take place? 
A.	At the maternity ward. 
Q.	Was that the ward where your sister was? 
A.	Quite. 
Q.	Was this before she was taken away? 
A.	When that happened, she was still there. 
Q.	Why is this not mentioned in any of your statements except in passing in your first statement? 
A.	But how do you want it to -- I've already mentioned it and I mentioned it in my written statement.  I think it could not be more obvious, and I have no further details to add. 
Q.	And how many pregnant women did you witness being disemboweled in your sister's hospital ward, please? 
A.	I told you that you should not insist on figures.  During the genocide, we didn't count the number of deaths.  I told you we could not pay attention to all that.  We saw the genocide unfolding and it -- we were incapable of taking note of the minutest details -- the smallest details. 
Q.	This is not a small detail, is it?  How many women did you see disemboweled? 
A.	But I have just answered that I didn't count the number of women.  I think you're putting a new -- the same question and you are always coming back to that question. I propose that we turn the page. 
Q.	You say you saw Rwamakuba on the 20th for the first time or maybe the 21st -- whichever.  When was this disemboweling in relation to that, please? 
A.	I told you that the genocide was not a happy time and we were not concerned with counting the dates or the number of deaths. 
Q.	You've -- you've never mentioned before anyone being disemboweled in the ward where your sister was at all, have you? 
A.	What do you mean? 
Q.	How many times altogether in the time you were in the hospital did you see André Rwamakuba?  On how many occasions? 
A.	I saw him three times.  First, and then I saw him once more when he was going to the plastic tents.  I saw him first in the morning, then I saw him in the afternoon. 
Q.	So you saw him what, once on one day?  Was that in the maternity, the first time you saw him? 
A.	Yes, I saw him at the maternity. 
Q.	And -- and is that the time you saw him in the morning and then later you saw him a second time in the afternoon?  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	The first time I saw him in the morning and the second time was in the afternoon. 
Q.	And where did you see him the second time in the afternoon?  What was he doing on that second occasion? 
A.	Would you please repeat the question.  Do you say that -- what did you say I saw him do? 
Q.	No, you saw him in the morning in maternity and then you told us you saw him in the afternoon of that same day.  What was he doing that afternoon? 
A.	In the afternoon, he was in the ward. 
Q.	Which ward, please?
A.	And he was asking patients to get up, and the idea was that these sick people would be put into a vehicle. 
Q.	All right.  So that second time you saw him in the afternoon, which ward was that, please? 
A.	I saw him moving about in the surgery. 
Q.	So the first time you see him is in the morning in maternity, and the second time you see him he's moving about in the surgery ward telling patients to get up in order to be put in the motor vehicle.  Have I got that right? 
A.	No, that is not what I have just said.  He was not talking to the patients.  He went into the surgery, he found the patients who were there and he hit with a hatchet a man who was lying on a bed, a man who was ill. Then, he placed his foot on the nape of a man who was there.  Then he got these patients out, he delivered them over to the Interahamwe who put them in a small truck. 
Q.	So that's what he did in the afternoon on the second occasion that you saw him.  What did he do on the first occasion that morning, which you told us was in maternity, what did he do then? 
A.	He was ordering the sick women in the -- in this ward to get up and he delivered these women over to the Interahamwe who got them out of the ward.  And at that time he was in the company of Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	And was your sister taken that time or not? 
A.	Be so kind as to repeat your question. 
Q.	I think you heard it.  Was your sister taken on that occasion or not? 
A.	No, she was not taken away on that day. 
Q.	So that's our first and second occasion seeing Rwamakuba.  Which was the third occasion, please? 
A.	On the third occasion -- when I saw him on the third occasion he was in the maternity ward as well. 
Q.	And what was he doing? 
A.	He was ordering the patients to get up and he was delivering them over to the Interahamwe.  These patients were Tutsis and the Interahamwe to whom he delivered them over, put them in a small truck. 
Q.	Was your sister taken on that occasion? 
A.	I told you that it is not on that day -- the day on which I saw André Rwamakuba, it was not on that day that my sister was taken away. 
Q.	No.  When you told me that, you were talking about the first time you'd seen André Rwamakuba in maternity. You then had a second occasion you saw him in relation to the ward and the hatchet.  You're -- you're now talking, as you know, of the third occasion that you saw him, which was again, you told us, in maternity and I'm asking you is that the occasion that he took your sister away or had her taken away.  What is it? 
A.	Yes, that is when he asked my sister to get out of bed and he gave her over to the Interahamwe who were there, and my sister was taken away with her baby. 
Q.	And that's something you saw, is it? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And tell me about your brother, did you see him taken away? 
A.	Yes, I witnessed that. 
Q.	Was that the same day or a different day that your sister was taken away? 
A.	No, it was not the same day. 
Q.	Was it before or after your sister was taken away? 
A.	He was taken the second time around -- that is the one that we've just referred to.  It was in the afternoon. 
Q.	When you say "the second time around," do you mean the same day as your sister was taken or not? 
A.	I told you that I saw the Accused the first time at the maternity, and that it was in the maternity ward.  I also told you that when I saw him for the second time it was in the place referred to as the surgery, and it was in the afternoon, and so it was to this second occasion that I was referring when I mentioned my brother. 
Q.	Well, I didn't understand you to say that.  You told us that -- I don't think you told us that your brother was taken away on that second occasion when the people were hit with the axe.  Is that what you're saying happened?  That your brother was taken the afternoon that you now say Rwamakuba hit the man in bed with the axe?  Is it your brother was taken at that time, is that your evidence now? 
A.	Yes, it was on that occasion that my brother was forced to get out of bed and delivered over to the Interahamwe who took him away. 
Q.	And -- and was that before or after the man had been hit with the axe by Rwamakuba? 
A.	It was at the same time.  The man who was hit with the hatchet was taken away at the same time as my brother. 
Q.	All right.  So now, on your evidence, we have the first visit in the maternity; the second visit in surgery; and the third occasion is in maternity when André Rwamakuba also directs the taking away of your sister.  How long was it between your brother being taken away and your sister subsequently being taken away?  Is it one day or more than one day? 
A.	But you yourself can do the calculation, Counsel.  If you take an afternoon right up to the morning of the next day, you yourself, can do the calculation, I'm sure.  Between the afternoon and what -- of one day and the morning of another, there's only one night that separates them.  I think you should try and follow me. 
Q.	Well, I'm doing my best, I can assure you that, and I think we now have this picture from you.  In the morning, in maternity, you first see André Rwamakuba.  That afternoon, you see him in surgery hitting a man with the axe, standing on another man's nape of his neck and ordering the taking away of your brother.  The next morning, you see him in maternity ordering and effecting the taking away of -- of your sister. 
A.	You seemed to pause in your question.  I think perhaps you should re -- you should ask the question again so that I can follow what it is that you mean. 
Q.	I don't think I need to.  I think we've heard your evidence and I was merely encapsulating it, I think, fairly.  If I've not done it fairly, I'm sure my learned friend would be correcting me.  

So when did you see him going to the tents?  When did you see him going to the tents to talk to the refugees there or doing something with the refugees there? 
A.	When he left the surgery, he went up towards the place where the refugees were in front of the pediatrics ward -- that is between the pediatric and the ENT wards.  So I saw the Accused moving about in that space. 
Q.	And when did you see him coming with the hoes or variously axes, when did you see that occasion? 
A.	I don't remember the date. 
Q.	Well, was it on a different day in addition to these three occasions that you say you saw him? 
A.	We saw that hatchets were being taken, but we cannot remember -- I cannot remember whether it was morning or afternoon.  You must understand that it was during the genocide and we felt ourselves to be under threat, so we did not pay attention to what time of the day it was or, indeed, to what day exactly it was. 
Q.	You were asked yesterday, "Did you see him distributing those weapons?"  And you said, "I did not personally see him issuing these weapons."  Is that correct? 
A.	I did not see him distributing the weapons. 
Q.	On a previous occasion, and I'm looking at your transcript of the 11th of December 2003 at page 4, you said, "There were a large number of machetes, he passed them out to the Interahamwe and the employees of the hospital.  I saw it with my own eyes."  Which is it? 
A.	As to the 2003 transcript, I cannot say for sure that you're reading it as it is, especially as you have been trying to twist my words.  In 2003, I appeared as a witness and it became necessary to start the trial anew.  I think now you must ask me questions about this trial instead of trying to sow confusion in my mind. 
Q.	Well, I can assure you I've related what is in the transcript accurately and, first of all, you obviously refer to machetes, not axes; and secondly, you say that with your own eyes you saw him distribute them to Interahamwe and employees, which is different to your evidence now.  Have you changed your evidence? 
A.	No, I think you are putting words into my mouth.  I did not talk about machetes in my testimony; that is not true. 
Q.	I'll read it again to you slowly.  "I saw him when he was going through the faculty.  He was bringing a large number of machetes and a lot of employees.  Those were distributed to the employees of the hospital, so that they could use those machetes inside the hospital."  

It then becomes "hatchets".  You say, "I explained that when he came out with those hatchets he passed them out to the Interahamwe and hospital employees.  There were also soldiers that were based at the ESO.  Those Interahamwe and those employees received those weapons and they used them to kill people within the different areas of the university hospital.

"And that was something you saw?  Yes, with my own eyes.  And were you -- where were you when you saw it?"  And you explained about that. 

So I hope I've read that accurately for you.  Can I come back to your first statement which we dealt with yesterday, and I don't want to go through it again.  In terms of how many times you saw 
André Rwamakuba, you said, "He often came disguised by wearing banana leaves."  Often came.

Now, yesterday you said, well, that's not the case. That's right, isn't it?  You don't accept now that you ever spoke of banana leaves -- let alone that he came often in them.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Even in 2003 I did not say that.  The investigators made a mistake.  I said that I saw him with banana leaves. 
Q.	Well, you say that but, you see, in your second statement the one you like, at page HF-14 you say this: "I, however, remember seeing on several occasions Dr. Rwamakuba and Dr. Gatera, the latter died last year in hospital in Kigali whilst in prison, together wearing banana leaves of the Interahamwe within the hospital premises. This dress was usually followed by killings."  

So it's not just in your first statement that you don't like that you say it, but it's also quite clearly said in your second statement that you do like.  So in two statements -- your first and second -- you make a clear reference to seeing André Rwamakuba on several occasions wearing banana leaves.  Can you explain that, please? 
A.	I do not admit this.  Even during a hearing in 2003, I said that the investigators had made a mistake.  That I -- I had never seen him carrying or wearing banana leaves.  Actually, I only saw him wearing a gown, which is usually referred to as an apron. 
Q.	You saw him in an apron, did you, and that is all you ever saw him in you're now saying; is that right? 
A.	He was wearing this coat or gown and black boots. 
Q.	Now, the black boots, did you see Gatera wearing black boots as well? 
A.	Yes, he was. 
Q.	In your statement, your first statement, apart from talking about he often came disguised in banana leaves, you then say, "He seldom came in his doctor's coat". 
A.	Actually what it was was a doctor's coat. 
Q.	You said, "He often came in the morning and at times in the afternoon"; is that right? 
A.	This is what I just explained to you. 
Q.	In December of 2003, you said this, "He came almost all the time.  He was almost always there"; is that right? 
A.	You mean almost all the time?  I don't quite follow you. 
Q.	Well, I'm looking at page 61 of your transcript, the English version of your transcript and you were asked this question:  "At what time of day did André Rwamakuba arrive at the hospital?  Answer:  He came almost all the time.  He was almost always there."  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	When you say each time, is it morning or afternoon?  If he came in -- on two succeeding days, morning and afternoon, isn't that almost every time?  I've -- I've already explained to you when he came. 
Q.	Later in that transcript, you were asked to state specifically how many times you saw him and you say this at page 61, "I would say I saw him on two occasions."  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	I did not see him only on two occasions; I do not remember saying that. 
Q.	You were asked yesterday, "Would you be in a position to recognise André Rwamakuba?"  What's your answer to that? 
A.	I can recognise him. 
Q.	Because in December 2003, you were asked this question:  Question:  "Would you be in a position to recognise André Rwamakuba if you had an opportunity to see him today?"  Answer:  "I would not."  So what has changed between then and now? 
A.	This is what I -- has changed, as I explained yesterday.  I was 19-years-old.  Anyone who saw me at that time would not be able to recognise me today.  You, for example, you have changed since when you were an adolescent; that is what I mean. 
Q.	No, that doesn't make sense, does it?  You were asked the same question -- exactly the same question on two different occasions and you've given completely different answers.  In 2003, you were saying clearly given the opportunity, "I wouldn't be able to recognise him."   Yesterday and today you say, "Yes I would."  You give different answers on different occasions to the same question, don't you? 
A.	I can recognise him. 
Q.	Right, so we now have a clearer view of what you're trying to say in evidence -- namely, that on the first day you saw him, you saw him first of all in the morning in maternity and that afternoon you saw him in the surgery ward.  And the next day in the morning, he was in maternity again, taking away your sister. 

Now, you told us that you saw him the first time three days after you arrived in the hospital, which is either the 20th, if you get there on the 17th, or it's the 21st, if you get there on the 18th.  So the first time you saw André Rwamakuba in maternity was three days after you got to the hospital; is that correct? 
A.	I did not get to the hospital on the 17th, I got there on the 18th. 
Q.	All right.  On the 18th -- that's all right, so we're talking about the 21st that you see André Rwamakuba the first time, and that afternoon he takes away your brother; is that right? 
A.	Yes, an afternoon. 
Q.	And the next morning, he takes away your sister; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And so what are you saying?  That you then spent a week at the hospital until the 29th, more than that even, before you leave?  A week -- nine days after your sister's gone -- eight days, sorry, after your sister's gone; is that right? 
A.	I told you that I did not pay attention to dates.  I gave you the date on which I left the hospital, otherwise I'm not aware -- I cannot tell the date on which my sister was taken away. 
Q.	Well, you just have.  She was taken away the day after you first saw André Rwamakuba taken away in the morning, and the latest time you've ever said that you saw Rwamakuba was the 21st.  So she's taken away on the 22nd.  Your brother, the day before that, both at André Rwamakuba's instigation.  And yet you've told us you spent most of your time next to your sister -- next to your sister's bed in maternity.  That's where you slept and stayed.  It doesn't fit, does it?  Your story doesn't fit. 
A.	I used to stay in the maternity sometimes, but I could move, I was not immobile at the maternity. 
Q.	Where were you -- where were you the first time you saw André Rwamakuba?  Where were you? 
A.	I was in the maternity ward. 
Q.	Were you with your sister? 
A.	Could you repeat the question, please?  
Q.	Were you with your sister? 
A.	I was not with her.  Had I been with her, I would be dead. 
Q.	No, the first day you saw André Rwamakuba, not the day your sister was taken away, the first day you saw him, where were you?  You said you were in maternity, where were you? 
A.	I was in the maternity ward. 
Q.	Well, I just -- were you with your sister?  That's the question I just asked you.  
A.	I was not near to her. 
Q.	Where were you? 
A.	How can I tell you where I was?  If you come to Butare, I can show you the place where I was and the place where my sister was, but in this Trial Chamber I don't know I can show you. 
Q.	Just explain to us, the first time you saw André Rwamakuba you were in maternity, where were you? 
A.	Since yesterday -- such question was put to me yesterday, I answered it.  This morning, I answered the question.  I've just answered it.  Counsel, I was the witness of the genocide.  Were you a witness?  Try and put yourself in my shoes. 
Q.	Well, Madam Witness, last time, please.  When you first saw André Rwamakuba, where were you? 
A.	But I said -- I have said I was in the maternity ward. 
Q.	Can we come to the second occasion that you saw him, which you now tell us was the afternoon of the first day that you saw Rwamakuba; is that correct? 
A.	I did not fully understand the question. 
Q.	The second time you saw him, I think you told us, was the afternoon of the first day you saw him; is that right? 
A.	That is what I have said and it's not by getting me to repeat it that I will forget it, which, I think, is your purpose. 
Q.	It's getting you to answer the questions and not put words in your mouth that I'm seeking to -- to do.  Were you in the surgery ward itself or were you outside the ward where these events took place? 
A.	I was outside in the corridor, but we could see what was going on inside because the doors were open. 
Q.	Now, when you say a corridor, do you mean a corridor that's outside in the fresh air or is it a corridor within the building? 
A.	I was in the corridor on which the surgical ward lies, where patients were receiving intensive care. 
Q.	And how long had your brother been at the hospital by then? 
A.	I told you that I did -- I was not paying attention to the number of days that past.  It was not a happy time; it was wartime.  I cannot tell you how many days had past there. 
Q.	Well, you go to the hospital to look after your sister. The killings don't start until about the 20th, and you see Rwamakuba, you tell us, the next day on the 21st in the morning and now in the afternoon.  So you've been in the hospital three days.  How long has your brother been in the hospital by then?  Because he's taken away that day, isn't he, according to you?  How long has he been in the hospital by then? 
A.	I told you that I was not paying attention so as to know the number of days he spent at the hospital.  
	It was not a time -- it was not a happy time. 
Q.	Well, of course, it was a terrible time.  But can't you tell us even if he'd been there a day or more than a day?  Can't you tell us whether he was there very shortly after you arrived?  You see, if the killings didn't start until the 20th and he's attacked and injured -- I assume he was attacked on the 20th or so?  That would be right, wouldn't it?  So he'd only be in the hospital for about a day before he's taken away.  Does that seem right to you, he's only there for about a day? 
A.	I did not say that he was wounded at the hospital.  When he came to the hospital, as I told you yesterday, he had already been wounded and he came for treatment -- to be treated at the hospital, and he was admitted to the surgical ward. 

Now, if you haven't understood my answer, you can ask me to repeat it and I will repeat it.  I understand that that is -- that is how you proceed. 
Q.	All right.  Well, now this story of seeing Rwamakuba hit a man who is in bed with an axe, you told us you were -- well, very close to that and you saw it.  Was there much blood? 
A.	But the question is a simple one.  When someone is wounded, they bleed.  Even if you are wounded with a razor blade you will bleed.  So I think that it is a very simple matter -- a very easy matter. 
(Pages 34 to 45 by Jean Baigent)


























1515H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, that may be as a conclusion, I'm asking you, did you see much blood or any blood? 
A.	The man did bleed.  If you are hit with a sharp instrument, you bleed, it's normal. 
Q.	Is that something you saw? 
A.	Yes, I did witness that. 
Q.	You see, on a previous occasion when you were asked, "Did you notice any blood?"  You said, "I did not pay any attention".  So this is again a different answer, isn't it, to one you have previously given? 
A.	No, there is no difference between the two answers. 
Q.	What did they do with that man's body, do you know? 
A.	His body was loaded onto a red pickup. 
Q.	And what happened to it? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Oh, sorry, the microphone wasn't on.  
THE WITNESS: 
I said the corpse was loaded onto a red pickup truck parked outside the maternity ward.  And if you don't understand, I can repeat.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You see, on a previous occasion, you said, "They put the body -- his body in a pit behind the maternity wing.  Yes, I saw that with my own eyes."  Did you see that with your own eyes? 
A.	I have the impression that you are pushing very far with your questions.  I saw the corpse when it was loaded on the pickup.  Otherwise, I don't know where you are getting your questions from. 
Q.	Well, it's your answers, you see.  You've said previously that you actually saw the body put in a pit with your own eyes, page 7 on the 11th of December.  Did you say that? 
A.	You put questions that are not relevant.  If the questions were relevant, this trial would have -- we would not have to have restarted this trial. 
Q.	You say that he attacked one man with an axe and another man he stood on the nape of his neck.  Again, on a previous occasion, did you say, page 24 of the 11th of December:  "I witnessed the execution of only one person.  I told you I witnessed the killing of only one person."  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	I did not speak of only one person, but two men. 
Q.	Much later, you were taken by another lawyer through your statement where you referred to two men and you then remembered and you said, oh yes, there was a second man.  Now, yesterday you said, "These men were dead, you can tell."  Do you remember saying again on a previous occasion, "I don't know whether they were dead or alive"?  Page 51 of the 11th of December.  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, I remember that. 
Q.	So, is the -- is it the situation that you knew they were dead or that you couldn't tell? 
A.	When that person was stamped on his neck, he was passed to an Interahamwe and they gave him a chop with a hatchet, and another one was handed over to the Interahamwe.  To tell you the truth I did not approach the corpses to see whether they were completely dead, but I saw that when they were passed to the Interahamwe, that they took them down the corridor -- across the corridor to load them on the pickup parked in front of the maternity ward, which is I think -- what I think I told you. 
Q.	Can I come back to your brother and sister?  In your first statement, HF-5, you say, "I no longer recall the names of the victims at the hospital."  Can you remember saying that? 
A.	I mean those two men. 
Q.	No, no, this was a general comment you made.  You hadn't mentioned in your first statement anything about your brother and sister and at the end of it you say, "I no longer remember the names of the victims, victims at the hospital."  Do you remember saying that in your first statement? 
A.	No, I did not say that. 
Q.	Well, it's in your statement, madam.  But, anyway, now you tell us -- you've explained how, first of all, your brother, on the first day, is taken at André Rwamakuba's instruction and then your sister the next morning.  Do you remember saying this, and this is in your second statement, and this is the first mention you make of them in your second statement, you say:  "They were both killed and taken away in the same pickup."  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	There was only one pickup to transport those people.  They would go and come.  We did not see any vehicle -- any other colour.  You must remember the colour of the vehicle of which we are speaking. 
Q.	And then in your most recent statement, the 12th March 2003, signed, corrected by you, and later agreed with by you, you say this, I will read the context:  "I managed to escape the killings again because I hid in small rooms inside the maternity ward for several days."  And now, this is the relevant part -- "My sister, her new-born baby, and my brother ********* -- sorry, I won't pronounce the whole name, you give the full name there -- "also admitted to the hospital for injuries sustained from attacks on Sahera hills, were killed in their hospital beds."  That's HF-31, "killed in their hospital beds."  Is that correct? 
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	But it's in your statement, "killed in their hospital beds."  How did it come to be in your signed statement? 
A.	Which statement are you talking of?  
Q.	The statement of March 2003.  How does it say -- how did it come to read that they were killed in their hospital beds, agreed and signed by you?  
A.	But, Counsel, do you think they had the same problem at the hospital?  One of them was injured, the other had come to give birth.  So how could they be in the same ward?  
Q.	No, "both were killed in their hospital beds."  If that can be translated, please:  "Both were killed in their hospital beds."  
A.	They were killed at the hospital, but they were not in the same bed. 
Q.	I thought you told us they were taken away to be killed? 
A.	No, they didn't kill them elsewhere.  My big sister was taken out of the maternity; my brother was taken out of the surgical ward.  They weren't taken away the same day as I explained before. 
Q.	On a previous occasion, you said, "They were both taken on the same day."  That's at page 11 of the 11th of December.  "They were both taken on the same day."  You corrected that much later, page 53 of the 11th of December, to another story where you said, "No, first of all, my sister was taken, and then my brother the following day," which of course is a different order and yet another story that you've told this Chamber this afternoon.  
A.	I have not said anything different.  I am telling you about events to which I was an eyewitness. 
Q.	Now, you gave evidence in the Gatera case, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, I gave testimony at that trial. 
Q.	And I have a document that was served on us by the Prosecution, which is your statement made for that case, the procés verbal, dated the ********************* '98.  And we have copies in English and French and Kinyarwanda, and I think it's right you should have a Kinyarwanda document and the other documents can be distributed, including to the booths, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, the history here, Mr. President, was that these were served by the Prosecution on us but not translated until, I think, Thursday or Friday, when we received a French translation, which, on inspection, it was our view, was inadequate.  The document you are getting that's in French will have handwriting on it where it's been corrected -- at least we believe it's been corrected to more accurately reflect the Kinyarwanda.  The English consequently follows that French translation.  The Kinyarwanda is, of course, remains in its original format and you would see that that's a handwritten format.  I have not received an English translation from the Prosecution. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I would like to ask the source of the translation Mr. Hooper is referring to because the translation that we furnished was an official translation of this Tribunal.  I would like to know then who did Mr. Hooper's translation.  As you will notice, the translation that we disclosed is an official translation.  We therefore object to Mr. Hooper's own translation being taken account of.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, first of all, if there is any dispute on the translation my friend can advance her version in due course.  Secondly, in terms of who translated it, it was translated by a man called Celestin Bahuru, who is an investigator, or the investigator in our case.  He is a member of the bar in Rwanda, and he's made a declaration as to the authenticity of his translation.  And it's then been translated from the -- from his French, translated by him from Kinyarwanda into English.  The corrections appear plainly on the Prosecution's tendered translation.  

We are confident that our translation is correct, and if there is any point to be taken, and, in fact, in the context, I don't think there is any particular significant point on translation, then, as I say, that can be taken up by the Prosecution in due course.  My friend will have her opportunity in re-examination of course.  So if I can press on with the limited time I've got.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. Hooper, I'm sorry, when I get up to object, please, have the same courtesy as I do to sit down because when you stand up, I sit down immediately.  

Mr. President, I would like you to judge between a certified official translator of the Tribunal and a Defence translator who has not been certified.  I think I will leave the choice to the Trial Chamber.  However, the question I'd like to put to Mr. Hooper is as follows:  Is his translator certified as an official translator by this Tribunal?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm afraid he isn't.  We can do this the other way through the booth.  So we'll -- I'm going to read from my English version, and if we have any difficulties with it, when we come to those parts where there is a handwritten part of the French, we can correct it with the booth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you start, Mr. Hooper -- Witness, you would like to say something?  Witness, you've been trying to attract my attention.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, it seems to me that Defence counsel is trying to play tricks in this matter, because I have the impression that my signature was imitated and he should be prosecuted for fraud.  That is not my signature on the document.  That is not how I sign.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we have given you a free amount of freedom here today, but do not get out of bounds.  Do you understand me now?  There are certain levels of behaviour -- 
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I am not going to go out of bounds 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have got out of bounds just now.  I'm just warning you to remember where you are and behave accordingly.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS: 
I have understood you, Mr. President.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Now, I'll proceed and we bear in mind that there is a difference between Mr. Bahu's translation and that of the certificated interpreter or translator here.  Such things can sometimes happen.  They are essentially perhaps minor differences and don't, as we'll see I think, carry or change the sense of what's contained in these documents.  Now -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Mr. Hooper, does the translation booth have a copy of the original Kinyarwanda document?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  Yes, it does.  It may be that as I see the time, if in a moment we are to rise and give an opportunity for the gentleman whose burden it may now be to translate these matters into French at least, and we can follow it in our -- in our documents.  But I just want to ask this witness a few questions about the document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, before we rise.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Indeed.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, you have in your hands a document that you have accused me of forging, but don't worry about that.  This is a document that comes from the Prosecution, all right?  It's been provided by the Prosecution, not by me, by the Prosecution, who obtained it from the Rwandese national authorities, formally produced to them as part of the official documents in the dossier of Dr. Gatera.  Now, you may well be sensitive to this document, but first of all, bearing all that I've said in mind, and bearing in mind you are on oath here, is that your signature at the conclusion of the Kinyarwanda statement underneath the name which is yours?  
A.	Mr. President, this is not my signature.  My signature has been forged. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, we'll bear that in mind, but I'm proffering this document, which has come from the Prosecution, as a genuine document, and in the fullness of time we will have to see whether it is indeed your document or not.  Let's turn, first of all there, to the first page of the document under the words 
	pro justitia.  And you will see there that it certainly appears to be you, will you agree, reading the Kinyarwanda, that refers to you by name; it names your father and mother; it gives your birth year; it gives your secteur, commune, and it states there that you are married to someone whose initials are ****; children are blank; profession is given as employee of a certain institution.  So certainly that -- all those details are correct and refer to you, do they not? 
A.	No, I don't even need to read this document.  It is a fake.  It is not true, so I cannot possibly read such a document. 
Q.	Well, I'm going to read it, and I think it's very important for you to pay careful attention to it.  We've heard what you've said about it.  I remind you this has come not from me; it's come from the Prosecution.  They got it from the procureur general in Rwanda.  Are you accusing the 
	procureur general of Rwanda of forging this document?  Who's forged this document, do you think?  Has the Prosecution forged it? 
A.	I think that since matters stand as they do, this document should be taken back to Rwanda to be examined to establish the truth of the matters described therein.  My view is that this is a fake.  No jurist would ever issue such a document.  It is quite beyond me.  I do not know how such a thing can be done. 
Q.	Right.  Well, let's see what it says, shall we?  And I will read the English -- well, no, I think we better have the booth read it, Mr. Booth -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I see the time.  I've got quite a bit to go, but I will deal with this as quickly as I can. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think we just should take a short break now, very short.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yeah, right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll now take a short adjournment.  
THE WITNESS: 
There is no problem with reading the document.  
(Court recessed at 1546H)
(Pages 46 to 51 by Gifty C. Harding) 





















(Court resumed at 1613H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can resume now.  Mr. Hooper, it seemed clear from the documents that have been tendered that the French version which has officially been certified by the language section, is the official translation for the purposes of our trial.  

Now, the process of complaining about the accuracy of that translation is a process that requires the involvement of the language section and would take some time.  What is being proposed now is that the original Kinyarwanda document, which is the official document, that we get the assistance from someone from the translation booth to read the relevant sections of it in Kinyarwanda, so that there will be a simultaneous translation in the French and English which will form part of our record.  Now, is it possible for you to identify what parts of the document require to be read, and we can have them addressed with the assistance of a representative from the translation booth?
MR. HOOPER:
At this stage for my purposes, I think, yes, I can indicate that we have dealt with the head -- the heading.  I don't think there has been any distribute or is any distribute at all, either linguistically or in any other way as to the formal introduction and the identification of, we would say, this witness, as being the author of the document by way of details.  Perhaps that is something, again, I haven't quite tied the knot on that.  If I can just ask one question of this witness at this stage. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, the details that appear at the beginning of this, in terms of your name, your parents' name, the place where you live and the other details, are those correct as they appear on this document? 
A.	I note that the names are correct, but I do not recognise the rest of this document. 
Q.	But it is right that you gave a statement of this kind, of this category to the prosecutor in Rwanda as part of the Gatera trial; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	There are some things I don't understand in this document because I do not recognise the signature appended to it. 
Q.	Yes.  No, that wasn't my question.  Listen, please, to the question.  Whether this is your document or not, or your signature or not, you do agree that you did provide a statement in the Gatera case.  You provided a statement to the procureur; that is correct, is it not? 
A.	It wasn't the prosecutor who questioned me. 
Q.	Well, which ever officer of the Court it was? 
A.	Yes, I was questioned, but my statement is not the one I see in the document shown to me. 
Q.	Yes, well, we understand what you are saying about that.  And so with the assistance of the interpreter, I understand, Mr. President, that -- and I'm grateful to the booth for their assistance, that one of their number, Kinyarwanda speaking, will descend into the Court and will read -- it is not necessary to read it all at this stage, will read, at my invitation, the question and answer; first question and answer, second question and answer of this document.  

And if the interpreter could come into -- the well of the Court in order to do that, so that he then becomes formally part of, as it were, the transcript; and his colleague can then translate.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I didn't ask you, but I assume you don't have any objection to that procedure. 
MS. FALL: 
No objection, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I don't know whether you need to give your name and rank, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Translator, it would be useful as a preliminary tool to perform this task that you identify yourself and your occupation. 
MR. NTIGURIRWA:
My name is Jean Marie Ntigurirwa, and I'm a translator/interpreter for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, while he is reading I think the witness -- if the registry could turn off the witness's microphone. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Interpreter, Mr. Interpreter, if you could read from the body of the text starting with the first question, which is, my translation; "What is the purpose of your presence here?"  And the answer to that -- and then the next question, "What did you see him do?"  And all of the answer to that until we intervene.  Thank you.  
MR. NTIGURIRWA:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The microphone he is using actually is not working, so he better use the witness's microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registry, could you assist with the microphone?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I wonder if this one might work. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He is listening to the French. 
MR. NTIGURIRWA:
"What is the purpose of your presence here before the prosecution? 

I came to speak of the conduct of Dr. Gatera during the genocide."

Second question, "What did you see him do?"

"Answer: On or about the 22nd or 23rd, I was at the university hospital where I was taking care of my elder sister --" then there is the name of the sister of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- 
MR. NTIGURIRWA:
Who had --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you please wait a moment?  The question that has just been raised is whether -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Hooper's microphone, sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  The question that has just been raised is whether this is a document that is under seal, and when it is being read into the record it should be in closed session, is it -- it is an inquiry,               Madam Prosecutor?  
MR. HOOPER: 
At present I notice that the interpreter, if I may say so, was very alert and stepped over the name of the big sister; and if that could be done, and also the name of the brother who is mentioned later on, if that could be done, as well.  It is not mentioned when you see it in print, and that would be satisfactorily for my purposes.  I can come back to it if I need to in closed session, if I need to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Prosecutor, you agree.  Okay, thank you, very much.

Mr. Interpreter, you understand 
MR. NTIGURIRWA:
Yes, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Please continue. 
MR. NTIGURIRWA:
I will repeat as from the second question:  "What did you see him do? 

Answer: Towards the 22nd or 23rd, I was at the university hospital where I was taking care of my elder sister." We will not read the name of the witness's elder sister.  "Who had given birth to a premature baby.  I then saw Dr. Gatera in the company of a lady, whom I later learned was his sister, writing on a piece of paper the names of the people that were going to be killed.  After a short while, he brought soldiers who were war wounded, who had been admitted to take the people whose -- who were listed, but it was Gatera who selected the victims.  He began with my eldest sister and another lady."  I don't know whether I should quote the name of the lady who was taken away at the same time as the witness's sister.

"He then brought a large number of women and loaded them on a pick up.  He went down towards the surgery where he had my brother removed."  We will not quote the name -- read the name of the brother.  "And put him in that pick up.  I don't know where they were taken.  Only Gatera can answer that question.  I accuse him, also, Dr. Gatera, of carrying also every time a small hatchet grumbling that elsewhere the work had been finished, but that there in that place there were still these Tutsi trash -- dirt.  I accuse him also --  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, very much.  Thank you, very much.  We can see that, and I don't prevent you from reading on, it is just a matter of time.  I think we will get a later time -- opportunity to look at all of the other matters that are in this statement.  For my purposes at the moment he refers then to tents, behaviour in maternity ward, and amputating wounded soldiers` legs later on that didn't need amputation.

Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.  I will probably require you again in ten minutes or so.  Thank you for the time being for your assistance.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter. 
MR. NTIGURIRWA:
I thank you too, Your Honour.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, on your oath is that -- 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, before going onto something else, I should like to know what are the major differences between the translation given today by the interpreter or -- it is important, Mr. President.  We were told that the official translation was not correct which is why we used an interpreter, and -- in the exercise we just accomplished.  And I should like to know what the major differences are. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, for our part we do not want to be involved in an adjudication process between the translations.  If it is necessary to have the translation verified, the procedure that we would like to follow is using the routine of going back through the translation unit.  But I don't think we would want to put ourselves in the position of making the assessment on the quality of the translation.  So, I don't think we should go into that now. 
MS. FALL: 
I won't dwell on it, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, on your oath, did you give that testimony to an official of the court who reduced it into writing in such a statement? 
A.	I made a solemn declaration, and I stressed that I made that solemn declaration to tell the truth.  You have visited my home hill.  I invite you, urge you to go back there and see if the content of my statement is correct.  I have no sister called Mukasanga.  There is a mixture of things in this document.  I don't have any sister named Rose Mukasanga which is why I do not recognise or acknowledge this statement. 
Q.	All right.  Now, dealing with the name Rose Mukasanga which has not been mentioned in open court yet, but there is no difficulty with that because it is not the name of your sister, you tell us.  But tell us this; do you know someone called by that name? 
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, if I can move on because if that statement is yours, it speaks for itself, really.  I want to ask you very briefly about how you say you knew André Rwamakuba.  Now, in your first statement, you said this about the man that came, that you saw, you said, "From hearing so much about him, I started paying attention to him."  All right, that is what you said in your first statement.  Do you want to comment on that at all? 
A.	I did not correctly understand.  Could you please repeat?  
Q.	In your first statement, you said this, of the man who you then called Rwamakuba, André Rwamakuba, you said, "From hearing so much about him, I started paying attention to him." And I have asked you, do you want to comment at all on that statement, in your first statement?  
A.	This is what I have to say, since yesterday I have told you that he was a man -- that there was a man whom I named, who pointed him out to me.  Subsequently, I saw him moving around and I mentioned those wards in which I had seen him.  I spoke to you about that in detail and I do not think I need to come back to it, since yesterday I have been speaking of it. 
Q.	All right.  In your second statement you say this, "I used to see him pass with his axe in his belt.  People whispered that he was leader of the Interahamwe." Did people whisper that he was leader of the Interahamwe?  
A.	Could you repeat the question, please?  
Q.	Did people whisper to you that he was leader of the Interahamwe as he passed you with his axe in his belt? 
A.	Yesterday, I spoke to you of the person who gave me the information; well, it was that person who told me. 
Q.	The question is, did people whisper to you that he was leader of the Interahamwe, as stated in your second statement? 
A.	It is the man whom I mentioned who pointed him out to me.  But as soon as he had told me, I heard other people speaking of him, but no one whispered it in my ear. 
Q.	See, in that statement where you have people whispering in your ear that this man was leader of the Interahamwe, in that same statement, as we have just seen a little while ago, you have him dressed in banana leaves which are, of course, as we all know, something the Interahamwe wore from time to time.  That is right, isn't it? 
A.	No, that is not true.  In 2003 I explained that, and yesterday I did also.  That question was put to me and I have sufficiently explained myself.  I never saw the Accused wearing banana leaves. 
Q.	Now, so far there is absolutely nothing anywhere in your statement about Rwamakuba being a minister in the government, as we know.  And you accept that that is the case.  But your evidence is now that you were told who he was by a man whose name was uttered repeatedly in the course of the last trial, and whose name appears at number 8 on the list.  The only man, in fact, or male on that list, all right.  And you say now, don't you, that you, in fact, heard for the first time the identity by name of the man you call Rwamakuba from that man; that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And I'm just going to read question and answer in respect to -- from the 11th -- sorry, the 11th of December, at page 9 of the transcript: "Question, so, who was the first person to tell you that that man is André Rwamakuba?  Who told that to you?"  And your answer was:  "Its --" and you give the first name of the man.  And you said, "He worked in the surgery ward."  And you said a little later that, "He moved the patients inside of the hospital.  He went everywhere, but his duty post was in the surgery ward, that he went everywhere with the patients.  He took the patient to the maternity ward, to the ENT service, to the health care service, to the surgery department.  Since he was a hospital employee, he went wherever he wanted to, therefore, it was during his presence inside of the maternity ward that he told me."  Is that correct?
A.	He was an employee and his work did not allow him to sit down at the same place.  He worked in the hospital.  I can't tell you what he did, but doctors could send him from one place to another, or send him -- he did not have an office, or send him to run errands.  He might be sent to run an errand or to bring something or brought along by a doctor. 
Q.	So, the answer is, yes, I think, to the question I put to you.  The next question, was this that was put to you, and we bear in mind that in the earlier trial you said you had only seen Rwamakuba twice.  "Question:  And was --" name of this man, number 8 on the list, "Was he also there on that second occasion when all of that killing was going on?" That is the killing, of course, with the axe in the ward, in the surgery ward.  Your answer was:  "He was present." 

And do you still stand by your answer, Madam Witness, that he was present when Rwamakuba was attacking the men and then later removing your brother from the surgery ward; is that correct? 
A.	It is as if you were asking me whether this man was going about with Rwamakuba.  Well, no, he wasn't.  This man was also being sought.  He was a target like many other targets during the events.  So, he couldn't have walked along side Rwamakuba. 
Q.	I think that got lost in translation.  
A.	Even if he was working at the hospital. 
Q.	I think that was lost in translation or misunderstood by you.  What I asked you was, do you stand by your earlier answer on a previous occasion that that man, who didn't work with André Rwamakuba, and that is not suggested, that that man was present when Rwamakuba, according to you, attacked those men in the surgery ward with his axe? 
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	Thank you.  And dealing with that same man, do you stand by, again, a previous answer that you have given -- well, let me ask you this, did that man come from Mpare, in Butare? 
A.	Yes, he comes from there. 
Q.	I think that is spelt P-A-R-E or perhaps M-P-A-R-E.  Now, in your previous testimony you said that there was another woman who was in that ward that your sister was in.  And her name was Donata D-O-N-A-T-A; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
(Pages 52 to 58 by Donna M. Lewis)













1645H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you said on a previous occasion that, first of all, it was the man whose name I won't mention, who told you that man is André Rwamakuba and that was later confirmed to you by Donata, do you agree?  
A.	Please repeat, Counsel.  
Q.	On a previous occasion you said that André Rwamakuba was first named to you and identified by the man who is number 8 on the list, whom we have just discussed from Mpare.  But you then added that there was someone else in your sister's ward who subsequently confirmed what that man had told you, i.e., that this someone called Donata identified this man as André Rwamakuba as well as the first man.  So you have got, first of all, that man telling you that's André Rwamakuba and later that's confirmed by Donata; is that correct?  
A.	This woman told me about it.  She gave me the information as if she herself had heard it from someone else.  
Q.	And this person, Donata, you told us on a previous occasion was an employee -- she worked in maternity and she was loaded onto the pick up at some time.  She is now dead; is that correct?  
A.	That's right.  
Q.	And in your evidence yesterday, you told us that *****************, number 7 on the list, that she told you that it was André Rwamakuba; is that right?  
A.	************* was also a refugee and did not know Rwamakuba.  It is the man whom I referred to who gave us the information which was repeated by the lady whom you have mentioned.  We were together and we both heard about it from that man.  
Q.	But I think that's the first time when you gave evidence yesterday that you have ever mentioned ***********************, as you have just called her, telling you or agreeing with you or hearing at the same time as you that the man was André Rwamakuba.  You have never mentioned **************** in this context before; am I right?  
A.	We were together.  
Q.	But until yesterday you never mentioned anything about ********************* and the name André Rwamakuba; that is right, isn't it?  
A.	It is not only yesterday that I mentioned it, no.  
Q.	We have no record of you mentioning it at any other occasion and you certainly didn't mention it at any time in the course of your evidence in December of 2003, do you accept that?  
A.	If my 2000 testimony was well recorded, it would show that I spoke of this woman because we were at the hospital together.  
Q.	No, I don't say you don't mention her because I asked you about her, so you did mention her, but you didn't mention her as having anything to do about the name André Rwamakuba until yesterday, that is the question -- that is the point I am making.  Do you agree?  
A.	I don't follow you.  I don't see the link that you wish to draw between Rwamakuba and that person.  They are not cousins; there is no relationship between them.  There was no relationship between them.  These people were refugees at the hospital, just like any other refugee and this person saw Rwamakuba at the hospital just as other refugees saw him there.  
Q.	All right.  So you got the name anyway from the man whose name appears on the list at number 8.  Now, that man is to be a witness in this case and we have had all his statements served on us.  And 
	I am going to read you a very short passage where he refers to Rwamakuba, and it is the only part of his statements, of which there are seven or eight or more, where he does refer to Rwamakuba, and I would like you to listen very carefully.  And this is at page 3 of the statement of XV dated the 25th of 
November '97, so it is very shortly after you made your statement.  "I also recall a man named Rwamakuba coming to the university hospital from Sovu hospital in an ambulance which he requisitioned to transport Interahamwe.  I no longer recall the date.  He was dressed in civilian clothing and the Interahamwe accompanying him were armed with hoes and clubs."  And more particularly, please listen to this:  "I recognised him because he was a native of Huye commune," that is H-U-Y-E, "which is part of Butare, of course.  He was a second lieutenant during the Kayibanda regime, who of course, was the first president of Rwanda in 1960.  He was a second lieutenant during the Kayibanda regime and a driver for DGB project until the war broke out.  He was a member of MDR Power and was very active in the meetings.  He had even become the Interahamwe leader when the war started."
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, since reference is made to a witness who will be appearing here and who did make that statement, I would like -- since Mr. Hooper is very keen on the investigator's notes, I would like Mr. Hooper to mention the change that was made in regard to her statement by this particular witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
No, that is what I am reading, and if you mean her, this particular witness, I am not entirely clear.  It may have been a mistranslation.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But you see, that Rwamakuba is not André Rwamakuba, quite obviously, is it?  
MS. FALL:
I will just say this again, Mr. Hooper did say a statement from a witness whom I know very well, 
Witness XV.  Witness XV corrected this investigator's notes and she said -- and the witness said that this person mentioned here was not the person that was mentioned, and he himself was aware that this was not the same person.  I think that if Mr. Hooper is making reference to a document, he must be aware that a correction has been made in regard to this statement, and he should mention this correction and not just the original document.  
MR. HOOPER:
This witness or the witness, XV, makes it plain that Rwamakuba is a different Rwamakuba.  That is exactly my point.  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So somewhere very early on, you and several other witnesses got into your heads that the Rwamakuba he was talking about was André Rwamakuba, the Accused I represent, and you have made up evidence in that mistaken belief.  That is what happened, isn't it?  Isn't it?  
A.	Nobody made a mistake in giving testimony.  It is André Rwamakuba.  That is the André Rwamakuba who is an accused here.  The witness is alive and will come and give testimony here.  No one can claim to see things that they did not see.  I lived through the genocide, I was a witness.  I am explaining what happened and you denied it as if you were with me at the hospital.  This man will come and explain to you that he talked about the Rwamakuba who is the accused at this trial and against whom I am giving testimony here.  
Q.	I very much doubt he will say that, but we will have to wait and see.  

Can I move now to the very last matter that I need to deal with you -- to deal with you.  You were perhaps very reluctant this morning to provide this Chamber with the name of another case in which you had provided evidence.  And very reluctantly -- very reluctantly, indeed, you eventually conceded the name of that case included as one of the defendants the name of Rwankerwa.  Now on a previous occasion, I asked you whether you participated in that case and you said you had not.  That was untrue, wasn't it?  You did participate in that case and, indeed, you gave evidence in that case; is that correct?  
A.	Since you say that I testified in this matter, I would like you to show me that testimony.  
Q.	I will.  And in that testimony, you gave the name of both your sister and your brother as people who had been killed not in the hospital, but in Sahera and you accused Rwankerwa of killing your sister.  Is that true, what I have just said?  
A.	You say that he killed my brother, that is not true.  I would like to explain something to you.  I accused him of killing my older sister who is called -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness gives a name. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, you better write that name down, please.  
A.	Is it not enough to just speak out this name?  I think you heard me.  I did say that this person's name is -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness gives a name.  
MS. FALL:
I think we are in open session and the witness has given a name of her elder sister.  I think this should be removed from the record.  

MR. HOOPER:
Let's go into closed session, please, because I think it is impossible to develop this certainly expeditiously without referring to names.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the English translation the interpreter intervened and said the witness has given a name.  So the name was not mentioned in my head piece.  Was it mentioned in the French translation?
MS. FALL:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was mentioned.  Oh, then it should be removed from the transcript.  

Madam Witness, under the rules governing protected witnesses and the practice that has been developed in these trials, that name should not form part of the public record of proceedings.  So you will write down the name on a sheet of paper so that it can be kept confidential.  Do you understand?  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I think I am going to have to move into -- or, request that we move into a closed session, because we are going to be dealing with a series of names.  I am sorry to inconvenience the public who are attending, but I think it is unavoidable.  It is unavoidable, I can see, particularly if we are going to deal with it expeditiously.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I will have to accept your assurance, Mr. Hooper.  

For the members of the public, we do have rules that are aimed at protecting the identity of protected witnesses.  So we now move into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 63 to 67] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
