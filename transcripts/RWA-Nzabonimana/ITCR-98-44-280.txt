P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 19th of June 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the      Prosecution v. Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Good morning, Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
-- and members of the Trial Chamber.  

Mr. President, I have a motion that I want to present to you this morning to start off your week, to give you some problems.  The motion that I want to make is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why does that make us smile?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't know.  Well, hopefully, it will be a problem we can solve together.  I want to make a motion to call Joseph Serugendo as a Defence witness, out of order, as soon as possible.  That motion is being made pursuant to Rule 85(A) of the Rules.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Robinson, why do you want to do that when the Prosecutor has indicated that he intends to call him as a Prosecution witness?  

MR. ROBINSON: 
Because, with my discussions with the Prosecutor, I am not convinced that they intend to do so.  I recall that you ordered them on the 30th of May to, forthwith, make an application to vary their witness list.  It is now the 19th of June.  In my discussions with Mr. Webster, he had indicated he wasn't certain whether they were going to do that.  So I don't want to wait any longer given Mr. Serugendo's precarious state of health.  I was given his statement by the Prosecution this weekend, and I read it, and I believe that his -- as -- it's very consistent with what he told me when I interviewed him before he was arrested.  And he is someone who has a great deal of exculpatory information that I don't want to lose.  

So rather than wait for the Prosecution -- when I discussed with Mr. Webster, he wanted me to agree to limit my cross-examination to one or two hours, to have him examined outside the presence of my client.  And I -- it just became obvious to me that it was not a fruitful way to proceed to simply wait for the Prosecution to make a motion and to try to attempt to live with conditions that they wanted to impose upon the examination.  

I have been advised that there is no other Defence team -- or, no other case in which Mr. Serugendo's testimony is offered other than in our case.  So rather than proceeding by deposition, as was originally contemplated, it seems to me it would be much more preferable that the testimony be heard by this Trial Chamber, as a body, rather than by some hearing officer only to be later produced for this        Trial Chamber by one or the other of the parties.  

I understand that Mr. Serugendo is in the hospital in Nairobi and that it may be -- that if there is      some -- unless there is some change in his condition, it may be necessary that his testimony be taken by video link.  

And the second part of my motion is that if Mr. Serugendo is not able to testify live before this           Trial Chamber that his testimony be taken by video link for reasons of his health. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you examined the -- whether it is practical or not?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I haven't.  I am just making -- I don't have access to his medical --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  Let's deal with the video link capacity between our Court and Nairobi.  Is there -- is it technically possible for that to take place?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't know.  I don't know.  So, I know it is possible between Kigali and Arusha, between camp Siest (phonetic), The Netherlands and Arusha, and The Hague, and Brussels and other places, so I would think that it would be possible, but I don't know for a fact.  So, in any event, the motion that I want to make, as soon as possible, now that I have read the statement, is that arrangements to be made for Mr. Serugendo to testify as soon as possible as a Defence witness.  And that if he cannot -- practicable for him to appear in person, that he testifies by video link.  

So thank you very much, for that opportunity. 
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Mr. President, I would like to endorse and support Counsel Robinson's motion.  You know that Trial Chamber I have already ruled in this matter so that Mr. Serugendo can be heard as quickly as possible in view of his health situation.  Under Article 20(E) of the Statute and Rule 11 and 85 of the Rules, it is absolutely important for this witness to be heard.  And as Counsel Robinson has already stated, the Prosecutor does not seem to be in a disposition to call that witness.  So for a witness who has such information in his possession, in relation to the events that occurred in Rwanda at the time, I believe that it is absolutely important for all measures to be taken to hear this witness as soon as possible.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse's Defence team; I also want to support Mr. Robinson's motion.  Allow me to say that I understand very well that the Prosecutor would have some hesitation in calling that witness as a Prosecution witness, and this is from my own analysis of the situation.  And I believe that this problem of late disclosures is a breach of Defence rights.  And in order to secure our rights, it is proper for this witness to be heard as a Defence witness if the Prosecutor is not going to call him.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  Good morning to the Trial Chamber and to the other parties.  I don't quite understand                 Mr. Robinson's impatience.  We were discussing this matter on Friday.  We have been doing everything we can to move the issue ahead.  In fact, I disclosed the English translation of Mr. Serugendo's statement by email on Friday to push things ahead.  So he has the materials as fast as they come off of the press.  And we are moving ahead.  

There is no reluctance to deal with this issue on the part of Prosecution, but we cannot rush through things.  Everything takes time.  I was discussing this matter with Mr. Robinson on Friday.  I offered to raise it informally with the Trial Chamber.  He declined that offer.  I worked on the matter this weekend.  I was working on it this morning as a matter of fact.  So we are moving ahead.  What I would request the Trial Chamber to do is to not decide Mr. Robinson's application until we address some outstanding matters in the Office of the Prosecution.  First of all, it is the condition of Mr. Serugendo's health.  

What I suggested to Mr. Robinson, and through him to the other Defence teams, was that if we take his evidence in this trial, whether he comes as a Prosecution witness or a Defence witness, it would be preferable to do so before the entire Trial Chamber and not by way of deposition.  So what                 Mr. Robinson seems to offer as his suggestion is actually something that we had discussed.  Now,    Mr. Serugendo does not seem to be in very good health.  The only way that -- my understanding is that a doctor would not consent to him giving evidence in a way that is typical of most witnesses where there would be unlimited cross-examination and where he would be put through a great deal of stress during the trial process.  My suggestion to the Defence was that we work out the parameters of some way of creatively examining this witness so that the Trial Chamber has the best evidence he can afford and we don't lose the opportunity of getting his evidence.  Now, all of that is under discussion.  

I can't make any decisions right now.  I need more information.  The key piece here is the state of health of this witness and the doctor's recommendation of what can be done and what will allow         the -- what he will allow in regard to this witness.  And I don't know that as I speak -- as I address the Court at this moment.  I will find out during the course of today.  I have some of -- even prepared an abbreviated form of his statement that could form -- that could, sort of, limit the scope of the Court's enquiry or the parties' examination of this witness.  Everything is moving ahead as fast as we can.  So I think it is, you know, it is a bit unreasonable to make the suggestions that Mr. Robinson did.  And for Mr. Weyl now to raise issues of disclosure should give the Court some indication of how contrived their complaints about disclosure are in this case because he comes as a Defence witness.  

There is no disclosure that the Prosecution has to make.  The statements have been disclosed.  I have made efforts to pull together Rule 68 material.  Everything that can be done is being done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the first issue --
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- are you calling him as a Prosecution witnesses?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That decision has not been made.  It depends on the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.
MR. WEBSTER:
-- modality of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- taking his evidence.  Everything is one --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
There is not one issue that can be separated from the other, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that issue -- you see, we would not be willing to consider Mr. Robinson's motion to have him called as a Defence witness if he is going to be called as a Prosecution witness.  Now, it would be, you know, illogical to do that.  But, if you are not going to call him as a Prosecution witness, then we have to consider Mr. Robinson's motion.  And you have to make a clear declaration what your position is. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I cannot do that at this time.  I would need at least another 28 -- 24 hours to figure out the status -- to get --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, there are two issues.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
These are two issues.  The state of his health, and -- well, if he is going to come as a witness he is going to come as a witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
What I am trying to suggest to the Court is that our decision to call him as a witness depends on the state of his health, as well, because we are concerned about the quality of his evidence.  There is -- we cannot distinguish one issue from the other.  

So, I will make some more enquiries.  I will continue in the vein that I have already started.  We are pulling together all of the information for disclosure in the event that he is called as a Prosecution witness.  And I cannot be any more explicit than that at this time.  We are moving ahead.  I was working on this this morning before I came to court.  So, it is not a question of the Prosecution dragging its feet or trying to create a situation where the Defence does not have access to this witness.  Everything is contingent on his health and the way in which his testimony is taken.  And I was trying to work that out with the Defence on Friday, and it is still an open question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has anybody got a medical certificate for -- about him?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't, I've never seen a medical certificate, but I know his -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How has his health status been investigated?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
He has been in and out of the hospital.  He has a diagnosis of a terminal illness.  My most recent information was that he was taken to Nairobi.  He is no longer present in -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it possible to get a medical certificate today; because that would be the only method of assessing his fitness for giving testimony? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is the first order of business, Your Honour, but I cannot do that while I'm here in the courtroom.  But we are looking into it and we are making enquiries. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well you have a team, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have to do it personally. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is understood, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we -- could we get evidence as to his health status today?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I will -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be the basis of assessing whether he can come as a witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
What I can -- based on the information that I have, it is very unlikely that he would be able to walk        in -- he would be able to be brought to this court in order to testify.   The question -- the sticking point in my discussions with Mr. Robinson is if the Trial Chamber were to hear his evidence, whether we would have to make arrangements for the Accused to be present, as well; based on the information I have it is pretty clear that he will not appear in this courtroom, that the arrangements would -- that the Trial Chamber itself would have to go to where ever he is. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But did you investigate the possibility of video link?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, I did not. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I could ask Mr. Hometowu to investigate --
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That on our behalf. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sure.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, Mr. Hometowu, would it be possible for you to make enquiries?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, Mr. President, I will do the enquiry and I will let you know as soon as I get some information. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, two points.  First of all, I just note again that it was on the 30th of May that we had this discussion originally when you ordered the Prosecution to forthwith file its motion to add Serugendo to its witness list.  Now I would once again ask that you provide a deadline to the Prosecution for which either they are going to add him to their witness list or you could consider our motion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Webster has requested 40 -- 24 hours.  So I would imagine it will come through tomorrow morning. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, that is fine. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you have any information, any evidence of his health position?  Do you have a medical certificate?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't have one, but I was going to suggest to the Trial Chamber that you contact Trial Chamber I which made specific findings with respect to his illness in its decision of the 7th of June in which it ordered a deposition.  And I believe that medical information was presented to the Trial Chamber by the Prosecution in connection with that motion.  

So, I believe that's already there, and the Trial Chamber's decision concluded that he had a terminal illness.  So I believe that there is medical evidence in the Tribunal that could be found to support        the -- what appears to be an undisputed point that he is not going to be -- that there is a need in the interests of justice to take his testimony as soon as possible.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well we will on our part, initiate the enquiry that we can.  And we will bring this matter up tomorrow morning at the commencement of the session tomorrow morning.

Now, Mr. Witness, can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  How are you feeling?  
THE WITNESS:
I feel well and strong this morning; I have no problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are pleased to hear that.  We remind you that you remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  And you will be examined this morning by the attorney representing Mr. Ngirumpatse.

Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS BTH
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I must say that I am concerned about your state of health.  You have just said that you are in good shape, and I believe that it would be difficult for me to get me -- to you out of your way, or the way you have chosen to go.  So my cross-examination is going to be difficult for me, I presume.  

But before I begin, let me introduce myself.  My name is Frederic Weyl.  I am of the Paris bar, co-counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And when I say that I am of the Paris bar, that means that I am a French lawyer.  I come from a legal system which is very close to that of Rwanda, and which is quite distant from the system that we have here, which includes examination-in-chief and cross-examination.  

I feel much closer to the system that applies in your country, which is closer to my system.  That having been said, let me proceed to my cross-examination.  But allow me, first of all, to recall that on the 14th of June, that was last Wednesday in the evening, it was your testimony in answer to my learned colleague, Robinson, you said that putting questions to you to which he had answers already was an issue that you found funny, and you said that you would have something to say about that at the end of his cross-examination.  So, before I begin my cross-examination, I would like to know that you still have something to say to Counsel Robinson.  
A.	No, no statement for him. 
Q.	Witness BTH, Mr. Robinson, referring to your level of intelligence, said that nobody had any doubts here as to how intelligent you were.  I would like to confirm that.  And when I said a short while ago that I was worried that you were in good shape as I wanted to take my cross-examination, it is because I believed we would in a chess match of sorts here, and being the very brilliant and intelligent person you are, it would be a difficult exercise conducting my cross-examination.

Now, when you say that you are an intelligent person, are you talking about academic intelligence, Witness?  

Let me be specific:  When you were being cross-examined, you said that your results were always good.  That was in reference to your academic work, that's your school performance, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, the question referred to my results in school, and I said that my results were excellent; that was the context. 
Q.	Agreed.  So that was at the end of your school attendance period, your performance was in the range of 72 to 75 percent; isn't it so? 
A.	Regardless of the scores, what mattered was that I was at the top of my class, so I had no problem with my education. 
Q.	In what subjects did you perform the best?  
A.	Subjects relating to economics. 
Q.	Your best grades were, therefore, in areas of analysis or imagination or creativity; what would you say to that, Witness? 
A.	When you attend a class, you study your subject matter, you do your best and you take the exams, and you do your best during the examination.  So, I ordinarily answered questions at the examinations based on the classes and on the effort that I put into preparing for the examinations. 
Q.	You said that your best grades were in economics.  Were you familiar with the rules and the meanings of various words? 
A.	I believe that I have answered the question that you have put to me.  I told you already that I made an effort to answer whatever questions were raised during the examinations based on the classes that I attended. 
Q.	When I asked you whether you know the meaning of words, it is to find out whether you can distinguish between "we did something" and "they did something"; are you able to make that distinction, Witness? 
A.	Yes, yes, I understand that. 
Q.	So, whenever you said, in the course of your examination-in-chief, or when Mr. Robinson was cross-examining you, or in your previous statements, whenever you said, "we attacked," did that mean that you participated in the attack, as would be distinguished from "they attacked"? 
A.	Yes, that is understood that way, Counsel. 
Q.	So whenever you said "we attacked," that meant something, and whenever you said "we killed," that also had a meaning, namely, that you were personally involved in the killings; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Would it be the same for "we lynched and we plundered," Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Therefore, Witness, for the first week here, and over the four years that you have testified here, and over the past 12 years you have been describing a terrible criminal past of yourself; isn't it? 
A.	Participating in killings is a reprehensible act, I know. 
Q.	When you say "killings" would that be 100 persons, 15 persons or five people, as was your statement in the first trial, or three persons, as was your statement last Friday?  Don't you think that that is a little more than just simply being reprehensible, Witness, if you have a full understanding of the meaning of words? 
A.	If one kills one person, two or three persons, all of those are punishable crimes, but the penalties or the sentences would depend on the circumstances under which any of those given crimes were committed. 
Q.	But Witness, we agree, don't we, that for the past -- or that you have, indeed, agreed to a criminal past of yours over the past 12 years, haven't you? 
A.	It is not only 12 years.  As far as I know these events started in 1991, so that is 15 years ago.  I have pled guilty and acknowledged my criminal involvement in this -- in these events.  That happens not to be your case.  So our circumstances are different; you haven't made any concessions as such. 
Q.	Well, maybe there is a problem with the interpretation.  But between yourself and myself, a lawyer, in my robes, I believe that I do not have any confession to make in terms of any possible criminal past.  I hope that there is no misunderstanding between us as to the distinction between yourself and myself. 
A.	Whatever the case may be, you are putting questions to me because you are defending somebody who was involved in the events.  While I know that you were not involved in those events, for sure, but you are putting questions to me based on information that has been provided to you.  You were not present at the time.  And you were busy elsewhere minding your own business.  But the business between myself and the persons against whom I am testifying, all I can say is that we all know very well what happened. 
Q.	Witness BTH, I am raising these issues of your criminal past with you because I can say that I have some difficulty in believing your statements, because I may tend to think that what you are saying is not true.  Do you understand that against the backdrop of your criminal past, I can have that type of difficulty?  Witness, do you understand that? 
A.	Well, you may have difficulties, because you want to demonstrate that your client had nothing to do with this.  And so you may be attempting to project me as the author or the perpetrator of those crimes.    Mr. Ngirumpatse was the president of the party at the national level.  I was at a much lower level of authority in the party; whereas you think that he had nothing to do with it where he was the one who gave the orders.  In fact, you should have been more reasonable.  You shouldn't be saying that I have things which can be held against me, whereas your client doesn't.  He was the head of the MRND.  He was in charge of the Interahamwe.  And, therefore, he must answer.  He must be accountable in view of his responsibility. 
Q.	Now, Witness, let me revisit the rules that have been laid down from the very beginning.  I said, up front, that our cross-examination would be one of two chess players, but please, I would like you to answer the questions that I have put to you and not to go four questions ahead of me and anticipate.  So, I would like to have a very clear answer to the specific questions that I put to you.  Do you agree with me that it is possible for me to have doubts in my mind about the statements of somebody who comes across as a criminal? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, I'm objecting to the question, Your Honours.  If Rob -- if Mr. Weyl wants to engage in a conversation with the witness, then he cannot object to the witness's responses.  This is hardly a question, whether the witness agrees what Mr. Weyl's state of mind should be.  So, if he wants to reformulate the question and ask a question that can be answered, otherwise, he should not complain about the way the witness responds to that type of proposition. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think that I need to have an answer to my question, and not a dissertation on a question which has not been put to the witness.  My question was very simple.  Can the witness answer that question?   
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Namely, do you agree, Witness, that it is possible for me to entertain some doubts as to the validity of the answers that come from somebody who comes across as a criminal?  
MR. WEYL: 
	That is my question, and I need an answer to that question.  And wouldn't refute anything other than the answer that comes from the witness to the question I have put to him.  

Mr. President, would you please ask the witness to answer my question, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Weyl.  It is becoming argumentative.  I think he answered the question immediately           before -- before you put this -- you rephrased the question.  And to pursue this line it becomes argumentative.  
At the end of the day, we as Judges are going to have to ask ourselves this exact question, and resolve it.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it is now on the record. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So, Witness BTH, I should like to come back to your qualifications.  You were a good pupil? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you were particularly good in all school work requiring an exercise of the memory? 
A.	I had good marks in general.  Are you going to deduce from that that I first memorised what I have been saying before the Trial Chamber?  What are you driving at?  As to subjects that required exercise in memory, I did what I had to do.  And those that required reflection, or general understanding, I did well in also -- rather well. 
Q.	As a pupil you remembered dates? 
A.	When one is a pupil, when one is a student, and you are studying and there are dates, you have to remember them, not only to be able to answer questions in exams, but to be able to grasp the contents of courses.  And when something might not interest you for one reason or another, you might not remember it.  As to the events that occurred, we didn't take notes.  We couldn't imagine that one day someone would question us.  And so we didn't remember dates, as one would in a school course. 
Q.	So, you remembered better what you learned, than what you experienced? 
A.	What I want to say, and I want to repeat, to make it clear to remember an item of information, it is because you have some interest in it, or some interest in it for you.  For example, during the genocide, or even before the genocide, as we would say, nobody thought the Inkotanyi would take over the country.  No one imagined that we would be answerable -- responsible for our acts.  Nobody took notes of the events and, of course, the dates. 
Q.	And you didn't take notes either of the names of people? 
A.	The names I give are the names that spring to mind.  I do not claim to have an exhaustive list of names, but when a question is put to me, I'm asked to give the names I recall.  And various -- there can be various reasons to lead you to remember the names of people.  You can put a question to me, and as a result of which many things come to mind. 
Q.	Well, I think we will come back to this in the course of the present exercise.  But do you confirm that more or -- a fact interests you or interested you, the easier it is to memorise? 
A.	There are various reasons that can lead you to retaining something in your memory.  An item may be contrary to your interests and for that reason you retain that item of information in your memory; that also can happen. 
Q.	You have said that you'd never forget my colleague, Peter Robinson.  I think that there are facts, events one can never forget because they are imprinted in your memory; do we agree on that? 
A.	Yes, you might remember something because it is associated with another event that helps you to remember. 
Q.	And events or some suggestions put to you by other detainees or people you frequent who put to you proposed facts a bit different to help guide your memory; that can also happen, discussions with co-detainees? 
A.	Are you insinuating that I came here to narrate before the Trial Chamber discussions I have had with prisoners?  Is that what you are suggesting, Counsel?  
Q.	I am not insinuating anything.  I am asking you whether sometimes your memory can be supplemented or modified through discussions you hold with one person or another. 
A.	Well, not as far as I am concerned.  I am speaking to you of events that I remember.  You know, at the time I followed everything that was going on.  And I can remember quite a few things.  I am not speaking of things that other people have spoken to me about, or was suggested to me -- put to me by other people.  I was lucid at the time and I remember what I remember. 
Q.	Well, we are getting there, Witness.
A.	I think -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think, Counsel said, "Witness, you know who is Mathieu Ngirumpatse?"  
THE WITNESS:
I know he was president of the MRND.  He was also secretary of the MRND.  And I know, it was someone who had a choir and liked music, enjoyed music. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, you said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president of the MRND, and national secretary of the MRND.  Can you tell me more about those positions and at the time that he occupied them? 
A.	When Habyarimana was still president, Ngirumpatse was party secretary.  When Habyarimana was no longer president of the party, it was Ngirumpatse who occupied the position; and that occurred in 1992. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I -- the Kinyarwanda booth says they are not sure about the year mentioned by the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, could you just repeat the year that you mentioned in your last answer?  The interpreter is not sure that they got it right. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that that occurred '92 -- maybe '93.  I don't remember the month exactly but, approximately, it was thereabouts. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	To the best of your recollection, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was he president of the MRND at the beginning of 1992?  
A.	I don't remember.  But I think that at the beginning of 1992, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not president of the MRND. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	If I say that Ngirumpatse was not president of the MRND at that time, it is because at the time of the rally organised in Ruhengeri, attended by the president, at that time Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president.  But I am not in a position to tell you as of which month he became president.  And I know that, at the time we fled into exile, he was still president of the party. 
Q.	Witness, do you know that you are much more precise under other testimony, under oath? 
A.	I don't understand that question. 
Q.	Do you know that in the course of other testimony under oath, you were much more specific -- precise? 
A.	Well, maybe at the time my memory was fresher, but not today.  It was two years ago, maybe I explained better than I do today because I remembered more of the facts better -- the facts. 
Q.	So, two years ago, because you know that I am going to speak of testimony that occurred nearly two years ago, your memory was fresher than it is today? 
A.	It can happen that I speak of something, and two or three days later I can't recall, or don't remember that I mentioned that thing, whatever it might have been. 
Q.	But if you speak the truth one day, two or three days later you are not sure that you can speak the same truth; is that how I am to understand what you have said? 
A.	It can happen that I'm not very sure of some things.  And then when you ask me and I don't have a clear memory of the event, I can't say with certainty that I remember it, because I took the oath to speak the truth.  And I speak -- as -- and I say what is present in my memory as to those events. 
Q.	Witness BTH, I think you would be much more credible if you knew how to say at some time, I don't know, rather than assert different things according to the moment on which you are being questioned.  

I would remind you what you said on the 12th of October 2004 in Bizimungu et al, page two of the    trans -- French transcript, to the question: 

"On what date did the national committee of the Interahamwe -- was the national committee of the Interahamwe established?" 

You answered:  "It was established after the introduction of multiparty politics.  I don't remember the exact date.  I remember that we started in 1992."  

"Question:  Do you know how it was established?"

Answer:  "You answered, "It was established by the party management." 

And to the question, "When you say, 'the party management, who are you thinking of?"  
You answer:  "Well, there was the MRND national committee, which was directed by its president, Mathieu Ngirumpatse; Karemera, vice president; Nzirorera, secretary general."  That was what you stated on 12th of October 2004.  At that time, under oath, you were sure that at the beginning of 1992 Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president; Karemera was vice president; Nzirorera was secretary general.  You were certain at that time, under oath.  
A.	But we are not speaking of the beginning of '92 there anyhow.  And moreover as regards dates, periods, months, it is approximations that I am giving you.  What I can confirm, and that you cannot contradict, is that in 1992 those people were running the MRND party.  They were at the top of the party.  And there is no difference in what I am saying today, and what I said at the time.  And, if I understood correctly what you read out, we were not speaking of the beginning of 1992.  And what I can confirm is the day where the top leaders of the party -- unless you wish to demonstrate or try to prove that they never had anything to do with the running of the party?  
Q.	Witness, I would like to recall that the beginning of our questioning, whether you touched any weight -- significance to the meaning of words, when beginning 1992 you say Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president, Karemera was vice president, Nzirorera was secretary general, it is that you attach value to these positions, these dates and your testimony under oath on the 12th of October 2004.  Do we agree on that point? 
A.	What I am telling you is that all of the dates are approximate.  And I rely on one item or another to speak of that.  It doesn't alter the fact that the people in question were the top authorities, leaders in the party. 
Q.	Witness BTH, if I tell you that you only learnt later that Mathieu Ngirumpatse became president of the MRND only in 1993, and you had to rectify your line of answering, would I be mistaken? 
A.	You are mistaken, Counsel.  I told you the dates are approximate -- estimates that I make.  And in my answer I told you that it was about 1992, 1993, about then, thereabouts, that he occupied that position. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I --  Mr. President, I could like to enter into evidence this extract of the witness's testimony in Bizimungu et al on the 12th of October 2004, pages 2 and 3 of the French version.  I don't have the English transcripts.  I should like the Trial Chamber to admit this preceding testimony into evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we admit it.  But like Mr. Robinson, I expect you to undertake to supply the English transcripts in due course. 
MR. WEYL: 
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is your --

MR. WEYL:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is your reference exhibit number?  
MR. WEYL: 
Unless the registry corrects me, I think the French should be D. NG017A.  And English would be -- is page five -- no, three of the transcript, NG017B. 
MR. MJUI:
Correct, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, registrar.  

Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG17A and D. NG17B admitted) 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, you have had the opportunity to explain yourself in respect of a card signed by Ngirumpatse.  I should like to come back to that.  To your recollection, was it a membership card of the MRND or a membership card to the Interahamwe? 
A.	We discussed the Interahamwe card at length.  There was an MRND party member card, but what we were discussing here was the Interahamwe card. 
Q.	Reminding you that you are under oath and it is always possible to review what you have said, if you are not sure of something.  You are sure that the Interahamwe card that you recollect was signed by Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Was the card signed by Ngirumpatse in front of you, before you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And the signature on that card, was it printed? 
A.	I didn't check to see what sort of signature it was, but the fact is that the card was signed. 
Q.	But with a stamp or with a biro or a pen or a pencil? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Oh no, Witness BTH, my question didn't ask for a yes or no answer.  Was the signature by way of a stamp, yes or no? 
A.	Your question is not clear, Counsel.  I know that there was an MRND stamp on the card and also a signature, the signature of the person who had signed it. 
Q.	I am not speaking of the stamp; I'm talking of the signature.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And after apologising for, perhaps, being too fast.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Was it, the signature, put on the card by way of a stamp? 
A.	No, I didn't see a stamp. 
Q.	So, was it signed with a fountain pen? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you remember the colour of the ink? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was it a legible signature with the surname and the forename, or was it initialed? 
A.	I don't remember very well outside -- I don't remember very well, but I know there was a signature on the card. 
Q.	If you don't remember, how do you remember that it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse's signature? 
A.	Because I know what was the name on the card. 
Q.	But you said you don't remember whether there was a name.  Was there a name or wasn't there a name? 
A.	I have told you that I do not remember whether there was a stamp with a name.  I don't remember the stamp.  I never said -- I have always said that the name was there on the card. 
Q.	Well, the record will speak for itself.  But did you often see Mathieu Ngirumpatse's signature before then? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So, you could recognise Mathieu Ngirumpatse's signature in 1992? 
A.	Yes, at that time I had a card and I knew that the card was signed.  I didn't pay close attention to all of the details of the signature.   I didn't lend much attention to the -- to Ngirumpatse's signature. 
Q.	You did not pay close attention in 1992, but now today in 19 -- 2006, you can assert that the card was signed by Mathieu Ngirumpatse; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I am certain.  I am sure.  I knew that the card was signed by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  As to remembering his signature, that was none of my business.  But I knew under what circumstances I had received the card from the Interahamwe, and who gave it to me.  And I know that that Interahamwe card was signed; it was made available to me.  I held it.  But I do not remember by heart how the signature was, all of the details in respect of that signature. 
Q.	And when the card was handed to you, it was handed to you by Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And when you were given it, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president of the MRND? 
A.	I don't remember.  In any case, I think he was either national secretary or president.  I don't remember very well. 
Q.	On what date? 
A.	I remember neither the date nor the month, but I do remember that the card was given to us after the uniforms were issued. 
Q.	Do you remember -- do you remember the year? 
A.	1992. 
Q.	And do you think it was after the uniforms; so what period?  You must have some idea. 
A.	I have told you that we received the uniforms in August in 1992.  So we received the cards after that. 
Q.	But you don't know whether Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president of the MRND, or if he was national secretary? 
A.	No, I don't remember.  I don't remember on what date he succeeded Habyarimana. 
Q.	Thank you very much for all of these answers, Witness.

The first meeting establishing the committee was when, do you think?  
A.	Towards the -- towards the end of 1991. 
Q.	You know that I do attach value to a maximum precision, end of 1990 -- is December the end of 1991, to your mind? 
A.	No, I can't be specific.  I did not take notes at the time. 
Q.	Well, can you be more specific as to what you mean by the end of 1991 because December is the end of 1991, or maybe November, stretching things.  What does end of 1991 mean to you? 
A.	Well, Counsel, you can take it as you will, but what I remember is that it was at the end of 1991. 
Q.	I think that the Trial Chamber should like to know, as I would like to know, what in your mind means end of 1991.  Is January 1991 the end of 1991? 
A.	I told you -- I told you it was towards the end of 1991; that is the answer I gave.  I can't give you another answer.  I don't have any other answer, don't require that I give you date.  I don't know if you are satisfied or not, but all that I know is it is towards the end of 1991. 
Q.	I'm not asking for a specific date.  I'm trying to understand what, in your mind, means the end of 1991, approximately.  Is it September, October, November?  When does the end of 1991 begin? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, I'm objecting to the -- excuse me, the form of the question at this stage.  Mr. Weyl has asked the same question --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- three or four times already. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it is not necessary.  
Mr. Weyl, we think you have exhausted that issue already. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, we shall have to live with the approximation and the lack of an answer. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	The first meeting held at the end of 1991, was held on the initiative of Kajelijeli; is that correct? 
A.	I don't know where that idea came from, but when the meeting was held he told us that it was -- there was a message from Nzirorera. 
Q.	And the meeting was held where? 
A.	Mukingo communal office. 
Q.	How many participants, approximately? 
A.	Between 40 and 60 participants. 
Q.	Was a list of those in attendance drawn up? 
A.	Yes, there was a list of the people in attendance. 
Q.	And only members of the committee or supporters of the committee were listed; is that correct? 
A.	No, all of the participants wrote their names down on the list and, subsequently, the minutes of the meeting were prepared after the elections.  Otherwise, all of the participants signed the list as having attended the meeting.  They didn't join then; they joined later.  No, when we left that place, the committee had just been elected. 
Q.	So, the participants joined in the course of the meeting? 
A.	Your question is not clear, Counsel; please repeat.  
Q.	The members of the committee showed their joining -- the fact that they became members during -- in the course of the meeting, correct? 
A.	That day we held a meeting.  Kajelijeli asked that the committee be elected, which is what we did on that same day.  When we left that place, the committee was already established. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did all of the participants vote? 
A.	Yes, except those who were conducting the elections; Kajelijeli, for example, and the others who had conducted the meeting, they did not vote.  But the youth who were present voted.  
Q.	Those who were elected, did they run for the offices in the course -- or during the meeting? 
A.	No, what happened was that one nominated oneself by standing up; normal procedure was not followed.  Nobody ever presented their CV or anything of that nature.  All one did was to stand up and indicate a desire to be elected. 
Q.	Was the entire committee elected, or did you proceed by first electing the president, the vice president and the secretary and the treasurer, in that order? 
A.	Nominations were made, and the person who received the highest number of votes became the president; and the second became the vice president, and so on and so forth.  So the individual who received the highest number of votes became the president, and the second was vice president, and so on and so forth. 
Q.	So your testimony is that the committee, which met at the end of 1991, proceeded to a democratic election of the president; is that your testimony? 
A.	All of those who attended the meeting elected the committee.  The committee did not meet to elect a president.  
Q.	So, when you say that it is Kajelijeli who chose the president, that is not correct? 
A.	This is what I said; I said so because he is the one who announced to those in attendance that this is the gentleman who is running for the position of president because of*************************.  So those in attendance heard him, and went on to elect that person who received the highest number of votes.  And the next was elected as the vice president. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you who have a good understanding of words, when on the 24th of September 2002,   D. NZ150, K0248982, when you say, "I was trained as an Interahamwe in 1993, around the Mukingo communal office, the vice president of the Interahamwe for that commune was designated, was appointed by Kajelijeli, Juvénal, on the basis of******************************," that was an untrue statement, isn't it? 
A.	You have just referred to the position of vice president who was appointed.  *************************** **********  You just said a short while ago that the vice president was appointed.  A short while ago you made a mistake, and to err is human.  All I know and what I confirm here is that at the time he proceeded to conducting the election of the committee.  But before the elections, he already had someone nominated, by stating aloud somebody's voice.  He led people to vote for that candidate.  So, I don't see any difference between what you have just read and my previous statement. 
Q.	Witness BTH, for purposes of witness protection, we may need to redact part of your statement.  I was cautious enough when I stated that in a previous statement you had asserted that the vice president of the Interahamwe was appointed by Kajelijeli, Juvénal based on******************************.  At that time I was referring to D. NZ150.  And I would ask for your confirmation of the appointment of the             vice president.  So, I would like to have your comments on the democratic election of the president, the vice president, the secretary and the treasurer.  And would you please state whether my reading of your statement is incorrect? 
A.	I don't see any difference between what you have read, and what I have said to the court today.  If someone is conducting elections, and that person conducting the elections says that he wants this person to be elected as the president that already tilts the vote.  That amounts to an appointment of sorts.  And, generally speaking, those -- those attending the meeting follow and uphold the direction of the person conducting the elections.  And that is why I said that that individual had been appointed by Kajelijeli. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I believe that we can take that as an answer.  And that at 10:30 it might be the appropriate time to break for the morning, if that is the desire of the Trial Chamber. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take our mid-morning break now.

Mr. Weyl, how much longer do you anticipate this to go on for?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, on Friday when you put the question to me, I said I would need a day.  But I believe that after having looked through my notes, and taking into consideration Mr. Robinson's cross-examination, I believe I can cut things down to about the mid-afternoon break.  But it will all depend on the answers that I get to the questions that I put. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, we will take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1031H to 1110H)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, during the recess -- or during the weekend, my legal assistant gathered the French transcripts of the English versions that I had offered previously.  And I gave them to                Mr. Hometowu during the break, and he asked me to put on the record the numbers that I am providing.  So, I would like to do that.  It will just take a minute.  

So, we now have French transcripts that will be the letter B to the following exhibits, 85, 106, 110, 146, 147, 151, 152, 153, 155 and 156.  So I have given copies to the Prosecution and the registry and may those now be admitted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.

MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a scheduling matter that I have to order.  The -- in order to facilitate another Trial Chamber, who is taking testimony by video link, we are going to have to move our Trial Chamber to Courtroom IV for tomorrow and Wednesday.  So, we will be sitting in Courtroom IV tomorrow and Wednesday.  

And lastly, Mr. Weyl, after digesting your comment just before the break, I thought I should tell you that there is no obligation to carry on for a long time.  You don't score points by the length of your cross-examination.  So, if it is possible to complete before midday, I would appreciate that.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, as best I can, you know that I also attach great importance to quality above quantity.  I can assure you that I will do my level best, but I'm not sure I will be finished within an hour and a half.  I will do my best, but I am not certain that I will be done by the lunch break.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, we talked of a second meeting that was held in order to introduce members of the committee to Joseph Nzirorera; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	As far as you can recall, Witness, can you tell us at what time that second meeting took place? 
A.	It was in 1991, and after the first meeting. 
Q.	Yes, we do agree; otherwise, that would have been the first meeting, and the second would have been the second -- or rather the first would have been the second.  So are you confirming that this meeting took place at the end of 1991, and if so, how much time elapsed between the first and the second meeting? 
A.	I do not recall how much time had elapsed, but not a very long time.  Between the two meetings, there was only a brief time-frame between those two.  
(Pages 1 to 22 by Donna M. Lewis)















1115H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Would you put that at one week, Witness, three weeks, or two months?  
A.	I can only say that it was not a very long time between the two meetings.  I didn't count the number of days between those two meetings.  
Q.	If one were to attempt an approximation, it would be days, rather than weeks and months; is that so, Witness? 
A.	Well, you know, that time can be counted in days and weeks and months, but what I was saying simply was that I do not remember how much time had elapsed, how much time specifically had elapsed between the two meetings, whether it be in days or months.  I have no clear recollection.  But I know that it was not too long a time between the two meetings.  
Q.	Did any other meetings take place between that first meeting and the second meeting, or -- at which the committee was introduced to Joseph Nzirorera?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Therefore, according to you, the leadership of the committee was modified after the second meeting, at which point the president became vice-president; is that your testimony? 
A.	Yes, it was after the second meeting that the change took place.  
Q.	It has been your testimony that, at that meeting, some figures of authority were in attendance, and that the agenda of the meeting sought to introduce the committee to those figures of authority; is that correct?  
A.	I said that on that day Nzirorera was in the company of other persons, and when the committee was introduced to him, he then went on to introduce the committee to those other persons, and urged those persons to assist him in all his activities. 
Q.	It was also your testimony that Joseph Nzirorera introduced the figures of authority to the committee.  Were these figures of authorities (sic) not well-known enough for there to be need to introduce them to the members of the committee, Witness? 
A.	It was necessary because, as a leader, whenever a problem did arise, it would be necessary to know who to go to.  And since these people worked with him, he had to introduce them to the committee so that, in due time, the members of the committee would know to who to go in case of any difficulty, in order to deal with the proper authority in terms of handling any claims or solving any problems as they arose.  
Q.	At that time you were a member of the Interahamwe; isn't it so? 
A.	At that time we belonged to the youth wing of the MRND, and the expression "Interahamwe" had not yet come into effect at the time of that meeting.  
Q.	But there had already been a meeting of the MRND youth wing committee at which a committee of leaders was elected; isn't it so? 
A.	Yes, we had talked about this previously.  The meeting did hold (sic).  Kajelijeli chaired that first meeting, but the second meeting was chaired by Nzirorera.  And I know that it was members of the MRND -- of the youth wing of the MRND.  
Q.	At that time, were you also a member of the MRND? 
A.	Yes, of course. 
Q.	When did you join? 
A.	From the very day on which I received a membership card.  With the advent of multiparty politics, members got registered in various parties.  So it is from the time of the introduction of multiparty politics that I registered.  But even prior to the advent of the multiparty politics era, when we had only a single party, all Rwandans were members of that single party.  And when multiparty politics was introduced, I became a member of the MRND party.  
Q.	You became a member of the MRND party, and there was no need for you to join the party; isn't it so? 
A.	I do not quite understand your question, Counsel.  Could you please be more specific?  
Q.	Did you have to apply to become a member of the MRND, or is it that you did not fulfil any formality whatsoever to become a member of the party? 
A.	What formality, for example, would you be referring to, Counsel?  There was no need for any formality.  However, members of the MRND would come and simply register those who were members of the party, and this was done by the local officials of the party at the cellule level.  Announcements were made that those who were members of the MRND should register at such-and-such a location.  Otherwise, there was no formality, as such.  And we know that at the time multiparty politics had been introduced -- and we knew exactly what we needed to do.  
Q.	From your answer -- maybe I did not quite understand your answer, but it would seem to me that you did not formally join the MRND, but you simply continued to be a member of the MRND, even with the advent of multiparty politics.  
A.	The MRND had existed as a single party.  Then, with the advent of multiparty politics, MRND -- the MRND became one of the parties in the country.  So everybody was free to choose the party of their belonging, and so it was said that whoever wanted to, could register.  And I did so with the local officials.  People would go to the local authorities and register with the party of their choice, and they would be issued a membership card.  That is all it took.  
Q.	Yes, I do agree with you.  So, you actually applied to become an MRND member with the advent of multiparty politics, because you actively sought to become a member of that party?  
A.	From what you are saying, are you inferring that one had to sit an examination or receive some training before becoming a member of a party?  No.  What happened was simply that everybody was invited to join a party, depending on their leanings, their convictions, and whatever interest they found would be of benefit to them in any given party.  And I think it is clear enough.  
Q.	Yes, it is getting clearer, because you have effectively said that one had to express a desire to become a member of the MRND.  And so my question -- my next question, then, would be:  What was your reasoning, or your motivations -- what were your motivations for joining the MRND?  
A.	At the time, and under the prevailing circumstances in my area -- well, let me go back to the beginning.  The Inkotanyi had launched an attack, and when they started the war, they were fighting against the MRND, and that was at the time when the MRND was the all-powerful single party.  Then other political parties came on the scene and we saw how they were being treated.  Anybody who was not of the MRND was considered to be an accomplice.  And there are other reasons which I do not want to talk about.  There are reasons, personal reasons, which I would rather not talk about which led me to join the MRND.  
Q.	When you joined the MRND, were you familiar with the statements or the constitution of that party?  
A.	As far as I know, those who joined the MRND did not enjoy that privilege of having to listen to anybody reading the statements or the constitution of the MRND, at least, as far as I know.  
Q.	Now, you personally, Witness, at the time you joined the party, did you read the statements or the constitution of that party? 
A.	No, I did not.  I simply came to a decision based on what the officials of that party were saying.  
Q.	Witness BTH, I thank you.  

Now I will go to another line of questioning, and I would invite you to tell me whether you are familiar with firearms.  
A.	There are various types of firearms -- various types of firearms, some of which I know, but I do not claim to know all types.  
Q.	Can you tell me what is a Kalashnikov? 
A.	What I know is that it's a type of firearm.  If you showed me a Kalashnikov among other firearms, I might be able to recognise it, but I don't know the difference between that firearm and other types of firearms, or how to use them or their capacity.  I don't know all those things.  But I could identify it from among other types of firearms. 
Q.	But tell the Trial Chamber whether it is a pistol or a machine gun or a rifle, or what type of -- 
A.	Kalashnikov is different from a pistol and different from a machine pistol (sic) -- automatic pistol.  If you showed me it, I could identify it.  That's -- I don't know if you can get one here, but I could identify it if you showed it to me. 
Q.	Witness, do you know what is an R4, "R" as in "Roger", R4? 
A.	Yes, I know how to distinguish an R4 from other types of firearms. 
Q.	Can you distinguish an R4 from a Kalashnikov?  
A.	Yes; I will answer the question you're going to ask me.  At one point I said that I had received a firearm -- an R4 at -- from Nzirorera's mother.  And at one time I think I made a mistake, because at home we had an R4 that belonged to my father.  So, I can distinguish between a Kalashnikov and an R4.  I think I made that correction in one of my statements, and it is clear, that matter is -- has been made clear.  
Q.	You're guessing the list of my questions, which means my questions are pertinent.  And when did you rectify to say that you'd received a Kalashnikov and not an R4? 
A.	I suppose you have all my statements, the statement where I said I received an R4.  Subsequently, I made another statement where I corrected myself.  And I think the Prosecution has all those statements, and you can refer to them whenever you like. 
Q.	You stated -- you first stated you received a Kalashnikov, and then you stated you received an R4, or is it the other way round?  First you said you received an R4, and then corrected to say that you'd received a Kalashnikov.  Which is the correct version?  
A.	I will repeat what I said.  I received a Kalashnikov at Nzirorera's mother's residence, and I know I corrected that in a statement.  This point has been rectified, corrected, cleared up, in the preceding statements.  You can always refer back to them if you like.  And if that is not the case, then someone has misreported what I said.  
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, let me indeed recall your statements.  On the 18th of October 2002, you said you had received two Kalashnikovs at Joseph Nzirorera's place.  That was 18th of October 2002.  Can you tell us on what date you received the Kalashnikovs?  
A.	No.  I never said I'd received two Kalashnikovs.  That is the first -- the very first time I hear that.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I wish to refer to D. NZ149 -- Exhibit D. NZ149, K0260334 in the French text.  The witness states, "Once, in December 1993, I, Niyigaba" -- N-Y-I-Y-I-G-A-B-A (sic)-- "went to fetch two Kalashnikovs from Nzirorera.  I took one and Niyigaba took the other one."  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	That is what you stated on the 18th of October 2002.  Do you remember that now?  
A.	No.  You told me -- you just said a minute ago -- you accused me of having, me, received two Kalashnikovs.  That's what you said.  But that -- Michel took one weapon and I took the other one.  So now you seem to have made a mistake.  Michel took one of the weapons, I took the other one.  Nowhere is it stated that I took two Kalashnikovs.  What you've read is correct, but what you started by saying in your question was incorrect.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I did not hear counsel's question, sorry.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	It was in 1993?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I think is what counsel asked. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, it was about that time when -- with Amahindure and everything.  It was around then.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	If I were to tell you that on another occasion you stated, "At the end of our training, I was given an R4 gun."  Do you remember having stated that?  
A.	Even before you asked the question, I'd explained what had happened.  That I had made a mistake, and subsequently I'd asked the Prosecution to correct it.  So, why do you want to come back again and again to this same question?  
Q.	Do you remember the date on which you made a statement concerning the R4 rifle? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And if I were to tell you that it was on the 11th of March 2003, in other words, subsequent to the previous statement, would you acknowledge that?  
A.	Well, I don't know if you're saying that I never corrected that mistake.  The Prosecution can probably say something about that.  I corrected it, and that is my answer to you on that matter.  
Q.	Unless my knowledge of the file is incomplete, or whether the complete file has not been disclosed to me, I have no -- nothing to show this rectification that you brought.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Well, I think you are basing yourself on testimony I made before the Trial Chamber.  It was an R4 weapon.  And in Government -- the Government II trial, I corrected that and, also, in another trial.  The Prosecution, itself, was informed thereof.  If, perhaps, you were not informed, that's not my fault.  But now you know.  I've told you what the problem was.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I should like to enter into evidence the witness statement of the 11th of March 2003, D. NG18A for the French, K0271966, and D. NG18B in the English, marked K0262094.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
(Exhibit Nos. D. NG18A and D. NG18B admitted) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
That was K0271966 and K0262094.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I'm sorry to insist, but I should like you to remember as clearly as you can when you received which arm, which firearm.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, but I'm objecting to the form of the question again.  The witness has answered this question at least three times already.  He stated repeatedly that he cannot remember dates, he remembers periods of time in relation to specific events.  And to keep pressing him on this issue not only wastes time, but it's abusive of the witness.  So I would object to the question.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, the PV and the exhibits will reflect the facts.  If the witness can't be more specific, perhaps he can tell me where he received the weapon.  
THE WITNESS: 
It was at Nzirorera's mother's house.  

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So it wasn't just at Nzirorera's residence? 
A.	I said it was at Nzirorera's mother's house. 
Q.	And if I were to suggest to you that it was at Kajelijeli's house, you would say no, as you asserted on the 14th of June.  It wasn't as Kajelijeli's house; we do agree on that? 
A.	I never said that.  If you read that somewhere, or if it's what you've heard, it is untrue.  I never said that I received a firearm at Kajelijeli's residence.  I said that I received it at Nzirorera's mother's house, and it was Dusabe who gave it to me.  
Q.	If I were to tell you that it was at Mukamira camp, you would again say no?  
A.	Well, if Nzirorera's mother's house is at Mukamira camp, then that is correct.  All I know is that I received it at Nzirorera's mother's house.  
Q.	And if I were to tell you that you'd received it at Ruhehe camp, you would again say no? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, is there an offer of proof for these questions?  All questions should be asked in good faith.  If Mr. Weyl is going to direct us to a statement or some piece of information that provides him with a basis to put these questions to the witness, that's one thing, but if he's just speculating and toying with the witness, it's not permissible.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, could the witness answer my question?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, hasn't he answered your question, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL: 
Well, then, Mr. President, I should like -- remind the witness of preceding statements in Bizimungu, Tuesday the 12th of October 2004, page 15, as to the French transcript.  

Question:  "Let us now speak of the firearm.  How did you receive your firearm?"  

Answer:  "We were shown the place where we were supposed to receive the weapons.  It was François Dusabimana who gave us the arms at Ruhehe military base."  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, have you got any comment?  
A.	You are ascribing to me words I never spoke.  I know where Dusabe lived.  He didn't live in Ruhehe, he lived at his residence -- his house, which is quite different from Ruhehe.  I said that some people had received weapons on Ruhehe hill.  As to I, Michel, and several other people, we received them at Nzirorera's mother's house.  Other people received weapons at Mukamira camp.  I never said that I personally, myself, received a firearm on Ruhehe hill.  I never said that.  

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I should like to have admitted as D. NG19A in the French, and 19B in the English, the extract of the transcript from Bizimungu et al of Tuesday 12th of October 2004, page 15 in the French transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG19A and D. NG19B admitted) 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, perhaps there's a difference in the page numbering -- page numbering in the transcripts that I'm entering.  For me it was page 15, but perhaps after the break I could be more precise and absolutely certain.  But, in any case, you will see the document.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  I have no objection to this going into evidence, but when I read it in the English translation, it states exactly what the witness just stated on the witness stand, which is that he got his weapon from Nzirorera, and the others got their weapons from the military barracks.  And I'm looking at page 15 of the English text, it's also page 15 on the French.  I'm not looking at the French text, only the English.  And that's exactly what it says.  Now if Mr. Weyl wants to put it in evidence, it's no problem, it doesn't hurt the Prosecution, but there's no contradiction there.  It simply repeats what the witness has said many times already during his testimony.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, if some versions are more authoritative than others, we see there's no respect for the official working languages.  The French here says something different from what the Prosecutor claims for the English.  But if one language is more authoritative than the other, where are we going?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Let me read what the -- what it says in English.  Answer -- or, I'll read the question and then the answer.  And this is page 15 on the transcript.  

Question:  "And let's talk about the weapon.  How did you get your weapon?"  

Answer:  "They told us where we were supposed to be given the weapons.  Some were given those weapons at the Ruhehe military position.  For us we were given these weapons by François Dusabimana, and about four of us, we were given these weapons by Dusabimana, François, from Nzirorera -- from Nzirorera's mother's home.  And Dusabimana, François, was Nzirorera's younger brother.  Other people got the weapons from the Mukamira military barracks."  And then it goes on.  

That's exactly what the witness has said several times.  I don't see any contradiction.  I don't have the French text to compare it in front of me, but Mr. Weyl can perhaps read the French if it's any different from that.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I will repeat the exercise I performed before.  My assistant, Ms. Anta Guissé, tells me it's on page 13 of the transcript.  I will read it.  

"Let us now speak of the firearm -- of the weapon."  

We're on line 18.  "How did you receive your weapon?"  

"We were shown the place where we were supposed to receive our weapons.  It was François Dusabimana who gave us the weapons at Ruhehe military base.  Dusabimana was Nzirorera's younger brother.  Others received their weapons at Mukamira military camp."  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Weyl, do you have the English version?  
MR. WEYL: 
I have the English version, Your Honour.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
And does the English version correspond with what Mr. Webster said?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President and Your Honour, to answer your question, I'm French speaking, and I am using one of the official languages of the Tribunal, the one I'm with which I'm most comfortable.  But to answer your question by another question, do we know in what language the witness testified in Bizimungu?  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Why don't you just put both versions in, both French and English?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I did ask for both versions to be entered, Exhibit D. NG19A for the French, 19B for the English.  And I think, unless I'm mistaken, they were admitted.  And for my part -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Unintelligible) (Microphones overlapping)

Mr. Registrar, did you get the documents?  

Do you have them, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL: 
I have them, and I also have the electronic version.  It's from the electronic version supplied by the Prosecution that I printed out the document. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, can I ask you what language you testified in Bizimungu -- in Bizimungu et al trial? 
A.	I spoke Kinyarwanda.  
Q.	Thank you.  May I, at this stage, suggest that you never ever received any weapon, either at Joseph Nzirorera's house, nor at Nzirorera's mother's house.  What would you say to that?  
A.	Well, I would tell you that you're not telling the truth.  I am the one who knows where I received the weapon.  I know very well where I received it.  I know the beginning and the end of it, and I've explained it.  It's not the first time I've spoken of it.  What I know is that what you read in French is not what I said.  The last time I had a similar problem to face.  A lawyer read to me something in French, and then after we checked, we saw that it wasn't true.  I explained that some people received weapons on Ruhehe hill, others received them at Mukamira camp, but as far as I was concerned, and other people, we received them at Nzirorera's mother's residence. 
Q.	Witness BTH, I think we can leave it at that, in this discussion on the problem of your preceding statements, which will depend on the decision the Judges come to on this rather thorny problem of two different versions, and we'll decide on the appropriate judicial consequences.  
A.	I should like to say I never wrote it in English.  And the person who did it made a mistake, perhaps.  I know what I said, and what I said is what was said in English.  But I didn't write it in -- either in French or in English.  
Q.	Well, in any case, Witness BTH, it is not then that you corrected to say that you'd received a Kalashnikov and not an R4.  Do we agree on that? 
A.	What counts -- what matters, is that I did make the correction, and I am sure of that.  I made that correction at one time or another.  
Q.	Witness BTH, I should like to come to the training that you underwent.  You underwent two training courses; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The first was in 1992; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	To the best of your recollection, when was that? 
A.	I don't remember the date.  What matters is that I do remember the year, and I have told you in what year.  
Q.	At what time of year?  
A.	Before the rally in which Habyarimana participated in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	And that training was decided upon by whom?  
A.	I don't know.  What I know is that Dusabe, who was in charge of that operation, called us.  We were at Busogo, and we had -- he told us we would have to undergo some training.  Now, as to where the orders had come from, I don't know.  But he must have received it from his superiors. 
Q.	And the training was monitored by whom, if you remember the names? 
A.	François Dusabimana.  There were other people who assisted him in that task, but it was Dusabimana who was in charge of the operation.  
Q.	Do you remember the names of the others? 
A.	I can remember some names; Musafiri, Ndagijimana, and others whom I don't recall.  But if other names spring to mind, I can, of course, provide them.  
Q.	I think that's what you told my colleague, Mr. Robinson, on the 14th of June.  No other names spring to mind? 
A.	I just said that if other names do come to mind, I will provide them to the Trial Chamber.  But for the time being that's it.  
Q.	And where did the -- was -- did the training take place?  
A.	It took place at Isimbi, Busogo, in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	And what type of training did you receive? 
A.	We were taught how to dismantle a grenade, the various parts of a grenade, how to put bullets into a gun -- how to load a gun with bullets, and how to dismantle a gun and put it back together.  How to -- and how to take up a position to shoot from, et cetera.  
Q.	And you were trained in shooting, firing? 
A.	No, at that time we were not taught how to shoot, but we were shown various positions to shoot from, how to put bullets -- load bullets into a rifle, how to clean a rifle, how to dismantle it and reassemble it.  
Q.	So you were not taught how to shoot at a target? 
A.	No.  At that time I did not personally receive that training. 
Q.	So on the 12th of October in Bizimungu et al, when you said that you were trained in shooting, that is another translation problem? 
A.	Listen, I have told you that we were taught theoretically how to take up various positions to shoot from.  You just asked me if we were taught how to shoot on a target.  Well, no, we were not taught how to shoot at a target.  You want to lead me up a path -- the path you want, but it's not what I said.  
Q.	Witness BTH, when you say, in Bizimungu et al, Tuesday, 12th of October 2004, page 6, "We were taught how to dismantle a gun and reassemble it, and how to shoot at a target", it's another mistake in translation?  
A.	No.  I have explained that I was taught how to shoot in theory -- in theory how to shoot.  But I did not, in practical terms, shoot at a target.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, can we enter into evidence BN -- D. NG20A for the French, and D. NG20B for the English, page 6 of the transcript in Bizimungu et al, Tuesday, 12th of October 2004. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG20A and D. NG20B admitted) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, let us now speak of your second training course.  You have told us that it was decided upon at a meeting at Mukingo communal office; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	On the 24th of September 2002, you were not very specific about that meeting with the participants, the place, the purpose.  You were not very specific about that meeting.  
A.	You're saying I didn't provide information on that meeting when I was asked?  When questions were put to me about the meeting, I think I gave sufficient information.  Where do you say I didn't provide sufficient information?  
Q.	Witness BTH, I think it's in your statement of the 18th of October 2002 that you give the first specific information, where you state:  "The volcanic lava squad was a meeting -- founded at a meeting held at the end of 1993."  Do you remember having stated that?  
A.	Yes.  Carry on, Counsel.
Q.	And then you go on saying that it was between June and October; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I was making an estimate. 
Q.	Well, there's one precious item of information here.  The end of a year starts in June, as far as you're concerned, at least.  
A.	The important thing, to my mind, in respect of that statement, was the existence of the Amahindure, and that Amahindure were created after the second attack on Ruhengeri town.  It was an estimate I was making.  I don't know the date or even the precise month. 
Q.	And when you made that statement, you said that four people had taken part in that meeting.  Do you remember the names of the people you mentioned?  
A.	I do not remember exactly who -- or, exactly what I said at that time.  If I said there were four people, then I -- because I remember four people.  I don't know if you could please read what I said at the time to refresh my memory.  
Q.	Well, I shall meet your request.  On the 18th of October, you stated that principal officials who attended were Colonel Setako, Minister Nzirorera, Kajelijeli, Mukingo bourgmestre, and Colonel Ntibitura.  That's what you said; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is quite correct.  As a matter of fact, you are simply reading out the answer.  But you have not read the question.  The question that was put to me was:  "Who was present at the meeting?"  And I gave the names of those who I could remember.  I only referred to the names of the officials that I could remember, because the question that was put to me was:  "As far as you remember, who were the officials who were present at the meeting?"  
Q.	On the 26th of August 2003, you make another statement.  Do you remember having made a statement on that very point, Witness?  
A.	Yes, it is quite possible. 
Q.	You locate -- or, you state that the meeting took place in 1992.  Do you have any comment about that?  
A.	Well, there must have been a mistake, again, because this meeting took place in 1993 instead.  I think that I have -- I had asked the Prosecutor to make some corrections to that statement.  And he may be in a position to talk about it.  It is not only that point which I asked him to correct.  There are other items which I asked him to change.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, could Mr. Weyl give us the date of the statement and the page where the alleged discrepancy occurs, please?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, to comply with my learned colleague, Webster's, request, I'm referring to cross -- to examination of 26th August 2003, K0275131 of the French version, and K0500344, the English version.  The witness' answers I'm referring to can be found on line 5 in the French version, K number K02575041.  

"In 1992, Nzirorera held a meeting at the communal office in Mukingo."  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Before I proceed any further, Witness BTH, do you have any recollection of having provided the names of any other figures of authority? 
A.	I have no recollection.  Maybe I did not mention the same number of names because, you know, depending on the days of the testimony I might mention three names or four names, according to as many as I remember.  
Q.	On that occasion, your answer as to the date was less specific, but things seemed to be clearer in your mind in terms of the participants, because you mentioned Nzabagerageza and Augustin Bizimungu.  Was he at that meeting, or were they at that meeting, as far as you can remember?  
A.	Bizimungu was present at the meeting.  And the préfet himself was also present.  
Q.	On the 8th of June 2006 -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Well, Mr. President, I would like to produce it to evidence the statement of 26th August 2003.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe that statement is already in evidence.  But I'm sorry to bring your attention back to the reference that you -- that Mr. Weyl made earlier.  I'm still looking for the specific contradiction that was to be brought to the Court's attention, and I'm not finding it.  I apologise for interrupting, but could you refer me again to what was being brought to the witness' attention as a contradiction in his statement of August 2003?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, in answer to the Prosecutor's objection, it would seem to me that a difference of up to one year is quite a contradiction.  But the explanation thereto is something else.  But there is clearly a contradiction.  1992 is not the same year as 1993.  Now, the mention of new persons in attendance is also an interesting aspect.  

So, in order to assess the witness's credibility, in view of the reliability of his memory as time goes by, I believe that this is also something that is important to bear in mind.  

Now, with regard to tendering into evidence of this document, I believe that I am not certain that this has already been admitted into evidence.  But if the Prosecutor would please guide us on this, with a clear indication as to whether the document has been admitted or not, I would appreciate that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think it was admitted as D. NZ148A and B. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That's correct, Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL: 
Let us, therefore, give to Caesar that which belongs to Caesar.  

Mr. President, let me proceed with the following questions.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	On the 8th of June 2006 in your examination-in-chief, Witness BTH, you included a new number of participants.  Do you remember those whom you mentioned?  
A.	Yes, I do remember.  
Q.	Could you be more specific? 
A.	Let me say something.  When I was being examined, even prior to my coming to Arusha, I was asked to try to remember the persons who were in attendance at the meeting.  Today I might remember three names, and tomorrow, five.  And I don't see why that should be a problem.  

By the way, the document you are referring to does not provide the question that was put to me.  You are only referring to the answers, and it is only those answers that are contained in the statement.  You see, today you can put the same question to me and I may only be able to remember two names, whereas if you put that very question to me tomorrow, I might remember five names.  You had previously put a question to me, and in answer I gave you a number of names, saying, all the same, that if I were to remember any other names, I would make those names possible.  Well, at that time questions were put to me on one day and I was able to remember a number of names, but when the question was put subsequently, I might have been able to remember other names which are not necessarily the same names as those mentioned previously.  
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, you see, my problem, my difficulty in listening to you, is that more -- the more we move away from the time of the events, the more specific things become to your mind when we are looking at blaming or denouncing or identifying people.  But, at the same time, the more unreliable it is, the more difficult it becomes for you in terms of dates.  I wonder how it is that names are so clear to your mind, but dates seem to be rather blurred in your mind.  Can you give me some clar -- can you shed some light on that, Witness?  
A.	No, that is not my own opinion.  You, as a lawyer, you are looking for a number of answers from me.  What I am doing is I am accusing somebody, but you are trying to prove that person not to be guilty.  Do you want me to provide disculpatory (sic) evidence in favour of that person?  You want to demonstrate that he has no responsibility.  But, you see, I remember an increasing number of details as you cause me to repeat many, many things, and in so doing, I am able to remember many more things that I was not able to testify about previously.  

If I go back to Rwanda, for example, I will be in a position to remember things about my life and about how I survived.  Now, here before the Court you are bringing me through your questions to think about those very facts, and in so doing, I am able to remember more things.  So, I don't see what is abnormal about that.  This shouldn't come as a surprise, the fact that I remember other facts, and I am telling the truth.  Well, you see, if I have made a mistake, I do confess that I have made a mistake.  But, please, do not expect answers from me to be exactly the answers that you are looking for.  
Q.	Witness, why is it that you cannot make same effort when dealing with dates?  
A.	No, I am not making any effort as such, because I didn't take any notes down.  And, you see, if you yourself did not write down some of the points that you are dealing with, I am sure that even tomorrow, if questions were put to you about those points, you will not remember everything entirely.  But what you can remember is mainly what you have taken down in writing.  And I think you have a specific interest in following up the issue of dates, but I, at the time, did not have any interest in dates.  

By the way, the officials -- and in view of the prevailing situation in the country and considering what they were telling us at the time, we did not know that the Inkotanyi were going to take over power.  I am certain that those in office at the time, if they had been certain that the Inkotanyi were going to take over power, they would not have asked us to be involved in all these activities.  You see, nobody knew -- nobody knew that we were going to be asked to answer -- to answer questions about specific dates.  
Q.	Witness BTH, nobody told you at the time that you were going to be asked about specific individuals, and you didn't take down their names at the time, either.  But, on the 14th of June, you shed some light, in answer to Counsel Robinson's question, by saying that the meeting definitely held a few days after the RPF attack.  Do we agree on that point, Witness?  
A.	Yes, that is true.  But that is not a specific date.  I did not give him a specific date.  I talked about an unforgettable event, and I used that as a bearing to make an approximation.  So I based my statement on an unforgettable fact in order to establish my estimation.  But you do not want to believe me.  

By the way, it is easy to forget a date, but it is not easy to forget someone's name.  That is quite different.  Now, even if you forget somebody's name, somebody who is still alive, it is possible to still remember that person's name some time after.  But when you forget a date, it is not easy to remember the date some time after.  If you forget the date of your birth, I think it is very difficult for you to remember that date of birth later on.  And once you forget a date, you tend to forget it once and for all.  
Q.	So, one can reasonably think that, if that meeting held a few days after the RPF attack, it must have held in February, and at the very latest, in early March 1993.  Is it so, Witness?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm sorry, but the witness has just given a very lengthy and comprehensive explanation of why it's difficult to recall dates, and yet we have -- and immediately following that, we have another question about dates.  I think we've exhausted this issue.  The witness has given the same response to similar questions all through his cross-examination, and after a certain point it starts to become worrisome.  So I would ask the Court to direct Mr. Weyl to reformulate his questions on these issues.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think that I had rephrased my question, in that I put it to the witness whether it would be reasonable to think that if the meeting held a few days after the RPF attack, it must have held in the month of February 1993 or in early March 1993.  I think that was a manner of rephrasing that question, and I believe that the witness can answer that question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, that's an inference that the Court can draw.  I don't know what a witness is to do, if you ask them to draw a deduction of what's reasonable.  He says he does not remember the date, and he has given facts from which the date can be inferred.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I will rephrase my question by deleting the word "reasonable".  And the question to the witness then is whether he can answer me if I put it to him as follows:  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Did the meeting hold in February 1993?  
A.	I do not remember the month.  I have told you that several times over.  What I remember is that the meeting took place after the attack on Ruhengeri in February 1993.  
Q.	Witness BTH, during that meeting, were you given any lists of persons to be trained? 
A.	No.  
Q.	That, however, would seem to be what you answered in your evidence in-chief? 
MR. WEYL: 
And again, Mr. President, maybe it's time for the break here.  Could we continue with the cross-examination later on this afternoon?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will take our lunch break now.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1411H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  

You can proceed now.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, good afternoon.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, good afternoon to you.  You may recall that prior to the break we had stopped at the issue of training in 1993, and also on the meeting that determined such training.  Are we in agreement?  
A.	Yes, that is what we were talking about.  
Q.	And I was asking you if, at the meeting held, after the RPF attack, which determined that such training should take place, whether the lists of participants had already been drawn up.  Do you remember having said that in examination? 
A.	I said that after the meeting, the day after, we complied.  And initially we drew up lists.  As for the meeting, it was decided that people who were to undergo the training should be about 600 in number, the size of a battalion, so there was a need to look for people to train them.  And the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi were to be found so as to undergo the training.  However, I never said that those people gave us a list.  We are the ones who drafted a list.  
Q.	Witness BTH, let me re-read your statement dated 8th June 2006.  The French transcript is at page 43, line 32.  

"When the meeting took place, the organisation of the training had already been prepared.  When, at the meeting, we were told -- or, addressed, we were told one Karorero would be in charge of training of Amahindure."  

And further down you say:  "They had also planned or provided for reservists who would be responsible for training.  And they had also drawn up a list of people who were to undergo the training."  

So, what you are telling me is that -- unlike your previous assertions, that the list had not yet been drawn up?  
A.	Previously you asked me if lists had been drawn up for people who were to undergo training.  That is a question that was put to me.  And I said to you that that is not what I said, nor can I say it today.  I think the answers I gave to the Prosecutor were noted down.  Right from the onset of my testimony, I have always maintained that we are the ones who drew up lists.  It is not those public figures who drew up the lists.  However, it was up to them to designate personnel to organise the training.  For our part, it was part of our administrative duties to draw up the lists.  That is what I said.  
Q.	So you drew up the lists the day after the meeting; is that what you mean to say? 
A.	The meeting took place.  And the following day we went to the communal office.  There were about 120 people.  And we began to draw up lists.  Four days later, we began to undergo the training proper.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to refer you to your statement, page 150 of the 24th of September 2002, K-number K0248982 for the French, paragraph 3.  You stated:  "Four days after the meeting, Kajelijeli asked us to draw up a list of all able-bodied young men in the commune to be sent for training."  And this is my question:  Was it the day after the meeting, four days after the meeting?  Can you give me a specific answer, as well as a definitive answer?  
A.	Let me repeat the explanation.  The day after the meeting we began to draw up the lists.  A meeting took place, and the day after the Amahindure members began to draw up the lists.  Four days later the training began.  That is the explanation of the situation that obtained at the time.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you.  I would like to refer you to your statement D. NZ149, dated 18 October 2002, K0260333.  Line 5 from the top, we can read from the French version:  "The training began the day after the meeting."  What are your comments?  
A.	This can be explained based on the way the question was formulated.  If I was asked when we began those activities, I answered "the day after" because we started by drawing up the lists, and then the training proper.  So, the day we were trained in weapons handling was four days later.  However, the fact is the day after the meeting we began to implement the requests that had been made of us.  People gathered and we began to draw up the lists.  
Q.	Witness BTH, I think the Court will follow those statements very carefully so as to ascertain and assess the sequence, also based on the statements you have given as to when the training began and when the lists were drawn up so as to pick out the contradictions.  

Witness BTH, you brought up training in Israel.  Can you tell us a bit more about this?  
A.	This was reported to me by a third person, or persons.  I heard that Interahamwes had gone to receive training in Israel.  As far as I am concerned, I have no personal knowledge of this.  This was reported to me.  You may remember -- yes, I said it -- that these were things that were reported to me. 
Q.	Can you tell us by whom these things were reported to you? 
A.	I do not remember.  It is people who were discussing it.  I may be at fault for forgetting who mentioned it, but I do know that it was being said at the time.  
Q.	And those who were reporting this to you, were they providing you details? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did they not tell you where the training was taking place in Israel, in which town? 
A.	No.  Those who discussed it did not even know where Israel is, and therefore did not even know any of the towns in Israel.  
Q.	But you somehow believed their remarks, their words? 
A.	I do not know where people were trained.  I noticed that there were people who had already been trained.  The fact is that I was certain that some people had been trained, though I did not know where they had undergone this training.  
Q.	Were you also not told with whom they were trained? 
A.	You asked me if I had details, if I'd been provided with details on the training, and I answered in the negative. 
Q.	It was not in Israel -- was it not in Israel that the basics of ethnic extermination were taught?  
A.	Wherever that may be, whether in Rwanda or Burundi, the fact still stands that people were trained and then went to kill people.  It doesn't matter where the people were trained, whether it be in Mukingo, Kigali, all those people perpetrated killings.  And they did this on the orders of other persons.  That is what counts for me.  
Q.	So, the information you gave us on training in Israel is of no real consequence? 
A.	That information is important, but one has to look at the way I talked with regard to that information.  I told you that this was something I had heard about.  As for the facts I witnessed, I am careful to mention that.  Perhaps there is someone who has more information on the matter and who will come to talk to the Court about this.  However, I am certain that people were trained.  It doesn't matter where the training was dispensed.  
Q.	So, then let us revisit the facts you witnessed.  I would like to talk a little about Makoni.  Do you remember Makoni? 
MR. WEYL: 
Spelt M-A-K-O-N-I, for the record. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do you remember what you declared in examination-in-chief on the 8th? 
A.	Yes, I remember.  
Q.	Would you care to remind us what you had said? 
A.	I said that person was killed in 1994. 
Q.	Let me help you out, unless you recall the exact truth and are in a position to refresh your memory as to how Makoni's name came up.  
A.	In 1993, Nzirorera and Kajelijeli told us that we should kill Makoni.  He was accused of collaborating with the Inkotanyi.  At the time we failed to kill him, we noticed he had a firearm, and we felt that might be a problem.  In 1994, subsequently, he was killed by a soldier called Shyiramburyo.  I wonder whether you need any more information on the matter.  If that is the case, you can tell me.  
Q.	Witness BTH, I will tell you as we go along.  

Is it Mr. Kajelijeli who first mentioned Makoni?  
A.	What I remember, and what I can confirm, is that when we were told of the Makoni case, Nzirorera and Kajelijeli were together and they decided to have Makoni killed. 
Q.	Who first said Makoni's name in the conversation? 
A.	When we entered the house, we were asked to identify accomplices.  And in the course of that conversation, Makoni's name came up often.  And Kajelijeli confirmed that, indeed, he was an accomplice.  Nzirorera requested that that person be killed for that reason.  So, that he be -- Shyiramburyo therefore -- we were, therefore command -- ordered to fetch him and have him killed. 
Q.	Witness BTH, I know that you have a highly developed sense of the weight of words.  When you say that Makoni's name circulated, who first mentioned Makoni's name? 
A.	What I remember is that Makoni's name was brought up during that conversation.  Perhaps it is another person who mentioned it, but I do not remember.  I am telling you what I remember.  Makoni's name was mentioned, and the decision to kill him was taken on the spot.  That is what I remember on the matter.  
Q.	Witness BTH, am I to take it that today you cannot remember what you could remember on the 8th of June? 
A.	It is possible.  I might even forget what I said this morning.  If I remember any information, I will point it out to you. 
Q.	Witness BTH, to avoid any misunderstanding, I am not asking you to recall what you said on the 8th of June.  I am asking you to remember and tell me what happened in the course of a meeting at which Makoni's name was mentioned.  If you remember, and if you have the same recollection you had, and which you gave on the 8th of June -- do you not have the same recollection? 
A.	I have already said what I remember about Makoni, and you suggested I recall other elements.  And instead of doing that, you have brought something up -- something else up.  So you asked me a question, and I answered it.  During that meeting, Makoni's name was mentioned.  I may -- or, rather, I can recall exactly what Kajelijeli said about Makoni.  He said that Makoni was an Inkotanyi accomplice.  Nzirorera said that he ought to be killed for that reason.  You asked me to tell you what I remembered as having been said during that meeting.  Well, it was decided that Makoni should be killed.  
Q.	Witness BTH, I made you a promise, and I will keep my promise.  On the 8th of June 2006, you said, in testimony, in answer to a question by the Prosecutor:  "Do you remember what he said at the time?  He said -- this was in reference to Nzirorera, and we're referring to the period between February and July 1993.  "Do you remember what he said at the time?"  That is the Prosecutor's question.  And your answer was:  "When he was done speaking with the authorities, as usual, he remained with Kajelijeli and other officials from the region.  So then he called us and we entered the house, the living room.  He asked us if we had -- if there were accomplices, and then he told us that we should find those accomplices and submit the list to Kajelijeli.  So, the Interahamwe president said there was a problem with one Makoni."  Is this of assistance to you?  
A.	I did not deny this.  The people who were in attendance took the floor and expressed themselves.  And I told you that I am answering you based on the questions you are putting to me.  So, I did say that.  I can confirm it.  And there is no contradiction between what I am saying and what I said.  
Q.	Witness BTH, on the 19th of June 2006 at 14:30, I asked you, "Who first mentioned Makoni's name?"  You were unable to tell us.  Whereas on the 8th of June, in answer to a question by the Prosecutor, under oath, you asserted, very peremptorily, that Makoni's name was first mentioned by the president of the Interahamwe.  Is there no contradiction here? 
A.	There is no contradiction.  You asked me thousands of questions about the same subject.  I'm not certain you understand my explanation.  This is what I said:  Among those in attendance, someone brought up Makoni, because accomplices were to be sought.  Kajelijeli confirmed that Makoni was collaborating with the Inkotanyi.  So Kajelijeli and Nzirorera said that, because of that, he would have to be killed.  Verify -- you can cross-check with the transcript and you will see that that is what I said.  There is no contradiction, as far as I am concerned. 
Q.	Witness BTH, this will be weighed by the Chamber.  

May I make reference to other versions of the same events, and then you will be asked to comment.  The first version is the one you gave on the 24th of September 2002, Exhibit D. NZ150, K-number 0248982.  It is towards the end of a paragraph that begins "Personally".  You mention a meeting shortly after late 1993.  Nzirorera asked us to tell him about all accomplices of the Inkotanyi in the commune.  We gave him a long list of names, a large number of names.  He picked Makoni, a Hutu who owned bars, and he told us to kill him.  We failed to comply with these instructions.  Do you remember these statements? 
A.	Yes, I made those statements.  And there is no difference between that and what I have said.  And I explained why Makoni's name was picked out from all those designated.  It is because Makoni was well known.  
Q.	I read on from that same statement.  You said:  "We were unable to execute these instructions, but Makoni was killed by soldiers the day after."  Is there still no contradiction?  
A.	You know, Kinyarwanda is a complicated language.  I spoke in Kinyarwanda, and it may be understood that it is the day after.  I asked the Prosecutor that -- for a correction to be made.  I had said that, and I had always known, that he died in 1994. 
Q.	Witness BTH, once and for all, can you tell us when, and under what circumstances, you asked the Prosecutor to make those corrections? 
A.	The Prosecutor is here in Court.  When they come to prep us, the documents are corrected.  Whenever an error is found and pointed out, the Prosecutor has his way of amending.  And when he does not amend, he asks you to make it clear in testimony.  I spoke to the Prosecutor.  I spoke to the late Prosecutor, Greg, in February -- it was February this year.  I was supposed to give testimony during that period, but that did not happen.  So, whether it was in this context or in the other, I have always asked for the corrections to be made.  Makoni died in 1994, killed by the soldier whose name I mentioned.  The Chamber will have an opportunity to note that I had clearly called for a correction to be made on the matter.  
Q.	Witness, I believe that we will leave the late Prosecutor Lombardi to rest in peace, and we will refer to the transcript.  Last Friday, on the 14th, you answered --
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't know if it's really the appropriate thing for me to say at this point, but what I can confirm to the Chamber is that I've had conversations with this witness.  He's made numerous corrections.  And I simply cannot record all of them and keep filing witness statements.  Now, this witness has also corrected that information in his testimony during the first Karemera trial.  There have been numerous instances where this correction was brought to the attention of the parties.  Mr. Weyl can continue with this line of cross-examination.  I don't see what it's bringing to the Trial Chamber, but on the point of making corrections to the Prosecutor, I can confirm, as a professional statement, that several corrections were brought to our attention, but we simply cannot record every correction that a witness makes and constantly re-file will-say statements and witness statements.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it seemed to me that there was a practice of issuing will-say statements whenever there were corrections brought to the attention of the Prosecutor, and that under Rule 76 and 68, that he was under obligation to inform the Defence of such corrections.  I have no knowledge of a will-say that puts forth any corrections by this witness.  I will pursue my line of questioning which I have not yet exhausted, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I mean, I'm sorry to belabour the point but, as a matter of procedure, when the information is corrected in a subsequent statement or in subsequent file testimony, it's pointless to file a will-say.  And if we did that for every witness we would have dozens of statements being filed -- -
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, it is not necessary to belabour that point right now. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, on the 14th of June, in cross-examination by my friend Mr. Robinson at page 64, you indicated, in answer to the question:  "Did the Interahamwe or Amahindure kill anyone before the 7th of April 1994?"  

You said:  "I do not clearly recall.  I do not clearly recall, but if I do recall this, I will tell you."  

Further on, in answer to a question by Mr. Robinson, you said, at a point in time you were sent to kill an MDR member called Makoni, "Is that correct?"  

Your answer was:  "I do not know what his political affiliation was.  I do not know if he was an MDR member."  

Is that correct?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Witness BTH, may I refer you to your testimony in Bizimungu.  Tuesday, 12th October 2004, page 7, line 20.  

Question by the Prosecutor:  "Can you tell the Chamber if any member of the opposition parties in your commune or secteur was killed because he was a member, or supporter -- or, sympathiser of the Inkotanyi?"  

And you said:  "A person was killed because he was a member of a party.  His name was Makoni.  The person was killed because he was a member of the opposition party, and his name was Makoni.  He was killed in 1994."  

Now you are telling us you do not know Makoni's political affiliation, but in October 2004, you were saying that a person was killed because he was a member of a party.  Can you comment?  
A.	When he put the question to me, the counsel said that Makoni was an MDR member.  But that I did not know.  I do not know if he was an MDR member.  That distinction should be made.  The RPF was also a party.  There was the PSD, the PL, and many others.  So, in the question he asked me if Makoni was an MDR member, which I did not know, I could not confirm it.  
Q.	I will read -- I beg your pardon.  Should I observe a pause?  I will read the continuation of your answer on Tuesday 2004 (sic).  

In answer to this question:  "Can you briefly describe the circumstances of Makoni's killing?"  

Your answer is at line 27, and you said:  "Makoni was a member of the MDR party.  That is what we had been told.  We were told he should be killed because MDR members were Inkotanyi accomplices."  

In 2004, you knew -- did you know Makoni's -- rather, in 2004 you knew Makoni's political (unintelligible), but you do not know it today? 
A.	Let me explain.  At the time I was saying that we had been told he was an MDR member.  However, personally I had no such knowledge.  Do you want me to vouch for other person -- people's remarks, or statements?  I have no basis to make such an assertion.  I am happy that you are faithfully reporting the fact that we were told this, but it was not within my knowledge.  There was nothing to show that he was a member of that party.  Whenever -- it was regularly reported that the basis for this assertion was that he was someone who worked, or collaborated with the RPF.  
Q.	What authorised you to be so (unintelligible) under oath the 12th of October 2004? 
A.	I made clear in my answer that I was told, I had been told, we were told, and now you're asking me questions about my knowledge, my conviction.  At the time I said that we had been told that he was a member of the MDR, but I personally know that he never belonged to the MDR.  It is only what was alleged.  There's a distinction before -- between what I was told, what was said to me, and what I knew.  
Q.	You told us that Makoni had been denounced by the president of the Interahamwe.  Can I ask you to comment on that last extract from the transcript of the 12th of October 2004?  Question:  "Who told you he was a member of the Inkotanyi, and had a walkie-talkie?"  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel said a talkie-walkie.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	"It was Kajelijeli and Kabyeza (phonetic)".  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I think the name was. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	What are your comments? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Baheza. 
THE WITNESS: 
I never spoke of a walkie-talkie, I spoke of a telephone.  We were told that he had a telephone with which he communicated with the Inkotanyi.  And Kajelijeli confirmed that he was -- that he was aware of what was said about Makoni, and that he knew that he collaborated with the Inkotanyi, and it was then the decision was taken to kill that man on the basis of Kajelijeli's confirmation as to the allegations aired -- voiced against Makoni.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, I'm not inventing the reference to a talkie-walkie -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says counsel. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	-- it's on four occasions that you said it, on the 12th of October 2004, out of your mouth.  "Makoni had a --"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Again, talkie-walkie -- I'm sorry.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	"-- walkie-talkie, and he communicated with the enemy."  And you say that on other occasions.  Did you never mention a talkie-walkie?  
A.	I personally don't remember speaking of any radio; I spoke of a telephone, and how even they dismantled it, took it apart.  And it was said that he used -- used that telephone to communicate with the Inkotanyi, and that is what I said.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, can I request that it be admitted in evidence, the extract from Bizimungu et al, Tuesday, 12th October 2004, I think for the French transcript it's pages 7 and 8, and in the English it's pages 9 and 10.  And these will be exhibits D. NG21A for the French version, and D. NG21B for the English transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We already have that as D. NG20A and B.  I think it's the same pages.  
MR. WEYL: 
D. NG was the previous -- 20 was the previous page.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Can I offer the suggestion that we expand D. NG20 and have two pages so there's some continuity in the -- in the text.  What I have in the pages that was given to me by Mr. Weyl is pages 6, 7, and 8 of the French version, and pages 8, 9, and 10 of the English version.  And that's what I've labelled D. NZ20 (sic).  Because I think that's what Mr. Weyl had proposed earlier.  
MR. WEYL: 
Well, I thought that for -- to understand my cross-examination it would be better to separate the segments.  But I have no objection if the Trial Chamber prefers all three pages as a single exhibit.  Then that is all right, and the three pages will constitute, therefore, D. NG20A and B in respect of the languages of the transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  I think that will be preferable.  And it is accordingly ordered.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, I should like to speak of extremely painful matters, and I should like to do it in terms as least scandalous as possible.  I'm referring to the incidents of rape you've described.  For you, are these incidents or atrocious crimes? 
A.	Yes, it is an atrocious crime.  It is an extremely serious crime, to rape someone and then kill them.  
Q.	Well, you're getting ahead of me.  It's even worse when it is -- a rape is followed by murder and acts of barbarism.  We do agree?  
A.	Yes, you're quite right.  
Q.	When one witnesses such atrocious crimes, one forgets nothing of it.  We do agree?  
A.	It depends on the circumstances under which the acts were committed.  And sometimes there are reasons for forgetting some pictures. 
Q.	Do you think that you can give, on two occasions, different versions of the same events, or that the memory allows one, in respect of such serious crimes, to narrate them always the same way, or always give the same narrative of the events?  
A.	When you have learned a song, you begin with the first work -- word of the song, and you finish the last word of the song, you can repeat it every time without any mistake.  But if you ask me a question -- put a question to me in 2002 and put it to me again in 2006, I might begin with the last refrain and end with the first.  What counts is that the contents should be the same.  I can't always answer the same way, as though it was a song that I'd learned by heart.  That is impossible for me.  
Q.	Witness BTH, we agree it is the facts that count, not -- and when you -- when it's observed -- witness such serious facts, from one narrative to another the facts remain the same.  We do agree?  
A.	In fact, at the time the person suffering the most, and who should never forget, is the victim, or those close to the victim.  As to the assailants committing those atrocities, no one knew that he was going to call to answer for his crime and remember everything.  And among the assailants who were some who didn't care at all.  They didn't give a damn.  They couldn't remember everything.  
Q.	Witness BTH, with the assistance of the registrar, I should like you to see Exhibit -- Prosecution Exhibit P. 032, where two names figure, because in respect of those atrocious acts, we have taken precautions not to reveal the identity of the victims.  
MR. WEYL: 
Could the registry please show you Exhibit P. 032 on which the names of two victims, preceded by a number.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	And I should like to speak again of the events you witnessed concerning the first victim.  
A.	I don't think it's even necessary to show me that paper, because I know the names of the victims.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I want this on record, I don't want there to be any ambiguity, I want us to be sure that we're speaking of the same -- at the same time of the same victim, and I should like the witness to have the paper before him so that he can see the name of the victim whom we're going to speak of first.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do you have that paper before you, Witness?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In your mind, you see the name and you know in your mind whom we're speaking of? 
A.	Yes, I know that person. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us what happened on the 7th of April 1994 concerning that person?  
A.	She was raped and subsequently killed. 
Q.	Who by? 
A.	Rugumire Nteziyaremye, Mbonankira, Caporal, alias Gapfogo, and one Gatama.  There were also other rapists, but I have given the names of the people that I recall.  
Q.	She was raped in her home? 
A.	I don't know very well where they lived, but I know she was raped at home.  She lived in Busogo secteur -- her parents lived in Busogo and she lived near them.  
Q.	What happened after she was raped? 
A.	She was killed. 
Q.	Who by? 
A.	Rugumire. 
Q.	How did he kill her? 
A.	One of the assailants penetrated her genitalia with a piece of wood.  Other assailants also had brought dry grass to burn her alive, but did not do so.  
Q.	This is inscribed on your deepest memory? 
A.	Personally, those are -- that is what I remember perhaps before I remembered more.  But for the time being, those are the only details that come to mind.  
Q.	If I were to tell you that they were details that do not match your preceding statements, what would your comment be?  
A.	That's -- that is possible.  It's not easy to give all the details of a crime such as that.  And, moreover, it shames one to speak of such indecent things.  
Q.	Witness BTH, can you distinguish between a piece of wood and a sword? 
A.	Yes.  A piece of wood is different from a sword.  
Q.	I will read you your preceding statement of 23rd of August 2003.  I will leave out the name, but anyone -- everyone can -- can read the exhibit.  I will leave out what is worst, but I have to read as follows:  "I witnessed acts of rape during the genocide.  I was present when a Tutsi lady by the name of" -- I'll say number 1 -- "was raped and killed.  That incident" --  it is not the word I use, it is in the transcript.  "The incident occurred in Ruhengeri cellule, Busogo secteur, Mukingo commune.  She was found at home by Interahamwe who took her into the bushes.  The Interahamwe in question were Celestin Mbonankira, alias Gapfogo, Rugumire Nteziyaremye" -- N-T-E-Z-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E -- "Gatama, and several others."  Up to there there's not too much contradiction.  "That Tutsi lady was raped by those three men, then Rugumire penetrated her with a sword."  There is a contradiction.  Can we have your comment?  
A.	What I can say is that the events took place, whether I spoke of a sword or a piece of wood.  I personally thought it was a sword, but subsequently, when we checked it out, we found it was a piece of wood.  So I have the right to say here the truth.  When she was disinterred, it was discovered that it was a piece of wood.  At the disinterment it was noted that it was a piece of wood and not a sword.  But, what difference is there, basically?  Perhaps the objects are different, the objects used to penetrate her genitalia, but the facts remain the same. 
Q.	I'm very sorry, but it's sometimes with the small details that a statement can be taken for genuine or fabricated.  There's another detail in your statement of the 26th of August 2003 and that you did not narrate.  You added, in August 2003:  "It was Rugumire that penetrated her, and he cut off one breast."  That was not a detail that sprang to mind in your testimony before this Trial Chamber?  
A.	No, I think they conflated two events.  The first victim, an object was -- she was penetrated with an object.  As to the second victim, that was the one who had a breast cut off.

1515H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	BTH, I'm sorry to contradict you, but in your narration of the rapes you said you witnessed, the first rape concerning victim number 1 is referred to in the last paragraph in your statement of -- page 5 of your statement of the K0275136 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could counsel repeat?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	The second victim is mentioned in the second paragraph on page 6, K0275136.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Perhaps we should ask counsel to repeat those two page numbers.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	We have to, together, go over what you said here, what you -- here in the last few days and what you said in August 2003.  Can you tell us what you remember of those atrocious crimes of the 7th of April?  I'm now referring to the second witness -- the second name on P032.  
A.	Iyamuremye undressed her and Iyamuremye cut off her breast and then licked the blood.  
Q.	I'm sorry to be looking for items to nourish the record, to feed the record.  Could you tell us what happened in the order in which the events occurred, all the facts, but nothing but the facts?  You have taken an oath.  Now, please narrate to us -- relate to us what you remember in respect of that victim on the 7th of April 1994.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll sorry, but I'm objecting at this point.  Clearly there's -- Mr. Weyl has a right to probe this witness to examine the issue of credibility but beyond a certain point it becomes a bit distasteful and unproductive, and here we have a situation where the witness has recounted several times already the specific facts of this incident.  What is really to be achieved by going over this incident over and over again?  It doesn't hurt the Prosecution, but is this really what we need to do in order to assess this witness's credibility?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I think this isn't only a question of the witness's credibility, but we want him to tell us what he witnessed in an order that we can comprehend in reference to preceding statements so that we can assess that these are events he witnessed, or stories that he's fabricating. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, the witness was confronted with a contradiction.  That contradiction was brought out, and he offered an explanation.  I stated that with the disinterment -- I assume that's a reburial of the victim -- facts were brought to light that distinguished what was uncovered years after the event from his initial account.  Does this Trial Chamber really need to go over this incident repeatedly in order to make an assessment of this portion of the witness's evidence?  
MR. WEYL:
These were questions that were raised in examination-in-chief, and I think it is proper for the Defence to discuss it.  It is not us who brought up the case of the victims we are speaking of, it was the Prosecution.  It was their choice to do so, and we have to cross-examine so that the Bench can appreciate and, otherwise, the cross-examination can lead to us refuting the testimony of Witness BTH. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Mr. Weyl.  To stop this discussion, we are allowing you to continue your cross-examination, but the question you asked the witness was simply to repeat what he had said before.  You wanted him to re-state what occurred.  It's not necessary for him to regurgitate the evidence he gave in-chief.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, at the time of your examination-in-chief on the 12th of June, you stated that "When that person was attacked, I was present."  Do you confirm that? 
A.	I confirm it.  I was indeed present.  There were many of us there.
Q.	You then continued by saying, "She was undressed."  Can you tell us who undressed her?  
A.	The Interahamwe; Iyamuremye, to be specific. 
Q.	It was Iyamuremye, then, who gave her a knife thrust; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it was he who did it. 
Q.	It was something important, that knife thrust? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Was it that knife thrust that amputated her breast? 
A.	No.  Why do you go on asking me the same questions?  I think I've answered all those questions.  I don't know if you take pleasure in continuing to put the same questions to me in speaking of those events. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has a point, you know.  
MR. WEYL:
I have one last question, Mr. President.  I assure you that I take no pleasure in this.  I'm playing my part, which is to undertake the defence of one of the defendants in this joint trial, and it is my duty to underscore contradictions.  And I should like the witness's comment on an important event such as the knife thrust by Iyamuremye on the victim is not mentioned in the testimony of the 26th of August 2003.  And on the 26th of August 2003, it was not something important.  
THE WITNESS:
I have told you that that is a serious crime and it is not easy for me to speak in detail of everything that occurred.  There are some details that I can't dare mention.  That girl was killed, and she had her breasts cut off.  You can check with the Gacaca in Rwanda or with the prosecutor's office.  I don't know if it really is in your interest to go on making me speak of these events, which did take place, and of which I have spoken at length. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Among the various successive variations, you have spoken of things which you did not witness.  And I should like to add one last series of questions.  I want to speak of the bus.  You remember the bus that stopped at Byangabo trading centre? 
A.	Yes, I do remember it. 
Q.	That was when? 
A.	In 1994 after President Habyarimana's demise. 
Q.	Could you be more specific as to the date?  
A.	No. It was after the 7th of April 1994, say between the 7th and the day we fled. 
Q.	Witness BTH, you're not co-operating with me very much, because in other answers you said at the end of May, beginning of June.  Do we agree?  
A.	I don't know how you want me to -- I don't know how you want me to assist you, but the events I referred to, to try and make an estimate, I tell you that it happened between the 7th of April and when the Inkotanyi took the country.  
Q.	Witness, on two occasions you were more specific because during questioning on the 12th of June, you said, "end of April, beginning of May," and in your statement of the 26th of August 2004, you spoke of May 1994.  Do you remember?  
A.	Yes.  Well, that period you've just mentioned is indeed between the 7th of April and the taking of the country by the RPF. 
Q.	Yes, we agree on that.  In answer to the Prosecution's question, "Do you remember if there was a roadblock where the bus came to a stop," you answered, "No, there was no roadblock."  You confirm that?  
A.	I can confirm that.  
Q.	Witness BTH, it's again on details that a statement can stumble.  I refer to your statement of the 26th of August 2003 that no doubt the Prosecution had in mind when they put this question to you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel has again given a number that escaped the interpreter, a K-number.  Sorry.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Third line:  "I remember the case of Tutsi refugees in a bus.  It was in May 1994.  The bus was stopped at the roadblock in Byangabo centre."  What do you say to that?  
A.	No, there was no roadblock at that place.  The bus was stopped there for a reason, and sometimes it wasn't a roadblock as such.  You could just take a piece of wood and lay it across the road, and then after a while remove the piece of wood. 
Q.	Well, that's a new description of the roadblocks erected in the course of the tragedy of April 1994.  We will have other occasions to speak of this.  Was there -- so was there or was there not a roadblock?  Your last version is that there was no roadblock.  
A.	No, there was no roadblock.  I told you how we went about stopping vehicles. 
Q.	In response to the Prosecution's question, you answered the question as to whether the woman -- women were removed from the bus.  You said, "Some women were removed."  Did the others stay in the bus?  
A.	I said that some women were taken away to be raped; others stayed in the bus.  I never said that all the women had been taken from the bus.  
Q.	The Prosecutor put another question to you:  "Can you comment on the ethnicity of those women?  Tell us if they were Tutsi, whether they looked like Tutsi or whether they looked like members of another ethnic group on the basis of what you observed."  Do you remember the answer you gave? 
A.	I think I answered, "I don't know."  I think I answered that I didn't know.  
Q.	What you said is specifically, "Counsel, I cannot clarify or confirm with certainty whether they were Tutsi or Hutu because they were not asked to show their ID cards."  That was your answer.  Is it helpful to you?  
A.	Well, that's what I've just said.  I did not know.  
Q.	Well, didn't the Prosecution question surprise you?  Were there buses -- busloads of Hutu refugees at the time?  
A.	It depends which period you are talking of and where the people were coming from because in the entire region of Kigali there was combat and people were fleeing.  People were fleeing from Kigali or from other places and would pass through our region.  The war was raging in some parts of the country. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I think that with that answer, I might suggest that we take the afternoon break.  I don't know if this is the appropriate time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  How much longer do you think you are going to take?  
MR. WEYL:
About an hour, on the short side of an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the mid-afternoon recess now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
May I also request that the Court enquire of Mr. -- Maître Sow how long he would be likely to take so we have some estimate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You want to know if you're going to complete your re-direct this afternoon.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, is there any chance of that? 
 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I have already said that I think I would take three hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but that might be the subject of some revision, so I was just enquiring, are you still -- do you still need so much time?  
MR. SOW:
From what I have in hand at the moment, I think it would be a maximum of three hours.  It might be that I will forego some questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take the mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1530H to 1601H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl, you may continue.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, I would now like to discuss the 7th of April 1994.  At what time did you learn of the death of the president?  
A.	Between 1:00 and 6:30 a.m., through the radio broadcasts. 
Q.	Can you tell me which radio station?  Can you tell me if it was Radio Rwanda or RTLM?  
A.	It was Radio Rwanda. 
Q.	What would you say if I were to tell you that Radio Rwanda no longer made broadcasts after midnight? 
A.	What I know is that I heard the news on Radio Rwanda.  This was an unusual event, and I heard the news.  There was also classical music on the radio.  The circumstances were exceptional. 
Q.	Where were you when you heard the news? 
A.	I was at home, at our house. 
Q.	Were you in the common room with your parents, brothers and sisters? 
A.	I was at my parents' house, at home. 
Q.	So between 1 a.m. and 6:30 a.m., you were not sleeping? 
A.	I told you that it was during that period between the two times I indicated that I heard of the death of the president, and then I went back to bed.  I woke up in the morning of the following day. 
Q.	Perhaps it is a translation problem.  But were you asleep when you heard the news? 
A.	Can one hear something when one is asleep?  It is not possible. 
Q.	So you heard the news on radio and then went back to sleep? 
A.	There was a radio set in the room where I slept. 
Q.	So, as you say, when you heard the news between 1:00 and 6:30 a.m., you do not recall if you went back to sleep after the news? 
A.	I did not tell you I was outside the house when I heard the news of the president's death.  After hearing the news, I went back to sleep. 
Q.	And it is between 6 and 7 a.m. that you went to have your tea; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, quite correct.  I went to have a cup of tea in the morning. 
Q.	Would you -- and you took your tea at the Byangabo centre restaurant? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	At that point were you in the restaurant when you saw Kajelijeli's vehicle passing, followed by Baheza? 
A.	After having tea, I went outside on to the verandah, and that is when we saw Kajelijeli's vehicle, Baheza passing by there.  
Q.	How many vehicles did you see? 
A.	I saw Kajelijeli's vehicle and that of Baheza. 
Q.	You did not see Nyabusore's vehicle then? 
A.	I did not see Nyabusore's vehicle moving.  I just saw it at Nzirorera's mother's house. 
Q.	Witness, may I remind you of your statement dated 11 March 2003, K02971, paragraph 2, "After learning of the president's death, I waited until 5 or 6 a.m. and then left my house and went to the Byangabo market to meet my Interahamwe friends.  While I was there, I saw Kajelijeli arrive at Nzirorera's mother's house, in a red vehicle.  He was followed by Baheza, who had also come aboard a red vehicle, and the ISAE director, Jean Baptiste Nyabusore, who arrived in a white vehicle."  

May I have your comments? 
A.	Yes.  I said that I found those three vehicles at -- rather, that those three vehicles were at Nzirorera's mother's house.  I gave a description of the vehicles.  However, two of the vehicles passed by the place where I was, whereas the third vehicle I only found at Nzirorera's mother's house.  So I did see the three vehicles in question. 
Q.	The Court will assess.  Witness BTH, Dusabimana and Niyigaba arrived.  Was this prior to the vehicles passing or was it after the vehicles had passed? 
A.	They arrived after those vehicles passed.  
Q.	A long time afterward? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Then you told us that a child came to look for them and that they went there; that is, to the house of Nzirorera's mother.  That is what you told us.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So if I understood it correctly, and if I try to picture the scene, Dusabimana and Niyigaba are called by a child and they go to Nzirorera's mother's house.  Thereafter, you joined them there.  Is that the position? 
A.	The child came and spoke to Dusabe, telling him that they wanted to see him.  Dusabe asked Niyigaba to escort them and then I joined them.  Dusabe, first of all, left.  And moments later he returned and asked Niyigaba to accompany him, and then I went after them. 
Q.	When you arrived at Joseph Nzirorera's mother's house, where was Dusabimana?  
A.	We were together. 
Q.	Dusabimana, did he not enter the house? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	What about Niyigaba, did he enter the house? 
A.	I remember clearly that Dusabimana remained standing outside because we kept on chatting outside.  
Q.	So, you do not remember where Dusabimana was, but you do recall being in discussion with Niyigaba; is that correct? 
A.	You asked me if Dusabe entered the house and I told you I did not remember.  The one -- or what I can recall is that Niyigaba was present and that -- Dusabe was present, but I do not recall him at the time when he entered the house.  Moreover, I did not remain there for a long time.  I went back afterwards. 
Q.	Upon your departure from the house, prior to your departure, you did not see Dusabimana again? 
A.	I did see him. 
Q.	You saw him at the house of Joseph Nzirorera's mother or at the market? 
A.	At his house.  I must point out that this man was at his parents' house, at the house of his parents.  
Q.	Yes, but before going to his parents' house, he was called by a child because he was with you, and it is only when he was called that he went -- when he was called that he went to Joseph Nzirorero's mother's house.  
A.	That is what I am saying.  I told you they came to call him, and then when we left, we headed towards his parents' home.  So he left that place and later joined me at the Byangabo marketplace.  I have explained this to this Court many times. 
Q.	That is what I'm trying to understand so as to picture the scene.  So let me start again.  Dusabimana and Niyigaba arrive; a child comes to fetch them; they go to Joseph Nzirorera's mother's house; you follow them; then you tell us you do not see where Dusabimana is and that Michel Niyigaba is in the yard, with you.  That is what you have explained.  
A.	I never said I did not know where Dusabe was.  The question was you put was did Dusabe not enter the house.  I told you that I did not remember, I did not know, but I never said I did not know where he was.  Again, you have asked me if Niyigaba asked me -- whether Niyigaba had entered the house.  I told you that I knew Niyigaba was outside because I was talking to him. 
Q.	So let me rephrase my question.  You say you did not see Dusabimana outside the house when you arrived there?
A.	I went with Dusabe.  Upon our arrival, that was his home, his parents' house.  I could not go about checking whether he had got into the house.  What I needed to know was that we were together in that place.  Now, when you ask me if I saw him enter the house, I tell you I do not remember.  
Q.	To borrow from a famous play, "a door must be open or closed."  When you get to the house, if Dusabimana is not outside the house, we can deduce that he was inside the house.  
A.	That is not what I said.  I did not say he was not outside.  I told you we arrived together.  I was with him.  We were together.  You mention an open door or closed door.  Do you know which main door or access door they used?  Counsel, do you know?  Given the location of the entrance to the house, from where we were standing you cannot see the entrance.  There was more than one door, if my memory serves me right, there were about three.  But I do not remember whether at a given point in time he entered the house. 
Q.	So, in conclusion on this point, you do not know what became of Dusabimana when you went together?  
A.	You are trying to make me say what I did not say, Counsel.  You asked me if I had seen him enter the house.  I told you I could not remember.  But he was in the area, in the vicinity.  He was on the spot. 
Q.	Let us put the question differently.  Once you arrived with Dusabimana at the house, what did you see?  What did he do? 
A.	I do not remember what he did.  I was more concerned with seeing what Kajelijeli and Baheza were doing.  They were in discussion, and then I left the place.  And when I noticed that no particular statement was to be made, I left the place. 
Q.	Finally, though, perhaps you did not arrive at the same time as Dusabimana at Nzirorera's mother's house?  
A.	But if I am here and someone else is at the door, what do you expect me to say?  We're in the same place.  What I do remember is that he was called; he asked Michel to escort him and I went with them.  I was with Michel and he was in front of us.  
Q.	Very well.  You were with Michel Niyigaba in the house -- rather, in the yard of the house.  And then you see Kajelijeli and Nyabusore talking; is that correct? 
A.	He was there in the yard. 
Q.	So you see, they are not saying anything special and then you go back to the marketplace, correct? 
A.	I got to the spot, noticed that they were talking, but since they were not telling us anything, I left and returned to the market. 
Q.	Without seeing Dusabimana again?  
A.	Who told you that, Counsel, that I did not see him again?  The house where we were is Dusabimana's parents' house, therefore, he was present. 
Q.	So you saw Dusabimana again? 
A.	I believe I have answered the question.  I have no other answer to give you, and I will not repeat it again.  
Q.	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The question was lost. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	At that time you said that Dusabimana and Niyigaba returned to the market? 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Previous question and answer were not heard by the interpreter.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	At that time did you hear instructions issued by one to the other?  
A.	Dusabimana -- Dusabe spoke to Michel Niyigaba and asked him to go and fetch Rukara, to make an example out of Rukara.  
Q.	So you heard with your own ears Dusabe order Niyigaba to go and look for Rukara; is that correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	At the marketplace at that point; do we agree? 
A.	Yes.  That is where we congregated in front of the restaurant.  
Q.	So you await orders issued by Dusabe to Niyigaba; are we in agreement? 
A.	I have answered that question, Counsel.  
Q.	May I remind you of your statements of 26th August 2003?  Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to do that right now because I cannot trace the -- find the document.  Give me a moment's indulgence.  

That is K0275135 in the French.  And you said, "On the 7th of April in the morning, after the president died, there was a meeting at Nzirorera's mother's house.  Present at this meeting were Kajelijeli, Baheza, Nyabusore, François Dusabimana, Nzirorera's younger brother."  So, according to you in August 2003, Dusabimana had attended the meeting.  Do we agree that that is how this passage should be interpreted? 
A.	Dusabe was in the place where those people were standing, and you asked me where they were, and I told you they were at his parents' house.  There is no contradiction in that.  
Q.	There is no contradiction, but here you know that he had attended the meeting which you are now not in a position to confirm to the Court.  After the meeting, Dusabimana called Michel to give him instructions; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  That is what I said.  When we were in Byangabo, he said, "Let's go and kill the Tutsis."  After that, he spoke to Michel and said, "Go and bring Rukara so that we make an example out of him."  Those are the instructions, are they not?  
Q.	Witness BTH, before I continue to read from your previous statement, whereby you add, "Then Michel Niyigaba told me what he had been told, we were told to avenge the death of the president, and the first to be killed was one Rukara."  Is that correct?  
A.	I don't know how you understand it.  I am made to appear before the Chamber to give details and expand on statements given in Ruhengeri or Kigali.  These were -- this is a rather general statement.  In court, I have come to provide details based on the questions I'm asked.  When I left Nzirorera's mother's house, I went to Byangabo.  I saw Dusabe and Niyigaba arrive after me.  Dusabe said, 'Let's go and kill the Tutsis'.  He saw that nobody had moved, was doing anything, and he said that whoever remained there and did not participate in the activity would be killed.  And right away he asked Niyigaba to bring Rukara, in order to make an example out of him.  

So, I am providing additional details to the same events.  These are the same events.  Basically, Dusabe gave orders to that person.  I must remind you that this is not the lyric of a song which I must recite identically every time.  It is the same events but which I recount differently.  
Q.	Witness BTH, you see, the problem for me is in order to understand why it is necessary for Niyigaba to give you or recount the instructions issued by Dusabimana, if you had heard them directly because Dusabimana gave the instructions to Michel in your presence.  What then was the necessity of Niyigaba repeating the instructions to you or telling you what the instructions were if you had already heard them? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll sorry, I'm going to object to the form of the question.  This is really starting to get abusive now.  The witness has recounted the same events at least three or four times; at least two or three times for Mr. Weyl alone; he repeated the same account for Mr. Robinson; and he testified extensively on direct.  And I don't see -- you know, my submission to the Court is it gets to a point where it's pointless and abusive, and clearly the witness is getting irritated, and who could blame him at this point?  

Now, if Mr. Weyl is bringing to light a contradiction, that's one thing, but to have him repeat the same account over and over and over again does not serve the interests of this trial or the fair trial interests of anybody who is participating in this exercise.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, does the Trial Chamber want me to answer or have you noted that I wasn't regurgitating the same questions but asking the witness to explain an evident contradiction between the fact that he heard directly -- he said he heard with his own ears the instructions given by Dusabimana to Niyigaba, and elsewhere he said that it was necessary for him to receive the instructions through Niyigaba?  It is not regurgitating to ask the witness to explain that contradiction.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, my objection is one of form.  This witness cannot say why Dusabimana did or said the things that he did.  He can recount to this Court what he heard.  He's done that before, but Mr. Weyl's question is asking him why does Dusabimana have to say thus-and-such if he said it before.  He's asking the witness to reflect on why another individual said and did the things he did.  In this context, it's not appropriate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I also do not see it as a contradiction.  He said both people made statements to him.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, going by what this witness has said here, he tells us that he heard the instructions given directly, that he was an ear witness, if not an eyewitness, whereas in his preceding statements he'd said that he'd received instructions through an intermediary.  It is not the same answer.  I should like the witness to comment on this difference between being a direct witness and an indirect witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you established that the previous statement was inconsistent with what he said in evidence?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I heard the witness say that he'd heard directly Dusabimana giving his instructions to Niyigaba in front of him, at the marketplace, that he was a direct witness because he'd heard it with his own ears.  And there is a statement where he says on the 26th of August 2003, that he heard the instruction to go and get Rukara indirectly through Niyigaba. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, do you understand what is being asked of you?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth is saying they did not interpret the debate that should took place for the witness.  
MR. WEYL:
It would be too much to ask me to re-state my part of the debate.  I can, if the Chamber authorises, reformulate the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, that would be much better. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I have a more general question.  Was this an exceptional situation where the colloquy was not interpreted or is this the way the language -- the interpretation staff proceeds generally?  I'm just curious for the record.  I'd like to know what the witness is hearing.  I presumed all along that unless the witness was instructed to take off his earphones, that he was hearing everything that was said in the Trial Chamber.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, that certainly is the way it's supposed to be.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, this is the Kinyarwanda booth:  We do not usually interpret the legal debates for the witnesses, but if you want us to, we should do so, you should give us a sign because otherwise we don't know on what tune to dance.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The point is, it's not necessary for the legal discussion to be interpreted.  I think we assumed that it was, but I don't have a problem with this position.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the Prosecution would prefer that everything be translated unless there's a specific instruction that the witness is not to hear it, and at that point we could ask him to remove his headphones or for him to exit the room.  But I have been operating on the principle all along that everything is being translated in all languages when we have a witness that's Kinyarwanda speaking. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but it depends on who the -- for whose benefit the legal discussion is for.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The problem is sometimes the questioning continues with the presumption that the witness has understood what was being discussed, and if that's not the case, then it needs to be made explicit.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I think Mr. Webster is quite right, and certainly that was what we were assuming also.  I don't know what's happened with this specific team, but normally that is the rule, unless requested, as you said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we can proceed now, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
So the Trial Chamber allows me to put the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I remind you that it's now 4:43.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I am coming to the end of my cross.  I had announced that it would take a day.  We began a bit later this morning.  I will finish a bit earlier this afternoon, well within the duration I had announced, in spite of the objections that arose in the course of the debate.  So, for the last time, I put the question to the witness.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Before this Trial Chamber, BTH, you said that you were a direct ear witness to Dusabimana's instructions to Niyigaba.  In your preceding statement, you'd said that you were an indirect witness.  Can you tell us -- can you comment on that contradiction and specify for what reason you tell us today that you were a direct witness, whereas heretofore you were an indirect witness? 
A.	The two things occurred, but all depends on the question put to me.  In 2003 I was asked if I knew anyone else who could corroborate what I said, and I said that Michel had spoken to me about it.  Now, today I repeat to you that I personally heard Dusabe ask Niyigaba to go and fetch Rukara so that we could use him for an example.  I can tell you with certainty today that Dusabimana gave that order, and I heard him do it, give it.  

Another thing is, in our activities, given the relationship between -- the position I was in and that of Michel, it's clear I could ask him why this or that was done, because of the position I occupied, I was in.  I wouldn't want things to be done without it being explained to me.  So, in view of my position, I could ask him for explanations, in view of the position I occupied and that of Michel.  I was free to put questions to him, in other words, as to what was going on.  And he could speak to the committee about the procedure to be followed.  
Q.	I come back to your statement of the 26th of August 2003.  That is not what you said.  You said, "After the meeting, Dusabimana called Michel to give him instructions."  So you're not included there.  
A.	But who else was present?  You, Counsel?  I was present, and I know very well that that's how it occurred.  I heard what Dusabe said to Michel.  And, secondly, Michel and I were allowed by the committee's rules to inform each other, and he informed me of what he knew and I also did the same in return.  Moreover, as it was an important event, an important operation, it was incumbent upon me to flush out the details, and he could.  But as to those words, I personally heard them.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the Bench will evaluate.  I should like to finish with a few questions on the information provided by the witness on his preceding statements since 1994.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you said that before September 2002, you did not -- you had not spoken the truth; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You say, "I gave you the reasons which drove me to give false testimony"; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's what I said. 
Q.	It's sufficient, therefore, to have reasons to bear false witness, to give false testimony?  
A.	What matters is to speak the truth here.  If I did not speak the truth -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth is asking, Mr. President, if you can ask the witness to repeat.  They did not quite catch what he said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the interpreters did not quite get your last answer.  Could you please repeat it?  
THE WITNESS:
I have just said that Defence counsel has a problem because I am speaking the truth.  I said that at one time, until 2002, I've explained the reasons for which I gave false testimony.  If I said this before the Trial Chamber, it is to explain, to be able to speak all the truth on those events.  I think that's the counsel's problem, the fact that I am speaking the truth and that I had reasons for, at one time, not doing so.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you also have good reasons to not speak the entire truth before the Gacaca? 
A.	Were you present at my trial before the Gacaca court?  When you look at the conviction, my conviction, you will see that they were satisfied with what I stated before them.  Unless you have information as to my not speaking the truth before the Gacaca commission, which in my opinion you do not possess. 
Q.	I will not come back to the question put by my colleague, Counsel Robinson, but referring to documents that we do not possess, if at all they exist.  But before the Gacaca, did you state that you had, according to you, sent your Interahamwe to Ruhengeri appeals court in February 1994? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, I'm not sure, was it February or April?  
THE WITNESS:
Article 44 of the law establishing the Gacaca commission provides that each Gacaca court is competent for the area of its jurisdiction.  The crimes committed at the court -- appeals court concerns another court and were not discussed at Mukingo Gacaca court.  When the time comes when we will speak of the events at Kabaya, it is not impossible that I be called to explain.  Moreover, in all my testimony, those events are mentioned.  

What has not yet been done -- or, what has been done, and you can refer to the Rwandan government, is the exchange of information between Busogo and Kabaya that concerns the Gacaca -- directly concerns the Gacaca court.  As you have said yourself, they are documents that are not in your possession, but to suggest that they don't exist is not true; that is false.  Those documents exist and I tell you that you -- if you look for them, you can find them.  Because even the documents you have, you found them somewhere.  So the documents that you lack can be found.  Perhaps those documents might give you problems if you don't look for them.  Perhaps you only look for documents that are of interest for you.  But you should seek out all the documents concerning those events. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness BTH, you've been very lengthy in your answer.  But I think I understand one thing:  Your fate is not entirely decided before the Gacaca courts; is that correct? 
A.	What I can say for the time being, if you go to Kigombe and you -- if you went to Kigombe and didn't find the documents concerning Kabaya, the fault is that of the people responsible for disclosing documents.  The important thing for me is to speak of those events.  The rest concerns the functioning of the Gacaca courts.  

I will give you an example.  Busogo Gacaca court cannot judge me for events concerning Musumba.  They judge you for facts, events that you are accused of.  
Q.	You have again been very lengthy with a specific answer.  You can still be prosecuted before the Gacaca courts for things you are accused of.  Do we agree on that? 
A.	I will explain to you, Counsel.  I can be called, summoned, called to appear before Gacaca court but the Gacaca court must consider whether I have referred to those events elsewhere.  In case it can be shown that I have already spoken of the events before a Gacaca court that charged me, the new Gacaca court will follow the judgement and conviction of the first Gacaca court.  
Q.	But you did not speak of the Ruhengeri appeals court because that Gacaca did not have jurisdiction, we do agree? 
A.	That is not correct.  When you testify, you mention everything, and then the tribunal judges you on the basis of the facts for which the court has jurisdiction.  Unless you want me to explain to you the entire law establishing and organising the Gacaca procedure.  I was convicted by the Gacaca courts according to the law, and you are seeming to suggest that I lied to the Gacaca courts.  Well, Gacaca courts are different from French legislation.  As far as I know, you don't have Gacaca courts in France. 
Q.	Witness BTH, you have answered my question because I asked you:  Did you, before the Gacaca court, say that you had given instructions to Interahamwe to go and commit massacres at Ruhengeri Appeals Chamber.  You said, "That matter was not discussed, so there's no point in coming back on it."  
A.	No, let me repeat to you the following.  I did not give instructions to the Interahamwe.  I said the following:  Kajelijeli called me, asked me to gather people together.  It was Kajelijeli and Baheza who gave the orders.  It was not me that gave the orders.  I was asked to go and fetch people, and I did that.  But I never gave them -- please understand this:  I never gave them any order to go to the appeals court.  But the person who gave that order did ask me to go and get -- assemble these people, and fetch those people. 
Q.	Witness, I would like to quote to you your -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry -- 
MR. WEYL:
I apologise.  K02071972, 11th of March. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Some year.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	You declared on the 14th of April 1994, "I was called by Kajelijeli.  He asked me to gather my Interahamwe together, to go and kill the Tutsi at the Ruhengeri appeals court.  I sent my Interahamwe to do that task but I did not do it myself."  You confirm having given instructions to your Interahamwe to kill the refugees at Ruhengeri appeals court? 
A.	No.  You are putting words in my mouth.  I can't speak of my Interahamwe; I'm not the MRND.  I'm not one of those leaders sitting over there.  Kajelijeli called me, asked me to find Interahamwe so that they could go and assist the Interahamwe and the CDR people from Ruhengeri to go and kill the Tutsi.  It wasn't -- there's not only that document in your hand which exists, but how could I express myself thus?  How could I say "my Interahamwe"?  I know who the owners -- the people answerable for those Interahamwe.  

Kajelijeli called me and the people he asked me to call, I brought them before him.  It is not I that took the Interahamwe to Ruhengeri, and they didn't come to speak to me anyhow, they came to speak to Kajelijeli. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I think that -- I think we can at this late hour refer to the transcript, which is quite clear on all these matters, and I shall finish with my first question:  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So you did not, before the Gacaca court, say that you'd given the order to kill?  
A.	I told you that all that is in my file.  If you find all the documents, you will see that all that is there.  And when you -- once you have found those documents, we will know who is speaking the truth in all this.  
(Pages 50 to 65 by Karen Holm)




























1700H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I come back to my first question which was my conclusion.  You told us that if there was any interest in lying one could lie and give false -- false testimony.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	That happened before but there is no reason for it now. 
Q.	Still under the threat of Gacaca proceedings in Rwanda, is that not correct? 
A.	In case it was discovered -- a crime was discovered of which I was guilty, that I did not mention, yes, in such a case I might be called to appear before the Gacaca courts. 
Q.	So it still is in your interest to lie? 
A.	I have not mentioned any reason which would lead me to tell an untruth.  I have come here to speak the truth.  And I'm sure that I know much better than you do what happened in Rwanda, because most of the events occurred before my eyes, just as we can see each other here, now. 
Q.	You made many statements since 1995.  We do agree? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Very many untruthful statements until 2002; is that correct? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	You know that yourself we mentioned it repeatedly before this Trial Chamber?  You made many statements before the Gacaca and we have to sort out between what might be mitigating, lead to a certain indulgence towards you and that -- and the other.  
A.	Well, apparently, you were present.  I told you I was convicted after my confession was accepted as being truthful.  The conviction wasn't -- the decision wasn't come to because I lied.  I spoke the truth before the Gacaca court. 
Q.	But you have often testified falsely before the Tribunal; is that not correct? 
A.	No, there are not several trials, there's three Trial Chambers.  I appeared before three Trial Chambers. 
Q.	This is the fourth trial in which you are testifying? 
A.	Quite possibly.  But to my mind it was Government I -- the Government I trial where Nzirorera was accused.  And now it is the same trial.  Now for you it is a different trial.  Well, we can leave it at that. 
Q.	And at -- each time you met the Prosecution team to be prepared to speak before the Trial Chamber?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And each time you saw your successive statements and the contradictions therein? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And each time you tried to make the story more coherent; is that correct? 
A.	No. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, in suggesting that Witness BTH has no time spoken the truth in the course of these debates, I think that the Trial Chamber will be able to assess his performance.  For my part, I have finished with the witness.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you have been examined by three lawyers already and your testimony is still not finished.  You now have to respond to questions put to you by counsel for Mr. Karemera.  He will commence his examination now.

Mr. Sow.
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	So, as the President said, I am co-counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera.  I will ask you a number of questions.  The first line of questioning is a continuation from Mr. Frederic Weyl.  

I would like to ask you:  Before 2002, you say you did not tell the truth because you feared for your life; correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	According to you, when you began to tell the truth, that is in particular since 2002, this presupposes that you no longer had fears for your life? 
A.	Yes, I was no longer afraid since that -- there was now rule of law in the country.  The laws were respected.  And if you want concrete examples, I am prepared to provide them to you. 
Q.	So, Witness, can you explain to me why on the 13th of June 2006, in this courtroom, you did declare in cross-examination by Mr. Peter Robinson that you were prepared to change your testimony if you were not in Rwanda; can you give us an explanation? 
A.	I never told him that I was prepared to change my testimony.  He asked me not to accuse Nzirorera.  I told him not to testify against Nzirorera.  I told him, "One could do that if we were not in Rwanda."  Now, assuming that people in Rwanda know that I'm here to tell the truth, and that they then find out that I did not tell the truth, I could be punished were I to return to Rwanda.  I would be asked to explain why I did not tell the Trial Chamber the truth.  I never agreed to change my testimony before Robinson. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it not true to say that when reading --  rereading your statement, you said it is mentioned in the draft transcript of 13 June 2006, page 11, point 25, in answer to a question by Peter Robinson, you said:  "You asked me if I was prepared to change my testimony.  I told you that was possible if I were not in Rwanda, because if I ever changed my testimony and were to return to Rwanda I would be punished for it."
That is what you said.  So my question is as follows: Since you were dealing in the possible, if today your safety were guaranteed, would you be prepared to change your testimony?  
A.	Let me answer you this way:  Perhaps I could advise you to reread from the start of the conversation.  I gave him that answer because he asked me not to testify against Nzirorera.  He even suggested or proposed that he should find a lawyer for me.  So I said to him that would be possible if one did not live in Rwanda because in Rwanda they know that you have come to Arusha, the authorities are aware of it.  It is mentioned on radio.  And if I were to change my testimony, that would constitute a crime and I would be punished for it.  Otherwise guarantees for my safety -- I do not understand what safety you refer to.  I am not with my parents.  I gave him an answer based on the question he asked me and questions that his colleagues put to me.  You should, rather, ask him why he offered to find me a lawyer.  I'm not an Accused that I should need a lawyer. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I brought up the issue of your safety because it is clear that, when one gives testimony, it is necessary to ensure that such testimony is not given under duress.  So how can you explain that you should have demanded that you be provided with a pseudonym?  Is it not true to say that your security is at stake? 
A.	My lack of security might arise from what I have come to say in testimony against these people.  Their relatives might hurt me because -- a relative of Nzirorera telephoned me.  And I wondered how he had got hold of my telephone number, and then Robinson mentioned it to me.  Moreover, given the incident involving Jean Pierre in 2004 and how he was offered money, all that prompted me to ask for my pseudonym to be changed.  Secondly, when we are here in this Chamber as you said, this is not the first time I am testifying, sometimes you hear people outside asking questions, do you know such a witness or some other witness.  Sometimes I am asked questions here to establish whether I know a certain witness.  There are journalists here, for instance.  The journalist cites Witness BTH and sometimes I notice that people know that I am here in Arusha, whereas they are not supposed to know.  I know that people in Rwanda are aware that I am here in Arusha.  It is understandable that when you give testimony people are aware of your testimony.  You know it yourself.  I can tell you who is GBU.  If you mention GBU to me, I can tell you who that is.  And that is why I did not want to continue using my first pseudonym.  
Q.	It appears to me, Mr. Witness, that in spite of the protective measures taken, you yourself acknowledge that there are people in Rwanda who know that you have come to testify; correct? 
A.	Yes, people are aware, they have -- they are, definitely.  If -- even people outside of Rwanda, in other countries, are aware.  Do you mean that when relatives of your clients or Nzirorera's come to visit them, that they do not mention such things to them?  There are a lot of witnesses here in Arusha and we know each other even though we do not discuss or chat, but I do come across other witnesses.  I can give you an example:  Sometimes when I travel, in the aircraft, I see my former fellow detainees.  We do not speak, but they knew that I was coming to testify, as I knew that they were also coming to testify in Arusha.
There is the issue of protection of witnesses because there is an awareness that there is a risk in that the witnesses should be protected as a result.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell me if, in order to save his skin -- in order to save one's skin, whether lies are justified in such cases? 
A.	There are many reasons that could justify or motivate lies.  If you are defending your client who sits next to you and he does not plead guilty, refuses to accept the charges against him, they are trying to survive to cover themselves.  Sometimes one has to tell a lie, but I tell you that in this case, today it is not the case for me.  I had to tell the truth -- I noticed that I had to tell the truth, therefore, I am no longer in that position. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  So I'm to take it that since your guilty plea, to date, you tell only the truth? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, I heard you were here when you were asked what did you draw from President Habyarimana's statement that was made in Ruhengeri.  Initially, you gave one version, a preliminary version, and when I reread the transcripts dated 30 April -- rather, 30 March 2004, you gave another statement.  Subsequently, when Peter Robinson cross-examined you on the 14th of June 2006, you repeated the statement of 30 March 2004.  If you happen to have forgotten, I can remind you of what you said on the 8th of June, which is different from what you stated on the 14th of June and the 30th of March 2004.  
A.	I would like to answer you.  You have just given a very lengthy question and I didn't get it all.  But this is what I want to say:  With regard to President Habyarimana's speech I was asked for my interpretation of his speech, so I gave my personal opinion.  I was asked what I concluded, what I understood from President Habyarimana's speech.  And the speech was shown to me.  I had a look at it for myself.  So that -- I do not understand the basis of your question since I was asked to report my understanding of the speech.  I must reiterate that my statements are not a song that I have learnt by heart and which I must repeat word for word whenever I am asked to testify.  What matters is that I express myself clearly and recount the events as they happened. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, regarding the president's speech, were you asked to say what the president had stated or were you asked for your opinion? 
A.	I was asked for my opinion on the president's speech.  I was told to give a brief account of what I had understood from the president's speech.  And then I was shown the president's speech, which I was asked to read, and I did that.  Thereafter, I was asked to say what I had understood from the speech.  And you are aware of how I answered. 
MR. SOW: 
I would like to ask Mr. Issa to help me circulate the transcript of the 30th of March 2004 in which the witness made statements about the issues I have made reference to.  And on this subject, it was the Prosecutor asking him the following questions.  No reference has been given in the French --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, before you proceed, how long is this going to take, this aspect of your questioning?  It is just before 5:30.  Do you want to do it now, or start tomorrow morning?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for counsel, please. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, it should take seven minutes at most.  May I proceed, Mr. President, on this question, of course?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. Sow, you can finish it.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, could Mr. Sow start with the page reference, please. 
MR. SOW: 
It is the transcript in French.  I'm starting at page 21 and page 22.  There is also page 23 for the English.  A copy has also been provided for the English.  Mr. Webster, do you follow?  So Mr. Webster said:  "Mr. Witness, did President Habyarimana address the rally on that day?"

The witness answers:  "He did.  President Habyarimana spoke, but not for long."

Question: "Was there anything in his speech that impressed you?  What was the most significant thing -- message that he delivered base on your experience of the events of 1992?"  

And the witness begins to give an answer:  "On that day, he said that his children had asked him to go see their grandmother and, upon their return, he didn't want to go by without saying -- without greeting us, and he knew there was a celebration.  And it was for that reason that he had come to the stadium.  He didn't want to just go by without greeting those who were present.  He said, "I know what these people are fearing."  And on that day, he saw the Interahamwe in their garb.  And he said "I have seen what those people" -- I apologise.  "I saw those people in their garb."  And he said, "I have seen what those people fear."  He also said, "To the best of my memory, I will call you and we will come down."  And then he said, "I ask you, I ask the MRND secretariat at the national level to have dialogue with the businessmen so that they can furnish the Interahamwe dress."  He also said that the dress was very expensive.  He said that that dress -- "those clothes cost a lot of money and that, in fact, if you look at them closely; they weren't more expensive than what we ourselves were wearing."  And still in the witness's statement, the next line, when he was asked:  "Mr. Witness, when you say, taken from the last portion of your response, so that after we can calm down, can you explain what you understood that to mean in 1992?"  The witness answered when he said:  "Finally, after supplying the uniforms, we would come down.  We had to accompany him to fight the enemy which had attacked the country."

The Prosecutor insisted on the word "descend", and then the witness specified that he was referring to the enemy and political parties.  But when the witness was examined by the Prosecutor on the           8th of June 2006, in this very courtroom, when he was asked about -- he would descend or they would descend, the witness specified that by descend -- this is what he said, another thing is he mentioned the fact that the soldiers would conduct their campaign, but that essentially it was the Interahamwe who would be responsible for his electoral campaign.  So there is a big different between electoral campaign and a descent to fight the enemy.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	So I would like to ask you, Witness:  Which of the two versions is the most truthful because you, Witness, have decided to tell only the truth?  
A.	At a certain point you stopped midway through your reading.  When I was here testifying in 2004, I gave a full explanation.  The explanation I gave in 2004 is identical to what I gave here during this session.  You stopped in the middle of the reading because you know that that is in your best interest.  But I maintain that you have not finished the reading, and I believe that if you had continued with the reading you would have got a satisfactory explanation because I know I definitely said there were parties in opposition to the MRND, and that since we were living in the north of the country, when I heard him talk about descending, I understood it to mean descent from our region to go and fight the opposition parties.  Moreover, I knew that the Inkotanyi had attacked the country and that he meant that we should accompany him and fighting the enemy.  That is to say you have not finished the reading.  If you read further, you will get an explanation.
MR. SOW:
I would like -- since the witness acknowledges his statements of the 30th of March 2004, I would like to enter the French and English version of the transcripts with Exhibit number D. K6A for the French, and D. K6B for the English version.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I have no objection to this material coming in evidence.  It doesn't hurt the Prosecution at all, but the witness has a point which is that his explanation in a previous proceeding was quite lengthy, and from what Mr. Sow read in his question to the witness, it is a brief portion.  And not only was it brief, but it skipped around over the course of two or three pages.  It was even one part where he read half of a quotation, he was actually reading a quotation and stops halfway and then moves to the bottom of the page.  So the witness is quite on point here.  And if we are going to put this in evidence, then at least the three or four pages need to go in so that the comments can be appreciated in context.  I wouldn't even be able to suggest at this point where we stop because this is a point of the witness's testimony where he testified for around 10 or 15 minutes.  So, in the first instance, I don't see what contradiction Mr. Sow is bringing to our attention.  And if there is one, and it needs to be placed on the record somehow, we are going to have to go beyond the two or three paragraphs that were read and look at, at least, three or four pages. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow does not have to read the entire passage.  But, Mr. Sow, you should expand your filings so that we could have the context of the comment that you are putting to the witness.  So perhaps you can -- you can -- you could complete that tomorrow morning. 
MR. SOW: 
Agreed, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I just note that there are already a D. K6.  I think this would have to be        D. K7. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

You have reached the end of this section, so you can -- we can take the adjournment now.  Mr. Sow, is this a convenient time to take the adjournment?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I think we can come back to this tomorrow morning so can I explain to the         Trial Chamber the contradictions. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
One last question before we break and that is:  We have another witness lined up, and I'm curious as to when we should make that witness available to the Trial Chamber.  Should I suggest that he be brought at two o'clock or before 2:00?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, can you assist us with that?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President, I will be making every effort, but you see that, in the Defence -- among the Defence teams, I will be taking only the three hours so I will try and forego and eliminate certain questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Sow. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
In which case -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- why can't you make the decision at 10:30 -- at the mid-morning recess as to what your schedule is?  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I have done on previous occasions, that during this or any other adjournment, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  

We adjourn until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1740H)
