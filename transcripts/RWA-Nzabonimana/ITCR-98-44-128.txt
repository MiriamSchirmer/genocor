MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, Presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today,                                Monday, 20 June 2005, in the trial on the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba,                   Case Number ICTR 98-44-C-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

Appearances -- 
MS. FALL: 
Appearances are the same, Mr. President, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

And on the Defence. 
MR. HOOPER: 
They are unchanged for the Defence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My real interest though, was trying to find out about the Accused.  We notice that he still is not here today. 
MR. HOOPER: 
So -- I haven't quite plugged in this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I haven't asked that question yet, but I thought it was worth raising the issue of his absence and the importance we attach to continuing efforts to have him here. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Again, thank you for that inquiry.  I was able to see him for several hours on Friday and he was following with keen interest all that I had to tell him, and was quite capable of giving me instructions.  And we didn't discuss the issue of his attendance.  I took it as a given at the moment that -- I hope one day he will appear, but it is his decision and his position has remained unchanged. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I think it is important to the Court that he continues to be invited to attend.  And we would like that to take place. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness GLM, how are you today?  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I feel pretty good, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, the weekend had a restorative feeling?  
THE WITNESS:
I had a good rest and the medication I took appears to be effective. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm grateful for that.  You remain giving testimony and you are still on the same oath that you took when you commenced your evidence to tell the truth.  The cross-examination by Defence counsel will continue this morning. 

Mr. Hooper.

                 CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	You gave evidence last week of your knowledge of André Rwamakuba.  And in respect of that you agreed or conceded to me that it may well be that you could know him but that he may not be able to place a face to your name.  Do you remember that? 
A.	I said that in the event that he does not recognise me, this would be because I was an ordinary citizen, a simple ************, but this doesn't mean that we never met. 
Q.	In fact, your particular meetings with him, as I understand it before July of 1993, were the two occasions where you say he chaired a meeting at the school; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. I attended those two meetings and he was present. 
Q.	Was this the *************? 
A.	Yes, it is indeed that school. 
Q.	And this was a school --  
A.	Which is known by the abbreviation ********. 
Q.	And the **********, does it not? 
A.	The abbreviation ***************. 
Q.	And this was ********** school for local children whether Hutu or Tutsi; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it was a school which was in that area and anyone had the right to be admitted there.  As for the various ethnic groups which were admitted, there I wouldn't be able to say much more than what I have said. 
Q.	Yes, but that was a rather begrudging answer.  The fact is that school was open to all, including, in fact, Tutsis.  There was no discrimination.  Was there begrudging? 
A.	I did not take a census of the students of that school depending on their ethnicity.  If there was criteria for the admission of the students, I wouldn't be aware of them. 
Q.	Now, you recall going on two occasions.  The first time was in May, you told us, of 1993; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I went there and on that occasion a meeting had been held.  
Q.	And did you meet and talk with André Rwamakuba on that occasion? 
A.	I went to the meeting and during the meeting it was the principal who was chairing the meeting.  Rwamakuba came in the middle of the meeting; he spoke during the meeting and at the end of the said meeting, Rwamakuba left.  However, he greeted us as we attended the meeting. 
Q.	And now I would like to come to your second meeting that you told us about, and that was in February 1994, as you put it, the second term; is that right?  
A.	I remember that it was during the second term of the school year, and I am able to say that that meeting took place around February, but let me repeat that I cannot remember the specific dates. 
Q.	Now February will do.  What happened; did André Rwamakuba speak on that occasion? 
A.	He took the floor and he explained to us how the school operated.  He announced some rules concerning the running of the school. 
Q.	Did you speak to him? 
A.	After the meeting, some parents, including myself, approached him and we spoke with him.  I do not recall the content of what we said, however there was a discussion with Mr. Rwamakuba. 
Q.	And you didn't mind discussing things with him despite his going around talking of the extermination of your people, is that your evidence? 
A.	On that occasion it was a meeting on education.  And at that specific moment there were other people with me and this didn't cause any difficulty for me. 
Q.	Just before we leave the school, it is right, and you can confirm that that was a school that had been established by Rwamakuba and his brother Nkubana for the local children, that they had established this free school to which your child had the privilege to go; is that right? 
A.	Yes, those are the people who founded the school and it is, indeed, true that this child who was an orphan -- the child **********************************; I therefore took him to that school. 
Q.	Now, can you give us a description, please, of André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I do not know whether I can give you a correct description of Mr. Rwamakuba because given the time which has lapsed, he may have changed in his physiognomy.  I don't know what description you would want me to give.  I don't know what he looks like today. 
Q.	Well, it may surprise you, I don't know -- I'm not asking for his description today because you haven't seen him since 1994, but what did he look like then? 
A.	It would be much easier for you to show him to me in this courtroom and then I would be able to identify him with no problem. 
Q.	But he is not here at the moment, but you do your best.  Was he a very tall, fat man?  Let's start with that.  You do your best.  
A.	But the description I would give of that man, what use would that be to you because you didn't know that man. 
Q.	Well, I might have photographs of him taken then, so you just do your best and answer the question for this Chamber.  
A.	I am trying to remember the physical characteristics of this man, but I wouldn't be able to give you details.  Rwamakuba was a man of average size, his complexion was neither dark nor light, it was medium.  He seemed to have a tendency to have chubby cheeks and very little hair on his head. 
Q.	Would you describe him as a strong man or thick set man? 
A.	He was a well built man and I would say that he wasn't thin. 
Q.	What about his voice, was there anything unusual or striking or significant that you can remember about that? 
A.	His voice was deep and somewhat rough. 
Q.	You heard his swearing in, you say, you heard him on the radio then; is that right? 
A.	Yes, on the day when the ministers were sworn in I heard him, as I did the other ministers.  He, like the others, was heard swearing in on the radio. 
Q.	Did you understand him? 
A.	Yes, on the day that he was sworn in I heard him. 
Q.	Do you remember what language he was sworn in? 
A.	He took his solemn declaration in Kinyarwanda. 
Q.	In 1994, did you know which -- what job he had? 
A.	I knew that he was responsible for the Kigali health region, he was the director of that health region.  But if there came about a change slightly before that date, I wouldn't have known. 
Q.	1992, he was director of Kigali-Rural health region, not Kigali town.  Can you agree with what I have just said? 
A.	Previously, we knew of Kigali préfecture.  I do not know exactly when the name change came about for one to be referring to Kigali on the one hand and Kigali-Rural on the other. 
Q.	Kigali-Rural covered all of the surrounding area round and about the very centre of the city itself, a very large area indeed.  Do you know the region I am talking about, Kigali-Rural? 
A.	I have told you that in the beginning it was only the Kigali health region, and just as the office of the préfecture of Kigali, it was in the city of Kigali.  What I am saying is that I don't recall the date when there was a distinction, a clear distinction between Kigali ville, in other words, Kigali city and           Kigali-Rural. 
Q.	Can I come to the Rwamakuba family.  You have been to see his parents on a few occasions, Pascal, and Pascasie; is that correct? 
A.	I know that Rwamakuba's father, who was known as Pascal.  As for the first name Pascasie, which you have mentioned, I did not know that name. 
Q.	Perhaps you rather exaggerated your knowledge of the family.  Would that be fair? 
A.	When I say that I knew that family, this means that I knew the people who composed that family and that, consequently, I knew the names which were used by the people to refer to members of that family.  At least you should know that there are names which are not normally used by the people in order to refer to one person or another, that does happen. 
Q.	Can you confirm that André Rwamakuba, as with his father, was not Tutsi nor Hutu, but Muhundi? 
A.	Unless he is the one who provided you with that information, as far as I know in Rwanda, there were three ethnic groups and you seem now to be adding a fourth.  In that regard, I wouldn't be able to say anything about that as such. 
Q.	Knowing the family, can you confirm that André Rwamakuba at the age of two or three, was taken with his family and his father to Kayanga where his father worked in the copper mines; do you know about that? 
A.	Yes, I knew at a certain point in time that this family had lived in Kayanga, where the father, the head of family, worked in the mines of that area.  As soon as I became a person of awareness, I realised that **************************. 
Q.	And the family, and in particular, André Rwamakuba, didn't return to Nduba until 1966 or so, until which time you would have been 10 years old; he would have been 16.  Would that be right? 
A.	I do not know exactly when this family came back to that area; otherwise, you are right that in 1966, I was ten years old. 
Q.	And that on his return he was away in schools and boarding schools and university and training in Belgium to be a doctor, and not very often in your area at all; is that right? 
A.	That is correct; he wouldn't remain in that area for a very long time.  However, during the school holidays he would come back to the family and he came back later to visit his family.  He never had residency in this area later on. 
Q.	Indeed not, he lived in Kigali, is that right?  
A.	Yes, that is right, his residence was in Kigali but I do not know the exact location. 
Q.	Now, can you be shown please our Exhibit D3, which is a sketch plan of Gikomero commune and its immediate surrounding area.  Can I just pass another one up so it saves it having to come out of the exhibit bundle in the future?  Thank you, very much.
Can you just familiarise yourself with that sketch plan showing the area that we are concerned with, and in doing so can you find Nduba and Shango on there, or do you have difficulties with maps; some people do.  
How are you doing?  Can you find Nduba or is the map difficult for you?  
A.	Yes, I have found Nduba.  I don't have any problem with the map, I have found Nduba. 
Q.	Good, okay.  And you can find Shango there and Sha; do you see that there as well? 
A.	Yes, I can see Sha and Shango clearly. 
Q.	Do you drive? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you know how many road bridges there are between Nduba and the -- to cross the river near Bumbogo, how many road bridges are there, if you can remember, fit for a vehicle? 
A.	Yes, please state clearly whether the departure point is Nduba, from the hill top to Nyabugogo, please clarify this, Counsel. 
Q.	Yes, it is.
A.	Actually, you might -- you could take two roads, two different roads from Nduba to Nyabugogo.  You can go downhill and go through Gasanze, right to Kayanga, and at that point you will get to Nyacyonga Bridge before you get to the tarred road.  There is another road, you can go down Sha hill in Sha secteur.  You will get to a place called Murangira and immediately after that you will get to the tarred road.  And then you cross a bridge before you get to Nyabugogo.  

In addition, I notice that your map is not complete.  There is another road that goes from Nduba to Shango, you get to Kajevuba, you also cross a bridge and immediately after that you get to the tarred road, but I don't see that road on your map. 
Q.	Can you see on my map the word "Nkubana Bridge".  And if you do, is that your second route down the hill from Sha?  Do you know the bridge -- do you know the bridge to be called the Nkubana, as I suggested it is? 
A.	Yes, this is Nkubana bridge.  It is the same -- it is the same as Murangira bridge that I have referred to. 
Q.	And where is the third bridge that you have mentioned on the map? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the interpreter is indicating that he did not hear your question. 
THE WITNESS:
I said that you did not indicate the third bridge on your map except, of course, you want me to draw that road on for you. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Just one moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
It seems to have got passed the interpreter, but got to the witness.  I don't know what happened there. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is probable that the -- I don't know, but the English interpreter did not hear the question properly. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French interpreter is indicating that you spoke before the witness finished answering the question. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I will repeat the question.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Where is the third bridge? 
A.	You referred to Nyabugogo River, so I'm going to tell you about all of the bridges on that river if one is coming from Nduba.  So this is Nduba.  When you leave Nduba, you passed to Shango; you get down, you go to Kajevuba.  And there you reach the marsh; you cross that, you get to the tarred road.  And at that point you must cross Nyabugogo river. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  
A.	That is Kajevuba bridge. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry; I don't always know when this witness is finished talking.  I have left gaps, I'm doing my best, Interpreter.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So the bridge that you take, is it Kajevuba that would effectively join the road that would go up to Gasabo, is that right?  
A.	Yes, this is the bridge you cross when you want to go to Gasabo. 
Q.	And just for clarity sake, as I understand what you are saying, that road drops down from the hill at Shango to the right into the valley, and then runs along the valley to the bridge at Kajevuba.  Would that be right? 
A.	Yes, from Shango you go down, you get to the Kajevuba marsh, this road intersects with the Gasabo road.  And so immediately after that, the Nyabugogo River is crossed and you get to Kajevuba river -- to get to the tarred road. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And it might be helpful and proper for the record if you could be given a pen and just mark -- mark that road on it, on the document you have in front of you or, at least, don't mark that document a moment, I have handed up a spare D3 and I believe you have got it, and so the original D3 is in the file.  If you could then mark that map, please, and we can perhaps call it, what you have done there -- can you mark that?  It would help us. 
A.	Yes, I can do it, but I have got to know why, why you want me to do that. 
Q.	Well, can we skip the explanation and you can just do it.  Is that a difficulty for you? 
A.	No, I couldn't do it, I have to know what questions you are going to put to me about that. 
Q.	Well, perhaps I will leave it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I wanted to explain to the witness that the whole process of examination of this nature is to get -- both to get information and to test the quality of the information that you give.  Now, you have made a verbal description and it is not improper for counsel to ask you to demonstrate on the document what you had described verbally.  So that would be a reasonable question to ask and something for you to do.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I agree to put down in writing what I have explained orally.  I can demonstrate to him that I know the entire region, so I will do it. 

I have finished. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Thank you very much.  I will just have a quick look at that, and while we are passing that around, can I ask you another question.  Where you are there, in *******************, it is quite the other side, isn't it, from the commune from Nduba and Kayanga, quite the other side of the commune? 
A.	Are you using the commune office as a reference point?  
Q.	Well, let me put it to you; do people from Nduba often go to Kayanga, for example? 
A.	No, people in Nduba do not often go to Kayanga. 
Q.	And in saying that that people from Nduba do not often go to Kayanga, I know you are stating the obvious to yourself, but for those of us who have not been to this area it is perhaps difficult for us to understand how distinct and separate these places are, but they are distinct and separate, aren't they? 
A.	Yes, it is true that between the various areas there are marshes, but there are roads that link these various locations.  It is true that -- that it is not easy to go to all of these places on foot. 
Q.	To really understand the kind of place we are dealing with, we really need to go and look at it, don't we, to see the place; would you agree? 
A.	Yes, these are regions where there are pathways, there are also marshes.  But, in general, this is difficult to (unintelligible). 
Q.	Now, I see that at one time -- just clarify this for me, you said in a previous conversation, I think, with investigators, you said these words that you didn't see André Rwamakuba in April, June or July of 1994, because you yourself were ***********************************************************************.  Is that right?  
A.	Those are not my words, I think you are confusing what I said with what someone else said. 
Q.	Well, I may have to inflict French again on everyone, but I only have it in French at the moment.  Perhaps I can refer you to GLM -- well not you, but other people, GLM15.  And this is notes of investigators that included a Ms.  Makwaia, Holo Makwaia, who I believe was a prosecution counsel at one point, Fadild Tidjani and nobody else, And that was on the 14th of February last year.  And they recorded you as saying, and I'm only inviting you to comment on it, in the fifth paragraph on            page -- GLM15 -- sorry sixth, the penultimate paragraph on that page, "The witness hasn't seen Rwamakuba, Andre during the months of April, June, and July 1994 because of the fact that he was himself ******** in Gikomero secteur, which is very éloigné, which I think is far -- "from ******** where he was living."  Did you say that? 
A.	No, that is not what I said, I never ******** at that place during that period.  At that time I wasn't **********, that is why I thought, I strongly suspect that you have confused me with another witness. 
Q.	Well have I?  The Prosecutor can correct me.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm on my feet, I don't mind a helpful interruption.  I'm looking at GLM15, have I got that wrong. 
MR. MORLEY:
If it assists the Court, my learned friend knows that an investigator note is not the same as a statement, and is not the same as the document which has been signed after having been read over and carefully considered by the witness.  My learned friend is perfectly at liberty to put to the witness what appears in the investigator's note, but the evidence is what the witness says about what is in the note.  The existence of the note, if the witness corrects what is in the note, does not make what the witness is saying wrong, because it is not in the investigator's note, a previous inconsistent statement, it is somebody else's note which is open to the witness to correct.  I hope the distinction is clear to my learned friend and to the Court.  I imagine this is a problem we are going to encounter from time to time throughout the trial, the distinction between the statement and investigator's notes and I'm at pains if I may assist my learned friend with the observation, which may meet with some favour, that what the witness says about the note is the evidence, the note itself does not amount to a previous inconsistent statement.  I hope that is of assistance. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, that may be the law in England and Wales, but it is not the law here, as I understand it.  And, indeed, it may not now be the law in England and Wales, because as you know, the law on hearsay has changed radically this year.  This is a statement, it is a hearsay statement, it is a statement of investigator hearsay of what this witness said.  And so it is a statement of this witness, albeit, a hearsay statement.  It is, in my submission, a different form of statement than one that he signed.  And the point is taken that he has not put his signature to it.  But we are still entitled to assume that Holo Makwaia, a prosecutor, together with other investigators, took the time and trouble to go all the way there to see this witness, all the way there to take a statement of relevant matters, and one assumes, made an effort, at least, a decent effort, to record what he said with accuracy.  

In fact, in the future the only way, as I see it, that I can prove this contradiction is by calling the maker, Holo Makwaia, or the other party, Tidjani, before the Court.  And that is something that may have to happen.  But at the moment, we are dealing with this witness's response to a statement that has been assigned to him, I appreciate that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper and Mr. O'Shea (sic), the issue of the weight of the testimony is not so important for this discussion and this debate at this stage.  The question is permissible, and the counsel is entitled to cross-examine the witness on the basis of the investigator's note.  So that will be the ruling.
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the issue as to what weight is attached to his evidence, we can discuss that at the appropriate time. 
MR. MORLEY:
Of course.  My response, Your Honour, was not to suggest that the question was inappropriate.  Thank you. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And so last year in February, you appeared to be telling investigators that, when you say, "no, those are not my words," would you agree it is a lot to get wrong, isn't it, a whole little paragraph like that?  
A.	Yes.  I have told you that this is not correct.  During that time I did not meet the prosecutor.  The person who interviewed me I met in 2003 for the last time, August of 2003 to be precise. 
Q.	Well, it may be your memory is not a good memory in any event, as perhaps we demonstrated with the CHK interview last week.  But, in fact, this document is dated the 14th of February 2004.  Would you like to see it? 
A.	I remember that on that occasion he didn't take notes.  I remember that I met this person who interviewed me in 2003.  I couldn't state that I was ********* around the genocide period, whereas I wasn't. 
Q.	But that you have put yourself, it appears, by saying -- "not in **** at all, but in Gikomero."  Do you see?
A.	Would you be so kind as to repeat your question, Counsel. 
Q.	You have put yourself, if that statement were true and said by you, in Gikomero and not in *******, which is far away.  Do you understand? 
A.	I never made any such statement.  I made no such statement.

Mr. President, he is telling me that I have said things that I did not say.  
Q.	Yes, well, I understand your reply is that it was something that wasn't said.  Now, in that same  statement -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose -- I think I should explain to the witness, that counsel is entitled to get your comment on documents the Prosecutor gave him, which represent interviews that the investigator had with you.  So he is asking you to comment on the notes that the Prosecutor's interviewers made after speaking with you, and that is a legitimate activity and you ought to comment on the notes when asked about them.  It gives you an opportunity to explain. 
MR. HOOPER: 
And if the Prosecutor has a clean copy of the statement of February 2004, can it be shown to the witness, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you indicated that you wish to say something?  
THE WITNESS:
I want to say that the statement he is referring to has nothing to do with what I did say.  Perhaps other statements witnesses provided information to the Prosecutor and these -- this information is being ascribed to me.  I would like him to check carefully when he refers to Sha and Gikomero, there is no connection between these two places.  I insist that verification -- it should be verified whether my statement has not been confused with what someone else said.  Perhaps it would be worthy if I were given the document, so that I can check and see if it is, in fact, my statement. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I think you should be shown a copy.  Do you have a copy in front of you?  I have a marked copy. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, the witness is welcomed to have my copy.  It has some highlighting, but no written notes. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I prefer not to have Prosecutor's highlighting go to the witness.  How about my highlighting go to the witness?  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't mind, I don't mind.  The only thought that I have though is that the witness may not be able to read French.  I may be wrong, he may read Kinyarwanda; he may be asked that.

	1000H
MR. PRESIDENT.
Mr. Witness, do you read French?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I can.  I do read French.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, that's -- that's jolly good.  We'll -- we'll hand you up -- you better show it to Mr. Morley and Ms. Fall first.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, on the first and second page you will see personal details.  Just, very quickly, look at those and it will also show you, at the second line of the first page, Mr. Witness -- can I take you to the first page, please, Mr. Witness?  Can you see a reference there to where the interview was held in a motel?  I don't know if that helps you place it -- place this meeting.  You will see the names of the people who were there, including the interpreter.  Do you see that?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could we be informed exactly from where this document comes because we do have certain documents, but we're not sure where this one -- this particular one is from.  So, we don't know whether we have it or not.  
MR. HOOPER:
(French spoken) and it's dated February 2004, and it's a four-page document, page 1 and 2 with details and then a series -- you're being assisted by Ms. Cummings-John, I see.  

It is helpful if the interpreters are following it; I -- I appreciate that and I don't know if everyone has a copy of this statement.  I hope so -- yes, I think they do.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  So, we're looking at page 1 of that document, and it's got details of it.  Can you remember that meeting, Mr. Witness?  
A.	I would like you to give me some few minutes so that I can read this document.  
Q.	Well, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.  I'm going to move on and just let me have that document back for a moment, and I'm going to let you look at it when we have the break later this morning and then -- then I'll come back to you; it will save some time then.  So, let me come back -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Let me have the document back now, please.  
A.	Yes, that is true.  I think that seems to be the best procedure since I realised that this statement is not signed by myself.  
Q.	I will appreciate, Mr. Witness, it's not nice being in a witness box, and it's certainly not nice seeing something that you haven't seen for a while.  So you'll get your chance to look at that a little -- in a little while.  But let me ask you one thing on this -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Before my learned friend does, may I just inquire of the Court, does the Court have copies of the investigator's note of the 14th of February?  Because I'm not aware whether the Court does or does not, and if it does not, it may be that the Court may want to see a copy.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the Court has got the electronic format, as I understand it, and it's GLM 13 to 16 on the paginated bundle that was helpfully provided.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we may need some assistance.  We don't have access to this document at the moment.  
MR. MORLEY:
If Your Honours are of the mind, and my learned friend has no objection to seeing the document, I'll make arrangements for copies to be made for Your Honours' attention. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we want to see it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Your Honour, that raises a question in my mind as to -- it may be Your Honour hasn't got it, as it were, at the fingertips there on the laptop, but it's been served as part of the Rwamakuba bundle by the Prosecution.  And I merely flagged that up because if you're missing that, then you have an incomplete service of documents.  And it's something that we should address because it may -- for four witnesses, because as I said, its got it's reference under the dossier, which was helpfully broken up into each witness, and is then given numbers per witness, though, in fact, this document was only served on the Defence at -- on the 27th or 29th of May, so just two weeks or so ago.  And it may be that that disclosure, which is a significant disclosure, hasn't come to you, the Judges.  In which case, in my submission, you should be provided with that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
My document ends at GLM 12.  So, that's the extent of the documents I have received. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, perhaps over the adjournment, we can sort that out later today, and we can get the other documents to you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Can I assist Your Honour with confirmation, that service on the Defence was the 27th of May, and, as I understand it, that will have included the material making its way to the court management section, and therefore, on to Your Honours.  It may be that the material has somehow got separated from what was originally served.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we can sort that out, I'm sure. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You -- you say in the statement -- and again, I appreciate, you haven't read it through, but I just want to ask you about it -- that you told the -- or you're said to have told the investigators -- 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, before my learned friend embarks on this, is my learned friend of a mind to allow the witness to read the statements so that he can better answer the questions?  I would invite that that is what the witness is allowed to do.  My learned friend has suggested that during the break the witness reads the interview -- the investigator's note.  But now he's beginning to ask questions again on the investigator's note without the witness having been able to read the investigator's note, as the witness has asked and my learned friend has agreed.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm asking one question.  I want to ask this now for forensic reasons.  It's one question, Mr. President.  I want to ask it now for forensic reasons, and he'll have the opportunity of reading the whole document shortly.  I hope that is acceptable.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	It's merely this:  You refer to someone called the wife of Raphael Rubazere as being someone who had told you certain facts that you had stated in your statement.  In other words, things that you said in your statement weren't all things that came from your head that you'd been told by the wife of 
	Raphael Rubazere (phonetic).  What did that refer to?  What things in your statement did you get from her; can you remember?  
A.	Your referring to someone who's known as Raphael Rubazaiza (phonetic).  I do not know that person nor do I know the woman in question.  However, there is someone whom I know who is known as 
	Raphael Rutayisira.  And, there's also that latter's wife and, indeed, it is her who gave me the information concerning the events during the genocide.  So you need to make a correction, it's not Rubazere (sic) but rather Rutayisira. 
Q.	Can you spell that for us, please?  
A.	Rutayisire is spelt R-U-T-A-Y-I-S-I-R-E.  

Mr. President, it would be useful to have the spelling for Counsel's "Raphael".  This is the surname of that individual --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- continues the witness.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, the name, as I read it from page GLM 16, is or was -- the person I referred to was 
	la Pouse de Rubayisere, and that was R-U-B-A-Y-I-S-E-R-E, Raphael.  
A.	In the beginning, you made mention of something like Rubazaiza, and this is why I believed it necessary that I needed to correct you.  
Q.	And thank you for the correction.  Now, you say here -- well -- is it the case that in your statement, in your original statement, there are things in there that didn't come from you, but which you were told by her, and if so, can you just indicate generally what the areas of that evidence were?  
A.	It's a long time ago since I made that statement.  I wouldn't be able to remember the exact words that I used then, either.  I do recall that this woman spoke to me of what she saw when she was in Gitarama, while she was being sought.  
Q.	Now, I want to come to Gikomero itself in 1994 --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you have any idea about how much longer you're likely to be?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm going to be a bit longer, yes.  I'm going to be longer than -- I'm going to be an hour 
to an hour-and-a-half.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was just wondering whether we -- when it would have been an appropriate time to take the break.  
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we do it now?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  
(Court recessed at 1015H to 1044H)
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, the microphones don't seem to be working.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was just told there was a technical problem with the French translation booth, and they need 
10 minutes to fix it.  So, we will rise again.
(Court recessed at 1045H)
(Pages 12 to 15 by Jean Baigent)








(Court resumed at 1140H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, here we are.  I welcome you to our new courtroom, Courtroom 2.  

Mr. Witness, the change was made necessary because there was a technical problem with the audio system in the last courtroom.  I apologise for the inconvenience of the move, but I think this is the only way to minimise the delay caused by that situation.  

So, I think if everybody is set, we can continue and resume with the cross-examination.  
MR. MORLEY:
Before my learned friend does so, with Your Honour's leave, may I just inquire, does Your Honour and Your Honour's colleague have a copy of the note made by investigators dated the 14th of February 2004?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We did receive the copies during the break.  
MR. MORLEY:
I can inform the Court that the witness has had an opportunity to look through that note and now that it's before the Tribunal, the Bench may see that it's not a statement.  It's written in the third person.  It's not signed by the witness, and as far as I'm aware, it's never been seen by the witness until today.  I should also mention to the Tribunal, if it assists, that material under the heading "Investigator's Notes," until the decision in the case of Niyitegeka, was not material which was ordinarily disclosed.  And when those notes were taken in 2004, they weren't prepared with an understanding that the material would be going to the Defence at the Tribunal.  So may I apologise in advance for any deficiencies which arise out of the document, but I hope that the history of the disclosure of these documents is relatively plain.  As a result of the Niyitegeka decision, disclosure of investigators' notes has begun in this case and, I know, in others.  

And what Your Honour and Your Honour's colleague is dealing with today is relatively new material, new material in the sense that arguments thrown up by the existence of investigator's notes, what their provenance is, what weight to attach to them, is something which is not, hitherto, been the subject of any extensive examination by the Court.  

So while my learned friend earlier was saying that the investigator's note amounts to a statement by the witness, I hope that the Bench can see that it's certainly not in the style of a declaration, which has been signed by the witness, been read over to the witness, corrected by the witness, adopted by the witness.  That is not what the Court is dealing with.  It's a private note, made later, from a recollection which may or may not be accurate as to what a witness may have said.  I hope that assists.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Morley.  
MR. HOOPER:
I have to say there's some difficulty with the reception in the earphones here.  Several have been tried, and there's a bit of back -- back-feed.

Yes, thank you very much for sorting that out.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've had the opportunity of looking at the statement.  Do you want to make any general comment about it?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I'm going to speak in Kinyarwanda, but from time to time, I might speak French.  I have read the document.  And this refreshed my memory, and I did then remember that these people came to meet me -- to meet with me.  I remember that I met them briefly, very briefly.  So in this document, the documents they drafted, I found statements that do not come from me.  I observe that there are errors that could lead this Court to make a mistake.  What is more, I did not sign this document, which shows that it was not read back to me afterwards, so that I could provide amendments, if necessary.  Therefore, with your leave, I should like to point out a few errors that I have noted in the document.  I shall start with the place where my place of residence is indicated, my place of residence at the time.
Q.	Can I interrupt you, please, Mr. Witness.  I am going to let the Prosecutor, if he wishes, take you through this.  I just want to take you to one or two matters in it and seek your comments in respect of it, if that's all right with you.  And the first thing is the account that appears the last but one paragraph on the third page of the document, our package GLM 15, which, in fact, I think you've probably dealt with, but we better get your reply again, the detail about -- and I'll read it in loose translation -- "The witness has not seen Rwamakuba during the month of April, June and July 1994, due to the fact that he was, himself, ********* in Gikomero secteur, which is very far from ***************************************."  And in respect of that, did you say any part of that?  
A.	Regarding this paragraph, I acknowledge that I said that I hadn't seen Rwamakuba in the months of April, June and July 1994.  However, what I see has been added and what I did not say was that I was ************** in Gikomero secteur, which is very far from ***************.  I have -- I never ******* in the Gikomero school secteur, for one.  For another, nobody was ************** anymore during that time -- during the time that we're talking about.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, can I take you over the page to GLM 16 and the first paragraph there, and can you read those first two lines with you, the 21st of April '94, to Le Radio, and comment on that, please; is that correct or not?  
A.	You're telling me about the content of these two sentences -- of these two lines; yes?  That's correct.  
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	Gisaro (phonetic) is in Byumba préfecture.  
Q.	Can you then go back to the very last paragraph on the previous page, page 3, which states that you specified that it was on the radio that you'd heard, on the 21st of April 1994, that André Rwamakuba was an active member of the government of that time?  Now, is it right that it was the 21st of April that you heard that?  
A.	I said that I would pick out the errors in this document.  Well, this is one of the mistakes that I wished to point out.  That is not the date.  
Q.	And if I may, I can move on, please, to the situation in Gikomero in 1994, and can you help me in this respect?  Can you confirm that there was both famine, dysentery, and cholera in your commune in the early months of 1994?  
A.	I don't remember that there was anyone who suffered from that -- that disease when I was there.  I have no memory of that.  
Q.	Let's start with cholera.  You have no memory of there being a cholera outbreak at Gishaka that was reported on the radio; you don't recall that?  
A.	No, I did not hear about this.  I did not hear about this at the time.  
Q.	Did you hear an announcement by Caritas, the Catholic charitable foundation, in respect of the need for help with the famine that had struck Gikomero commune, among other places in Rwanda, in the early part of '94?  Do you recall anything about that?  
A.	Regarding assistance that was requested from Christians in church, I heard about that.  Each time there was famine in that area, such requests were made.  But for that particular period, I most certainly do not remember.  
Q.	But it would indicate that life in Gikomero commune in this period, early 1994, was difficult and hard, would it not?  Do you agree with that, that life was difficult and hard in this commune?  
A.	I did not roam the entire commune.  What I can tell you is that I didn't see any such problems, and where I was, no one was facing any such problems.  
Q.	And you didn't listen to this or hear any of this on your radio; is that right?  
A.	I can't confirm that.  I didn't listen to all radio programmes.  I spent my day at work, and I got home in the evening.  So I cannot say that such things were said on the radio.  I'm not sure of that.  
Q.	In 1990, the RPF forces, in the early part of that year, in January, had made an attack on the state of Rwanda; is that correct?  
A.	I think everyone who was in Rwanda knows, and this is what the officials were saying in Rwanda.  
Q.	Well, do you agree that there was an attack on Rwanda from Uganda in 1990, in January, by the RPF -- I'm sorry, I said "January" -- I mean the 1st of October of 1990; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that was the case.  That is what we learned.  The authorities at the time told us that a group of enemies had attacked Rwanda.  And at that time, these people were not referred to as the RPF.  They were called by various other names, these people who attacked Rwanda.  If you wish, I can recall for your benefit some of these names.  
Q.	They were the same group; can we agree on that?  
A.	Yes.  This group that was subsequently referred to as the RPF, it wasn't called the RPF by the Rwandan government at the outset.  The government said the Inyenzis had attacked Rwanda; the enemy had attacked Rwanda.  That is what they said in October 1990.  
Q.	And as a consequence of that attack, can you confirm that about 600,000 Hutus moved from Byumba and Ruhengeri and moved south as refugees?  Can you confirm that?  
A.	Counsel, I'd like to tell you that this was not the first consequence.  The first consequence here, I can tell you about it so that we can understand this.  I would like to tell you that the first consequence was the arrest of people who were referred to as accomplices of the Inyenzi, and this took place on the 4th and the 5th of October 1990.  That was the first consequence of that attack.  
Q.	I take it that you've read quite a lot about these events, have you?  You seem very -- very sure of dates and things like that.  Have you read various books and histories of this matter over the last 10 or 14 years?  
A.	Look, I have tried to follow the course of events.  I was an intellectual person, and some of these events had an impact on me, so much so that I cannot forget them because I suffered these consequences personally.  
Q.	And were you arrested?  
A.	I was not taken into custody, but I was a member of the group that was supposed to be arrested.  My elder brother was arrested.  His name is (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  He was arrested as one of the accomplices, but afterwards, he was released.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just rise to my feet?  The usual problem of there has been a name announced.  This is an open session.  I would ask that the name is stricken from the record, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is so ordered, Mr. Registrar.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And that was the person I suggested had joined the MDR, but you said he was on the -- about to, but he hadn't actually done so last week.  Do you remember?  Is that right?  He was the man we talked about last week, you and I.  
A.	Yes, this is the same person.  
Q.	Now, can you confirm that there was a multitude of refugees as a result of this incursion by the forces from Uganda?  
A.	The refugee problem came afterwards following the fighting in the north of the country.  We only saw refugees in our region fairly late.  If you wish, I shall give you the time when this occurred, but I'll give an estimate.  
Q.	In 1992, started a process known as the Arusha Accords, a meeting between various interested parties here in Arusha; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct, but I do not remember in what year the negotiations started.  
Q.	In early 1993, during the course of those negotiations, the RPF attacked a second time, a significant, large, military offensive that took a sizeable part of northeastern Rwanda.  Do you agree with that?  
A.	I agree.  
Q.	Which led to the number of refugees, by the early part of 1993, amounting to almost a million people; do you agree with that?  
A.	I cannot be very sure about the figures.  There was no census conducted as such at the time.  
Q.	Is that right?  Because wasn't there, in fact, significant radio coverage and international concern about the number of refugees and concern expressed by those organisations dedicated to helping them?  Don't you remember any of that?  
A.	I remember because there were refugees, and the international community was being asked to provide assistance to these people.  
Q.	And I want you to look at our D. 3 again, please.  If you still have it -- do you still have it, sir?  I'm sorry.  You're looking at something else.  What -- if you still have the statement, can you have that taken from you, please?  That would be helpful.  And we'll just leave you with the sketch map that you drew on a little earlier.  
MR. HOOPER:
And before I forget, can the map on which you -- on which you -- thank you -- on which you drew that road very helpfully, can that be exhibited, please, as Defence Exhibit D. 3?  It might be helpful if it was D. 3-GLM -- D. 3-GLM, so we know exactly what it is.  Would that be a possible nomination?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
Normally, Your Honour, the next exhibit would be D. 12, but I'm open to suggestions, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would your recording be put out if it was not D. 12?  It would be?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we prefer consecutive numbers, but we're willing to number it as you wish.  
MR. HOOPER:
So there's a degree of flexibility there.  Would D. 3-GLM be generally helpful, I think?  
MR. MORLEY:
May I make a short contribution?  I invite my learned friend's nomenclature.  I anticipate this map is going to float around a number of witnesses.  It may be that a number of witnesses end up marking the map.  So we will end up with a large number of this map being marked by witnesses and being put in evidence as that witness's map.  If all of those maps are grouped under the heading D. 3, with each individual witness's contribution being against the witness's pseudonym, then in time, it will probably be helpful to have that grouping.  Otherwise, one has to ferret through what will be a consecutive ordering of a large number of exhibits to find these maps again.  So, if it pleases Your Honour, I invite my learned friend's suggestion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Then I order it accordingly.  It's D. 3-GLM.
(Exhibit No. D. 3-GLM admitted)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And if we look at our -- your D. 3 there, and we look at where Nduba is and we put our finger there, that side of the hill running down to the river to the Nyacyonga bridge, our finger on that spot would be on the spot that there was an enormous refugee camp with about 80,000 displaced persons living in that camp; do you agree?  And this is 1993-'94; do you agree?  
A.	The refugees had come from the north, that is, from Byumba préfecture.  I know that they did come, but I do not think that were up to 800,000.  These people only came from two communes.  
Q.	No.  80,000 people -- not 800,000 -- 80,000, in that camp.  
A.	I agree with that figure.  
Q.	A camp of abject conditions with little shelter; is that correct?  
A.	If I consider the way people were sheltered in that camp, then I would agree with you, that they did not live in the best conditions, but they were provided with food.  
Q.	And come events after the death of President Habyarimana, is it right that a significant number of those displaced persons participated in killing **********, particularly in Nduba, Shango and Sha?  
A.	Yes.  People who were put in these camps did not immediately attack the homes of people.  Attacks began when their camp was demolished.  These people were dispersed, were scattered, but before they got to some areas, the people of those areas had already killed their neighbours.  
Q.	You made your statement on the 11th of February 1998, to a Mr. Sidibe and a Mr. -- or, perhaps, Ms. Allagouma.  Those are the names on the statement.  Would you accept those details from me, or do you want to see your statement?  
A.	I remember their names even -- even if it is a long time ago. 
Q.	I'm looking -- I'm looking now, but I'm not going to trouble you with a list, necessarily, of names that you ticked last week, and I'm looking at number 1, and it's in that context I'm asking this question.  When you came to make your statement -- or a statement, did you make it at the same time, to your knowledge, as a statement made by that gentleman?  Were you together with that gentleman when you made that statement?  
A.	I can't follow you.  I don't know what list you are referring to.  However, when I gave my statement, I was alone.  
Q.	I think that answers the question.  Thank you.  

Now, can I come to the subject of the MDR party?  Now, I'm asking this question independent of any reference there may have been earlier -- hence, the way in which I'm going to put the question -- do you know a man called *************? 
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers this question, may I remind my learned friend of the evidence-in-chief which took place on Thursday?  And may I also invite his attention to what became called, I think, Prosecution Exhibit P. 32, which was a list of names.  We are in open session at the moment, and my learned friend, if he is going to pursue a series of inquiries about names, he's invited to reflect on the list which is under seal presently.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm proposing to -- I'm -- I've asked this witness about a name.  I'm not aware that that witness is in any way a protected wit- -- the name I've given in any way relates to a protected witness, and I'm going to ask questions about that person.  And at present, I see no reason why that shouldn't be something I can do.  
MR. MORLEY:
The thinking behind a list of sealed names is to protect this witness and not necessarily the named person, because it's clear that it may, in theory, be possible, having heard the name of a person to whom this witness has spoken, that that person can be identified and find out to whom that person spoke.  So, the thinking behind a series of sealed names is primarily to protect this witness.  If         Your Honour takes the view that one is being overcautious, the Prosecution is in the hands of the Court, and it may be my learned friend wishes to pursue his inquiry about various names in open session, but I'm simply putting down a marker at this stage, that for the -- from the Prosecution's perspective, the concern is creating a root by which this witness can be identified.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

It's preferable to do as much in open court as we can, but, Mr. Hooper, the point is -- requires careful attention.  If you do, in fact, propose to make questions which could lead to the identification of this witness, we will have to deal with that.  I don't think the question, as asked, is capable of doing that.  
 MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Let me refer to -- to -- I can revert to a reference by number, perhaps.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me ask you this.  When you listed names by number so that our reference was a number, and we didn't mention the names - 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, before you ask the question, the witness has indicated that he wished to respond to something. 
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you may say what you need.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to say that if I refer to the questions being put to me by            Defence counsel, I might give answers that could identify me.  I am afraid that I have already given some information that might make my identification easy.  Mr. President, I'm requesting that you allow me to answer quietly or calmly in a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, if the names are not mentioned and the people are referred to by a number, which is placed -- has been placed under seal, is the risk that you mentioned eliminated?  
THE WITNESS:
But, Mr. President, I have names that I might pronounce or say in response to one question or another, and these names might be used as a starting point to identifying me.  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I noticed the time.  It may be possible that this one issue can be dealt with now in closed session.  It won't take more than a minute or two, and then we can -- I don't know what time you wanted to sit to this morning with the disruptions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  We are going to stop pretty shortly.  So if you can address this quickly -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I'll do it quickly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Then we'll move into closed session now, which will last until the luncheon break.  We intend to resume -- for the benefit of the public, we intend to resume at 2:00.  We're now going to closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 24 to 27] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

(Court resumed at 1415H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registry, could you open the session, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is sitting today in open session, Monday, the 20th of June, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of Rwamakuba v. The Prosecutor.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  I should mention that we are back in open session now.  

Mr. Hooper, in relation to the question you asked this morning for the list of names, I don't think that there has been a sufficient foundation laid for that question which should justify making an order at this stage.  
MR. HOOPER: 
By your leave, Mr. President, can I just seek to lay a foundation?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I don't want you to name any names, Mr. Witness, you understand that, but I want to ask a little more about your position in respect of previous evidence.  We know that you made a statement in this case in -- let me get it right, is it February, I think of '98, 11th of February of '98.  Had you, by the time you made that statement, given -- provided statements or given evidence in respect of any other case in Rwanda?  
A.	As I have told you, I provided testimony in other trials of persons who were in Rwanda and who are already in detention. 
Q.	But my question was more specific than that.  Had you, by the time you came to make your statement in this case in February of '98, had you provided that information by then? 
A.	Yes, I spoke to them about it. 
Q.	Since February of 1998, have you provided any further information in respect of any case in Rwanda? 
A.	No, I didn't appear before any Rwandan court because up until now, these people have not yet been brought to trial. 
Q.	And so to recap what you have just said, the information you gave or statements that you provided were in respect of other people, and made before February of 1998; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did those statements relate to events in your commune between the 6th of April and the time that you came to leave the commune in order to seek refuge; did they concern events during that time? 
A.	The statements that were -- that I made were in relation to individuals who had been accused, individuals who were living in ********** secteur. 
Q.	I will ask my -- 
A.	It's not a statement concerning all the elements or events that took place in the commune. 
Q.	I'll ask my question again.  Did those statements you made refer to events in your secteur or in your commune that occurred between the 6th of April and the time that you came to leave the commune to seek refuge? 
A.	I made my statement in relation to individuals implicated in the attacks that took place during the genocide.  In other words, from the beginning of the genocide until the time I left the commune.  I also testified against individuals who held meetings in order to prepare the genocide in the cellule in which I lived. 
Q.	Yes.  Well, I'm coming to that in a moment.  But you have just confirmed that the statements you gave, first of all, did deal with events in your secteur during the actual period of genocide before you left.  I understand that.  Now can I come to the second limb, and you've just touched on it.  Those statements also referred -- those statements also refer to events leading up to the genocide, the sensitisation of people in your area, and the meetings that that -- where that was done; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And in respect of sensitisation in your area, you've told this Court in your evidence that André Rwamakuba was a principal, if not the principal player; is that correct? 
A.	I mentioned other persons against whom I testified; people who had been arrested by the Prosecutor.  I never spoke about André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	But am I correct in saying this, that those statements provided to the prosecutor in Rwanda that those statements dealt with the meetings political meetings, sensitisation meetings held in your secteur? 
A.	I have explained this to you.  I stated that the statements I made dealt with what had happened in my secteur, and it was a statement concerning individuals who had already been arrested and were in detention. 
Q.	I hear you, Witness.  I hear all that, but you also say, didn't you, that the circumstances leading up the genocide, and the meetings that were held in your area.  That is correct, is it not? 
A.	Yes, that's what I stated, and let me specify that what I have had as a statement was limited only to my secteur. 
Q.	And were these meetings which you yourself attended or not? 
A.	If you are referring to people against whom I testified, I do not see the connection between the trials of those individuals and the present one. 
Q.	But you have told us this afternoon -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- the issue of relevance to the trial is really a question of law for the Chamber to decide.  When I think that counsel has gone outside of the limits, I will make a ruling about it.  But in the meantime, you can rely on my decision-making on this issue.  If you have a problem, you can draw it to my attention and I will make an appropriate ruling at the time.  But I do not think that he has gone outside the limits as yet.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And, Mr. President, perhaps I can pause in questioning the witness to say that in my submission -- perhaps the ground was not laid earlier, but in my submission, it has been laid out as a proper and fair invitation to this witness, and for this reason -- he has given evidence now that his previous efforts to assist a procureur in Rwanda, failing to both giving evidence or providing information in respect of events in a narrow period, from the 6th of April to the time when he says he left the commune, I note of course that that is not a time when André Rwamakuba is alleged to have been there, but there were ancillary matters relating to opportunity to hear him on the radio and the like, which may be relevant, but I base my application most particularly on the defendant's evidence (sic) of a moment or so again -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defendant?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry, the -- I am sorry, of the witness's evidence of a moment or so ago -- I appreciate you have your earphones on -- of a moment or so ago, that in fact this information related to meetings held in his secteur, sensitisation meetings, leading up to the period of genocide.  And that is the self-saving period, of course, that we are concerned with in his evidence in respect of André Rwamakuba.  

Now, if that is the case, then, in my submission, I should be,  if possible, entitled to seek access to that material.  It's not material in the Prosecutor's possession, nor is it material, as I understand it -- the Prosecutor wasn't even aware it existed.  But now that we know it existed, it would be fair and proper for me to make what inquiries I can.  And in order to do so, I require some chapter and verse from this witness as to where this document -- those documents may -- may lie.  Now, I understand him to say that at no time in those documents is there a reference to André Rwamakuba, but that, in my submission, is perhaps a significant omission as could be.  But it would lead me to be able to examine his previous records of history of these meetings and lead me, in fact, to be in a position to better assist the Court as to whether there is a point in respect of this which is relevant.  But on the face of it, I'd say that relevancy is more probable than not in those circumstances.  So I come back to my application based on this, perhaps, new evidence from the witness that he has, indeed, provided statements relating to the self-saying period and the self-same evidence, essentially that he's providing in this Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, before you reply I would just like to ask the witness.  

How many statements are involved in this?  How many statements did you make to the Rwandan prosecutor?  
THE WITNESS:  
I think that with regard to the statements I made on persons accused of genocide in my secteur, I provided testimony against them on three occasions.  I do believe I made three statements. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY: 
With Your Honours' leave, there are three observations to invite Your Honours' attention to.  The first is, the Court may feel it's fatal to the establishment of relevance, but the witness has said repeatedly that he has not referred to the involvement of Rwamakuba.  Perhaps at this juncture, if he might take his headphones off.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but before he does that I would like to ask him:  Mr. Witness, do you understand English -- English language?  
THE WITNESS:  
No, I do not speak English, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, my question was do you understand it?  
THE WITNESS:  
I do not understand English very well, just a little bit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, how do you -- I don't think that this really is a sensitive issue -- very sensitive issue, unless you intend to say something that the witness should not specifically -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
I don't intend to say anything that the witness shouldn't hear, but I'm just mindful that my learned friends may be sensitive to my saying something that the witness picks up on and then in testimony -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I understand that.  

Mr. Witness -- I think it will be sufficient at this stage if he removes his headset; if necessary, then I would order him to be removed from the courtroom.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But please take your headset off, Mr. Witness, during this discussion.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Three areas, Your Honour.  The first is that it may be thought fatal -- it may be thought fatal to the application that Rwamakuba has not been mentioned -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, to interrupt, Mr. President, could Mr. Morley speak directly into the microphone?  It's a little bit off, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you hear, Mr. Morley?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I did, although -- can I be heard as I stand upright at the moment?  I'm asking that question of the interpreter.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Maybe, Mr. Morley, if you could come closer to the microphone, or bring the microphone closer to you as you've done.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Can you hear me now.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I can hear you perfectly.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.

The first thought is the absence of reference of Rwamakuba may be of importance.  The second is, where do we go from here if Your Honour was to allow the list to be given to Your Honour.  And the third is the available comment which is there for my learned friend in any event, and it may not get any better than that.  

Dealing with Rwamakuba and the absence of his reference, Your Honour may feel that the witness, having not said anything about the involvement of the Accused in this trial, that means on the face of it that whatever he has said in previous matters is irrelevant to the issue which is before this trial about this defendant.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I interrupt?  

MR. MORLEY: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Over the last few days, Defence counsel has signaled that he thinks that the absence of mention of Rwamakuba in statements where he -- it might have been logical for his name to be mentioned, is something in favour of Rwamakuba.  So he wants it on the record -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- that Rwamakuba was not mentioned in certain circumstances.  So that's his Defence theory.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Yes, and insofar as it goes, it's a point for the Defence, except that -- it's my third point, so I might come to that straight away that the comment is available to him in any event.  The witness has given evidence that he has referred to some people, he has referred to some previous gatherings prior to the genocide, and that he has not referred to Rwamakuba.  Is it going to get better for my learned friend?  

If we then move to the second point that I raised, where do we go with this?  If the witness gives the list, then, in principle, Your Honour is saying that the Defence will have to see this material in order to finalise their cross-examination of this witness.  At the moment, we are in trial.  This is material which, on the face of it, the Defence will go and find, and having found it, would then presumably have to consider it, research it, investigate it, and then in theory, recall the witness for further questioning; and all that is supposed to take place within the next three or four weeks.  And it may be that -- to put it in the straightest -- it's all a bit late.  Now, if my learned friend then replies, "Well, we didn't know any of this beforehand," neither did we, the Prosecution.  The Defence have been aware of the existence of this witness for a considerable time, and it may be thought that the inquiries which are being raised today are inquiries which could have been raised by the Defence team at a much earlier stage.  The witness, on behalf of the Defence, could have been investigated better at an earlier time.  

Now, that is not the best point to make on the part of the Crown -- on the part of the Prosecution; however, it's part of the background to the unease that the Prosecution has with pursuing a line of enquiry which basically opens up further investigation whilst we are in the middle of a trial.  And one anticipates that this is a line of enquiry which could arise in respect of almost all of the Rwandan witnesses who are going to be called.  So, I come back to my first submission:  no mention of Rwamakuba, on the face of the material is not relevant.  The second point:  does it get any better for my learned friend?  He's able to make the comment that the witness hasn't referred to Rwamakuba before this trial.  And that is what I submit.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
First of all, we have asked the Prosecution over the years, for indications of any previous statements made by witnesses, and to that we've had no reply.  

Secondly, if I had known that this witness had indeed made a prior statement, I would have got it.  But I don't think it's right or fair to seek to erect a scarecrow of delay here.  We are not seeking to delay things; we are merely seeking, although late through no fault of ours, to do what we can to remedy the lack of knowledge.  

Thirdly, I don't think I need go further in respect of relevance.  There is an issue of relevance here.  In respect of no damage done, because I can make a comment at some point, I don't see why my friend should stand in the way, then, of my obtaining this matter.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I'm inclined to act on the assumption that if the Prosecutor had known of the existence of these statements, that the situation would have been different now.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours is almost right.  If we had known of the existence of these statements, we would certainly have tried to get them, but we may not have got them.  We don't always get what we seek, but we would have tried.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That is what I was getting at.  Now, you see, the situation seems to me that in real circumstances one cannot say that there is a -- I'm not aware that there is a disclosure obligation that has been shown to exist.  And I notice that my friend (sic) does not even allege that.  
MR. MORLEY: 
My learned friend has been perfectly proper in identifying that we don't have this material so that we therefore cannot disclose it.  However, if we had the material we would have to disclose it, and we would have done so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That's the assumption I was -- I wanted to be able perhaps to make.  

Now, it's difficult to make a statement of relevance categorically at this stage, one side or the other, because we don't know the content of the document.  So I think both yourself and Mr. Hooper have equal difficulty on the issue of relevance.  
MR. MORLEY: 
That may be right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what I'm wondering is this -- you see, the other issue then that affects this is the point that you made that we are actually in trial.  Now, I'm wondering whether this is not a situation where, although no obligation exists on the Prosecutor, whether the Prosecutor may be willing to offer good of his service in making enquiries of the statements?  
MR. MORLEY: 
In an ideal world, the position would be that my learned friend would have made these inquiries.  I can tell Your Honour that the facilities at the Prosecutor's office are quite stretched.  I would like to be in a position to tell Your Honour that would be relatively straightforward for the Prosecution to try and find these documents.  I know, however, that it will not be straightforward, and I know that obtaining them is going to take time, whoever tries it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What -- what -- how much time do you think is involved here?  
MR. MORLEY: 
One is almost certainly looking at a period of months.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Months?  
MR. MORLEY: 
It is not as simple, we have discovered, as picking up the telephone and, for example, ringing an officer in Scotland Yard and then material gets produced.  It is a relatively torturous process, where it is not immediately apparent who to speak to and where to find documents wherever they have been filed.  It can be a time-consuming process.  And whether we will ever find the document, I don't know.  And one of the problems which may arise is, for example, if Your Honours can make an order that the Crown -- I'm sorry, that the Prosecution was to go looking for these documents and we cannot find them, it becomes an open-ended situation where we remain under an obligation to see if we can find them somehow.  We are not in control of their location; we are not in control of physically getting our hands on them; we have to rely on others.  

So one wonders whether it becomes a requirement of the Prosecution which we can never establish whether we can fulfill.  We might fulfill it quickly; we might not fulfill it at all.  And we do know from previous experience, getting our hands on these things is quite hard, which may also have been a problem for the Defence if they did go looking for material -- I'm not sure they did, but it's not straightforward.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's clear the Defence has not looked for this because they didn't know about it until now.  So we assume that they haven't look.  

MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes.  If I may make the observation that my learned friend and I do both sides of the bar, as it were.  It would have occurred, I am sure, to the Defence, to have set in motion inquiries about witnesses as to whether they have given previous testimony.  I would respectfully be a little surprised if that is something that they have not sought with their best officers to do themselves as well.  I imagine that they've had a go as well, and I imagine that they will tell Your Honour that it's not that easy to get this material either.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, the key to any successful search of a statement is to know if the statement's being made, first of all, and in respect of which dossier, so that's where the name of the party that the statement refers to becomes so relevant.  If we are provided with that name, and it would be dealt with in the same way as we deal with other redacted material, with proper care and caution.  We have an investigator based in Kigali at the moment; himself Tutsi, and himself a member of the bar in Rwanda, and we will hope that he can, in fact, make his inquiries and discover the dossier and get the documents.  So I'm not asking the Prosecution to get it, though they are very well placed on the ground in Kigali.  If they can help us, well to the good; but if they can't, the least we need is the name of the dossier.  And that gentleman has that information, and once we've got it, we can put such enquiries as we can in hand.  They may be successful, they may not, but at least we can get on with it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Morley, if the names were -- were written and kept under seal, what would be the harm in that?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Frankly, none.  The harm comes if my learned friend finds himself making an application to Your Honour to delay the proceedings in order to investigate material arising from the names.  If my learned friend is saying -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What kind of application are you warning me about?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, the application I would make on the other side is, until I've investigated this material, seen what is in it, and been able to weigh to what extent there should be further cross-examination of the witness, on behalf of the Defence, I would be submitting that we have not completed our cross-examination and the Prosecution case has not been able to come to a close.  And that there should be a delay until such time as that material is in my hand and I have had an opportunity to review it.  That's where it leads to potentially.  

If my learned friend is saying that his office will review the material -- I'm sorry, his office will seek out the material, do his best to find it, and failing being able to find it as the trial proceeds, will not be making applications to adjourn the proceedings, then there is no harm at all.  It gives my learned friend an opportunity to find this material as best he can.  But the harm comes, as I anticipate it might, where my learned friend stands up to say, "The Court has found this material to be relevant; we still haven't got it.  We cannot finish until we have."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
But this is nothing to do with admissibility of evidence at all.  And, however -- well, to quote my friend's submission a moment ago was how much better it would be to be forearmed in the position to question armed with this material.  I haven't made an application in respect of that and I'm not minded to.  All we want is the key to the box, and what's in there may or may not be relevant.  We think it's a probability it will be, but until we see what it is, we are not in a position to come to this Court and make any request.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.  

We think that in the circumstances of this matter that the counsel for the Accused is authorised to ask the witness to write the names, and the Court will admit it in evidence under seal.  Now, we are very concerned about the identity of this witness and the -- I'm sorry, Mr. Witness -- I'm sorry, Mr. Witness, I should have allowed you to hear my ruling in full.  So I will start again for your benefit. 

Yes, we think that the counsel for the Accused would be entitled to ask the witness to write the three names.  The document would be admitted in evidence under seal.  

Now, we also think, Mr. Hooper, that this witness, as a protected witness, is entitled to have the order in his paper extended to this information which should not be disclosed to the public.  You will be entitled to have your Defence team, the investigator, know the names to access the statements but we are emphasising that the protective order in relation to this witness has to be complied to in reliant to this information which is potentially capable of leading to his identification.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Your Honour, we acknowledge that and give the undertaking that the information he provides will be dealt with appropriately and discreetly, and in conformity with what you've just ordered.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, do you understand what I have -- the order?  
THE WITNESS:  
I understood your decision, Mr. President, but I don't have confidence in the fact that the information he is going to obtain will be -- he will keep under seal, and that he will be discreet about them.  The reason for that is that there are other people who came to look for me at my home in the past days.  These are people from the Defence, so I don't trust their confidentiality. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is not in a position to make any guarantees.  What we can tell you is that we are -- we do have a regime of enforcement, and if the Defence team is in breech of the orders made, that there are sanctions that will be applicable, and we enforce our orders in that manner.  We act on the -- I don't know -- that's the position of the Chamber.  So we expect all orders to be obeyed on the basis that if there is a breech there are sanctions that are applicable.  
THE WITNESS:  
All right, Mr. President --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:  
I would be glad if you were to monitor compliance with the decision that you have just rendered, 
	Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that I can give you the assurance that the Tribunal will monitor the performance and the observance of the protective orders.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Just two things in order to save a bit of time: I'm quite content that he provides those names, and perhaps another identifying detail such as the court or the area of the prosecutor where the information is being given so that we can better trace the dossier.  And if he wants to discuss this later with 
Mr. Morley, those matters, I will accept from Mr. Morley the document that's produced rather than do it now.  I'm entirely in your hands.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I?  I thought that if we are going to do this exercise it really needs to be conducted in Your Honour's presence because if I get it wrong, if I don't do it as well as it should be done, or can possibly be subject to some form of criticism because I have had a private conversation with the witness after his testimony, that would be most unfortunate.  Insofar as my learned friend wants material, it won't take very long.  My learned friend is invited, through Your Honour, to ask the questions that he wants answered of this witness, rather than leave it to me.  In that way, my learned friend gets what he wants.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, there is one other -- I don't know whether it would be beneficial and solve the problem in this particular case if the Prosecutor got the statements.  Would that solve the problem?  
MR. MORLEY: 
That's the -- that is going to aggravate the problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It will aggravate the problem.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Because we would then be under obligation to see if we could find that material and insofar as we can't find it, the obligation is never ending.  So I would invite -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have answered my question.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper, it seems that the best effort would be to invite the witness -- and he has agreed to do it -- to write the names on a paper with the limited information required to access the dossier.  And that would be placed under seal in the Court.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, if you could be provided with a piece of paper, and you can do that I would be most grateful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you can say something to me.  
THE WITNESS:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to say that the testimony I gave against these people are -- is in the keeping of the Rwandan prosecutor's office, and as these people have not yet been tried, I cannot tell you where you can find the information.  I shall therefore ask that the Court seek -- look for these documents themselves -- itself because I cannot give you information about where the documentation is found.

1530H
MR. HOOPER: 
While that is being done, can I just raise one matter, quite different matter?  We checked earlier on,   Mr. O'Shea drew to my attention to the possibility that this witness was actually being filmed and the technician we spoke to about an hour ago wasn't too sure, having just come on shift.  We raise it because we may assume, because we are surrounded with cameras, that that is the position.  But I just raise it as a matter of concern, whether there is a specific recording going on of the witness's testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can't answer you on the technical details, but the Court Management Section requested filming for the purpose of our 15bis sitting, so that when Judge Hökborg returns she will be presented with the video transcripts of the testimony.  I have not supervised the technical details or the quality of the filming. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, she will have the advantage of the fast forward button, at least, which we don't.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
But I just raised it but I wasn`t sure if there was actual filming going on in this court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
There is right.  I know that would be a concern -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Aren't you seeing what is filmed on your screen?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, but that is a moving image, a changing image.  It is whether there is actual filming, constant filming of this witness.  And that was the matter that the technician was not able to answer a little time ago.  And I see the registrar pointing to the camera.  If it is being filmed, I merely raised it as matter of concern because if it is not being filmed, that would be a cause of anguish for you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thanks for raising it.  

Mr. Registrar, kindly confirm that the arrangements have been made. 
MR. FRY:
I believe it is being filmed, but I will double-check, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you go, Mr. Registrar, we admit the document and direct that it be placed under seal.  What is the exhibit number?  
MR. FRY:
D. 12, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is exhibit D. 12.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D. 12 admitted, under seal)  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, can I come to political meetings that were held in ***********.  And before July 1993, can you help us as to what meetings you were aware of were held in *****************, meetings, that is, by the MDR? 
A.	Could you kindly remind me of the date, Counsel, please, I don't -- I didn't quite get the date. 
Q.	The date is prior to July of 1993? 
A.	Before July 1993, I am aware of a rally which was organised by the MDR, so this would be only one rally which I remember. 
Q.	So, that is just one rally that you can remember in that area from the time of multi-partyism which, I believe, was early 1991, up until July of '93, just the one rally that you remember for the MDR; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I think I recall one such rally being held.  If there were others, I wouldn't have been aware. 
Q.	And who attended that rally? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you the names of all of those who attended the rally.  Furthermore, I wasn't invited to that rally. 
Q.	Well, did Rwamakuba come around the country side with his car and his loud speaker; do you remember that? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, that question of yours was not interpreted in French because the channel was still with the Kinyarwanda booth, and you are being asked to repeat it, please.  

And by the way, the witness hadn't quite finished his answer, Your Honours.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you understand what is happening?  The translators are having difficulty with two issues:  One, you asked your question before the witness had completed his answer.  And secondly, they are unable to hear your question properly. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry for that.  First of all, I don't know at what point I interrupted the witness.  I wasn't aware that I had done so.  I will leave that to Mr. Morley, perhaps, if he caught that there.  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	My question though, Mr. Witness, was you didn't attend but did you, for example, have the experience, as you had later, of André Rwamakuba coming by with his loud speaker calling MDR members to a meeting?  Did that happen on that previous occasion? 
A.	With regard to the rally which took place in ******* secteur, I said that I wasn't invited there, but that I went there.  Furthermore, I did see people inviting the population, using megaphones to go to attend that rally. 
Q.	Well, I have asked you, who attended the rally?  Who were the principal speakers?  Did you see Rwamakuba there; who did you see? 
A.	I told you that I couldn't tell everyone who was at that meeting, but that there were some people whom I was able to identify, and that seems to me the most important at that -- at that rally. 
Q.	Was Rwamakuba at the meeting? 
A.	Yes, he was present and he was with the others whom I can mention if you so wish.  There was  Arcade Kirenga, the Sha secteur MDR official; there was Anastase Gasana.  There was also Jean-Marie Vianey Makombe.  There was someone else whose first name was Asarias and he was a native of Shango secteur.  I think those were the important personalities or party officials.  As for the remainder, this was just the population who had responded to the call to attend the meeting. 
Q.	And you yourself attended this meeting; is that right? 
A.	I arrived at the venue as the rally was being held, ************ it was held quite close by the Sha trading centre. 
Q.	And when was this rally held? 
A.	I have already told you that it took place before July 1993; I cannot remember the exact month, but this must have been towards the beginning of that year. 
Q.	Are you aware of any other meetings that took place in Kayanga in 1993?  You told us of one later, were you aware of any others in 1993? 
A.	As for rallies which may have taken place in this area in 1993, let me refer to those who -- which took place after July 1993, but which I did not attend.  I would mention, for instance, the rally which was organised in Nduba secteu -- 
Q.	Yes, I'm going to come to that. 
A.	In Shango and Kayanga secteur. 
Q.	Don't worry, I'm going to come to all of that, Rwamakuba calling to the Hutus to exterminate the Tutsi, I'm going to come to that.  I'm asking you now, though, about any other rally that you heard about in 1993 in Kayanga.  Did you hear of any other MDR rally in Kayanga? 
A.	You are mentioning some dates, but if I refer to those dates it is quite likely that I wouldn't be able to recall any meetings or rallies, I'm sorry.  There were rallies that were held during the schism that took place, or the split that came about in the MDR, I remember a rally which was held around January 1994. 
Q.	Yes, but you are going back to that.  Don't worry, I'm going to come to that, I hope in not too long a time.  Do you remember a rally in Kayanga where Anastase Gasana, Faustin Twagiramungu and Agathe, when they came in May of 1993.  There, I have given you all of the detail now; do you remember that? 
A.	Thank you for having reminded me of that detail.  Indeed, I did learn that there had been a rally which brought together Mr. Twagiramungu and prime minister, Agathe, among other people.  But I wouldn't be able to place this rally in time.  I do not remember the date on which that rally took place. 
Q.	Did you come to hear of an incident when Anastase Gasana, in October of 1993, was stoned by a crowd near Chunga, just very near Nduba, did you ever hear of that incident? 
A.	I think I got to hear of that incident.  At a certain point in time, they got to Chunga and the refugees that were there threw stones at him, but I wasn't an eyewitness of that event; I heard it mentioned though.  
Q.	Now, I want to come to your evidence concerning the split in the MDR.  I appreciate that you weren't a member of the MDR, you didn't attend MDR meetings, except for the one you have just referred to, which -- you weren't at Kabusunzu which you referred to.  What you said was this, "I was listening closely to the radio, as I was monitoring the news to find out the political situation.  That is how I learned about the split," that, I suggest you said last week; do you remember saying it and is it true? 
A.	Yes, I do recall having said those words. 
Q.	And you told us how there was a split, you said, "In 1993 before the August signing of the Arusha Accords."  That is what you said.  Do you agree, and is it true? 
A.	I do recall that I made such a statement and I believe that is how things happened. 
Q.	But you were "listening closely" you told us, "monitoring the news to find out the political situation."  And you referred to a broadcast by Karamira immediately after the Kabusunzu conference and the recommendations that had come from that conference.  Do you remember saying that, and is it true? 
A.	I did make such a statement.  And, furthermore, anyone who had a radio set at the time would have heard that news, it wasn't a secret. 
Q.	And as a result of the split, you told us, the power wing came into being in July, at the time of Kabusunzu, the conference; is that correct and is it true? 
A.	I, indeed, said those words, and that, indeed, is how things happened. 
Q.	Thank you.  And you said that you had been told by the person, number 1 on the list, that Andrew -- excuse me, André Rwamakuba had joined the power wing at that time.  And that, indeed, number 1 told you that he had been told that by André Rwamakuba.  Is that -- do you agree that that is what you said, and is it true?
A.	Yes, the person at number 1 spoke to me about this.  He spoke to me of matters occurring in his party.  He is the one who informed me of this matter, and he himself said that he learnt it from the other members of his party who were describing to him the situation prevailing at the time within his party. 
Q.	And you told us, is this correct, that he had been told that by André Rwamakuba; is that correct? 
A.	In his capacity as a representative of the party, I wouldn't be able to confirm that it was only André Rwamakuba who told him, but he himself had told me that amongst others Rwamakuba himself had spoken to him about it too. 
Q.	And do you agree that it was from that witness box, or one very like it I should say, that you said that you had learned of this conversation between number 1 and Rwamakuba, first time you ever mentioned that to anybody was in your evidence on Friday, is that right -- on Thursday, sorry?  
A.	I would like you to remind me of the words which you claim I mentioned for the first time here; it is not quite clear to me. 
Q.	Well, I can, over time, give you the actual transcript, but I only received that recently so you will have to have the benefit of my note.  "They intended to have racial segregation" -- this is about the power    wing -- "This official" -- number 1 on the list -- "who told me had not been present" -- that is at Kabusunzu, -- "but he had met André Rwamakuba who had told him of the change in direction.  And with respect to the ethnic aspect, he told me, and I also heard it when it was broadcast, that they wanted to be powerful and to get rid of the enemy, the Tutsi.  They were saying that the Tutsi -- the Tutsi had to be exterminated."  Do you remember saying that, is it true?  
A.	Yes, I did say that, and it is, indeed, true. 
Q.	And this immediately after the Kabusunzu conference you told us; is that right? 
A.	Yes, it was, indeed, after the Kabusunzu meeting.  That is when we really began to hear such statements. 
Q.	And the particular point I was asking you to agree or disagree with is this:  Do you agree that the first time you spoke of number 1 having a conversation with André Rwamakuba about those things was in evidence, you hadn't mentioned it before in your statement or in any of your discussions with the Prosecutor.  The first time you mentioned it was as you sat in the witness box on Thursday.  Can you agree that that is correct? 
A.	I had already informed the Prosecutor about these facts.  And then I also wish to say that I had met various individuals who were acting on behalf of the Prosecutor.  What I would like to say is that the Prosecutor, who is here with me in this court, already was aware of this information which I had provided him with. 
Q.	Well, I've got a statement -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Can I, at this stage, invite consideration to clarity of the question?  My learned friend has a will-say statement, and my learned friend has, in paragraph 5, reference to meeting with Karanga -- reference to meeting with someone who was able to explain what had happened within the MDR.  The questions which my learned friend is putting are quite long.  And it may be that if the witness is asked the specific question, which I think my learned friend is trying to get to, and then the answer will be more helpful.  But at the moment, I think the witness is answering one question when my learned friend is trying to get at another one. 

MR. HOOPER: 
I will put it more simply. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The first time you mentioned André Rwamakuba having a conversation with someone who then related that conversation to you, was in your evidence on Thursday; is that correct? 
A.	Obviously, this was the first time I had any opportunity to speak about this before a court.  I had not previously had any opportunity to speak about such events. 
Q.	But your evidence is that the power wing started at Kabusunzu and you heard of it as "power" as "MDR Power" on or about July of 1993; is that correct? 
A.	It was at that time that I heard mention being made of that MDR Power.  I had heard of it on the radio.  There was one Froduald Karamira who had mentioned this during a meeting.  So, it was during that period of time that people were hearing mention being made of the term "power." 
Q.	Is it right that the power was first used by Froduald Karamira at a political rally of all parties held in Kigali at the end of October 1993; do you agree with that? 
A.	I don't recall that it was during that month.  As far as I am concerned, I know that it was Karamera who made that speech during a meeting which brought together quite a number of parties.  I know that he was the one official for the power wing, but I'm not absolutely certain that it was in the month of October that he first mentioned MDR Power.  I know very well that this speech which he made was made at the Kigali regional stadium. 
Q.	And can you confirm that it was a rally held immediately following on the murder of President Ndadaye of Burundi? 
A.	I think you are expanding the question so much, whereas we had been discussing the meeting at Kabusunzu, and Ndadaye died at the end of October, or the beginning of November.  But I'm getting the impression that you are moving away from the time when the power wing was born, as it were, in Rwanda, when it first saw the light of day. 
Q.	Well, you have told us the word "power", MDR Power, first came to your ears in July of 1993 after the Kabusunzu conference.  Do you agree you said that, and is it true?  
A.	I got to know about this when rallies were organised after that Kabusunzu conference or meeting. 
Q.	You see, to make it plain, the word "power" didn't begin to enter the Rwandese vocabulary until after the Kigali rally on the 23rd of October 1993.  So there could have been no MDR Power party, as such, before then; do you understand? 
A.	I cannot confirm that this was when this expression was used for the first time.  But the person who invented that expression announced it during political rallies, the political rallies that you have referred to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, are you going on much longer on this line?  

MR. HOOPER: 
This is a convenient point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I beg your pardon?
MR. HOOPER:
This is a convenient point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will take a break now.
(Court recessed at 1604H)
(Pages 40 to 46 by Donna M. Lewis)




























(Court resumed at 1630H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So do you accept, Mr. Witness, that contrary to your evidence, there was no reference to MDR Power before the end of October 1993?  Do you agree with that? 
A.	I don't agree with you because it was being discussed inside the MDR already, but it can be said that it was said publicly when the chairman of MDR Power mentioned it during rallies that brought together all the political parties.  
Q.	Now, you told us that the split that occurred in July at Kabusunzu, when you were listening carefully on the radio and all the rest of it, that that -- let me start that question again.  

You told us last week that the split that occurred at the MDR conference that gave birth to Power, MDR Power, was a split by the group that did not support the Arusha Accords.  Did you say that, and is it correct? 
A.	This wing was created at that meeting.  At that time, there were two different ideologies:  there was one which was based on the Parmehutu.  One wing was based on Parmehutu, and the other one was not -- did not agree with that.  There was a problem in the party, and one of the wings of the party did not -- was not in agreement with the Arusha peace negotiations.  
Q.	Well, as I understand your evidence, they were opposed to the Arusha -- Arusha peace negotiations and did not want the Accords to be signed.  Is that, indeed, your view?  Is that your evidence, as I understood it to be? 
A.	If I go by what was said at the time, this wing did not wish this Arusha peace agreement to be signed because this wing was advocating ethnic discrimination.  
Q.	But your evidence, sir, is that that wing was against the Arusha agreement; is that right? 
A.	The Arusha peace agreement had not been signed as yet, but the various causes -- clauses upon which agreement had been reached had been announced already.  And this wing did not recognise part of these clauses.  
Q.	I'll ask you again for the last time:  Is it your evidence that that wing, the split, was caused by a group who stood against the Arusha Accord?  Yes or no? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And you told us how you heard a radio broadcast about that, and you even heard it broadcast that the Tutsis had to be exterminated; is that right? 
A.	That was the ideology of -- ideology of that wing.  This wing said that Hutus should not accept to be in the power of the Tutsis and that instead Tutsis were to be prevented from gaining access to power.  
Q.	No, the question, sir, is this:  Do you agree you said last week that you heard the broadcast and that it referred to, among other things, the Tutsis had to be exterminated?  Did you say that?  Do you agree you said that?  Is it true? 
A.	At the Kabusunzu congress the terms that were used were not very clear.  Things were said indirectly.  It was said that the enemy must be cast aside, and the enemy at the time was the Tutsis.  
Q.	Can I refer you for a moment, and I'll read this out to you, but many people here will have the document, which is Exhibit P. 4, item 21 on the Prosecution's bundle of exhibits and referred to there as, "Statute of the MDR Party and Kabusunzu Congress held on the 23rd of July of 1993," as published in Urumuli-Rwa Demokrasi MDR newspaper, special edition; and also reference item 24 P. 6, I believe, MDR document number 110, Extraordinary National Congress by MDR Party, dated 24th of July 1993, and it's item P. 4, the first of those items that I'm going to ask you about.  

Now, first of all, in respect of the special MDR Congress, was it not right that the congress was concerned with what it identified as Faustin -- Faustin Twagiramungu's taking too much power within the party?  Is that something you -- you heard and can help us about? 
A.	I was not a member of this political party; I am, therefore, not aware of all that.  
Q.	So you can't help us very much in respect of -- of that? 
A.	About Twagiramungu, I can't help you much, because I do not know what conflict pitted him against the others.  
Q.	You see, that -- that conflict is at the heart of this congress that you've told us all about in a little detail.  Now, you say that the division here involved this split and this group who were taking objection and opposing the Arusha Accords, and it's in that context that I want to just read out some of the recorded motions that were passed by the MDR at that congress.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, before my learned friend does so, it may be thought that a small difficulty arises.  The witness has made it plain that he was not a member of the MDR, and he has made it plain that he did not attend the rally or the congress, which took place in July 1993, and that he wasn't privy to the internal machinations with any precision, precisely what it was that people were arguing over.  

He has given the Court his impression and understanding that a primary source for the split, which undoubtedly did occur, was a concern over the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  

My learned friend is about to start reading out the minutia of various aspects of motions and resolutions drafted during the course of a congress to which this witness was not a participant, and the Court is invited to reflect on to what extent this can be a meaningful examination of this witness.  The difficulty or danger is what is likely to happen, is the Court will hear a lot of what it is that happened at the congress through the mouth of my learned friend, who should not be giving evidence, and the witness will simply be saying, "I can't comment on that; I wasn't there."  So, what I invite Your Honours' attention to, is whether this is a proper line of cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, the document is already in evidence.
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we have accepted -- we already have access to the contents of the document.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So Mr. Hooper will not be giving evidence about that.  We already have it on the record, and I think I should allow him to proceed.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If he overdoes it, I will stop him.  But the witness has made specific statements, and if the document contradicts him, I think it's reasonable for him to have a chance to comment on it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  Thank you.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you hear it announced on the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, one moment. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
I'd like to tell you something about the document that Defence counsel wishes to read.  I have a problem with the authenticity of this document.  I wasn't present at the congress.  He wasn't either.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is -- the Counsel is not reading the document in its entirety.  He is putting one or two matters to give you an opportunity to comment on them.  That's what's going to happen now.  We will be reading the document in any event.  So, it's useful for you to have a chance to comment on sections of it.  

But, Mr. Hooper, I was hoping we were going to finish this witness this afternoon.
MR. HOOPER:
You're not alone in that.  So we are some way from the tape, I'm afraid.  But I'll be as brief -- as concise even, as I can.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The document I'm looking at, Mr. Witness, is a Prosecution document put in exhibit -- exhibited in this case, and I'm looking at our page 14 in the hard copy and exhibit bundle volume 2, page 85 of item 21, exhibit page 4 -- P. 4, I'm sorry.  

Did you hear that the congress had reiterated the MDR's support for peace and true democracy?  Is that something you -- you might have heard or did hear? 
A.	If you're going to put -- going to put questions to me based on what was said during this congress, I shall not be able to answer them.  I only heard the reports that were made there on -- on the radio.  
Q.	All right.  Just on that again, those reports concerned the extermination of the Tutsis, did it? 
A.	A moment ago I answered that question.  They were saying that the enemy was to be eliminated and the enemy was the Tutsi.  
Q.	Did you hear that the congress had denounced and urges the Rwandan people to denounce war and the upheavals that President Habyarimana was preparing(sic)?  Did -- did you hear that?
A.	What I heard were the conclusions that were adopted by the congress, but the radio did not say everything that was discussed during this meeting.  
Q.	Well, let me just read this, item 8-5 of the accepted motions of this meeting.  "Urges the president of the republic to speed up the process of the signing of the peace agreement and, therefore, decries the tactics being used by President Habyarimana and some political leaders, aimed at delaying the signing of the agreement and thereby derailing the democratic process which the country has chosen."  Do you remember hearing that? 
A.	I have told you, Counsel, I have told you what I know.  I'm telling you that I cannot remember everything that was said during the congress.  However, I have told you that in regard to the peace agreements, there was some debate as to the people who were to represent the MDR.  Actually, this is the last point that attracted the attention of the members of the party. 
Q.	Can I repeat those words I've just read, just the first few:  "Urges the president of the republic to speed up the process of the signing of the peace agreement."  Now, you don't remember those words being said, but that is the exact opposite of your evidence in respect of this meeting.  That's right, isn't it?  The exact opposite of what you said in evidence last week?  
A.	If you remember one sentence and you take it out of context, then you can maintain the conclusions that you wish, but this is not the only sentence that was -- was discussed during the congress and the resolutions.  In any case, that the actions - sorry -- that followed this congress did prove that -- prove what I'm telling you.  
Q.	And, finally, the Extraordinary National Congress of the MDR Party held in Kigali on the 23rd and 24th of July 1993, decided 9-1, confirms that the MDR Party is ready to participate in the broad-based transitional government as provided for in the Arusha agreement signed on the 30th of October '92, and the 9th of January 1993.  Did you hear that? 
A.	It was discussed because members of this party -- the members of this wing that had just been created wanted to get together.  I would like to add instead, Counsel, please remind me when this congress that you referred to took place, the date. 
Q.	Well, don't you know? I thought you told us last week.  
A.	There were two MDR congresses, because there was a split within the MDR.  So I'm going to ask you to tell me the date on which this new MDR wing was created.  I just want to be sure -- I just want to be sure about the date.  
Q.	Just tell us -- I'm listening with keen interest -- when do you say there were two congresses?  When was the first one, do you say?  And when, in relation to that, was the second?  And where were each of them held?  And did you listen to them both on the radio? 
A.	I have told you that I was listening to the radio, and these problems were being discussed on the radio and people could hear.  I know that there was a meeting on 26th of July.  I think you referred to another meeting that took place at another date, which is different from the one I have just given.  
Q.	Let -- let me make it plain, the one that I was reading to you.  That was the recommendations and findings, in part, of the Extraordinary Congress held at Kabusunzu on the 23rd to the 24th of July 1993.  Now, do you know another congress of the MDR? 
A.	This is what I was telling you.  Since there was a conflict within the party, there was a first meeting at which a consensus was not reached, and so a second meeting was organised to adopt the conclusions that I have mentioned -- that I mentioned in my statement.  I think that you mentioned the first meeting but not the second.  
Q.	Was that something you've just made up to get yourself out of a tight corner once confronted with the real evidence? Was that something you've just made up? 
A.	No.  This is not a figment of my imagination.  The Kabusunzu conference -- congress that I referred to is the one during in which the power wing of the MDR was created, and this is the wing that joined other political parties to commit the genocide.  

As regards the meeting about which you say that it ended on the 24th of July, the one that you mentioned, I think that the one that I am talking to you about took place on the 26th of July. 
Q.	Was that at Kabusunzu too, that you told us last week that it was? 
A.	We might say that you're dwelling on the meeting that took place first.  And I am telling you that another meeting took place afterwards and that the decisions that were taken at this meeting are those that I am talking about in my testimony here.  
Q.	But that wasn't your evidence last week, was it?  You've changed your evidence between Thursday and today, haven't you?  
A.	No.  Your Honours, I have changed nothing.  Apparently, however, the Defence counsel has information that he's unable to understand.  I - I am talking about the meeting that took place on the 26th of July 1993.  Defence counsel is, for his part, referring to a meeting that took place before that, and it is during this first meeting that a consensus was not reached.  And so there was a second meeting, and it is during this second meeting that the party was split into two wings.  
Q.	Can I suggest there was only one meeting, and it is quite plain, and we have got the paperwork from it.  Where was this second meeting you are now telling us about?  Where was that held? 
A.	At that time, there was more than one MDR meeting.  Before the creation of the Power wing, there had been another meeting where a consensus was not reached.  Subsequently, people who did not wish to stay in the party called another meeting at which they adopted the decisions that I am telling you about in my testimony. 
Q.	You didn't answer the question, with respect.  This new second meeting you're telling us about, where did it take place? 
A.	What I'm telling you about is the one that you're avoiding, and that is the meeting that took place in Kabusunzu.  And you're talking about conclusions that were not adopted at this meeting, and, instead, the conclusions that you have mentioned were those that came before the ones that I am telling you about.  
Q.	But I've just read to you the conclusions of the Kabusunzu meeting from a Prosecution document.  Do you understand that? 
A.	I have told you that the first MDR congress took place, and the members of this -- this party were not able to come to an agreement.  And part of the MDR called another meeting during which a decision was made to create the Power wing of the MDR.  As to the document that the Prosecutor supposedly gave you, I'll tell you that I met more than three prosecutors, and I have the impression that you have not been given the documents that have any connection with the second meeting that took place in Kabusunzu.  
Q.	So both the meetings were in Kabusunzu; is that your evidence?  Yes or no? 
A.	Yes, both congresses took place in Kabusunzu.  
Q.	Quite extraordinary.  All right.  Well, I'm not going to take this any further.  I suggest you are completely wrong, and your recollection on this and on other subject -- subjects is, unfortunately, wholly unreliable.  Do you accept that? 
A.	I am basing my comments on the date that you gave, and it is based on that date that I said that the second congress took place later -- after the date that you gave. 
(Pages 47 to 52 by Jean Baigent)







1700H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me move to another subject.  You told us last week that you met André Rwamakuba in Nduba.  It was a Sunday.  And while you, in fact, were on the veranda, you heard him say these words, that "The Hutus could all unite.  They could then exterminate all the Tutsis, so that when the Inkotanyi returned, there would not be anybody left to meet them."  Do you remember giving that evidence?  And is it the truth?  
A.	As for what was said in Nduba, they were not words spoken out in public.  These were words he said in a small group -- when he was with a small group of people, and they were talking about Tutsis.  This is not exactly what he said at that time.  
Q.	Those are your words on Thursday, that you say you overheard him say -- now, do you want to change that?  Do you want to say that he said something else?  And if you do, will you take this opportunity to say it?  
A.	What I've said is that when I arrived, he was with a small group of people.  I was sitting on the veranda, but they did not mention this subject for a long time.  When they saw me arrive, they didn't continue their discussion, apart from the fact that the way you have just read that extract is not exactly what I said the last time.  
Q.	Can you tell me what you heard them say?  
A.	At that time, when I arrived, I was in the company of someone else.  We sat on the veranda.  And when we arrived, they were discussing the matter concerning the Tutsis.  Rwamakuba was saying that it was high time the Hutus got rid of the Tutsis and that the Hutu needed to unite.  He was referring, I believe, to the MDR.  But as I've told you, they didn't stick to that subject for too long since they saw me arrive, and they stopped talking about that subject and began talking about other things.  
Q.	I'm going to read back your words as they've been taken down by the stenographer in this Court.  And this is on the draft transcript for Thursday, the 16th of June, at page 10, at line 18.  "Yes, I found him at that small Nduba training centre.  It was on a Sunday.  I sat next to people who were with him.  As he was explaining to them, I was outside on the veranda."  I'm going to skip a little bit, but it doesn't lose the sense in any way of what you said.  "During his conversation, he said he was saying that if the Hutus were to unite, they would be able to exterminate all the Tutsi, and, therefore, peace would return to Rwanda.  And if the Inkotanyi were to come to the country, they will find no one to support them."  Those were your words last week.  You're changing them now, are you?  
A.	No, I'm not changing anything about what I had said.  Obviously, I don't have any written document here in front of me like you, yourself, have.  The fact still remains that during their discussions, they were talking about Tutsis.  They were speaking about the Hutus coming together, their union, and they also mentioned the Inkotanyi in their discussions.  
Q.	Did you hear him say that the Hutus could all unite, and they could then exterminate all the Tutsis?  Did you hear that?  Yes or no?  
A.	Yes, I heard it.  
Q.	And is that an honest, accurate recollection of what you heard?  
A.	I remember that he used those words when he was discussing the subject with us -- with whom he was.  
Q.	Sir, is that the truth?  
A.	You're making my job very difficult.  I've answered you, Counsel.  
Q.	Which month was that?  
A.	As for the date, I would need some time to think about that.  I must have given many dates when I was testifying, so I need to think in order to refresh my memory.  At any rate, it was in 1993, towards the end of the year.  
Q.	So you think about it and tell us the date, please.  The month will do.  
A.	It's not an easy thing for me to know the month.  I was passing by that area quite frequently.  All I recall is the rally, but I don't know exactly in which month I would place that event.  
Q.	Last Thursday, I stand corrected if I'm wrong, but I think you placed it in November, didn't you?  Is that right?  
A.	You said November regarding this specific event?  
Q.	It doesn't matter what I say.  What do you say?  
A.	I told you that I recalled that it was near the end of the year, the year 1993.  Now, as for giving you some month or other, that's not very easy for me to do.  
Q.	So towards the end of '93 is the best you can do in respect of this dramatic statement by                André Rwamakuba?  That's your position, isn't it?  
A.	Yes.  I think that it was towards the end of the year 1993.  
Q.	And it is -- I'm sorry.  
MR. MORLEY:
I've allowed my learned friend's cross-examination to continue without rising to my feet at this stage to see how that series of questions and answers developed, but in fairness to the witness, it is right to say that, reviewing the transcript, there was no reference to that veranda meeting being in November of '93.  It wasn't time-framed.  So insofar as my learned friend was putting to the witness what he, my learned friend, says the witness said, I stand to be corrected, but the witness never said November '93.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, if I'm wrong, I am corrected.  The witness's evidence now is, it was at the end of 1993.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) 
MR. HOOPER:
The last two months of 1993.  Thanks.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Towards the end. 
 
MR. HOOPER:
Towards the end?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Towards the end, I think.
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, thank you, sorry.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you'd agree with me that that was a dramatic thing for André Rwamakuba to have said, that you heard, is that right, a terrible and dramatic thing that you heard him say?  
A.	Yes, those were words which made one afraid, but it's not words that he spoke before a big crowd.  He was saying these words within that small group.  
Q.	But those were the only words like that that you ever heard André Rwamakuba say in your presence?  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, it was on that occasion that he mentioned those words.  But later on, I continued to hear people who were with him in that group, continue to say those same words.  
Q.	But that wasn't my question.  Please attend to the question.  That was the only time you were in the presence of André Rwamakuba and heard him say anything like that; is that correct?  Yes or no?  
A.	That was the only time that I heard Rwamakuba speak words of that nature.  I didn't hear him again speak such words in front of anyone.  
Q.	So the answer is yes.  So let me ask you this.  Why is it that it was only from that witness box on Thursday that you've told anyone about that?  It's not in your statement.  It's not in your investigator's notes.  It's not in the long will-say that was taken by Mr. Morley shortly before you gave your evidence.  There's no reference to it anywhere until you said it in evidence on Thursday.  Why is that?  
A.	Counsel, I think what you're saying is not true.  I spoke about this to the investigators, to the Prosecutor, and to others whom I met, even the Prosecutor who is here present.  I think that it should be written down somewhere in the documents available.  You, yourself, have said that one can't read about this anywhere, but all those I have met told me that they wrote down all my statements, all I said in the documents, because they were telling me that I was going to appear before the Tribunal and speak about these things.  
Q.	But you may recall when you did mention it last week, Mr. Morley was good enough to indicate it was the first time you'd said it.  I don't need an answer to that.  But now you're saying you have told people before, and they haven't written it down?  Is that what you're saying?  
A.	I want to say that through the document which was drafted by the investigators, it turned out that the genocide was planned at that small drinking place.  They were telling me that they didn't write down everything, but that I needed to give further information once I got to the Tribunal.  
Q.	So you left out the one and only time in your presence André Rwamakuba spoke about exterminating the Tutsis?  You left that out then?  That's correct, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, I want to apologise to you.  I'm not a very technical person.  I'm not the one who was taking down the notes.  I think that the whole content of our interview does not appear in my statement, by the way.  
Q.	I'd like you to be shown, at some point, your original statement, the investigator's note, and the will-say statement, all three documents, so that they can be exhibited.  I'm not sure when the appropriate time for that is.  I notice the time now, and there will be re-examination as well.  I've got two more areas to cover -- three more areas to cover, but perhaps I can move on at this point to one of them, which is the rallies that you say were held.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, is there any objection to these documents going in?  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't know at this stage.  It may be that the matter can be reviewed after re-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Just at some point, if there is any objection, I need to formally introduce those documents to the witness so that he can identify the first lot.  And he's seen one already and identified that, as I understand it, as an inaccurate record of a meeting that did take place.  And I don't think as yet he's been shown the will-say statement that was taken by Mr. Morley, but that, also, I have in mind to put to him.  So lest I forget, I'd like just to flag up those three matters.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I come to rallies?  You refer, in your statement, to André Rwamakuba coming every weekend to your area, in order to hold rallies; is that correct?  Did he come every weekend?  
A.	I don't believe that I used the term "every" weekend, but I did see that they wrote down my statement in that -- or in those terms, but it is not true that he came every weekend.  I said that he came during weekends, but I didn't say "every" weekend.  
Q.	Well, let me just read what it says at GLM 4, for the record, page 4 of your statement, that is, of February '98.  "Every weekend he was seen travelling about on his political business, which mainly consisted in inciting the Hutus to kill the Tutsis."  Do you accept you said that in your statement or not?  
A.	I have told you that those who took down what I said did not do so correctly.  I didn't say that he came there every weekend.  I said that he would come during weekends, and this means, in my view, that he did not come every weekend.  As for what he said when he came, he would pass by groups of people, and he would talk to them about politics.  He spoke words which dealt with politics.  As for ethnic groups, he said that the Tutsi ethnic group presented problems.  Now, if you're asking for details of everything he said, it's not very easy to remember everything he said.  
Q.	In the French, which is the document that was signed by you, the phrase is "tous les week-end," which means every weekend, does it not?  And you speak French.  
A.	Yes, that's what I was telling you.  They didn't take down what I was saying properly.  Yes, I do agree with you.  They wrote "tous les week-end," all weekends, every weekend, but that wasn't true.  
Q.	And didn't you read it through, and weren't you given the opportunity to correct anything?  And did you not sign it, stating that you had had that opportunity and that everything was correct?  
A.	Yes, you can insert amendments, but it is also possible that you do not realise that there's one mistake or other.  I only realised this after the document had already been drafted and signed.  
Q.	So you did realise there was a mistake, did you?  Sorry.  I'll repeat it.  

You did realise that there was a mistake in your statement, but it went uncorrected; is that your evidence?  
A.	I think that I've explained this to you.  I realised that there was a mistake later on, and I do admit that I should have corrected it.  
Q.	None of these meetings you, yourself, attended, as we know, but in respect of each of the three meetings -- one held at Nduba, one held at Shango, and one held at Kayanga -- you received information from others; that is correct, is it not?  That is your evidence?  
A.	Yes, you are right.  That's what I said.  
Q.	And in respect of each of the meetings, your evidence was that André Rwamakuba was reported to you as having said, among other things, "exterminate the Tutsis."  Did you say that, and is it true?  
A.	Yes, that is the truth.  That's what I was told.  
Q.	And was each of these meetings on a Sunday?  
A.	The rallies often were held on Sundays because that was the time people had to attend meetings.  
Q.	That may be why you say it's a Sunday.  I'm asking you, were these meetings on a Sunday?  
A.	The people who gave me this information told me that these rallies had taken place on Sunday.  
Q.	Well, that's a change in your evidence again, is it not?  Because let's deal with Nduba.  You told us, only on Thursday, that that was a Sunday and that you actually heard the megaphone, you actually heard the car that came by your house.  Which was it?  Was it something you saw, yourself, or something you were told by somebody else, re it being a Sunday?  
A.	There was no problem for people to move about on a Sunday.  I, myself, was at home.  I didn't go to work, and so that didn't create any problem for me.  
Q.	No.  What I'm asking you, sir, is this.  In your evidence last week, you said, in respect of the Nduba meeting, it was a Sunday in October of 1993.  First of all, do you agree with that, it was a Sunday in October '93?  
A.	Yes, that's what I said.  
Q.	And you said André Rwamakuba had the megaphone; is that right?  
A.	Yes.  They were in a vehicle and that vehicle was equipped with a megaphone.  
Q.	So André Rwamakuba, you told us, had the megaphone; is that right?  
A.	I think you are trying to put words in my mouth.  If Rwamakuba was at the wheel and the person who was sitting beside him was speaking through the megaphone.  
Q.	Well, then, whatever it was, when I asked you, "Was it a Sunday," why did you start telling us that somebody had told you it was a Sunday?  You'd either have known or you wouldn't know? 
A.	These people didn't tell me that that day was a Sunday.  I, myself, remember that Sunday.  What I'm saying, however, is that the facts reported to me concerning this incident took place on a Sunday.  And these people who informed me were the ones who told me that it was a Sunday.  I'm talking about the day on which that incident took place.  
Q.	Now, the next meeting you told us about was at Shango.  What did you see there?  
A.	I did not say that I went to that rally.  It is someone who was present at the rally who told me what had been said at the rally.  
Q.	I understand that, but what did you see of the rally?  
A.	When people went to the rally, they took the same road.  They were on board a vehicle, and they were calling people to come en masse to this rally.  That is what I saw.  That is all I saw about the rally.  
Q.	Did you see Rwamakuba?  
A.	Yes, I saw him on that day.  He was on board a vehicle.  
Q.	What was he doing?  
A.	He was at the wheel of his car.  That's what he was doing.  Is that what you want to know?  
Q.	And you saw him and recognised him?  
A.	He was driving his own vehicle.  
Q.	And you saw him and recognised him, did you?  
A.	I saw him.  I recognised him.  It was not the first time I was seeing him.  
Q.	And that, you told us, was in November?  That's correct, is it?  
A.	I said that it was between November and December.  In any case, it was towards the end of the year because I don't have the exact dates in mind. 
(Pages 53 to 58 by Wendy Molnar)














1735H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In which case, leaving aside what you said in evidence, I believe you did specify the date as November.  Why did you tell Mr. Morley, when he spoke to you on the 13th of June, so recently, that in November 1993 there was similar announcement by megaphone of a rally which was to take place in Shango.  You specify the month, you see, there.  
A.	I did say that it was the month -- that month, but what I was saying was that I did not know the exact date.  I did not know the day. 
Q.	So you know the exact month but not the day.  That's your quibble there, your disagreement -- not disagreement.  Let me start the question again.  You agree that it was in November and you can be precise about that?  

I'm sorry, I didn't get your answer there, you agree it was in November? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda interpreters did not get the question.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm putting the question again.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So you agree that it was in November 1993 that the meeting took place in Shango, but you can't be precise about the day; is that your evidence? 
A.	That is what I said.  I said that it was this month, but a while ago, I was telling you that I couldn't remember the precise date, the day. 
Q.	Just to be sure, the Nduba rally took place on a Sunday in October; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I said that the Nduba rally was organised in October.  That was on a Sunday. 
Q.	And again, the first time you ever told anyone of those specific rallies in those specific months was to Mr. Morley on the 13th of June 2005; is that correct? 
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, before the witness answers that particular question -- before the witness answers that particular question, it's always a difficulty when one puts previous statements, which had not been placed before the witness, to ensure that what has been put is entirely accurate.  My learned friend is invited to remind himself of the third paragraph of the investigator's notes of the 14th of February of 2004, because what is being factually put to the witness at this point may not be reflected in the paperwork which of course the witness does not have in front of him.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And what you say there is that the witness specifies -- this is the notes of the enquieteur that's just been referred to, much of which you disagree with, but at the third paragraph it says, "The witness specifies that during the months of November/ December and 1993, Rwamakuba, André had held several meetings in which he had made some incendiary statements against Tutsis."  

So that's the context of it.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And so, you mention his coming in November, December, in the notes of the enquieteur, shortly before giving evidence, you mentioned more specifically that it was a Sunday in October for Nduba, and a November meeting for Shango.  I think we can agree on all that.  But on neither occasion do you say that you saw André Rwamakuba yourself, and that doesn't appear in Mr. Morley's document either.  So the first time that you say you actually saw him in respect of those meetings is in evidence, when you gave evidence on Thursday; is that correct?  
A.	I do not think that is a correct translation of what I said.  I was talking about Rwamakuba when I was talking with the various members of the Prosecution team.  Each time he went to rallies, I saw Rwamakuba go past on board a vehicle.  You must understand two things:  I always saw Rwamakuba when these meetings were being held, but I have pointed out that I myself did not go to the venue of the meetings. 
Q.	And it's also right that in no time have you ever told anyone that André Rwamakuba used the words "exterminate the Tutsis."  Do you agree that the first time you said that was from the witness box on Thursday; is that right? 
A.	Regarding the statements that I made, I didn't quote what Rwamakuba said.  I do not think I gave word for word quotations of what this gentleman said.  That wasn't the case. 
Q.	Did you ever hear of a meeting of any kind held in Kayanga in 1994, where Rwamakuba was present with Gasana? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, are you moving on to a new area?  
MR. HOOPER: 
That's as far as I'm moving into it.  It's a "yes" or "no" or hope he'd answer and then that would be an appropriate moment to rise, yes.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Could we have your answer in respect of that?  Did you ever hear of a meeting in Kayanga, of any kind, in January in 1994 in which Rwamakuba was present together with Anastase Gasana and Aloys Munyangazi? 
A.	I referred to the rally which took place in Kayanga at the beginning of 1994.  I do not know whether the other people -- the two other people whom you referred to were present at it.  What I also know is that before the split in the MRD and the birth of the power wing, I was given to understand that these three people used to hold meetings together. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Just a moment, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I address Your Honour just very briefly?  My address rises out of a question three questions back.  I rose to my feet but then saw my learned friend was in full flow, so I sat back down again.  It comes back to the same difficulty which mentioned a little earlier concerning accuracy of what it is that's being put to the witness that the witness did or did not say in his previous statements.  The witness doesn't have the documents in front of him, and it may be that as my learned friend asserts that the witness did or didn't say something in his statements previously, it resonates in the mind of the Tribunal as being something which must be right because my learned friend is asserting it and the witness, of course, isn't able to correct it because the statements aren't in front of him.  

A moment ago, my learned friend mentioned that in the will-say statement there was no specific reference to seeing Rwamakuba in connection with the rallies which Your Honour has heard about, the rallies in Nduba, Shango, and I think we then moved on to Kayanga.  However, in fairness to the witness, Your Honour may recall a paragraph which my learned friend read out from the witness's statement where the witness then took issue with the expression "every weekend."  And that paragraph coming from the witness's statement of the 11th of February 1998 -- so right back at the very beginning--  of GLM-4, and I read the paragraph again, as my learned friend has already read it into the record, paragraph 5:  "I personally saw him" -- that's Rwamakuba, "assembling the people in his capacity of as a member of the MDR-Power préfectural committee.  Every weekend" -- and Your Honour will then recall there was a big argument about whether or not it was in fact every weekend -- "every weekend he was seeing travelling about on his political business, which mainly consisted in inciting the Hutus to kill the Tutsis."  

So in fairness to the witness, it may not be strictly accurate to say that in respect of rallies, he, the witness, has never mentioned, until he gave testimony on Thursday, seeing Rwamakuba in connection with the gathering of people to attend the rallies.  I try to make that clear.  I hope not inelegantly at this late hour, because it may be a point of some importance.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  We'll make the appropriate comparisons when -- at the relevant time when we are assessing the weight of this witness's testimony.  

I think this probably is an appropriate time to take our adjournment now, and we rise until tomorrow morning.

Mr. Hoop, how much time do you have?  
MR. HOOPER: 
30 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have 30 minutes more?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, and I hold myself to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I am looking forward to Mr. Hooper holding himself to the 30 minutes.  It is difficult to know, and I fully respect the fact that my learned friend is in difficulty knowing exactly how long he would take, and I have to say the same.  I would have thought I may be an hour in re-examination.  If -- if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm -- don't get me wrong, I'm not intending to impose a time limit on you.  I just was trying to get an assessment of the extent of your examination, for planning purposes and maybe to encourage you to keep it as brief as you could.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I will try to be brief.  It isn't so much the length of the questions and the length of the answers which makes the matter take so much time, it does appear that within the Tribunal of this nature where there is simultaneous translation, everything slows right down.  And I think my learned friend and I, we're pretty good at guessing exactly within five to ten minutes how long a witness would be back home, but here it is tricky.  So I think about an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, are we sitting here tomorrow or back in normal court?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know yet.  Mr. Registrar, do you have any information?  

Thank you for making that enquiry.  

I have been informed that the arrangements that have been made for us is that we will continue sitting here in this room until Wednesday, inclusive.  I am told that on Wednesday we will get more information as to where we will be continuing, but we are here until Wednesday, inclusive.  

We adjourn now.
