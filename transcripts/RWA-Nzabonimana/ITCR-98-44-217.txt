P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, please open the proceedings.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 15th of December 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba case no. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began giving evidence yesterday.  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper will continue his examination of you this morning. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I make an apology?  I was outside; I've been here since quarter to nine and I hadn't realised that Your Honours had assembled.  It was my fault.  I was speaking to everyone as they were going in.  I should have paid more attention. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley. 

Mr. Hooper, are you ready?  
MR. HOOPER:
Can we return into closed session, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  For the benefit of the public, we have been taking this witness in closed session and closed session testimony is not concluded as yet.  About how much time do you estimate, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
An hour, maybe a bit longer than that; 10:15.
  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we go into closed session for approximately one hour.

MR. HOOPER:
And I meant to summarise, with the Court's leave, the evidence of the last witness in open session so there was at least some public appreciation of the nature of the evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we are reaching this stage now where we're going to have to decide whether to call the next witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
We've lost a lot of time this week, not entirely due to -- for lots of reasons.  It would be very difficult for this witness, I think, to make the emotional journey she's made, she's very young, to this Court or Chamber again.  I never thought her evidence would take long.  I've said an hour, and I think that's reasonable.  I hope to do it in less.  But I feel it would be a very burdensome imposition on her to have to bring her back again.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. HOOPER:
And I suspect, Mr. President, you and your brother Judges have seen her statement and can appreciate that she isn't going to be a -- a long witness. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated) 

Good evening, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming to give testimony in the trial before our Tribunal.  The first step that would happen is that the registrar will administer an oath to you to tell the truth.  

Mr. Registrar, could you.
(Declaration made by Witness 1/1 in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Madam Witness, as in most court trials, you will give your evidence by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers who have been designated for that purpose.  The lawyer who will be questioning you first is Mr. Hooper, who is representing the Accused, Dr. Rwamakuba.  

Now, Mr. Hooper, are you ready?  

MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 

We're -- we're in closed session -- I'm sorry.  We're in open session. 

But this is a witness who would prefer, I think, to be in closed session for reasons that have already been hinted to in the last witness's evidence, and a general concern for security.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will go into closed session now.
