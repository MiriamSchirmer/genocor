(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding; Judge Hökborg; and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 30th of November 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The appearances are the same?  Yes.

Now, just before the witness recommences testimony, the Chamber is now ready to address the Defence motion seeking disclosure of closed session transcripts of evidence previously given by two Defence witnesses in the matter of the Prosecutor against Kamuhanda and the Prosecutor against Niyitegeka.  Under Rule 75(G)(ii) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence this Chamber has the power to order that witness protective measures ordered in prior proceedings before the Tribunal shall be modified to permit disclosure of closed session transcripts of evidence given by protected witnesses.  The Chamber therefore grants the Defence motion.

Secondly, we request the registrar to disclose to the Defence the closed session transcripts of the testimonies given by Defence Witness 1.13 and 1.5 in the matter of the Prosecutor against Kamuhanda and the Prosecutor against Niyitegeka.  

And, thirdly, we request the Defence to comply with the protective measures previously ordered in the cases of the Prosecutor against Kamuhanda and the Prosecutor against Niyitegeka.

That is the Chamber's order.  

In order to facilitate the proceedings, I would ask you, Mr. Hooper, to liaise with CMS to obtain the closed session transcripts that you need.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. MORLEY:
In light of Your Honour's ruling, the witnesses attracting the protective measures, in the usual way a witness attracting protective measures would be the subject of disclosure of statement to the Prosecution, I'm anticipating that Your Honour has in mind that we should have those statements, as the witnesses have now attracted protective measures.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought that would have followed automatically and, if necessary -- Mr. Hooper, is it necessary to make an order to that effect?
MR. HOOPER:
I think the Prosecution have access to them, in any event.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So an order is not necessary.  Thank you.

Madam Witness, you may put on your headphones now.  You are entering the last phase of your evidence where Mr. O'Shea will re-examine you.  I remind you that you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began giving your testimony.  

Mr. O'Shea?
WITNESS 9/1 (continued) 
RE-EXAMINATION

MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  Madam Witness --
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	-- at the time that you were in Gisenyi during the war in 1994, do you remember who was the préfet at that time?
A.	No, I do not remember the préfet's name.
Q.	Thank you.  You described your position while you were in Gisenyi and hosting Dr. André Rwamakuba and his family -- you described your position as a housewife.  Can I ask you this:  did you have your own children?
A.	Yes, I did state that I was a housewife while I was in Gisenyi.
Q.	Did you have your own children?
A.	Yes, I had children.
Q.	How many children were you looking after in the household during the period that we've been discussing?
A.	There were very many of us -- there were very many of them.  There were my children, Rwamakuba's children.  There were also my brother's and sister's children, who were with me.  I also had with me two orphans.  Actually, there were more than 10 of them -- 10 children.
Q.	Thank you.  Do you remember who washed André Rwamakuba's clothes?
A.	We did it, his wife and myself.  We were the ones who washed his children (sic), unless there was another person who was tasked with washing the clothes.  Otherwise, it was yours truly and his own wife who washed his clothes.
Q.	Let me just be clear about this, because I wasn't sure from the translator -- and no disrespect meant to them -- but you're talking about André Rwamakuba's clothes, are you?
A.	Yes, we're talking about André Rwamakuba's clothes, of course.
Q.	Do you ever remember anything unusual about his clothes when you washed them?
A.	I don't remember anything special about his clothes when we washed them.  In any case, his clothes were not usually very dirty.  He never wore his clothes for long, so they weren't dirty -- they weren't that dirty when we washed them.  No, his clothes weren't dirty.  He didn't wear his clothes more than once or twice in succession before having them washed.
Q.	Why was it that he'd wash his clothes regularly?
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, is this new or additional evidence?  Mr. President, I believe -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, does this really arise out of cross-examination?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, it does, Your Honour, because the whole line of cross-examination -- oh, could the witness take her headphones off? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the question that you are exploring?  
MR. O'SHEA:
André Rwamakuba's clothes and why they were -- well, the witness -- my initial question was --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I am dealing with the cross-examination.  What does it arise from? 
MR. O'SHEA:
It arises from the questions which were directed at saying that she wouldn't know what André Rwamakuba's activities were when he wasn't at the house, so it goes to André Rwamakuba's activities as the Prosecution outlined them in their case.  Anyway, I'm happy to move on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	You said that your parents -- did you say that they lived in Tare, or where did you say that they lived?
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  My parents live in the Tare commune.
Q.	Do you remember -- well, can I ask you this:  where is the Tare commune; which préfecture is it?
A.	Tare commune is found in Kigali préfecture at the border or -- at the border with Kigali, Byumba and Ruhengeri préfectures.
Q.	Do you remember how long it took you to get to your parents' house from Gisenyi?
A.	I cannot remember.
Q.	Very well.  During the course of your cross-examination you referred to the relationship between Patrick and André Rwamakuba.  And --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And from what I heard from your response through the booths, I was a little bit confused by the answer, because I heard reference to a grandfather.  Can you just clarify, what was the relationship between Patrick and André Rwamakuba?
A.	Patrick is not the son of Rwamakuba's grandfather, but, rather, he is the son of Rwamakuba's older brother, whose name is Alphonse Nkubana.
Q.	During the latter part of my learned friend for the Prosecution's questions, she showed you a photograph I had shown you and another photograph.  Can I please show you a third photograph?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honours, this is a photograph which the Chamber has seen before, which Mr. Hooper referred to in his opening -- the photograph taken at the UNDF.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	How does that photograph accord with your recollection of André Rwamakuba?
A.	I find that the picture does show André Rwamakuba -- is a picture of André Rwamakuba, but he's put on some weight.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, if that photograph could please be marked Exhibit D. 177, I think.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. 177 admitted)
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you.
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Now, the Prosecution asked you questions about your knowledge of what André Rwamakuba was doing when he was not at the house and the fact that you wouldn't know what he was doing when he was not at the house.  When he was at the house, from your perception and your conversations with him, what did you see was his preoccupation?  What was on his mind?
A.	I noticed that he was rather concerned over his children and wife.  He was occupied with the departure from Gisenyi of his family.  He did not want his family to remain in Gisenyi.  He wanted his family to be in safer -- at a safer location.  He was also concerned over the health of his child who was ill, because the child was visibly ill.  The child kept complaining, and he was not at rest when he saw his child in pain.
Q.	Madam Witness, those are all my questions.  I believe those are all the questions you're going to receive, but you may receive questions from the Judges.  Thank you very much for your cooperation.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, those are all my questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.

Madam Witness, that brings to an end your evidence before the Tribunal.  We thank you for coming to give testimony, and you are now excused.
MR. O'SHEA:
Just one other matter, Your Honour.  Could this witness be given leave to see Dr. André Rwamakuba? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, permission is granted.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
THE WITNESS:
I would like to thank you, Mr. President.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
THE WITNESS:
I would like to thank you for having made it possible for me to travel smoothly and for putting questions to me.  You made sure that I was comfortable and -- so that I can testify under appropriate, suitable conditions.  And I'd like to thank you for this very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE WITNESS:
I would like to encourage you in your work.  I would also like to encourage you, and I know that you are judging, or you'll pass judgement according to your discretion and that you're trying to seek the truth and, therefore, I would like to express the wish that André Rwamakuba should be able to go back to his family.  This is somebody who did medical studies.  You know, the world needs doctors, and we -- I am expressing the wish that he is released some day so that he can go back to his family and serve -- and be of service to society, especially with the medical education that he has.  

Thank you.  I would also like to thank you for having given me the opportunity of seeing him.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would just like to tell you that the judicial function is not influenced by fear or by favour.  We do our job according to the evidence that is adduced and the legal principles which are applied to that evidence.  Thank you very much for what you said, and you may leave now.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Adds witness.  
(Witness excused)
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think there was an oral motion filed yesterday by Mr. Hooper in respect of disclosures.  I don't know if this is the appropriate time to address that motion, or should we wait until we finish listening to the testimony of the witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you ready to address it now?  You're ready to make your submission?
MS. FALL:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can hear you now.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Concerning the oral motion filed by Mr. Hooper yesterday concerning disclosures under Rule 68, we were able to carry out research, and we can put forward the following answers when we carried out research.  Under Rule 68 we base ourselves on the name of the Accused and on the crime sites that correspond to the dates for which we are accusing André Rwamakuba of having perpetrated certain crimes.  

We actually carried out detailed research, and we disclosed all that we found and all that was in our custody.  We disclosed all of this in April 2005, well before commencement of the trial in June.

And we must say that, before commencement of trial, Defence was able to have access to EDS, and this made it possible for them to undertake their own research in accordance with criteria that they deemed to be important.

We feel that the Defence -- their position was that the material will be exculpatory if Rwamakuba's name is not in the said material.  Well, we don't share this position, and we feel that under Rule 68 we have fulfilled our obligations.

On 20 June, a few weeks after commencement of the trial, the Defence disclosed to us a list of over 200 names, and they indicated that these were names that had been mentioned by Prosecution witnesses in their testimonies.  And in the statements of others the Defence didn't give any reason for seeking disclosure of the statements, except for the reasons that the names were mentioned by the witnesses.  

Now, in reply to that request, we said we didn't have the possibility of carrying out research on all those names.  Finally, your Chamber ordered -- or thought the number of names were too high and that the Defence should reduce this list.

Following this, on 14 July we disclosed redacted statements, since the Defence did not have, or was not entitled to, unredacted statements as per the rules.

On 10 October the Defence requested, in an email, the disclosure of statements of 58 pseudonyms that were witnesses in the Butare case.  We carried out research and we found that many hadn't statements, because they were never called to come and testify by the Butare team.  Some of them were really part of another list of witnesses, so the Defence had already received their statements.

The remaining witnesses had their statements disclosed to the Defence with the notice of admitted facts.  That is when we had to disclose the motion of admitted facts.

In conclusion, Mr. President, we would like to say that we spared no effort at bringing assistance to the Defence, to the extent of what we can do, but we feel that there is some investigation that should be done by the Defence team itself.  We can't do investigations in their place, and we cannot look for witnesses or call witnesses that they should witness (sic).  

So even if I don't say this all the time, I would like to say that we are aware of our obligations.  As the rules prescribe, insofar as disclosures are concerned, we intend to comply with them, and we will disclose to the Defence -- and that's what we have been doing -- we will disclose to the Defence any material that is in our custody and that can be given to the disclosure (sic).  This, therefore, is our response to the oral motion that was raised by Counsel Hooper yesterday.  And thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall.

MR. HOOPER:
Well, very briefly in response, because of our concern of non-disclosure of relevant statements, we did present a list of perhaps close on 200 names gleaned from statements in this case.

It is not right to say that the Chamber thought that that was too many.  It was in fact the Prosecution who raised the objection, and suggested that in fact to research so many would be too burdensome on the Prosecution.

And, as I recall the position of the Chamber, the Chamber merely sought to seek a compromise between the requests of the Defence and the objections of the Prosecution and, as a consequence of that, a shorter list was submitted.

We hear this morning that the Prosecution have conducted themselves thoroughly, diligently and properly and, as a consequence of that, furnished the Defence with all exculpatory material in their possession and that they have done that by April of either this year or last year -- I've forgotten -- but I accept the date suggested by Ms. Fall.

Well, the question then arises:  how is it that the statement of the witness before last was never disclosed?  If that was a diligent and thorough review of exculpatory material, how is it that that statement was not disclosed?

I use that one statement -- I could refer to others -- as an exemplar of a thought in the process which represents for us a tip to an iceberg.  That is our worry and our concern.  We suspect the Prosecution are using a far too narrow definition of "exculpatory".  If they wish to argue it, then let them argue it, please, in the context of the statement I've just referred to.  I am reminded that that is Witness 6/10, to be specific.

Is that, in the Prosecution's view, an exculpatory statement, or not?  And it might be a reasonable test bed of their view.

Now, recently, because of a document that came into our hands, we made a request in respect of the statements served in the Butare case.  Again, you see, we've no way of knowing or judging whether the Prosecution have in fact reviewed their position properly.

What does surprise us, though, is that all the Prosecution need do is offer us statements, even redacted statements.  And one is puzzled by a reluctance to do that and rather taken aback by the suggestion that really it is for the Defence to make their enquiries.  Well, I assure the Prosecution that the Defence have made their enquiries, but there are some areas into which we cannot intrude and we have to rely on the goodwill and diligence of the Prosecution and of the Prosecution applying a fair criteria to what is and what is not exculpatory.

The product of the Butare witness list, for example, in respect to the hospital was that we were provided with statements of three of those on the list.  We were not given view in any way of the other 15 relating to the hospital.

In respect of the préfecture, we were provided with 10 statements and not provided with 27.  And we wonder whether there has been such a diligent and appropriate review of that evidence, as should be.  And who does this?  Who conducts, and has conducted, the review of exculpatory material in the Prosecution team?  We don't know.  Is it handed down to an intern who has been here six weeks, with six weeks to go?  We don't know.

The fact is that 6/10 provided a statement to the Prosecution that had the word "exculpatory" written all over it, and it was never, ever disclosed until we forced it out of the Prosecution a month or so ago.  So there's our concerns, and hence the matter that was raised yesterday.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I won't prolong the debate, but I should merely like to give some clarification and correction to the extent that I think we have demonstrated here before the Chamber that the disclosure of 6/10 was done on 14 July 2005, and not as Mr. Hooper claims.

Moreover, the criterion of what is exculpatory in their eyes is so large, so wide, that if we were to disclose all the statements, it might take us all year to do so.

I think, indeed, there is a problem as regards the Defence's concept of "exculpatory" in respect of ours -- versus ours.  I should like Counsel Hooper to grant us as much of a degree of seriousness as they -- and we do not use interns to undertake our disclosures.  However, I do not wish to reveal to Counsel Hooper our work methods.

We should like to ask that this matter be dealt with in a written submission so that we can be much more precise.  We also recall, and I stress this, that EDS is there to help the Defence and to undertake all the necessary investigations.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, Counsel for the Prosecution said "EDS", or something like that.  I'm not sure.  EDS, yes, right.  Okay, thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I'm not going to take up time, but just in respect of EDS, as you know, that was a relatively recent provision of access to Prosecution material.  The problem is that the statements contained with it are redacted and nameless, so you can't do a search, even if you have a name of a witness.  And it is also not complete -- in fact, it's incomplete.

So the Defence are not, at present, particularly assisted by that system.  I can assure my friend that we have accessed it and used it, I think to the full, but with little consequence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you very much for the submissions that were made.  I'm sure it is obvious that we will have to deliberate.  We can't respond now, and we'll respond as soon as we are able to.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I call the next and protected witness, 3/22, please?  While he is on his way, can I distribute the witness identification document?  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are now going to start your testimony.  We thank you for coming to give evidence before the Tribunal.  The first thing that will happen is that the registrar will administer an oath for you to tell the truth during your testimony.  The registrar will now give you an oath.
(Declaration made by Witness 3/22 in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony before the trial.  Mr. Witness, I was trying to explain to you that you will give your testimony before the trial by answering the questions put to you by the lawyers who are designated that task.

The first person who will be asking you questions will be the lawyer representing the Accused, Dr. Rwamakuba, and you'll have to answer those questions.  Do you understand me?
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Now, I would invite the lawyer, Mr. Hooper, to commence his examination.  

WITNESS 3/22
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are a protected witness, and I hope you have before you a document with details on it.
MR. HOOPER:
Has the witness got the document?  He has; thank you very much.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	This is a document we've been through before, and perhaps I can deal with this in closed session, together with some other matters, and the closed session will take me 10 minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, as a protected witness, the Tribunal takes steps to prevent your identity from being revealed to the public.  So sensitive questions which may reveal your identity are dealt with in a closed session to which the public has no access.

This will last approximately 10 minutes, as Counsel has said, so we go into closed session now, which will permit you freedom to answer all questions.  We go into closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 12 to 13] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 11 by Maureen Dunn)

















MR. PRESIDENT:
We go back into open session now.  

Now, Mr. Witness, that means that the public are present.  The Chamber and lawyers working here have experience in respecting the interests of protected witnesses, but if there is any question that is asked of you and you think that the answer you're going to give could reveal your identity, you should draw it to my attention, and the necessary action will be taken.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've signed the identification document.  And can that be exhibited, as I believe the number would be D. 178, under seal, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 178 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	In closed session we heard a little about where you live, and your own experiences.  And now, in open session, let me take you to the 6th of April 1994 and ask you this.  In your area did you observe any difficulties between Hutus and Tutsis before the death of President Habyarimana?
A.	There was no problem between the two ethnic groups, and those who fled from combat and came to seek refuge in our area we welcomed as Rwandan brothers, and they stayed in our area.
Q.	Did that situation change and, if so, can you tell us how things developed after the 6th of April?
A.	After the 6th of April there were atrocities, because on the 7th, over the radio, there was an announcement calling on people to stay home, and that included me.
Q.	You speak of refugees coming into your area.  Do you know where they were coming from?
A.	Those refugees came from Rubongo commune.
Q.	Did there come a time when there were numbers of refugees in the secteur who were staying somewhere in the secteur?
A.	Some refugees were Protestant, and they moved to the Gikomero Protestant parish.  They didn't get to that parish.  Others went to the secteur office.
Q.	Were those people subjected to any attacks at all?
A.	An attack was launched against those refugees between 1 and 2 p.m., I think.  Grenades were thrown, and those refugees were shot at.  Where I was, bullets could reach me.
Q.	And can you help us as to a date when that happened?
A.	That incident took place on the 12th of April 1994.
Q.	In your secteur, to your knowledge, had there been any killing before that?
A.	Before that date there hadn't been killings.  People were still living in harmony as before.
Q.	And you told us that the bullets could reach you where you were.  What were you doing when that killing started? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  You think that that question may require a sensitive answer?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.  The answer to that question is likely to reveal my identity.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you write the answer?  Could you write the answer on a sheet of paper?  Could I suggest a place?
MR. HOOPER:
Perhaps we could just leave it there, because we have a wider context for this witness, as we know, which I won't refer to.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	So the bullets reached you.  What happened?  Take us through your own personal history of what happened that day, what you saw and what you heard with your own ears from the time that the bullets reached you.  What happened?
A.	Personally, where I was, bullets could reach the place.  My wife and myself took flight and, since we had left the children at home, we returned home to take the children.  But we didn't find them at home, since they themselves had fled with the others.
Q.	So not finding the children at home, what did you do?
A.	We went to look for the children in the forest and where refugees were, and we found the children who were with the surviving refugees.  We therefore took the children before returning home, and that was in the evening.
Q.	Did you at any time visit the place where the killings had taken place?
A.	In the morning of the following day, ******************************************, first was there, I took my niece to the place of the killings and realised that there were corpses there.
Q.	Did you recognise any of them?
A.	I found a woman's remains there, who was a friend to my baby brother.  She was his fiancé -- she was not yet dead.  She was at a point of dying.  I was so aggrieved that I immediately decided to leave the spot.
Q.	Did you -- did you see if there were any children there?  Did you notice any children amongst the bodies you saw?
A.	I did not see the corpses of children.  There were the corpses of adult persons, in particular the corpses of old men and women, and men in general.
Q.	Subsequently, did you learn from other people their accounts of what had happened at the school?
A.	Subsequently, the criminals arrested some people and brought them to that location in order to kill people.  I therefore met those persons, and I believe that those same persons can testify, if you invite them to do so.
Q.	You earlier mentioned some children.  Were the children you were with that day all yours, or not?
A.	They were my children, and those who weren't mine -- well, I kept them home in my house.
Q.	And those you kept at home who weren't yours, were those Hutu or Tutsis?
A.	They were Tutsi.
Q.	And how many of them were there, if that's not a compromising question for you.  It is a compromising question, right.  Let me ask you this -- don't answer that question.

Did they all survive the genocide, or not?
A.	All those children are still alive and, by the way, I visit them and they return my visits.  And amongst those children, the girls who are married today visit me, and those who have children, well, they show their children to me, and I offer them presents in the Rwandan fashion.
Q.	Now, let's take that day, the 12th.  And I'm not going to ask you details about what you learned had happened -- others might.  But on that day, the 12th, or afterwards, did you -- can you help the Court as to what your knowledge and understanding is of access to that area, to your secteur?  In short, was it possible, as far as you know, to get from Kigali up to Gikomero secteur, from what you know then and from what you've learned since?  What is the position, as best you know?
A.	It was no longer possible, because the RPF had taken control of the roads.
Q.	Do you know of anyone who actually tried to get to Kigali?
A.	On that day, or on that date, or before or after?
Q.	Around that time, and you can tell us approximately when it was, if there was such an incident.
A.	Personally, when I realised that the situation was deteriorating and my brother-in-law came to my house and asked me to flee, I asked him where -- which way we're going to take to flee with the children.  In the course of the night, I tried to flee, and the RPF shot at us.  And thence forward I decided not to move about, and to move around only in our area while waiting for God to make a miracle in order to stop the war.
Q.	And do you know approximately when that incident occurred?
A.	I cannot recall the date, but this was in May, or early May.  I cannot be precise as to the date.
Q.	Can I ask you, what was the position around the day of the killing at the school, around the 12th?  Was it possible to get to and from Kigali, or not?
A.	It was no longer possible.  If this had been possible, people in my area would have fled.  There were soldiers on the roads.
Q.	Do you know someone called André Rwamakuba?
A.	I know André Rwamakuba, but I don't know him very well.
Q.	How do you know him?
A.	One day there was an MDR rally in Kayanga, and he came, and there was a person who was introducing the guests.  I was passing by and I heard that person introduce Dr. Rwamakuba.
Q.	Did you know anything else about him at that time?  Do you know where he came from, for example, or what he did, or anything like that?
A.	I used to hear people say that he was a doctor, but I did not know where he performed his duties.
Q.	Have you ever learnt or heard from others in your area at the time, in the 11 years since, of André Rwamakuba at any time during the genocide coming to your secteur?
A.	Today we attend Gacaca hearings and we can go about in other cellules to get information.  In Gikomero, from conversations that I have with certain persons, with people in general, I have never heard anybody say that Rwamakuba came to our secteur.  It is said that certain people came to our secteur from Rubongo, from Ndera where the communal office is.  These people came on board a vehicle, but nobody has mentioned Rwamakuba's name as being amongst those who came from Rubongo.
Q.	Do you think it's possible that a minister of the government came to start the genocide in your area or incite people to commit the genocide and for you, over these 11 years, not to have heard about it from others where you live?
A.	No minister came to our locality.  The authors of the killings included the communal brigadier and the bourgmestre.  There is a bourgmestre who led an attack.  No bourgmestre came to the locality.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Rather, it is the brigadier who led the attack."  And this is a correction from the Kinyarwanda booth, says the Kinyarwanda interpreter.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you, I understood that.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Do you know a man called ************?  Let me put it in two ways.  Do you know a man called ***************?
A.	I know *****************.  I know him because for a long time he was a friend of mine, and while I was in custody he brought me vittles.  And one day while he was bringing vittles to me, he was arrested in prison and put in prison.
Q.	Do you know someone else called ********* in your area?
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	Can I ask that in fact that last answer be redacted, because it gave details of distance from home, and other perhaps identifying matters? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I order the redaction.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, your last answer is now made secret.  All right?

You mention being detained, and I'm not going to ask you much about that, but how many people were in the prison?
A.	Are you talking about the persons who bore the name ***********?
Q.	No, sorry -- sorry, it's my fault, it was the question.  It's a new subject and new question.  Forget that *********** chap.

I'm just asking you now about prison.  How many people -- how many prisoners were there when you were detained in prison?
A.	I was first detained in the Kigali prison, which had an intake capacity of 2,000 persons.  Later, the number of persons there increased to 12,000, and as of December the Remera prison was opened, and those who had no case files were asked to go to the Remera prison that had just been opened.
Q.	And any idea how many were put in there?
A.	We met -- well, we came from different prisons, those of us who met at the prison, but I didn't look at the list.  On the same day I didn't look at the list of detainees, since they kept bringing in detainees, but at the time I left the prison, there were 7,747 persons or 7,547 persons.
Q.	Now, in Remera prison, is it right to say that there were detainees from Gikomero commune?
MS. FALL:
Objection.
MR. HOOPER:
Is this disputed, the fact that Remera prison --
MS. FALL:
The manner in which the question was put to the witness is what I'm objecting to.
MR. HOOPER:
Perhaps I can rephrase it after the break.  I've only got basically two questions to go -- I say two questions, one final area -- 10 minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take the morning recess now.  

We'll take a short break now, Mr. Witness, and resume in about 15 minutes' time.
THE WITNESS:
Do I have to stay here, Mr. President?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Asks the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The WVS will take care of you during the break.
(Court recessed at 1031H)
(Pages 14 to 18 by Maureen Dunn)


(Court resumed at 1058H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can resume now. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during your period of detention, were the events at Gikomero secteur ever discussed; that is, discussed by fellow -- by you or fellow prisoners? 
A.	In prison, we organised gacaca sessions similar to the ones being held in the secteurs nowadays.  In the course of those gacaca sessions we discussed what had occurred in our secteurs, and some people admitted to having committed offences, confessed to the crimes they had committed.  Others were more reticent, but later, by force of convincing them, by persuasion they were led to admitting to confessing. 
Q.	Was André Rwamakuba's name ever mentioned in prison as someone who had played any part, anywhere, in Gikomero commune in the events of the genocide? 
A.	No detainee mentioned having seen Rwamakuba in Gikomero.  No one stated having seen him act in Gikomero, nor even having seen him passing -- passing through Gikomero.  No detainees said it then, and no one says it in our community now. 
Q.	Do you know anything about events at the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	No, I know nothing.  Kayanga -- Kayanga is quite far from my place. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can I ask you to look at this document which is a list of names, a document we are all familiar with.  All right, so there may be a difficulty in reading.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can we go into closed session?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	As I understand, Mr. Witness, you have a problem with your eyesight and reading.
MR. HOOPER:
So can we just briefly revert to in closed session for five minutes -- well, it may be longer, but no more, I hope, than five minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We resume -- we go back into a closed session for a short period of time.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 20] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Page 19 by Jennifer Spring)






MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, under the rules that govern our procedure, you now have to be questioned by the lawyer representing the Prosecution.  You now have to answer her questions. 

Madam Prosecutor, are you ready?  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.   We are not going to stay in open session very long because I should straight off like to call for a closed session, then try and group all my questions for the closed session at one time, and would therefore require ten to 15 minutes please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We go straight back into closed session. 

Mr. Witness, we will go back into closed session where you can answer freely.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 22 to 26] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Page 21 by Jennifer Spring)






















MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We are now going into open session.  

As I mentioned to you earlier, if there is any question the answer to which you think (inaudible) you can draw my attention to it. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, I'm going to put to you a few questions on the events that occurred before the 6th of April 1994, and the president's plane crash.  You told us that before that event there had been no disturbances in your secteur; everything was calm.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Do you know if the same could be said of other secteurs in Rwanda? 
A.	I can only answer as regards my area.  I don't know what was happening elsewhere. 
Q.	So in those days, you did not have the opportunity to listen to the radio? 
A.	Yes, I listened to the radio. 
Q.	And at no time did they refer on the radio to disturbances in the country? 
A.	I'm sorry, I did hear such news.  For example, I heard it said that there were disturbances in Kigali.  I heard of the death of Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  I heard it over the radio, and I also heard other news of that nature, of that ilk. 
Q.	So contrary to what you just said, you did hear that there were disturbances in the country? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	Witness, we will now go on to the events that occurred after the presidential plane crashed.  If I correctly understood you, you said that it was as of that moment that certain atrocities were committed? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether you were aware of the atrocities -- atrocities committed in your secteur? 
A.	Yes.  I can tell you that local people left their houses and their cows were eaten, and some of the people who ran away were killed on the road.  Those events occurred after the 13th, and it was the day after the 13th, in fact, that the situation deteriorated in our area. 
Q.	According to what you are saying, in your secteur on the 12th, there was no massacre? 
A.	There were massacres in our secteur on the 13th, but what I have just told you -- what I have just stated concerns what happened in my cellule.  In my cellule the massacres were going on the 13th and continued thereafter in my cellule and in other places.  On the 12th, yes, there were massacres, but in places somewhat distant from my cellule. 
Q.	The massacres that took place elsewhere in Gikomero secteur at the parish, at the secteural office, apparently you were not present when they occurred? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	In respect of those massacres you are not, therefore, in a position to tell us today who was responsible for those massacres and who participated in those massacres? 
A.	That is correct, but I know some people who were in prison and who admitted to having participated in those crimes. 
Q.	You have for the time being answered my question.  I will return to that matter.  
MR. HOOPER:
That is the third time, with respect, that the witness has been actually cut when giving an answer, and he hasn't been giving long answers and, in my respectful submission, he should be allowed to conclude an answer to a question that's put to him. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I am undertaking my cross-examination.  I am following a line.  I am really following Mr. Hooper's (unintelligible).  I will return to this matter.  I put a precise question to the witness; he answered.  I think I should be allowed -- I can continue my cross-examination. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So, once again, Witness, we agreed, you answered me that you could not say who were the perpetrators, who were the people who participated in the massacres in Gikomero at the parish, not the secteural office? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, you see, that's the corruption of the answer, with respect; that you didn't -- the Prosecution didn't allow the witness to conclude because he didn't say that. 
MS. FALL:
The answer was, "Yes, you are quite right," and I think I was satisfied with that answer, and I will come back to those events and will be putting other questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The translators spoke of more of the answer than that.  What was reported to be in his answer before you got him to stop was, answer, "That is correct.  But I know some of the people who were in prison and who admitted to having participated in those crimes."  So there is in that sense, you see, there is some good sense in Mr. Hooper's comment because, not having allowed the witness to complete his answer, you completely misunderstood what he was saying.  So maybe it might be better to allow him to complete his answer, so we can actually get what his evidence really is. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, so you're saying you knew people who told you they were responsible for the massacres.  Can you tell us who those persons were, or are? 
A.	Yes, I can give you their names.  I don't -- very well -- the name, but there was the assistant to the Rubongo communal policemen, all the members of the -- all the local inhabitants blame him, and he, himself, admits to having brought the attackers.  But he said he brought the assailants involuntarily, but he doesn't say who told him to bring those assailants.  And then there is a young man called Nyagatare. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness has raised his hand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  You can tell me what -- what's bothering you. 
THE WITNESS:
I think I was about to answer in such a way as people might discover who I am if I go on with my answer, Mr. President.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Well, Witness, after having heard the rest of your answer, it would be precise to say that the massacres that occurred in Gikomero parish and at the secteural office, you know nothing about it except for what was told you by those detainees? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, at the time of your testimony, you said that at the time of the massacres in your cellule you went to the site of the massacre? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You told us that you saw corpses? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you told us that at one moment you saw that there was a person who was in the last throes? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	That you were sad; the person who was in the last throes but not yet dead; am I to deduce that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	At that time you told us that you left the place? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	If I've correctly understood, you did nothing to assist that person or to see if anything could be done to assist them? 
A.	I had no means of doing so. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say that you didn't try to do anything? 
A.	Personally, I had no means at my disposal.  I had no serum to give them.  I had no first aid kit.  When I thought it was the closest friend of my younger brother, I went to tell my brother how I had seen his friend.  When my brother arrived, he found the person already dead.  Otherwise, I had no drip to save that person. 
Q.	So at that moment you didn't even try to transport that person to where he could get appropriate treatment? 
A.	I couldn't pick up that person alone.  However, I did inform a lady who was close by, and when the lady arrived, we found that the man was already dead.  The person was already dead. 
Q.	Witness, you were asked whether on the 12th of April it was possible to go from Kigali to Gikomero secteur.  You answered -- did you not answer at that time that it was impossible to do so because the RPF had obstructed the road? 
A.	Yes, that is what I answered. 
Q.	You therefore are aware, or do you know quite specifically what were the RPF positions? 
A.	The RPF was already in Rutunga secteur, Gasabo secteur, because locals from those secteurs had fled to our place, and the people from Rubongo, from Muwizindiro, had already fled their homes because the RPF had set up at Nsekarije's place on the road leading to our place. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, could we have some assistance with the spellings from that last answer?  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Could the witness spell out the last name he gave? 
A.	Nsekarije?
Q.	You gave a name of someone where the RPF had set up a post.  Can you spell it for us? 
A.	Nsekarije.  The RPF was at Nsekarije's place.  N-S-E-K-A-R-I-J-E.  Zindiro, Z-I-N-D-I-R-O.  Zindiro, Z-N-I -- Z-I-N-D-I-R-O; Nsekarije, N-S-E-K-A-R-I-J-E. 
MS. FALL:  
I thought I heard some other name.  I think I heard another name, but I think that the witness has spelt out the name he gave now. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness had said Muzindiro; M-U means in.  M-U is a prefix meaning "in".  So it was Muzindiro, coming from the Kinyarwanda booth.  Zindiro is the name of the place.  Muzindiro means at or in Zindiro. 
MS. FALL:
May I continue, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Yes, Witness.  You did not answer the specific question I put to you because you did in your testimony, under examination-in-chief, that it was impossible to go from Kigali to Gikomero secteur because the RPF had obstructed all the roads, and you replied "yes", and I should like to know what were the roads that were obstructed, and what the RPF's positions were since you appear to be very much ofay of all that -- very knowledgeable about all that? 
A.	The RPF had obstructed the road coming from Kigali and leading on up to Byumba.  No vehicle could take that road.  As for Gikomero secteur, the RPF was already in Rutunga and Gasabo secteurs. 
Q.	If I have correctly understood you, you are telling us that the road -- you are mentioning just the road -- may I finish?  The road obstructed by the RPF was the road from Kigali to Byumba, if I have understood you correctly? 
A.	The road was blocked even from Remera to Zindiro, which passes through Zindiro and on to Gikomero, that road was also blocked.  The RPF -- the RPF was also at Ndera.  The RPF arrived in Ndera when the Interahamwe had already left there.  
Q.	Coming back to the roads which is what interests me -- 
A.	You must know that there were other roads, secondary roads that might get to Gikomero.  In any case, those were the only roads you could take to get to Gikomero.  Once again, I would say that you must know that there are secondary roads that can get you to Gikomero.  All those small roads you're talking about lead to the main road coming from Kigali; a main road from Kigali was blocked. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber the number of units that blocked the Kigali road? 
A.	I can't tell you what were -- which were the units blocking those roads.  I was not a soldier.  But as to where Nsekarije used to live, I went by there and I witnessed it myself.  I passed there when I was fleeing.  As to the units blocking the roads, I can't tell you how many units were blocking the road. 
Q.	You did tell us that you passed by there as you were fleeing. 
A.	I arrived there, I was fired at and was obliged to turn back. 
Q.	At what time did you therefore wish to flee? 
A.	I told you that it was in May. 
Q.	So if I have correctly understood that question -- that answer -- you saw that it was not possible to leave because the RPF was there; you're referring much more to May than to April.  
A.	I did not go there in April.  I know that I went there at the beginning of May, but we couldn't pass there for the reasons I've just given you. 
Q.	You do agree with me that in your testimony before, when you were being questioned about the 12th of April, the answer you just gave applied rather to the month of May than to the month of April?
A.	No.  I cannot give you an answer as regards the 12th because I could not move around on that day. 
Q.	Witness, you made a statement; you stated in answer to the question put to you by the Defence -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- and I have your statement before me -- sorry, you did make a statement to the Defence on the 21st of June 2003.  
A.	What date did you state, Madam?
Q.	June 2003.  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	In that statement you state that you tried to leave, to flee, but that you could not do so, that it was you, yourself, who tried to flee.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, maybe I didn't get that question correctly. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I sought to flee.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
I had thought that the booth wanted the witness's answer repeated.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Perhaps the question also. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The booth has requested that the question be repeated so they can...
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I was saying, Witness, that when you were questioned earlier today, you told us that you had tried, yourself, to flee, and that is how you saw that it was impossible to pass because the RPF had blocked the road? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That's what I answered. 
Q.	And this document doesn't disclosed (sic) by the Defence -- the statement that was made is quite different because you say that you knew that that road was blocked because your brother, who wanted to take you to Kigali, had been wounded.  And then he came back, and you said that those who were -- there were others who were with him were killed.  Now I would like to know which is the correct version of the facts? 
A.	I do not know if the person who wrote down the statement didn't make a mistake.  I said that I was with my brother-in-law, and when we got to a certain point, we were shot at.  We were compelled to back-track, and when he went back home, he realised that his father had been shot at on the shoulder, and that is why we were unable to proceed with our flight.  I therefore do not know either (sic) those who wrote down the statement didn't make mistakes. 
Q.	Well, I think we can verify to check what is there because it is clearly stated that your brother is the one who wanted to take you along, but who told you it was impossible, and that all those who were with him had been killed.  Mr. Witness, I will now move on to another line of questioning.  We will talk about what you know.  Could you tell us what you know of André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I know André Rwamakuba, but I have seen him only once. 
Q.	I didn't put any question to you yet.  You, rather, jumped the gun.  So you have seen him only once.  Would you be in a position today to recognise him if he were shown to you? 
A.	Yes, I will try.  Since I saw him only once when he was introduced to us, I believe that I won't make a mistake.  I think I would easily identify him. 
Q.	You saw him only once, Mr. Witness.  Can you tell us at what period you met him for that first time? 
A.	I saw him in 1993, between the month of July and August. 
Q.	You tell us that you saw him.  You have said that you saw him during that period at a rally? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you did tell us that that was the first time you were seeing him? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us how long that meeting lasted? 
A.	I arrived at the said rally at 10 a.m.  I was turning in the field.  The guests of honour were introduced, and he was introduced along with others.  The organisers of the rally set at holding the rally, and introductions began at about 10 a.m.  I believe the meeting ended at about 2 p.m. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told us that that rally took place between July and August 1993.  Can you be more precise? 
A.	You see, Madam, it's been over ten years since that happened.  I did not record the precise month.  I know the meeting didn't take place in September, and I know it was not in July either, that it took place.  I therefore think that the meeting was held -- the rally in question took place between July and August. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you made reference to September, whereas I was only asking you the precise date within the period that you indicated; that is, between the month of July and August.  But then you decided to tell me that the rally didn't take place in September.  Mr. Witness --
A.	It was between July and August.  Don't ask me for the date, and don't ask me for precisions as to whether the meeting was held at the beginning, in early, or late August.  I didn't retain all of that.  I didn't keep a record of the date.  That's all I can give you as information. 
Q.	Well, you've already answered my question, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, after that rally, was that the only time at which you saw André Rwamakuba? 
A.	That was the only time, the one and only time I saw André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	You told us that you heard about him? 
A.	Yes.  People did talk about André Rwamakuba, but I had never seen him in person.  I finally saw him when he was being introduced at that rally.  It was said that we have intellectuals that are natives of our area, including a medical doctor that can treat us, and that is how I came to see him in person, that is, physically.  While the introductions were being made, that's all I know of him.  If I gave you any more information, if I were to tell you that I knew more information on him, I would be lying, and that is not the reason wherefore I came here. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told us that you used to listen to the radio.  You therefore had the opportunity of hearing people talk of André Rwamakuba, or hearing about André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I never heard him speak on the microphone or over the radio. 
Q.	You never heard him speaking before the radio microphones, even during the events of April 1994; you never heard him speak over the radio? 
A.	Never.  I had a radio set and I used to monitor the situation prevailing in the country, but I never heard a journalist or anyone say that Rwamakuba was going to take the floor on radio. 
Q.	Would you be surprised to hear that there were quite some documents that show that he did give statements over the radio or make speeches over the radio? 
A.	Well, that would come as a surprise to me, since I never heard André Rwamakuba's speech, not even once. 
Q.	You say that you used to listen to the radio always, or you used to follow the events.  You definitely heard André Rwamakuba when he was being sworn in as a member of the new government? 
A.	So far as the swearing in is concerned, I think that the swearing in ceremony didn't take place in Kigali.  I think it took place in Gitarama.  When the government was in Gitarama, that is when I learned that he was a minister.  I believe that the government was formed or was established when he had already taken flight, or the government was installed when he had already taken flight. 
Q.	I am not going to emphasise on those facts which show that you are well aware of the events that took place.  I am going to go back to the gacaca hearings.  Mr. Witness, besides the gacaca sessions or the special gacaca hearing at which you said André Rwamakuba's name was not mentioned by any of the prisoners that were in prison at the time, you must have, in recent times at the gacaca hearings, participated at the sessions held in your cellule? 
A.	You ask us to tell the truth and we do accept to tell the truth, and we know that the truth -- the truth generally carries the day.  Even if you look at the registry records, you will find in the Gikomero secteur you will never find André Rwamakuba's name in that register. 
Q.	Please, Witness, can you answer my question.  Did you participate or not at gacaca sessions that were held in your cellule? 
A.	Yes, I have taken part in the sessions.  I have participated in the hearings. 
Q.	Now, I am referring specifically to your cellule.  I think you have said that André Rwamakuba's name was not mentioned or has not been mentioned? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	You attend the gacaca hearings held in your cellule.  There are other hearings or sessions that are held in the other cellules in the secteur or even in the secteur office.  Would you be in a position to tell us which information is given in those other cellules and at the level of the secteur? 
A.	I'm going to give you an answer.  There have been gacaca sessions and, personally, I was in the secteur where killings were carried out.  To my knowledge there is information that was gathered, that was circulated, and I have never heard Rwamakuba's name.  It is in Rutakira (phonetic) cellule that killings took place.  We had information that is contained in the register, but I never heard André Rwamakuba's name, and I was expecting his name to be mentioned since that is where the killings had taken place.  But his name was nonetheless not mentioned. 
Q.	You're talking about a specific location in your cellule where killings were taking place, and where Rwamakuba's name was not mentioned.  Would you be in a position to tell us today whether, in Gikomero secteur or in other cellules besides yours, André Rwamakuba's name was mentioned or not? 
A.	I can answer your question in respect of two cellules; my cellule and that which shares the border with mine.  Otherwise, if I were to talk of what obtained (sic) in the other cellules, I would be exaggerating.  However, people -- the people with whom I converse or discuss say that nobody mentions Rwamakuba's name. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you be surprised to hear that some people who have appeared here have stated that at some point in time at gacaca hearings they heard André Rwamakuba's name being mentioned? 
A.	That would come as a surprise to me.  In fact, I would be very surprised. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have told us that during gacaca hearings in prison, some prisoners made confessions? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you personally had to give confessions or to make confessions? 
A.	The truth be told, you confess to your crime that you have committed.  You did not confess to a crime that you haven't committed.  I, myself, cannot claim to have killed, whereas I haven't killed.  All the more so if there is nobody who can accuse me, I can't confess.  What I can say is that I rather gave assistance to certain people who were in danger, and who were the targets of killers. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you or not -- has your name been mentioned in gacaca sessions outside of prisons, that is, besides in prison? 
A.	Nobody has accused me of having killed members of their families, or of having looted their property, or cows.  Nobody has accused me of having shed blood.  Nobody has accused me of having stolen, not even a bunch of bananas.  Nobody has laid any criticism against me. 
Q.	You therefore are not aware, Mr. Witness, whether at certain gacaca sessions, in particular the sessions of the Gikomero secteur office, your name has been cited as being one of those who committed certain acts of genocide? 
A.	I am not aware of that, and nobody has said so. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I merely would like to ask you as a last question the circumstances under which you were approached by the Defence counsel within the framework of this trial? 
A.	I am going to give you an answer.  Personally, people said that Rwamakuba was accused of having killed people in Gikomero, and I bemoaned the fact, and I wondered what he was accused of.  We heard about this over the radio, and I was telling the others, "Have you heard the name of these people being mentioned in Gikomero?" And I said, "If I were to meet his counsel, I would be happy."  Unfortunately, the Defence counsel came to Gikomero and they were taking photographs of the locations at which the killings were perpetrated.  They questioned me and I answered their questions, and I told them that if it were possible, I would be ready to go and testify for Rwamakuba's Defence.  So that is how I was approached by the -- by Mr. Rwamakuba's Defence counsel. 
Q.	You did not know André Rwamakuba well.  You met him just once.  You had never heard him speak over the radio.  You were not present at the locations where he is -- it is alleged that he committed such crimes, but you are ready to come here and appear before this Chamber to give this testimony in favour of André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, that is the case.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, one small clarification, an additional clarification.  Could you tell us again how the Defence team met you? 
A.	I'm going to explain this to you.  The counsel for Rwamakuba came to Gikomero.  They went to the sites of the killings and they were taking photographs.  There was no other person around, so they put questions to me which questions I answered, and I asked them if they were indeed Rwamakuba's counsel, they answered in the affirmative.  So I seized the opportunity and told them that that person is innocent, and if it's possible, I am going to testify for the Defence.  They asked me where I lived, and I told them, and those are the circumstances under which I gave them a statement.

1230H 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, from what you have told us, and the little that you knew of André Rwamakuba, did you have any interests whatsoever in coming to give this testimony before the Chamber? 
A.	As far as Rwamakuba is concerned, I had an interest in testifying for his defence, besides he is a doctor.  And as far as possible, I am willing to come to the assistance of anybody who is a victim of injustice.  I can testify in defence of a person who is suffering an injustice.  Probably my testimony may not be of help to him, but I think I have the duty to give testimony, and I can do that. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, however, do you agree or do you accept that you were not present at the location where it is alleged that André Rwamakuba committed certain things?  The only thing that you have said to the Chamber -- they have not heard anybody say that André Rwamakuba has been mentioned as -- a name as being mentioned that -- and no minister came to the area at the time of the events? 
A.	I did not dwell on that fact.  In the morning, when I was taking the child to my elder brother's house I saw corpses.  And I asked my elder brother who had attacked people, since my elder brother was moving about.  After Rwamakuba was accused, I asked my elder brother if he saw Rwamakuba at that location.  And my elder brother told me that he never saw any official at the location when the events were taking place, let alone Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Well, your answer has been noted.  One last question, Mr. Witness, you told us that you saw no minister or that no minister precisely came to the area at the time of the events? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	If you did not see any minister come there, did you hear of a Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda who came to that area? 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I clarify he was not a minister at that time, not until the end of April.  Perhaps that could be made clear to the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm going to answer you.  What the Defence counsel has just said is correct.  Rwamakuba and Kamuhanda were appointed ministers at the same time.  And Kamuhanda is a native of Gikomero.  Now, you are mentioning a person who is not involved in this case.  But I must tell you that Kamuhanda is innocent and he is being unfairly accused.  I have talked to you about people who are beautiful people, but whose hearts are bad and accuse people unjustly.  I must tell you that I know Kamuhanda very well.  He never came to the area.  I do not know why some people take it upon themselves to accuse others unfairly.  Kamuhanda never came to Gikomero. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Well, I will repeat my question; and this will be the last, and you can answer very concisely.  Have you heard or not it said that Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda came to Gikomero?  That is a question that can be answered briefly.
A.	He never came to Gikomero. 
MS. FALL: 
Yes, I think I am done with the witness, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I have no questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. HOOPER: 
The only matter, Dr. Rwamakuba would like to meet this witness, if the witness is willing to visit him.  Can he have permission to do so?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the permission will be granted.

Mr. Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you very much for coming to give evidence at the Tribunal.  Now you are excused and you are free to go.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the luncheon adjournment now. 
(Court recessed from 1237H to 1410H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are we ready to start?  What is the problem?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I don't know what it is; I think it is some driving difficulties, bringing a witness back from the safe house which is a bit of a distance away. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
They have normally done it on time. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I don't know. 
MR. MORLEY:
While we are waiting, it occurs to me that it may be a useful opportunity to enquire of Your Honour, I have been liaising with your courtroom assistant, Ms. Denis, with regard to the January potential scheduling.  Does Your Honour have any information at this stage about the likelihood of a January listing?  Obviously, there are consequences which affect another case and also this case and the sooner we know, the better. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we would like to do is to schedule -- have a scheduling meeting, off of the record, just before we start the afternoon session tomorrow, so we can do that between 2 and 2:30 tomorrow afternoon. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can you give me a few moments to speak to the witness, before she comes in?
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are about to beginning hearing your evidence in this trial.  The first thing that will happen is that the registrar will give you an oath to tell the truth.  So the registrar will now administer the oath to you. 

(Declaration made by Witness 7/18 in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Madam Witness, you will give your evidence in this trial by answering the questions which are put to you by the lawyers that are designated for that purpose.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the first person who will be examining you will be Mr. Hooper who is the lawyer for the Accused person, Dr. Rwamakuba in this trial.

Mr. Hooper are you ready?
WITNESS 7/18,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	Can you see -- I'm on your left side here; I'm to your left, to your left.  Can you see where I am?  

I have some personal details I have here which I am going to go through together with some other personal information.  For those reasons, I would like to go into closed or secret session please? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long do you envisage that for?  
MR. HOOPER: 
For about 15 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We go into closed session now.  

Do you know what that means, that means that the testimony that you give will be kept confidential to the persons -- only to the persons who are required to know about it.  It will not be available to the public, so you can speak freely.
THE WITNESS:
I have understood.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 41 to 44] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 37 to 40 by Donna M. Lewis)





















MR. HOOPER: 
I think I can start in open session, merely by saying that you have signed details, personal details.  And that that should be exhibited under seal as D. 179. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 179 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In terms of the history of events that you are going to tell us, Madam Witness, they are close, indeed, as I think we would probably all anticipate and understand through the history of your husband.  You essentially shared much of the events; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know, or have you heard of a man called André Rwamakuba, or Dr.  André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Are you talking about our place?  
Q.	Well, let me put it just simply; have you heard of someone called Dr. André Rwamakuba.  And if you have, in what context do you know him? 
A.	Are you referring to the people in my area?  Are you referring to the members of the public in my area?  Well, I heard nothing about him.  I had not heard anyone talk about him. 
Q.	Do you know -- do you know the family, if I can call them that, the Rwamakuba family, his parents? 
A.	Yes, I know his family. 
Q.	And in respect of André Rwamakuba himself, have you ever met him? 
A.	No, I never met him because I never lived in Gasabo and he never came to where I was.  During the war I stayed in Gasabo commune and Rwamakuba never came to Gasabo commune. 
Q.	When you say, "Gasabo commune" that was then called -- or it was then called Gikomero commune; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	Now, before the war, had you ever seen André Rwamakuba or met him? 
A.	Before the war, I saw him in 1992 when he came to our area. 
Q.	Do you -- do you know, or did you know André Rwamakuba sufficiently well to describe the kind of man that he was?  I don't mean his physical appearance, but what sort -- what manner of man he was, as you noticed? 
A.	I know Rwamakuba.  He didn't have much hair and he was neither too dark nor too fair skinned.  He was not very talkative.  He did not visit his family often so that we didn't see him very often.  This was someone who was fairly quiet. 
Q.	Are you aware, or not, that he was appointed a minister in the interim government following the start of the war? 
A.	Yes, I learned of it.  I heard people say it. 
Q.	It has been alleged against André Rwamakuba that he came to the area where you lived and he was responsible for holding meetings, political meetings that were strongly anti-Tutsi in character.  Have you ever --  
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers that. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Excuse me, Madam Witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
And perhaps if the witness may take off her headphones?  

I respectfully submit that that question within the framework of an examination-in-chief is premature.  My learned friend has to lay some foundation for the witness's knowledge of whether or not there were meetings in the commune of the MDR.  The question he is asking at the moment is based on -- I`ll start that again.  

The question he is asking at the moment is going to elicit an opinion from the witness about what may or may not have taken place with regard to meetings in the commune.  My learned friend is leading the witness on a fact which is a part of the Prosecution case allegedly.  And the appropriate way, I respectfully submit, for my learned friend to go about this is to establish what the witness knows of any meetings in the commune of the MDR.  And then, after that foundation is established, ask the question.  But to ask the question now is to lead the witness, effectively, to giving a version of events about meetings in the commune and in leading the witness in this way, it is inappropriate.  The question requires foundation. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I'm not prosecuting this case, and I'm not making an allegation.  I'm putting an allegation to this witness and inviting her comment. 
MR. MORLEY:
Precisely.  And to put the allegation and invite comment requires foundation beforehand. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I don't think it does at all, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah --  
MR. HOOPER: 
I strongly disagree, that is what I can say. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I thought that you could have addressed that issue, because you see, up to now, the witness has not indicated -- the witness has not indicated whether she is in a position to answer your question.  A few questions could elicit some information as to what her level of knowledge is on -- about those issues. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm merely going to ask the witness whether she has ever heard of such a thing and if my friend then wants to explore, he can.  But the question is a direct question, and --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Fair enough. 
MR. HOOPER: 
And will carry the weight that it carries, I suppose. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, at the end of the day it really becomes a question for weight for us.  If he doesn't lay a foundation, then he accepts whatever weight we ascribe to it. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sorry, Madam Witness, if you can -- all right.  Sorry, Madam Witness, we had a little legal argument which need not concern you.  

It has been alleged in this case against Rwamakuba that he came to your area and there held political meetings which were vehemently anti-Tutsi, that is in the area where you live and where you were living.  And I ask a general question of you, were you aware then of any meetings; have you heard of any such allegation against Rwamakuba in the last 11 years? 
A.	I cannot state that Rwamakuba ever hated Tutsi.  I am a Tutsi, I can say this.  I also know that his sister had married a Tutsi.  I do not see how he could have been against Tutsis.

As to rallies, I didn't participate in any of those.  Regarding what I might have learned in the course of these past 11 years I can say that I never heard anyone say any such thing about André Rwamakuba 
Q.	Before the 6th of April when Habyarimana was killed, how would you describe the relations between Hutus and Tutsis in your area? 
A.	I could see that the Hutus and the Tutsis lived peacefully together; they exchanged daughters in marriage.  During baptism ceremonies, they would have Godmothers and Godfathers from the other ethnic group.  In short, they lived in good terms and they shared everything.  That is what I can say. 
Q.	After the 6th of April, did -- how did things develop in your area? 
A.	After the 6th of April I can say that the killings began around the 8th and 9th and 10th of April.  That is when some people working together with the refugees who lived in the Nyacyonga camp began to commit such acts.  That is the way the situation began to deteriorate. 
Q.	Okay, and I anticipate that there is no objection to my leading.  Is it right that on the 9th of April your home was attacked by Interahamwe? 
A.	The Interahamwe attacked our home on the 10th; before the 10th they were in other areas, for example in Ngiryi. 
Q.	And on the 10th -- 
A.	That is spelled N-G-I-R-Y-I, Ngiryi. 
Q.	And on the 10th when your home was attacked, and I won't dwell on this, but was anybody -- was anybody hurt in any way? 
A.	One of our boys, a close relative was killed.  There were also Tutsi neighbours who had sought refuge with us, they were wounded, and others were able to escape.  It is this boy who was in our home and who was a close relative, so much so that we thought of him as our son, who was killed.  He was actually -- we thought of him as our son, but he was actually a close relative; it was he who was killed. 
Q.	And what about your position, Madam, were you in any way threatened or at risk that day? 
A.	They pulled me from the house.  They dragged me out to the fence, because you see there were two attacks; the attack from the backyard and another attack through the main entrance.  My husband tried to give them money.  They took the money.  They looted everything.  They took our property and we were able to escape.  We actually fled without our children; we found them afterwards. 
Q.	And when you fled, where did you go to? 
A.	My husband and I went to Gishaka.  When we got there on the 10th, a friend hid us in his home -- or her home. 
Q.	I don't think it is necessary to mention who that person is, unless the Prosecution feels it is necessary, as we have had details from somebody else about this.  All right.

And so you and your husband, is it, had gone to Gishaka without the children; is that the position?  
A.	Yes, the children joined us where we were on the morning of the 11th; but the children got to us separately one by one. 
Q.	Were there any developments on the 11th of April that you can remember? 
A.	We met -- or found our children on the 11th.  And I remember that the other people, the other inhabitants met us in Gasaka when they were fleeing the RPF, since the RPF had fired shots at that camp that was in the area. 
Q.	So, where was that camp that the RPF had fired shots at? 
A.	The RPF had fired at the Nyacyonga camp. 
Q.	How long did you remain at Gishaka? 
A.	We left Gishaka on the 14th because the person who had hidden us had fled.  That is how I was forced to leave this person's home in order to go to the Gishaka centre. 
Q.	Now, the person's home that you had to leave and where you were hiding, how were you hidden in that -- at that place? 
A.	I was hidden in a wardrobe in that house, a closed cupboard. 
Q.	And were you together with the rest of your family or not in the house? 
A.	The next morning the children and the father were hidden elsewhere because the person who was hiding me said that as it was -- because it was near the road he couldn't hide all of us.  And people began to suspect our presence in the house and that is how I hid there alone and my children and their father hid elsewhere. 
Q.	So you told us that the person who was hiding you himself fled and that as a result you fled to the centre.  Now when you fled to the centre were you there with your husband and children or not, at the centre? 
A.	No, I was alone but before going to the centre I had to go where my husband and children were hiding to inform them that I was going to the centre since most of the refugees were at the centre. 
Q.	Now, when you say "the centre", is that the communal centre, i.e., where the commune office is for the whole commune in Gishaka, or is it somewhere else? 
A.	The church, the church centre. 
Q.	And is the church centre -- well how far is that away from the communal offices there? 
A.	It is the Catholic centre, not very far from the Roman Catholic church -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This word "centre" is not coming through clearly, I'm sorry, Counsel.  The Kinyarwanda booth is using the word "salter" (phonetic), but is not exactly a centre but we cannot pin it down.  Perhaps you may want to clarify that, I'm sorry. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, there is just a little difficulty of whether you are talking of the church or some kind of centre, perhaps a community centre or something like that.  What do you mean by the centre?  Can you just tell us again, please? 
A.	It is a big church, if you like. 
Q.	And do you know the name of the parish priest of that church, as was then? 
A.	It was Gishaka parish. 
Q.	And the name of the parish priest? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The answer was "yes" apparently. 
THE WITNESS:
His name was Michel Donnet. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	That is D-O double N-E-T (sic)? 

So you go to the church itself, and approximately what time on that day, the 14th, did you get there? 
A.	I reached the parish between 4 and 5 p.m.; around 4 or 5 p.m. 
Q.	And what happened there that day, for the remainder of the day, can you tell us please? 
A.	The night we went inside the church, but before night fell the Interahamwe arrived, showed us their machetes and made threatening gestures through the church windows.  We closed the church but the Interahamwe told us that they would return at the right time and seek us out.  As I was afraid, I left that place, I left the saltar (phonetic).  And Michel Donnet gave me a room -- showed me a room -- showed me a room where my aunt was. 
Q.	Was that an aunt or an uncle, please? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness corrected herself, says the Kinyarwanda booth.  "It was my aunt's husband. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you can provide that gentleman's name if you are asked to, I don't ask for that gentleman's name.  So the two of you are provided a room by Father Donnet, and what happens then? 
MR. MORLEY:
I`m sorry, before the witness answers, maybe I am being dim, which is perfectly possible here; but has the witness actually -- perhaps if she might take her headphones off, please.

My learned friend, a moment ago, it is a small point, Your Honour, but a moment ago he said, "The two of you arrived".  I may have misunderstood what he means by, "the two of you".  Is he referring to the priest or is my learned friend leading the witness on who she was with as to members of her family?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I will go back over, it if it helps you. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, you have spoken -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Has she got her earphones back on?  Sorry, Counsel Hooper. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, you were telling us how, as a result of the threats by the Interahamwe and their threat to return later that you left that place and that you were then with -- or you were then offered a room by Father Donat.  And that your aunt's husband was also there with you; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, he was with me, with his son and two of his elder brother's sons. 
Q.	And how did things develop from then? 
A.	We stayed in that house, but during the night the Interahamwe came; they wanted to break in through the windows.  The people ran in all -- ran away in all directions.  And we were afraid because there was thunderous knocking on the door.  I was afraid, so I immediately opened the door and ran away.  We all scattered in all directions.  We ran into the bush, or into the sorghum fields to hide there through the night.  It was raining moreover, and extremely dark. 
Q.	And what happened to your uncle? 
A.	He stayed in that house, but he was subsequently killed and the children also, the children with us also were killed. 
Q.	You are now outside in the dark and rain, you tell us, and in the bush.  And how long did you remain there? 
A.	I spent the night in the bush behind the house of someone I knew.  So we spent the night in the bush.  And in the night of the 15th, the men flushed us out and the people flushed out were killed; but I was able to go to a family very near where I was.  The wife, the mother of that family, who is Tutsi, called me and covered me with a tarpaulin. 
Q.	Do you know how long you remained there, at that house? 
A.	I spent the day with that family.  And at about 12 or 1 p.m. the man of the family came.  The lady showed him where I was hiding.  He went then to get my husband and brought him to where I was hiding.  And he asked me to allow him to stay until night fall, but he refused.  And they decided to take me to another house that man owned; but on the road people stole my watch, tore off my watch and other things I had and wanted to kill me, but a communal policeman prevented them from killing me.  So I stayed at the place where I was hiding.  And subsequently the RPF attacked that place and everybody ran away, including me. 
Q.	By the time you ran away, so one is clear, were you alone or were any members of your family still with you by then or not? 
A.	When I left my hiding place I was with my family.  We left together. 
Q.	And where did you go to, which place did you go to from there? 
A.	We could hear people fleeing, saying that the RPF was near.  I fled with them.  And throughout the night we fled until we arrived in Mucuyu in the course of the night.  There were many of us.  We stayed in Mucuyu, but then the people then took me to Rutongo to kill me. 
Q.	And who took you there? 
A.	At this time it was the communal policeman who took me and the children.  At that very night he took us in a vehicle. 
Q.	But what happened to your husband? 
A.	My husband called us and told us to hide, but we were found, the communal policeman found us and put us in the vehicle.  When my husband wanted to get in the vehicle the brigadier pushed him and he fell down; that is how we left without him. 
Q.	Did Brigadier Nyarwaya speak to you at all? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm conscious of the witness's distress and I'm also conscious of we are getting to an interesting area now leading the witness.    My learned friend has led on the name. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I don't think I did, if I did it was certainly not intended.  I thought the witness had said -- had stated this party's name.  I'm being told not; is that right?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
My notes suggest that you did lead. 
MR. HOOPER: 
If I did lead, it was no surprise to anybody, I should think in this court who is following the evidence for the last four or five days.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm not sure how the witness referred to the party, by name or rank. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
By rank. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The brigadier, it is correctly suggested putting a name in your head here, or at least in your mouth; you mentioned the name of brigadier, can you spell his name for us please, if that is possible? 
A.	How will I spell his name?  It was a brigadier.  He was in charge of the communal policemen. 
Q.	All right.  And can you give me -- can you just state his name, please, if that is all right? 
A.	His name was Nyarwaya.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nyarwaya is spelt N-Y-A-R-W-A-Y-A, N-Y-A-R-W-A-Y-A, Nyarwaya. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So your husband has been pushed out to the floor, and you are being driven off by this man with your children; and we know the number of children you had.  Were there any other children with you at that time, other than your very own children, if I can put it like that? 
A.	There was another girl child with me.  She came from Gishaka, and she was from Gishaka and had lost her mother. 
Q.	And you told us that you were taken in that vehicle to Rutunga.  And we know because we have a general idea now of where places are, where Rutunga is, was Nyarwaya alone in the vehicle, or was there anyone else with him? 
A.	Nyarwaya had Interahamwe with him, and one soldier. 
Q.	And what happened when you got to Rutunga? 
A.	Throughout the night we drove.  And in the morning we arrived in Rutunga marketplace.  Then Nyarwaya asked us to get down.  And there were some Interahamwe to the side, he called them to come and kill us. 
Q.	And what happened then? 
A.	He called the Interahamwe; they came running over.  So we fled and entered a house.  And the owner of the house locked his house.  The Interahamwe forced the door open and that man who had hidden us asked them to leave us alone.  And the Interahamwe -- and the Interahamwe told him that Nyarwaya asked them to kill us.  And just then a shell exploded, and the people fled.  So we left that place for Kayanga. 
Q.	So you get to Kayanga, and which date would this be, please, as best you can recall? 
A.	We arrived in Kayanga on the 15th of April. 
Q.	Do you know approximately the kind of time of day that was? 
A.	Were I to make an estimate -- to estimate the time, it was about 11 a.m.  All I can tell you is that it was in the forenoon, in the morning. 
Q.	And where did you get to in Kayanga? 
A.	In the courtyard in front of the health centre there were many people who sought refuge there.  And the Interahamwe had begun to kill people.  And we asked whether the Interahamwe -- one of the Interahamwe was told to keep watch over us.  And our turn to be thrown into a mass grave -- the moment of our turn to be thrown into a mass grave was fast approaching. 
Q.	Now, at the health centre, were you -- did you -- were you -- when you got there, did you stay outdoors or did you go indoors or what? 
A.	We stayed out and the killers were bringing people to kill them.  And when it was just before it was our turn, we saw the bourgmestre's vehicle; we ran towards it.  He took us on -- in and took us somewhere, where someone refused to hide us, and told the bourgmestre to take us with him.

1530H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Just -- just going back over that -- could you just tell us that again, just break it up a bit.  You see the bourgmestre's vehicle and you run to it, and do you get in the vehicle or not? 
A.	The policeman who was in that vehicle, which was, by the way, an ambulance, opened the doors, and we climbed in.  That policeman's name was -- is Assiel.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A-S-S-I-A-L (sic).  
MR. HOOPER:
A-S-S-I-L-E? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
A-S-S-I-E-L. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	He locks the doors, and who's in the ambulance with you now?  What -- any members of your family in the ambulance? 
A.	I was with my family, also the girl I mentioned to you and someone else the Interahamwe had threatened to kill.  And there was also the bourgmestre, but my husband was absent.  
Q.	And did you go anywhere in the ambulance, and, if so, where was it? 
A.	The bourgmestre took us away from the marketplace and took us to a former accountant, who refused to hide us.  And the bourgmestre had to double back to the health centre.  It -- we were still the 15th, and the bourgmestre asked the director of the health centre to hide us.  And he said he was going to look for my husband, for us to suffer the same fate, and the director of the health centre hid us in the maternity ward.
MR. HOOPER:
That may be a convenient moment, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Very well, Witness, we are going to take the short recess.  We recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1533H to 1605H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may commence. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, if I can just recap where we were when we broke off, that you'd gone together with the children and another girl and someone else in the ambulance with the bourgmestre.  He took you to where a former accountant of the commune was.  Can -- do you know that former accountant's name?  Is it something you're -- you can give us? 
A.	His name was Mathias Rubanguka. 
Q.	And you explained how he refused to --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Rubanguka" is spelled as follows:  R-U-B-A-N-G-U-K-A.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you explained how that man, Rubanguka, refused to hide you, and the bourgmestre then doubled back and took you back to the health centre in Kayanga, where he asked the director of the health centre to hide -- to hide you, and that he was then going to go and get your husband so that you'd share the same fate.  Who was the director of the health centre?  Do you know his name? 
A.	He was called Kamenzi.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Kamenzi" is spelled K-A-M-E-N-Z-I, Kamenzi.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And, again, can you just help us as to the date that this happens? 
A.	It was on the 15th.  
Q.	And I think you -- well, you did tell us before the adjournment that you were placed in maternity, the maternity ward of the health centre.  When did you next see your husband? 
A.	I saw him again on that very 15th because he had -- they had gone to fetch him from Gikomero.  And he came to the health centre, and we stayed together. 
Q.	Now, the next day, the 16th, a Saturday, did anything -- was there -- was any hurt or harm done to anybody on that day? 
A.	There were patients who were in the hospital who were beaten up by former FAR soldiers, and they were finished off by Nyarwaya and the others -- and others who were accompanying him and who were on board the vehicle of the priest.  
Q.	Did you know any of those people who were finished off on the 16th? 
A.	I knew them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness, it appears, would like to ask a question.  
THE WITNESS:
I would like to give the names of these people but in a closed session, if possible.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, well, I'm sure we can do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could she write them?  Would that be effective? 

MR. HOOPER:
If we went into closed session for just a few minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the public gallery seems empty, so it's not a problem.  

Nobody's there?  There's somebody there?  

Okay.  We'll go into closed session for just a few minutes. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 57 to 69] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
