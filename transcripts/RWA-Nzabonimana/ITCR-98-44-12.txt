 It is up to the

Maybe it would be better, more appropriate,
if you have no problems with that, maybe he
enters a plea and then you would be at
liberty to make your preliminary statements
or observations that you intend to make.
Thank you.
I would like the Accused to move to that
area in front of me.
 Could the Registrar
please assist in moving the Accused to the

THE ACCUSED:
Mr. Kajelijeli, could you give us your

of your father, your mother, date of birth,
place of birth.

I would prefer to speak in Kinyarwanda
because in the course of my own career I use
Kinyarwanda.
But to facilitate the work of the Tribunal
we are going to ask that the indictment be
read out in a language --
It's Kinyarwanda.
English or French?
 Between English and
French.
I can't say I am fluent in French because
there are some technical words which I
cannot manipulate.

 Moreover,
he had policing duties in regard to

The Movement's objectives were, among
others, to support and control the actions
of the various state powers.
 Only the
Chairman of the MRND could stand for the
presidency of the Republic.
 All Rwandans
were members of the MRND from birth.

 The organs of the MRND (Mouvement
R volutionnaire National pour le
D veloppement) were centralised at the top
and spread out at the bottom.
 The national
organs included the chairmanship, the
general secretariat, the national Congress
and the central committee.
 The central
committee was made up of the Chairman, other
members appointed by the Chairman, the
national secretary-general and the speaker
of parliament (the Conseil National de

 These two figures
were civil servants directly appointed by
the President of the Republic, who was also
the Chairman of the MRND.

 The MRND controlled the policy of the
government and the government gave effect to
that policy at the national, pr fecture and
commune levels through the structure set out
in paragraph 3.3 and 3.4 above.
4.4
 With the institution of the multiparty
system and the adoption of a new
constitution on the 10th of June, 1991, the
Mouvement R volutionnaire National pour le
D veloppement (MRND) was renamed the
Mouvement R publicain National pour la
D mocratie et le D veloppement (MRND).
Although its statutes were amended, the
structure of the new party remained the
same.

 The Accused had close ties with MRND's
national secretary-general, Joseph
Nzirorera, former minister in the MRND
governments of 1987, 1989, 1990 and 1991,
and a fellow native of Mukingo commune.
 And
he benefited in authority and status from
this association.
JUDGE GÜNEY:
MS. LEROY:
4.6.1
 At times other than those referred to
in paragraph 3.5 above, the Accused
exercised the de facto authority of
bourgmestre in Mukingo commune as a result
of his association with, and patronage of,
Joseph Nzirorera.

within the then-Rwandan government and
military structure, initiated the
characterisation of the Tutsis as the enemy
to be eliminated from Rwanda.
4.8
 This characterisation defined the main
enemy as the Tutsis from inside or outside
the country, who allegedly wanted power, who
allegedly did not recognise the achievements
of the revolution of 1959 and who allegedly
were seeking armed confrontation.
 The
secondary enemy was defined as the moderate
Hutus who provided any kind of assistance
to, or sympathised with the main enemy or
opposed the government or the MRND's
policies.
4.9
 Furthermore, from late 1990 through
about July 1994, military personnel, members
of the government, political leaders, civil
servants and other influential
personalities, including the Accused and
Joseph Nzirorera, conspired among themselves
and with others to work out a plan to
exterminate the civilian Tutsi population

and eliminate members of the opposition, so
that the MRND could remain in power.
4.10
 In 1991, the MRND created its own
youth wing.
 The members of the MRND's youth
wing were known as the "Interahamwe".
 The
youth wing was formed in response to two
requirements within the MRND:
(a) sensitising the youth to politics; and,
(b) mobilising the youths.
4.11
 The Interahamwe-MRND was highly
structured, along the same lines as the MRND
party.
 At the national level, it had a
chairman, two vice-chairmen, a
secretary-general and a treasurer.
 The
chairman was to liaise with the central
committee of the MRND, among other things.
4.12
 Beginning in 1992, numerous MRND youth
wings' members received military training
and weapons, and were thus transformed from
youth movements into militias.

the strategies for the plan.

 During such meetings, speeches were
made by influential persons, including the
Accused and Joseph Nzirorera, inciting their
audience who were predominantly members of
the MRND and Hutus, to assault, rape and
exterminate the Tutsis who were excluded
from such meetings on account of their
ethnicity.

 On 6 April 1994, the plane carrying
the President Juv nal Habyarimana of Rwanda
crashed on its approach to Kigali, Rwanda.
This situation created a perfect opportunity
for the execution of the plan, and the
massacre of the Tutsis began soon thereafter
throughout Rwanda.

President Habyarimana, a new government was
constituted by the MRND and several meetings
were held amongst themselves with the
pr fets and other persons in authority
between 8 and 13 April 1994, for the purpose
of assessing and analysing the situation in
the country at the time, particularly the
massacres in each pr fecture.
 Similarly,
meetings were held in the pr fectures and
communes, including Ruhengeri and Mukingo.

 The policies of the MRND formulated at
the said meetings were implemented at the
national, pr fecture, commune and cellule
level through the structures set out in
paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 above.

 The massacres of members of the Tutsi
population and the murder of the moderate
Hutus extended throughout the territory of

plan of extermination and followed the
directives in order to execute it.

 Events in
Ruhengeri pr fecture.
5.1
 The Ruhengeri pr fecture is located in
the northwest of Rwanda, a region that was
historically a power base for the MRND.
Between 1973 and 1992 Ruhengeri was the site
of periodic massacres of the civilian Tutsi
population.
5.2
 The Accused's relationship with such an
influential figure as Joseph Nzirorera
enabled him to flout the local authorities,

population and avoid any criminal sanctions.
5.3
 From April through July 1994, many
Tutsi men, woman and children were attacked,
abducted, raped and massacred in their
residences or at their places of shelter
within the Mukingo commune or arrested,
detained and later murdered.
 The Accused
commanded, organised, supervised and
participated in these attacks.
5.4
 These attackers, comprising the
members of the Police Communale, Gendarmerie
Nationale and Interahamwe militia who were
under the control of the Accused, used guns,
grenades, machetes, spears, pangas, cudgels
and other weapons to slaughter the Tutsi.
5.5
 The Accused ordered and witnessed the
raping and other sexual assaults on the
Tutsi females.
 At all times material to
this indictment, the Accused, as a person in
authority over the attackers, failed to take
any measure to stop these nefarious acts on

 During the course of the events
referred to in this indictment, the Accused
had the authority to issue circulation
passes (laissez-passer) to persons in the
commune who were eventually evacuated from
the commune.
 But he refused to exercise
this authority to prevent or stop the
killings of Tutsis in his commune.
 Rather
he employed various means, including
roadblocks, to deny them free movement
within and outside the commune.
5.7
 The Accused intended to destroy the
Tutsi as a racial or ethnic group, they
having been identified as the enemy by the
MRND as defined in paragraphs 4.7, 4.8 and
4.9 above, in furtherance of the government
policy to defeat the RPF, eliminate the
Tutsi and retain power.

 By his actions
during the period referred to in this
indictment, the Accused sought to eliminate

exist in Ruhengeri pr fecture, with
particular reference to Mukingo commune, by
eliminating the Tutsis.

 The Accused, in his position of
authority and acting in concert with others,

He committed some of the crimes personally,
and some were committed through persons he
assisted or by his subordinates including
the members of the Police Communale

GÜNEY:
Done in Arusha on this day, the 25th day of
January, the year 2001.
 Signed Carla
Del Ponte, the Prosecutor.
 With the seal of
the Prosecutor and that of the Tribunal.
 I
thank you, Your Honour.
Thank you, Registry, for reading out the
amended indictment pursuant to a decision of
the Tribunal, dated 25th January 2001.
Before reading out the charges, and prior to
asking the Accused to enter a plea on each
of the charges, I would like to state that
the Accused had already entered a plea of
not guilty on each of the charges during the
initial appearance that took place on the
7th and 8th of April, 1999, by decision
dated 25 January 2001.
Trial Chamber II had allowed the Prosecutor
to amend the indictment.
 The amended
indictment was filed by the Prosecutor on
the 25th of January, 2001 and was

immediately served upon the Accused and his
counsel.
I would like to be reassured by counsel that
the Accused has already had time to acquaint
himself with the amended indictment and
would be prepared to enter a plea.
 In the
meantime, I wish further to point out that,
although the amended indictment does not
include new charges, some of the charges
have been further strengthened and new
charges added on.
 In the opinion of the
Chamber, these new charges further
strengthen and amend the previous 11
charges.
 Accordingly, the Chamber is of the
view that in the instant the Accused enter a
new plea with respect to all 11 charges
after the reading of the amended indictment
has taken place.
HINDS:
I'll, therefore, ask counsel for the Accused
if he has agreed that we proceed in this
manner.
Your Honour, counsel respectfully disagrees

with the Court's interpretation with respect
to this amended indictment.
 And I have read
the decision of this Trial Chamber, which
was served upon me yesterday.
 It is my
understanding that this Trial Chamber
concluded that the facts and allegations
that were contained in the amended
indictment are sufficiently provide what
amounts to new charges.
 And in particular,
I make reference to paragraph 30 of the
decision.
So, therefore, it is clear to me that this
amended indictment includes new charges.
And furthermore, when we look at the areas
in which the amended indictment recites to
the specific counts, we can see that they
are so commingled that it is impossible to
extricate what would be considered to be the
original counts from what were the new
factual allegations; and therefore, there is
no way that Mr. Kajelijeli could plead
except to each of the 11 counts.
And so, therefore, I think that we have to

of the indictment.
 And the only point I am
making, Your Honour, and I don't know if it
was the translation or whether it is what
you said, but what I got through the
translation suggested to me that you felt
that the decision was such that there were
not new charges.
 The decision clearly
indicates that there are new charges.
It would appear there was an interpretation
problem.
 Of course there are new charges
which do affect the indictment.
 And it is
for that reason that we are asking the
Accused to enter a new plea for each of the
charges, each of the 11 charges.
 Is that
clear now?
That's clear to me, Your Honour.
That stated, I wish to be assured before
reading out the charges, I want to be
assured by counsel for the Accused, counsel
for the Accused, assured that the Accused
has had time to acquaint himself with the

amended indictment and would be ready to
enter a plea with respect to that new
amended indictment.
Yes, Your Honour.
 Mr. Kajelijeli has had
opportunity to review each of the 11 counts
and is familiar with them.
 But I'd like to
point out, and, again, it may have been a
problem in translation, but there is some
confusion, at least on my part, with respect
to whether or not there is conformity
between the French and the English versions
in two areas in particular.
I first make reference to Count 5, pursuant
to Article 6(3).
 And the translator read
"paragraphs 4.21, 4.22, and 4.23".
 Now, in
the English version, there's only 4.19 and
then we go to 4.23.
 So I'm not quite sure
whether or not 4.21 and 4.22 is also
included under Articles 6(3).
 I'd like
 a
clarification on that.
And it is the identical same situation in
Count 8, 6(3).
 Identical situation.

may have been just with the repetition of
all of these numbers that there may have
been an omission or something of this
nature.
Thank you.
 Could the Prosecutor please come
in.
 Do you want the Defence to repeat its
remark once more?
Yes, for clarity.
If you turn to page 12 and look under
Count 5, pursuant to Article 3, I have
before me the English version.
 It reads
"4.19, 4.23", etc.
 The translator when he
read it out also included 4.21 and 4.22.
And I am saying I am not sure whether or
not, since I wasn't following the French, I
didn't know whether the French version had
4.21 or 4.22, and he was simply reading that
or whether it was just fatigue.
I think it must have been a mistake.
 It is
correct the way it is in English.

 Somebody who speaks French
must see the document.
It is correct in English.
So the error is in the French?
Well, I suppose it should tally with the

Could I have a look at your French version,
please?
As you already determined, the English

 Maybe you can read out or they can
read out the 5th count so they can compare
it with the French version, and we will see
which version is the correct one.
Okay.
 What I have, which is the English
version, is correct.
 And let me compare it
with what they have in the French version.
Okay.
 Go ahead.
Your Honour, my attention has just been
brought to -- it is wrong.
 It should read
Article 6(3) under Count 5.
 It should read
4 -- second paragraph of that should read:
4.19, 4.21, 4.22, 4.23, 4.24.
 I think that
is the mistake.
 They missed 4.21 and 4.22.

But the French wrongs to 4.21, 4.22.
 So it
should be 4.19 and 4.23.
That has cleared the problem raised by
Defence counsel.
 That clears the problem
raised by Defence counsel.
The same Count 5, what we have under Count 5
should reflect in the French version.
 What
I am saying in a sense is that we should
have 4.19, 4.21, 4.22, 4.23 in all of them,
in both 8 -- and Count 5 and Count 8.
 So
there is a mistake.
All these will be tallied with the English
version.
 You've just pointed out that the
English version is the correct one.
Your Honour, just so that we are all singing
out of the same hymn book, is it my
understanding that both with respect to

Count 8 and Count 5 that we should have
4.15, 4.21 and 4.22; is that correct?
 I
thought that's what counsel said in terms of
her latest statement.
 And I just want to be
sure, because it's contrary to what you said
prior to that.
What I am saying is that -- that's exactly
what I am saying that you have 4.19, 4.21,
4.22 and 4.23.
Okay.
 With respect to both counts?
Both counts.
All right.
Mr. Juv nal Kajelijeli, the amended
indictment has just been read out to you.
 I
want to be sure that you've understood the
contents of the charges brought against you
and the various counts that have been read
out against you.

indictment.
 I see no reference to 5.10.
Was that an oversight in the indictment?
Thank you, Mr. President.
You want to say that the paragraph you just
referred to is not referred to anywhere or
is not mentioned anywhere in the indictment.
But in the counts, reference is made to
paragraph 5.10, of paragraph 5.10, whereas
it appears nowhere in the main body of the
document, under Count 8, for instance.
Let the Prosecution clarify the point.

to correct errors I've discovered here.
I can't hear.
May I then clarify what I said earlier
regarding 4.19 and 4.13 in Counts 5 and
Count 8.
 The English version that we have
here on Count 5 and Count 8 is correct.
There shouldn't be 4.21 and 22 in Count 8.
The way it is now is correct in English
version.
 So, that's what I have to say on
this.
JUDGE GÜNEY:
Then 5.10 is obviously a typographical
error.
 It shouldn't be included because we
don't have it in the indictment.
 It is a
typographical error.
 The factual allegation
stopped at 5.9, it is a mistake.
Madam Prosecutor, we'll now proceed the way
you have directed us to.
 But let me say
that for the future, if there are any such
errors, the text that would be available to
the Accused would be the one to be used.
Thank you.

proceedings, Your Honour asked whether or

comments until after my client pled.

Absolutely.
Thank you, Your Honour.
 I'd like to make
two comments, one related to the indictment,
and the second, the issues that may impact
the effect of us moving forward as
expeditiously as we had contemplated in the
conference that both the Prosecutor and
myself had with Trial Chambers on Tuesday
afternoon at 4:00.
First of all, I have already argued
substantival with respect to my views on the
amended indictment, but I'd simply like to
point out that looking at the indictment and
also looking at the evidence that the
Prosecutor intends to produce as reflected
in the witness statements that were
presented on October 30th, we will be

challenging the competency of this Tribunal
and the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to
proceed under this indictment based upon the
Prosecutor's submissions.
It is our view that the introduction of
evidence beyond the dates that this Court
has jurisdiction over is ultimately ultra
vires and the temporal jurisdiction of the
Tribunal is fairly set forth in the Statutes
of the Tribunal, and in particular, Article
7 of the Tribunal.
And the sole authority for expanding the
jurisdiction of this body is the Security
Council and not the Prosecutor's office.
And I refer to paragraphs 3.5 in the
indictment, 3.6 in the indictment, 4.6, 4.7,
4.9 , 4.10, 4.12, 4.15, 4.16, 5.1.
 It is
clear that the Prosecutor is attempting to
try Mr. Kajelijeli for acts that preceded
January 1 of 1994.
 And we certainly will be
filing the appropriate motions.
 But I am
making my comments at this time and we will
be filing our motions, of course,

indictment but going to trial and whether or
not we would be able to proceed as we had
planned and agreed upon earlier this week.
I asked the Prosecutor in the presence of
the Tribunal --
I apologise for interrupting you.

apologies for interrupting you.

comments would be made fully cognizant with

initial appearance, I would like to thank
counsel for the Defence and the accused
Juv nal Kajelijeli for cooperating with the
Chamber.
 I also wish to thank the Office of
the Prosecutor for their assistance they
have extended to us in the course of the
initial appearance.
 I also would like to
thank the interpreters together with the
court reporters, who have been here to
assist us in the course of an afternoon,
which is supposed to be free for them.
 I
also wish to thank the representatives of

proceedings that deals with the initial
appearance.
Now I wish to inform you of two oral
decisions rendered by Trial Chamber II.
 On
Friday, 26 January 2001, these were
decisions adopted unanimously by Trial
Chamber II, first that is with respect to
the pretrial brief, and, secondly, on the
motion filed by Defence seeking the
withdrawal of counsel.
 Both decisions heard
by the Trial Chamber on Monday, 22 January
2001.
Firstly, the Chamber decided to allow the
extension of the time limit for the filing
of the pretrial brief by the Prosecutor.
Said brief should be filed no later than
Monday, 5th of February, 2001, as the
Prosecutor did undertake to proceed during
the hearing of the 22nd of January 2001.
Secondly, in view of the fact that the

counsel for the Accused had indicated in the
course of the hearing that for reasons
connected with the organisation of his
office in New York and also due to the
difficulties encountered with his
co-counsel, it would be impossible for him
to mount an appropriate Defence for his
client if the trial were to commence on the
22nd of January 2001, as scheduled.
The Trial Chamber duly notes the fact that
the trial has been adjourned and the motion
has accordingly become without merit, null
and void.
HINDS:
So those are the two oral decisions that I
wanted to indicate to you.
 Professor Hinds,
you have the floor.
Thank you, Your Honour, for your indulgence.
The comments I was about to make are not
altered at all by the decisions.
 As you
recall in conference on Tuesday at 4:00,
Mr. Fleming indicated that when the trial is
to be resumed, presumably the week of March

12th, he would make his opening remarks, in
addition he'd plan to put on maybe one or
two investigators.
 I indicated then that if
he planned to put on these investigators, I
needed to have their statements and any
other exhibits that they plan to introduce
before I left Arusha today.
 And maybe they
will provide me with that information, but I
plan to leave here, with the Court's
indulgence, in the next 15 minutes to catch
a plane.
So I spoke to Mr. Fleming earlier today and
he said they would make all efforts to
provide me with the information.
 If I don't
have that information, then I've indicated
that I may have to reserve cross-examining
those two witnesses to when we reconvene at
the end of June.
 Now that is the first
point.
The second point relates to a Bill of
Particulars.
 And I spoke to Mr. Fleming
also about that.
 And on the 19th we
attempted to serve upon the Prosecutor's

office through Mr. Webster a communiqu
requesting more particularity with respect
to the proposed witness statements.
 In
addition we requested the original, or
copies of the original interviews with these
witnesses.
 If they were done by tape, we
wanted the tape recordings and particularly
we wanted it in the original language, as
opposed to the translations that we have.
We think we have a right under the Rules to
have the original language, so that we can
make a determination as to the authenticity
of the translations.
 And we feel we have a
right to that information as soon as
possible.
 We have also asked particular
questions with respect to each of the
witnesses in terms of particularity, dates,
times and places.
Now, apparently the Prosecutor's office did
not receive -- may not have received the
communiqu
 because the Registrar's office
did not also have a copy.
 So I had copies
made for all of the parties this afternoon.

I am making this statement in open court
because I wanted to be very clear that the
Defence needs a response to this request
expeditiously since we are now on the eve of
trial.
 And would be unfair for the
Prosecutor's office not to respond
immediately.
 So this information which we
happen to think they have in their
possession and they certainly have the
capacity.
 If they don't have it in their
possession, to get it forthwith and turn it
over to the Defence.
JUDGE GÜNEY:
MS. OJEMENI:
So those are the comments that I wanted to
make, Your Honour.
 One, with respect to
discovery and the other, of course, was my
comment about the indictment itself.
Thank you, Professor Hinds.
 The Prosecutor,
please.
Your Honour, if I get the Defence, you are
asking if we received the Bill of
Particulars and we have response for you,
that's for the discovery.

MR.MS.HINDS:
OJEMENI:
The first was whether or not you received
the Bill of Particulars before today.
 I
know that you may have received it today,
but it was sent out on the 19th, and I am
not sure whether or not you in fact received
it when it was sent out.
To that I would say Mr. Fleming told me
exactly what you said, that he met with you
in the lift today and he told you that we
have not received it.
 But, however, just
before I left, about 30 minutes before I
came down, somebody brought it from the
Chambers and gave it to my colleague.
 So as
I was coming out, it was given to me.
 So
that's about the Bill of Particulars.
But then, again, I would say that the
pretrial brief should be able to take care
of the questions you are asking for in your
Bill of Particulars, because that is exactly
an American practice.
 So if I may say -- I
won't speak for Mr. Fleming -- but if I am
to comment on this, I'll say that the Bill

of Particulars is what obtains in America
and the pretrial brief will definitely take
care of what you are asking for in the Bill
of Particulars.
 So that's what I have to
say as per that.
As regards the photographs that you are
asking for, the exhibits that the
investigator would tender, we will get that
from Kigali.
 And we will assure you we will
definitely get that before -- or we'll send
them over to you in the next couple of --
maybe 10 days from now.
 So if that is okay
for you.
 Otherwise, we will send them
through the Registrar.
HINDS:
Your Honour, I am asking the Prosecutor to
respond in particularity with each of the
requests that we have made on each single
witness.
 I don't know what they plan to do
in their pretrial brief.
 But we are asking
them to tell us with respect to each witness
who claims to have seen Mr. Kajelijeli at a
particular time, at a particular place, to
say so with particularity or to the extent

 I don't know if they plan
to do that in their pretrial brief, but that
is what we are asking for.
 And I don't want
a situation where there's confusion in the
Prosecutor's office based upon our request
and I come here in March we still don't have
the information.
OJEMENI:
So I wanted to be very clear what we are
asking for.
 If the Prosecutor is not sure.
I'll be willing to -- if they have any
questions, I'm willing to communicate with
them.
 But we have a specific request and I
want them to study it and respond thereto.
Your Honour, we will definitely provide you
with the original statements.
 I am sure
Mr. Fleming has already undertaken to do
that and that's what I said we will be

getting from Kigali.
 As regards the Bill of
Particulars, I said we just got them.
 We
just got the motion for that, and we will
definitely, you know, respond to that.
JUDGE GÜNEY:
MS. OJEMENI:
JUDGE GÜNEY:
MS. OJEMENI:
But I just said perhaps most of the
questions or most of the things you are
asking for in the Bill of Particulars will
be provided in the pretrial brief.
 But
definitely we'll study it and give you
adequate response.
I think the informal meeting of the parties
that took place recently created or served
as a framework for close cooperation, and
within that framework the issues raised by
Defence will be addressed and resolved in
the spirit of cooperation.
 So I suppose
that could bring to an end the current
discussion.
 Before I conclude -
May I say something?
Sure.

GÜNEY:
May I, on behalf of the Office of the
Prosecutor since that we have noted your
comments on our attitude, or the attitude of
the prosecuting counsel in your decision of
yesterday.
 We will at the appropriate time
apologize formally.
 We do apologize.
Most obliged, thank you.
So before we rise I would like to state, and
this is intended for the accused Juv nal
Kajelijeli, that Juv nal Kajelijeli is still
presumed innocent until his guilt is proven
beyond a reasonable doubt, pursuant to the
provisions of this Statute.
That having been stated, if there is no
other item to be dealt with and I see none,
we now rise.
