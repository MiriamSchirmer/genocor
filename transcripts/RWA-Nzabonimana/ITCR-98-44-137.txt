CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I want to go back to the first time you saw Rwamakuba, just to ask you this.  You refer to the two young people and to the incident with their confrontation with Rwamakuba and the others who were with him.  Did you actually hear Rwamakuba or anyone else ask for their identification? 
A.	I do remember that I gave you the following answer.  The members of the population stopped those young persons -- that is, the local population Rwamakuba called.  Those young people and Nyarwaya asked the young people to produce their identification papers.  Nyarwaya was the brigadier.  I believe that those young persons did not have any identification papers, and I saw them give to those speaking to them, certain documents.  Thereafter, I learnt that, indeed, what they gave to them were their certificates and those certificates were torn by the people who were there. 
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Now, the question was:  Did you actually hear them being asked to produce their identification as you said in evidence? 
A.	Yes, I heard that myself. 
Q.	Because in your statement you are particular to say that you didn't know how the certificates got into the hands of Rwamakuba, "I only saw him tear them up."  So there's a change in your account, is there not? 
A.	No, there was no change.  Where do you see the change? 
Q.	In your evidence yesterday or perhaps just the day before, you said that when the two young people were taken into the wood, that it was an hour and a half before the people who took them into the wood returned.  But they'd been in the wood for an hour and a half.  That was your evidence; is that correct? 
A.	No, you are mistaken.  I think you should read my statement again and you will realise that you're making a mistake there. 
Q.	No, I -- I've read the transcript with care and that's my note as well, but it's the transcript that says that.  Do you want me to refer you to the line in the transcript -- no, I'm not going to do that, it's on the transcript, an hour and a half in the woods.  Do you want to change that? 
A.	I recall very well -- probably, you did not take good note of this, probably you're doing this deliberately.  I stated that the time lasted between 30 minutes and one hour.  I do remember this very well.  In any case, I must add that this was only an estimate of the time. 
Q.	Well, the transcript is clear that your response was one and a half hours. Is that account, if you gave it and it's been -- let me read the line to you, it's in the draft transcript and it reads: 

"Question.  Would you also be able to tell us how long these persons remained in the woods?"

This is transcript, 29th of June, draft -- that is, at page 1.  Let me find the point again. 

"Would you also be able to tell us how long these persons remained in the woods?  Answer. I will estimate and say that I believe they were in the woods for about an hour and 30 minutes." 

Is that right or wrong?  I'm not making it up, you see. 
A.	I think you started by reading that I was making an estimate.  There must have been a problem in the translation.  When you talk about making an estimate or comparing things, you are comparing at least two things.  I said that the time lasted between 30 minutes and one hour.  Not one hour and a half.  I believe, that my statement was not properly written down. 
Q.	And, finally on the first incident, this -- I'm not going to go through it again, but in your evidence you said you were 40 to 50 metres away from Rwamakuba.  In one of the note d'enquêteurs, you specify that you were 100 metres.  And in your evidence in May of last year, you said several times that you were very close, close enough to hear everything that was said.  You were, you said, just 10 metres away.  And you gave, as we recall, and we mentioned yesterday, not an estimate but a -- more than that, a description of your position in respect of the witness box as being no further than where the interpreters' booth was, which is the same distance as we see today between you and these interpreters' booths. 

So we've had varying distances.  But whatever the distance was, you were outside your house over all this period of time watching and listening to what was going on.  Is that correct? 
A.	I would like to consider the following to you.  You talk about 30 to 40 or even 10 metres, but that is an -- that's only an estimate of distance since I didn't measure it.  And I would like to remind you that these people were outside and I myself was outside, and those people were not afraid of speaking aloud.  They, therefore, spoke aloud and I heard everything. 
Q.	With respect, would you agree that for Rwandese in particular, you would be recognised from your physical appearance as -- as being a Tutsi or probably a Tutsi?  Would that be right? 
A.	Rwandans may look alike and there are many distinctive features or traits and it may be possible for you to identify somebody just as it may be impossible for you to do so. 
Q.	I'm asking a specific question about you.  In your opinion, would you agree that most Rwandese would probably identify you from your physical appearance as -- as a Tutsi.  Yes or no? 
A.	But let me answer your question the way I understand it.  Don't give me the answer in my place.  My answer is as follows:  I look like many Rwandans including Hutus.  Not everyone can say that I'm Tutsi merely by looking at me. 
Q.	I'll ask the question again.  Rwandese looking at you, would probably determine that you were a Tutsi, would they not?  Most of them would determine that you were probably Tutsi.  Yes or no? 
A.	That would depend on the period or the time concerned and the objective of the person who is making the observation. 
Q.	People in the centre ************* knew that you were a Tutsi, didn't they? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  There weren't any marks or signs on me or anything that was written saying that I was Tutsi. 
Q.	How long had you lived ***********? 
A.	I had already spent one year and a half there. 
Q.	But weren't you worried when all this killing was going on and Tutsis were being singled out, that the people there might turn on you and kill you? 
A.	I was afraid but my fear was different from that of others. 
Q.	You were afraid and yet there you are -- not stood inside your house looking through the window, but standing outside the house in full view of everybody and for several hours.  That's extraordinary, isn't it? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Extraordinary that you with a young child and pregnant again by several months would put you, your baby, your child at risk by standing in full view of killers; people killing Tutsis.  That is incredible, isn't it? 
A.	No, that is not incredible.  And, by the way, this is not the first time that I'm telling you that my husband was Hutu and that -- besides he was armed. 
Q.	But you also told us that he was often not there, not there to protect you from some rampaging Interahamwe killer.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	When he wasn't at home, I never went out; I only went out when he was there. 
Q.	In your statement you acknowledge this, you say and it's on page GIN 4, the small penultimate paragraph of your statement:  "My husband prevented me from approaching the crowd and made it clear to me that I was personally threatened because I was Tutsi."  Are you still saying that you stood  ***************** to watch and hear all these events? 
A.	Yes, I do confirm it. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, at this stage I think there is clarification -- that is on the statement that Counsel Hooper did not read because you said -- he said, "Your husband told you not to go ****************************** (sic)".  And, in the statement, it is clearly stated that her husband had stopped her from going close to the crowd.  I think that clarification is very important, at least for us. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	According to the evidence you gave in Kamuhanda and which I read to you yesterday, after the Gikomero school massacre, 30 to 50 people were murdered by Interahamwe, ***************************. The next day, it varies -- the day of the school massacre.  The next day, the day after that, and the following days.  And that's what you said then and said clearly.  If that's right, by the time Rwamakuba appears, two to five days after the school massacre, there's already been plenty of killing in that centre.  Against that background, are you telling this Chamber that you paraded yourself ************************, at great personal risk with the possibility of death?  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	I told you that I was standing ************************* and that I used to do this often when my husband was around, but when he wasn't present, I was scared of going outside and I could observe events from **********. 
Q.	Can I come to Kayanga and return to the list of names.  Now, overnight thinking about that, let me put -- or, your thinking about that, having had that opportunity, let me put the question that I put to you yesterday.  Was that a list of names that you wrote down in respect of people that you'd made statements about in the context of the part they played in the Kayanga health centre killings, yes or no?  I think this is a question which is capable of a yes or no.  Do you have answer? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President -

THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have an answer to give you -- 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I'd like to mention here that Counsel Hooper has changed his question compared to the question that he asked yesterday.  And the proof is in the transcripts, which presupposes at a certain point when the occasion will arise -- or depending on the occasion, the statements can be changed. 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, I didn't quite get the Prosecutor's point.  If she wants to repeat it?  I'm sorry. 
MS. FALL:
(No interpretation)
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I'm not getting a translation, I'm sorry. I'm on channel 1.  I'm not getting a translation. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPETER:
Can you hear now?  It's okay?  
MS. FALL: 
May I continue?  

Yesterday, Counsel Hooper when he put the question, he began by saying:  "Did you provide information on" and then came back putting in question the witness's credibility, saying "You gave a list of names on DR6 concerning the people on whom -- to whom you'd given information."  The witness answered immediately, "There aren't people to whom I gave information, but they are people in respect of whom I testified because they had been guilty of certain things."  And counsel became -- said, "Well, that's not what you said in your statement of 2004."  

And, indeed, yesterday evening I did some research and found the statement that the witness has indeed provided information with regard to who had witnessed the genocide.  I think, Counsel Hooper realised the mistake that was made and has come back to the matter and I think this is -- it's important for us as for the Defence.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm sorry, I still don't understand the point.  But I'd - I'd invite my friend perhaps to address it if she wishes in re-examination or at the conclusion of the witness's testimony, if it needs to be.  I'm afraid I haven't followed the point.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I ask the question or return to the question I have just asked you, Madam Witness and it's this.  Do you want me to repeat the question or I think you have the question.  Can we have your answer to it, please? 
A.	You may, of course, repeat your question and I would pray you to do so. 
Q.	The question is: The list that we showed you yesterday evening just before we broke up for the day, do you agree that was the list of names that you provided in the context of having provided statements to the Prosecutor in Rwanda about the people named on that list and the part they played in the Kayanga health centre killings?  Is that correct?  
A.	I do not agree. I gave those names with the explanation that they were people who had been involved in the genocide without specifying whether it was in Kayanga or elsewhere.  I gave those names because I had been questioned and told that they were seeking information in respect of those people. 
Q.	Well, I'm not going to take up time by reading every line of these pages and, if I am in error, I'll be corrected.  But I'm just going read to you what I have in front of me.  And this is your evidence of the 13th of May last year, at page 28, in the English, at line 18. 

"So you've given testimony in respect of the killings at the Kayanga health centre in respect of other persons, is that correct?"

And then there's a passage where you make it plain you haven't yet given evidence, but you have provided information.  What you say is:  

"As I've stated, I'm not a jurist; however, I would like to inform you that the perpetrators of the Kayanga massacres have not yet begun their trial.  They are still under detention, and they are waiting for their trial to begin.  So what I did or made were written statements." 

And then I ask you, "Now, can you give me, please, the names of those people to whose dossiers you have contributed?"  And you -- we go through a list of names. And you say, "One person, Ngarambe, he's deceased."  And then you add, "However, when -- within the ambits of the statements made regarding to the co-authors of these acts, his name appears.  But I didn't make any allegation against him."  

"Question.  If possible, can you complete the list of those persons in respect to whom you've provided a statement concerning the Kayanga health centre killings?"  

And you say you don't know whether that might impact on your personal safety, but it's made clear that it can now be written down and that will protect you. You say, "I would like to pray the Court to ask someone to write it down for me.  I do not wish" -- pardon me -- "I do not wish my writing to appear on any document of this Court." 

And you make your list. 

"Question" -- as the list is passed around the Court -- "And while that piece of paper makes the rounds of the Court to see, can I ask you this:  Is this a complete list as far as you remember or do you think you may have left any names off it?  Answer.  It's impossible to include every name at the same time and one cannot remember all the names at the same time.  The time that I've given for this is very short."   And, I invite you, if you think of any other names, to let us know and you agree to that. 

"Question.  Now, in making statements in respect of any person that you made a statement about relating to the health centre, did you include in any of those statements the name André Rwamakuba?"  "Answer.  No, because in Rwanda what is of interest is -- or those who are interested are only detained persons.  No question was put to me regarding Rwamakuba because he was not in Rwanda, especially as it was known where he is, and it was known that he was in good hands anyway." 

And we conclude after a further page of questions.  "So, in some" -- question -- "No mention of the Kayanga health centre in your statement about Rwamakuba until a month ago and no mention in any previous statement of Rwamakuba's participation?"   And, you agree with that. 

Well, Madam Witness, I've taken you to the transcript.  Can I invite your comment, having heard what I've read out in respect of the list which you were shown yesterday, indeed, being a list of those you nominated as participating in the Kayanga health centre killing and in respect of whom you provided information. 
A.	Fine.  When you began reading the transcript, you read the question that was put to me -- read out the question put to me as follows:  "Can you tell us who the people are in respect of which you gave information?"  I think you must understand that question.  You speak of Kayanga people against whom I testified, but, in fact, in my answer, I directly mentioned the people against whom I testified.  Not specifically people connected to the Kayanga massacre site. 
Q.	All right.  Well, I don't accept that that's what you were saying on a previous occasion.  But that's what you're saying today.  So let's see what -- let's deal with what you're saying today.  How many people did you give information about that concerned the Kayanga health centre?  
A.	Many people spoke of those events to the Rwandan authorities -- 
Q.	Would you please answer the question? 
A.	Notably the Rwandan judicial authorities -- 
Q.	Sorry, I spoke over you.  Can you answer --
A.	I am answering.  Please, allow me to finish my answer. 
Q.	Please, finish it. 
A.	This was not direct testimony.  It was information given to me.  I was given a lot of information and when I felt that I wasn't sure about the information I've been given, well, I would not pass it on. 
Q.	The question was:  How many people did you provide information about as to the part they played in the Kayanga health care -- health centre killings?  A simple question.  Can you answer it, please? 
A.	I think that I mentioned Rwamakuba and other people who I don't remember. 
Q.	So now we have a complete reversal of your evidence of just a day or two ago and what you said last year because you've told us so far, you never mentioned Rwamakuba to anyone in relation to the Kayanga health centre killing, that you did nominate other people.  So you're changing this, are you? 
A.	No, no, I didn't change my statement.  You asked me whether I had testified against anyone by accusing them of participating in the Kayanga massacre.  Now, today, I am testifying against Rwamakuba in respect of the Kayanga massacre, but I did not do so in Rwanda.  I have not appeared before any Tribunal to accuse anyone in respect of those events. 
Q.	You see, if this list is correct and, I suppose, we better go through it because you don't accept what I suggest it represents.  But, let's go through it.  Man number 1 on the list is Kamanzi, who you've mentioned.  You describe him as a director of the health centre.  Did you provide evidence in respect of him?  Yes or no?  And I want you to answer, please, yes or no, if that's possible, so we can get on.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Nyarwaya, the brigadier, the gendarmerie brigadier of the commune, did you give evidence in respect of him and the Kayanga health centre?  Yes or no? 
A.	I gave information concerning him, but not in respect of the Kayanga health centre massacre. 
Q.	All right.  Contrary to what you've said before.  All right.  

Desirée (unintelligible) originally from Kayanga.  Did you give evidence in respect of that person and the Kayanga health centre?  Yes or no? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Gakwaya Bwenge, did you give information about him or her?  Whichever it is?  And the Kayanga health centre -- yes or no, please? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	I'm sorry, I didn't get the answer to that from the booth.  What was the witness's answer, please, to the last question, about Gakwaya Bwenge? 
A.	I said no. 
Q.	So now, it's just one on this list that you've given information about in the context of that health centre killing and that's Kamanzi.  So what the other names in respect of whom you have given evidence?  Can you provide those, please? 
A.	Where did you get that one, Counsel? 
Q.	You've told us that you provided names of people who were at the centre and responsible for the killings there.  So far, you've just named one.  Who others -- who are the others? 
A.	I didn't say that. 
Q.	Well, let me ask you this:  In respect of how many people did you provide information in respect of the part they played at the killings at the health centre -- Kayanga?  How many? 
A.	Before which court or where?  In what location, Counsel? 
Q.	Anywhere in Rwanda.  I will ask the question again:  In respect of how many people did you provide information concerning the part they played in the Kayanga health centre killing? 

Sorry, did we get an answer from that?  I've had no answer from the booth.  If she gave an answer, I haven't had it.  
A.	I was waiting for you to ask a question, I was waiting for your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, here it comes for the fourth time:  How many people have you provided information about to the Rwandese authorities concerning the killings at the Kayanga health centre?  
A.	I shall answer your question for another time, also.  Rwanda authorities need testimony of eyewitnesses.  I gave testimony about some events concerning various persons, but I did not give testimony about Kayanga. 
Q.	You haven't given testimony in respect of Kayanga.  I'm not asking you about testimony, I'm asking you about statements and information which you've already stated you've made.  Are you changing your evidence yet again? 
A.	I'm not changing anything that I have previously stated.  Many things happened in Rwanda.  I had a lot of information; I gave a lot of information.  I may have forgotten some of this information and I can't remember it for the time being. 
Q.	All right.  Question:  Have you ever given any information about those responsible for the Kayanga health centre killings? 
A.	I have answered your question and I have said that I do not remember having provided any information about Kayanga.  I may have done so, and I may not be able to remember that I did so for the time being. 
Q.	Why did you tell us yesterday and the day before that you had provided this information about Kayanga health centre? 
A.	I remember very clearly the question you put to me.  You asked me whether I had provided information to the Rwandan authorities regarding Rwamakuba and I answered in the negative. 
Q.	And what about all your answers to the questions from the transcript that I just read out to you -- the answers you gave just last year?  Where have all those answers gone? 
A.	The answers I gave are not different from the answers I'm giving you now.  You read in the transcript that I had been asked whether I could provide a list of the names of people about whom I had given information in Rwanda.  I answered in response to that -- that I knew of the list, and that it did exist. 
Q.	Do you want me to put your answers in the transcript again?  Will that help you? 
A.	You are entitled to that; however, I would like to remind you that I remember everything that I said which has been recorded in the transcripts of this Tribunal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, (inaudible) to put the transcripts in evidence.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I won't go to it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can read them.
MR. HOOPER:
I won't go through it, thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let's go back to the actual events. You're at home and André Rwamakuba arrives.  He doesn't stay very long in the centre and this is two to five days, you told us, after he'd appeared the first time.  What time did he come to the centre, approximately, in your estimation? 
A.	You're emphasising the hours and the times and you're trying to trap me there.  I would like to remind you that after 11 years, it is difficult to remember the time when things happened.  That is why I make mistakes about the times; however, I shall make an effort.  I remember that it was between 
	10 and 11 o'clock.  If this is not correct, please forgive me, it's a long time ago. 
Q.	Just last year you said, I think, it was between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the afternoon; that was just last year.  Which of those two is correct or is neither correct? 
A.	I would like to remind you that what is correct is that I saw Rwamakuba going to Kayanga.  As to days and dates, I would like to remind you that I did not know that I would have to answer questions about that.  If so, I would have written it down. I asked you to understand me because it is not easy to remember times and dates. 
Q.	We know you never mentioned Kayanga and André Rwamakuba to anybody until April of last year; that's correct, isn't it?  I'm sure you can agree, that that's true, can you not? 
A.	I would also like to ask you to grant me this.  The Office of the Prosecutor conducts investigations, just as you of the Defence team do.  Each time, the witness is reminded that if, at any point in time, he or she remembers something he or she may mention it to the judges.  So when I remembered the details, this detail, I told -- I talked about it. 
Q.	And -- and you place this sometime between 4 or 5 days after the killings at the school and 10 days after the killings at the school?  That would be right, wouldn't it?  Up to a week and a half after the killings at the school -- on your estimates? 
A.	Is that a question or am I to wait for your question? 
Q.	Well, do you agree with that? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, isn't this already on the record? 
MR. HOOPER:
Let me move on. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Just -- just help me with this. The vehicle, with Rwamakuba, arrives and this was the last point we were dealing with actually, last night.  And you've told us that it was a white car, I'm not going to go into all that, and it goes off again towards Kayanga.  What actually happened in -- in -- what did you actually see?  What happened after that? 
A.	After he left for Kayanga, Counsel, or are you referring to the time when he was still at the centre?  
Q.	Well, what -- what are you doing when he arrives?  Where were you? 
A.	I wasn't doing anything.  I was chatting with other people *****************. 
Q.	And -- and the car arrives, and -- and where does it go? 
A.	It was heading for Kayanga as you have said. 
Q.	Did it stop in the trade centre? 
A.	Yes, it did. 
Q.	Where did it stop? 
A.	At the centre. 
Q.	Where in the centre? 
A.	In front of the houses. 
Q.	How far from *************? 
A.	It is always difficult to estimate distances.  If I give you a different distance from what you know, I -- I'll ask you to forgive me.  I think that the vehicle parked ****************************************; however, I did not measure this distance.  It is an estimate. 
Q.	Yes, but in respect of -- in front of whose house did it stop? 
A.	The vehicle parked between ****************** houses; they share a courtyard. 
Q.	And after that -- and after the vehicle went off, what happened then? 
A.	We saw vehicles drive up; they contained the accountant and some policemen of the commune.  They took away some people -- some inhabitants of the centre. 
Q.	Was there a meeting at your house? 
A.	There was no meeting at my house, no. 
Q.	On a previous occasion you said this:  "Question" -- from the Prosecution, "Did people subsequently come to your house on that day?  Answer.  Yes people came to my house" -- this is after Rwamakuba has past through. "Who came to your house?"  "There was the brigadier of the commune and the accountant, as well as some policemen who were with them.  They came to our home; the policemen was from Bumbogo."  

I'm going to carry on -- 
MS. FALL:
(Microphones overlapping)

MR. HOOPER:
I'm going to carry on reading and perhaps be interrupted a bit later -- 
MS. FALL:
I would like to obtain the references of the document that you're reading. 

What document are you reading right now because you've talked about references in the document in very general terms?
MR. HOOPER:
Page -- I'm sorry.  Page 11, transcript in English.  This witness's testimony, 4th of May, 2004.  
MS. FALL:
(No interpretation)
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	And this particular next portion is at page 11. 

"The first person was my husband and the others were my children.  As for the others, they were just neighbours." 

"And why did Brigadier Nyarwaya, the accountant and other people come to your house?"  

"They'd come to transport other policemen and Interahamwe to go and help them in the killings of persons who were at Kayanga -- at the Kayanga health centre." 

"Did these people go with the brigadier to the Kayanga health centre?" 

"Answer.  Yes, they did.  They went with the brigadier."  "Question.  How do you know?"  "Answer.  They spoke about it. They were in my sitting room and they were saying that they were going to Kayanga. They got on to two vehicles.  My husband left with those people and when he came back, I asked him what had happened and he spoke about it to me and he told me about where all these events took place." 

Are you saying now, that there wasn't a meeting in your home? 
A.	There was no meeting in my living room.  As you read out and, I think you tried not to read some words clearly in order to confuse me, you referred to the policemen from Rubungo.  You didn't say what he did, however.  These people came to get the policemen, who came -- who was at my place.  There was no meeting, however.  These people talked and they left.  So I cannot accept that there was a meeting at my home.  There wasn't a meeting, as you have read it, you can even repeat it if you wish.  I said that they were inhabitants, my husband and the policemen.  They -- they left and even beforehand I had mentioned these people.  So where is the contradiction or where is the difference? 
Q.	"Did people subsequently come to your house?"  "Yes, people came to my house."  "Who came to your house?"  "The brigadier of the commune, and the accountant as well as some policemen.  They came to our home."  

"How did you know these -- these people were going to the Kayanga health centre?"  "They spoke about it, they were in my sitting room and they were saying they were going to Kayanga." 

Let me move on to something else. In 1991, the Kayanga health centre was officially opened in the esteemed presence of the president of Rwanda, President Habyarimana, and you, on a previous occasion have said that you attended that inauguration of the Kayanga health centre.  Is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	André -- Dr. André Rwamakuba was a prominent figure at the opening of that centre.  Did you see him there? 
A.	I did not see him. 
Q.	You've said, in fact, on a previous occasion, that that was your opportunity or one of them to see 
	Jean De Dieu  Kamuhanda; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	I remember talking about two personalities, Anastase Gasana and Kamuhanda, if I remember correctly. 
Q.	And you misled the Court about that, didn't you, because Kamuhanda was never there, was he? 
A.	I don't understand your question.  Would be so kind to repeat it?  
Q.	Kamuhanda was not there at the inauguration of that health centre and you have misled the Court on a previous occasion in respect of that.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	No.  I did not lie. 
Q.	And in the Kamuhanda case you claimed that Kamuhanda had come to ************** a few days before the killings at the school, distributed weapons and incited people to kill.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then in that man's trial, though you'd never ever made a statement about it, you suddenly said "And he was there on the 12th at the time of the Gikomero school massacre", didn't you?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	A final matter or matters. The transcript, *********************** 2002 in the case of Kamuhanda.  I've referred to previous parts of this transcript; I'm not going to repeat it.

"Question.  Did you at any time go across to the school and look to see if anything had happened?"  "Answer.  Subsequently, the Interahamwe that came from Rubungo commune came after us, and we immediately ran heading for Kibobo.  It was during that chase that we found bodies that were in the school. That was three days after the killings."  And, you said:  "I reckon that there were 4 to 5,000 bodies."  
Did you flee to Kibobo three days after the massacre, passing through the school and seeing the bodies; is that correct? 
A.	This is practically the fourth time you're putting the same question to me.  I have answered this question. I gave you an estimated time frame.  I told you that we sought refuge in Kibobo forest and it is when we were going to Kibobo that we saw the bodies. 
Q.	Thank you.  Page 9, your answers:  

"After the massacre at the school, we went into hiding because they were running after us and I couldn't show myself." 

Is that correct?  You went into hiding, you couldn't show yourself?  
A.	Do you see any trap in the -- any hiding place in that transcript?  I could have been hiding at my home, you know.  And it was not forbidden to do so; I was not forbidden to go out. 
Q.	Page 20 of the transcript:  

"I went to Kibobo fleeing from the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe came to attack us and then they went back and then I went back to Kibobo to spend the night.  And I came back to my house.  I didn't remain in Kibobo for several days."  

Did you spend the night in Kibobo? 
A.	I have explained this. I said that we went and spent the night in Kibobo, because we were afraid of the Interahamwe.  I also explained, however, that our husbands came to fetch us.  So we did not spend the night in Kibobo.  If you go on reading the transcript, you will find that. 
(Pages 1 to 14 by Jean Baigent)














1000H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And the 13th of January 2003 you said, "The day after the killings," so, it is now the day after the killings, right, "I went to Kibobo but I didn't spend the night there, I immediately came back home."  Is that right, the day after the killings, or the third day after the killings; which was it? 
A.	I have given the time frame.  I referred to the days that followed the massacre.  I said that I went to Kibobo, that I returned home and I indicated the different places where I had sought refuge. 
Q.	"Answer: I know that Eustache Kayumba, lived in Gikongoro."  Eustache, E-U-S-T-A-C-H-E, Kayumba, K-A-Y-U-M-B-A, "lived in Gikongoro," G-I-K-O-N-G-O-R-O.  "He was an inhabitant of Gikongoro.  And I know that he and Drocella are friends.  In fact, they exchanged cows.  And I know very well in 1994 when we were in Kibobo we were living in his house." Did you live in his house?
A.	First I would like to correct you; this man is not from Gikongoro, and I never said he was.  But when we were fleeing, we went to his home and we stayed there until we returned to our homes.  
Q.	And was he -- was his home in the forest or was it at Kibobo, the other Kibobo that you tell us about, of the two that you mentioned; which one was it? 
A.	His place of residence was in the forest at Kibobo. 
Q.	But I thought you told us you just sat down in the forest; you weren't in any house two days ago, were you? 
A.	But my answer has not changed.  It is no different.  Kayumba`s house is in Kibobo in the forest, so there is the house and there is the forest.  I could have sat in the forest one day and another day entered the house and sat there.  I did not give any different answer.  My answer didn't vary to the contrary of what you are asserting. 
Q.	Transcript 4th of May 2004, page 74:  "Answer:  I went to Kibobo on two occasions and I think I have mentioned that quite clearly.  The first time was before the killings at the school complex.  I also confirmed that there are at Kibobo two places, which are referred to as Kibobo, and which are distinct.  Now, the second time around was when the RPF was liberating that area."  Is that correct, too, two visits to Kibobo, one before the killings at the school and the other one when the RPF are liberating the area?  Change of story again, isn't it? 
A.	No.  I did explain on several occasions that I went to Kibobo on several occasions.  And in my answer, I answered the question put to me as to the number of times I could remember when I had gone to Kibobo.  So, I specified the number of times, according to the memory I have of it. 
Q.	"Answer --" page 79, "I said that I lived in Kibobo and not in Gikomero.  When I was in Kibobo, the massacres had not yet begun.  When I came back to Kibobo, the Inkotanyi were liberating Gikomero." Let me focus on two sentences, forget the first sentence because maybe it got the words mixed up, all right.  "When I was in Kibobo, the massacres had not yet began . When I came back to Kibobo the Inkotanyi were liberating Gikomero.  This is, indeed, contained in the Kamuhanda documents.  If he looks through those, he will be able to find such testimony."  So two visits to Kibobo, one before the massacres started and the second when the RPF were liberating -- the Inkotanyi were liberating Gikomero? 
A.	Are you not reading the record correctly, but that wasn't the question put to me.  I went to         Eustache Kayumba and I was asked how many times I had gone there to his place, to his place of residence.  And it is following upon that question that I gave the answer that you have just read to us? 
Q.	Transcript page 80 of the same date.  "The first time I was in Kibobo the massacres had not yet started at the primary school.  The second time, the RPF had just arrived in Gikomero.  I think that that is clear now.  Question:  It is, and that is where I thought we were a dozen questions ago.  But are you saying that you didn't go to Kibobo then between the killings, the massacres and the RPF coming; is that your evidence?  Answer:  No, I did not go to Kibobo between the two events, between the massacres and the arrival of the RPF."  Is that correct?
A.	Your question is complex.  I was asked what -- under what circumstances I had gone to Kayumba's residence.  And we discussed that at length.  I had said I had gone there twice.  The first time was before the massacres and the second time was at the time when the RPF was in the process of liberating Gikomero. 
Q.	My last question.  Transcript, 4th of May, page 74, your answer:  "I need to explain that before the killings at the school complex, I was hiding at Kibobo.  Later on I said that I fled following the shooting between the RPF and its enemies.  I went to Kibobo, too.  And I do believe I said that I went back to my area when security was restored a little later.  Question: I'm asking you when was it safe for you to return to your home at the trade centre, when was that?  Answer:  I had a baby.  I didn't have any problem, I no longer had any problem and I got there in August.  And from what I could see, the security had been restored.  I told you I went to that place when the RPF reached Gikomero."  
A.	You are speaking of when the security was restored, a return trip.   When the RPF came, there was some fighting.  We lived on the road where there was -- this fighting was taking place.  We have to distinguish between the two occasions and the two places at Kibobo.  And I did explain the difference.  We came back to our residence after the fighting, when security had been re-established.  And that was in August, when we returned in August, at that time there was no problem. 
Q.	Now, I may have raised a false expectation in everyone that that was my last question, but, I'm afraid, I just thought of one last one. So let me ask you this -- or one last very small subject.  

You referred earlier to how you were collecting information, lots of information including information on the Kayanga health centre.  Do you remember saying that, about half an hour ago? 
A.	You say that I was gathering information, seeking information.  What for?  
Q.	I mean, doesn't your evidence even last 30 minutes? 
A.	Yes, I remember what I said.  But I didn't speak of seeking information. 
Q.	Well, you obtained lots of information you told us.  Are you changing that now? 
A.	No, I speak of events which I witnessed; one must distinguish between the fact that one knows something or that one -- and seeking information on something. 
Q.	Okay.  Leaving aside things you know, of course, all you saw and heard, as we have been listening to for several days, you refer to getting information, receiving information from people, including the Kayanga health centre.  Are you saying that didn't happen?  That you didn't get any information about the Kayanga health centre from anyone?  Is that what you are saying now? 
A.	(No interpretation)
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think that, perhaps, it is very important at this stage, perhaps, to check the transcript.  I think this would merit verification because it is very important for us.  It was not long ago that the witness spoke to this point.  Could we undertake a check?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think that is necessary at this stage.  

Ms. Witness, Madam Witness, the question that you are being asked was whether you got information about the killings at the Kayanga health centre.  In a simple way, that is that question that is being put to you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  In fact, Defence counsel changed his question.  That was not his question.  He said to me, rather, that I had stated that I had sought information subsequently, and then when I said, what information are you referring to, he changed his question.  And then put the question to me that you have just put, sir.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have an answer to my question?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I said that my husband had given me some information, and I think I explained that at length here before you. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But you refer to other people, as my recollection serves, I was on my feet, perhaps others have a better note -- or a note, even.  Didn't you refer to getting other information about it from other people, or did I, perhaps, mishear you? 
A.	I said that when the assailants left, they stated where they were going.  And when they came back, they spoke about it also.  But more concretely, it was my husband who provided information to me.  And I remember that we went to bury the corpses, the remains of the victims of the genocide.  And they spoke of a woman who had been killed atrociously.  I think I mentioned that -- previously mentioned that incident. 
Q.	No, I don't think you have ever mentioned that incident.  But as I understand it -- let me put it like this, you said, I understood you to say that you had received information about the Kayanga health centre from other people.  That may -- other than your husband, that is.  If it is true that you received any information about the Kayanga health centre from other people, can you name those other people?  If you received no information then, obviously, you won't be able to name anyone.  Which is it?  
A.	At this moment in time before the present Court, I must say I never said such a thing.  Perhaps you need more information, in which case I can provide it to you. 
Q.	You can or cannot provide me with more information, which was it? 
A.	I should like to remind you of the following; before they went to Kayanga, they came to pick up the policeman and members of the population and stated where they were going.  That is the first item of information.  When they came back, they explained how the people had been killed and how they had dragged the corpses around on the ground. 
Q.	Very well.  There is no dispute that there was a massacre at the Kayanga health centre.  And the names of people who were Interahamwe in your area you have named, or, at least, you have named many of them.  But you know full well that André Rwamakuba had nothing to do with that.  You have misled this Court, haven't you, or you have tried to? 
A.	As I am still before the Court, I would remind you that I am here to state before the Court what Rwamakuba did in Kayanga and in Gikomero.  If I did not have any information on that topic, then why would I have appeared before this Court?  And what would be -- where would be -- how would it be in my interest to lie to the Court. 
Q.	Well, if that is a question you are putting to me, may I suggest that perhaps you do have a burning sense of the need for revenge, given the hurt you yourself have suffered.  There is one motivation.  Perhaps you are hoping for some advantage in your present condition ***************************, that may be another --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:  
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think the question was meant to be answered. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, too. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President, sorry. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
It is on, yes.  Okay, Madam Witness, I am saying that you are going to have to answer some questions from the Prosecuting counsel now.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President.  
RE-EXAMINATION
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.
A.	Good morning. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, before beginning redirect, I would like to raise two points.  I should, first of all like to request -- in choosing how to proceed with my redirect, whether you have, in your hands, all of the transcripts concerning all statements this witness has made in the Kamuhanda trial, as well as, in the Rwamakuba trial, because -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permit me to enquire of Mr. Hooper.  Do you intend to put the transcript in evidence?
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I consider that matter, because much of it has been read in anyway, and therefore, has the added advantage of being part of the narrative of the evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But as a court reviewing the -- reviewing the factual matters, it might be of interest to the Chamber to actually have a chance to read them. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Right.  I will put the full transcripts in, if they are not in already. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but by "full" you mean -- are you going to put in the relevant sections, or are you going to have to search for them --  
MR HOOPER:
Other -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- putting in the full transcripts may be sufficient because I think in most cases, if not all, you indicated the reference that you are reading from. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, subject to my references remaining the same with the eventual documents you get, because sometimes they alter, that has been a problem.  But I think that is probably, in my submission, I agree, the most straight-forward matter.  It has the added advantage that the Chambers isn't deprived of seeing context, or of it being suggested I isolated a passage or anything like that, it gives an advantage to the Chamber of seeing context.  And I have no objection at all to the transcripts going in, at this stage, to be referred to in whatever manner by either party or by the Chamber in the future. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but would they come in as a Defence exhibit?   
MR. HOOPER: 
They could come in as a Defence exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have them available?
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I would have thought they would have been served as part of the previous testimony of the witness and so they should emanate essentially from the Prosecution in my submission. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Your Honour, just to clarify, it was our understanding that Mr. Hooper agreed with the Trial Chamber coordinator that he would provide the transcripts because he was planning to rely on them, so we didn't as a result. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Whatever, it is an administrative matter.  I move that they be admitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know where they are now?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, we have got them in hard copies in various formats, but you will not welcome that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not all of us. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, this is it, there may again be a preference, on the Tribunal, as to the format in which the documents are produced.  We can produce them, or, perhaps, better neutrally they should be produced, perhaps, by Court Management.  I know there is a shifting of responsibilities here.  But, at least, in that way there is a neutral production of important court documents.  Otherwise, the Defence are quite happy to produce ACD with the relevant transcripts on them.  If that is the preferred method, then I will try to undertake to have that CD presented in evidence as an exhibit on Monday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry.  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, yes, the registry would prefer that either a CD or the hard copies be presented to the parties.  And I think we need, normally, five copies, one for the registry, one for the Prosecution and three for the Judges.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Considering --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if there is an objection we can address it in that manner on Monday morning. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
No objection, Mr. President.  And I think as far as we are concerned, we already have the transcript.  The reassurance that I was seeking was that you all had them and that you could lay your hands on them.  And if you could see them, that would avoid my having to come back to certain points, and, thereby gain some time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do have some of them.  I just -- I'm not certain that we have all.  But I do have access to many of the passages that were referred to.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  The second point which I wish to raise before beginning my redirect, and this is on the invitation of Counsel Hooper, because when I spoke before to point out that he had changed his question, he told me that he did not understand my point.  And I will, therefore, clarify by reading to him exactly what he said yesterday and what was the answer the witness had provided.  I am referring to the transcript of Thursday, 30th of June 2005; page 72 in the French.  I won't be very long, Mr. President.  

"When you were shown the document DR. 6, which did, indeed, contain the list of persons,"       Counsel Hooper said, and I quote, "Examining this document, do you accept that it is something that you fabricated.  And is, in fact, a list of persons to whom -- or rather -- to whom you have provided information in respect of the killings at Kayanga health centre?"   

"And when you were asked to provide a list" -- and this is the question, "if possible, can you tell us -- can you elaborate on the list of people to whom you provided information at the Kayanga health centre?  You elaborated this document -- page 28 of the transcript, page 28 and 29 of a transcript or minutes or records dated 2004.  Can you confirm to us that this is a list drawn up on the basis of your instructions or directions?  Witness: I do remember, but that was not the question put to me, at least, the one that you have just quoted was not the question put to me at the time."  And then Counsel Hooper's question:  "Well, that is what the Court transcripts says; it is the list that you prepared.  I will put the question different, is the list of names before you, the list of names of people to whom you provided information in respect of the killings perpetrated at Kayanga health centre; answer yes or no please?"  Witness's answer:  "I recall that they asked me if I had provided information in respect of certain people.  Question:  In the context of the massacres or the killings at Kayanga health centre?"  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, if this is already a part of the transcript of our trial, it is not necessary to read it back into the transcript.  If there was a particular issue that you wanted the witness to clarify, that could be part of your examination.  But we already have it in the transcript, so it is not necessary to read it back in. 
MS. FALL: 
Yes, Mr. President, but it is in respect of Counsel Hooper's position, who changed his question, who put the question in respect of the witness's credibility and said today that he didn't understand what I was pointing to.  But I shall not go on, inasmuch as the transcript is there. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Precisely.  I have access to the information and we will be reviewing it at the appropriate time.  

Do you know about how long you expect to be in re-examination?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, does this mean that I should limit my re-examination in consideration of Mr. Hooper's cross-examination?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Come on, Ms. Fall, that was not what my question was. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I shall promise not to take too much time up for this re-examination.  And it is entirely possible that I shall not go beyond half an hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, in that case, it might be appropriate to take our mid-morning break now. 
(Court recessed from 1037H to 1058H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can resume now. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, I would like to ask you, when you saw André Rwamakuba for the first time, was it before or after the massacres of the Gikomero primary school? 
A.	When I saw him for the first time, it was during the war, before the school massacres. 
Q.	Yesterday, Witness, you were shown several photographs.  And when you were shown these photographs, you were asked to refer to a Prosecution document; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I remember that. 
Q.	And you told us that you were able to indicate on that document the place to which the young people had been taken to be killed; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	If you were to be given a document depicting these photographs, would you be able to do that again today? 
A.	Yes, I would. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, with you leave, I would like to show the document to the witness.  This is taken from another angle, and I would like her to indicate the place to which the young people were taken, after the document has been shown to the Trial Chamber and to the Defence for verification. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, the English booth would like to tell Ms. Fall to leave a space between the questions and the answers.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, do you have the document now? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Could you please indicate approximately the place to which the young people were taken to be killed? 
A.	Give me time.  I need a pen.  And how should I indicate the place, Madam Prosecutor?  
Q.	Please use a cross.
A.	I think it is at this place. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you.  Can the document be shown to the Judges and to the Defence?

Please be so kind as to give the document to the registry or to the Trial Chamber.  Would you be so kind as to take the document back? 

Mr. President, I would like to tender this document as a Prosecution Exhibit under seal, and I believe it should be P. 48. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted as a Prosecution Exhibit under seal, Mr. Registrar, P. 48. 
(Exhibit No. P. 48 admitted, under seal)
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Yesterday, I believe you were criticized with not having said everything you knew about the events that occurred in Gikomero, also in regard to your knowledge of André Rwamakuba.  And reference was made to your statement of 3rd February 1998; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	When your statement of 3rd February 1998 is reread, in particular, the passage referring to            André Rwamakuba, you realise that this covers about two pages.  Do you think that in two pages, you would have been able to provide all of the information that you were able to have given during this trial? 
A.	I could not provide all of the information that I knew.  And it could not be contained in the two pages.  First of all, when investigators return to see you they do not give you prior warning.  Secondly, you can not remember everything at once. 
Q.	Witness, for some days now, you have been giving testimony before this Trial Chamber.  Are you able to tell us whether you can remember what you have said in these two or three days, everything that you have said in this Trial Chamber, word for word?
A.	During the time that I have been in this Trial Chamber, various questions have been put to me, the Prosecution and the Defence have put questions to me.  If I was asked now to recall what I said, I would not be able to do so, unless I were given the opportunity to read the transcript. 
Q.	Since 2001, and regularly from 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, you have given testimony at various times before Trial Chambers.  Are you in a position to remember all of the things you have said to the various Trial Chambers over these four years?
A.	I cannot remember what I said word for word, and for various reasons.  These are different trials and in each trial one had to give dates.  And when I leave here, *********************************** there are so many dates that sometimes it is difficult to remember. 
Q.	However, Witness, since all of the transcripts will be made available to both parties, please give estimates, if you can.  Do you think -- do you think that you have given faithful testimony in regard to André Rwamakuba of the events that you experienced? 
A.	Everything that I remember, I have talked about, and I have done so accurately.  My conscience is clear that I have told the truth. 
Q.	Thank you.  I shall now take a quick look at the note d'enquêteurs, or the investigators notes.  I believe you told us that you made -- you gave a statement which you subsequently signed; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Afterwards, it became apparent that there were three visits.  The investigators, my humble self and another Prosecutor; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  That is how I remember it. 
Q.	Now.  Regarding these three documents, did you sign them? 
A.	No, I think I signed one or two of them.  I no longer remember exactly which ones I signed, but I am sure that I did not sign all of the documents. 
Q.	Yes, you did, in fact, sign your statement and the reconfirmation statement, which amounts to two documents.  Now, as to the other documents you did not sign, did you at any point in time become aware of their contents? 
A.	After giving the investigators and the Prosecutor this information, as you know, the investigator and the Prosecutor withdraw and decide what to write down, and then they return to see you.  But they did not do so for all documents.  In some cases, they didn't come back to see me. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us at what particular time you became aware of the contents of a document -- that is, the investigator's notes that you did not sign? 
A.	Are you asking me when I became aware of the contents of the documents that I did not sign?  
Q.	Yes.
A.	The document was only read out to me here before the Judges.  If I had seen the document before, I would have signed it. 
Q.	Witness, is it correct --  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I'm going to refer to the transcript, however, I am not going to read it out.  I am referring to page 34 of yesterday's session.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	When the first document was read to you, Witness, you immediately made a correction regarding the	 bureau, the secteur bureau or office, whereas, reference had, in fact, been made to the commune office.  Do you remember?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	So, this is the first mistake that you observed, and you corrected it immediately, did you not? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Is it correct that afterwards, while the Defence was analysing the note d'enquêteur, did they read the note d'enquêteur of February 2004 to you?  And in reading part of this statement or referring identity cards that were torn up, is it not correct that you said that it was not identity cards that were torn up, but certificates, actually.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	So I am referring to page 63, lines 27 to 31 in reference to the Defence question; and lines 35 to 37 for the witness's answer to the question.  Witness, does this mean that if you had had all of these documents in your possession you would have made all of the necessary corrections? 
A.	Yes, it does. 
(Pages 15 to 25 by Donna M. Lewis)





1115H  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, does this mean that if you had had all these documents in your possession, you would have made all the necessary corrections?  
A.	Yes, it does.  
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like to return to the first question I put to you.  I know that you answer the questions as they are put to you.  When you saw André Rwamakuba for the first time, was it before or after the massacres?  I am saying that this is in 1994, you gave me an answer, but I would like to say that my question regarded 1994, particularly.  
A.	I saw him after the massacre at the school.  
Q.	And you have in fact answered my precise question.  

Witness, can you now tell us when you saw André Rwamakuba for the very first time?  
A.	I saw him during a wedding in ************* which is in Gikoro.  
Q.	Witness, you told us that the first time you saw André Rwamakuba, he was pointed out to you as Dr. André Rwamakuba; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	When you saw him for the first time, were you aware that he was a physician?  
A.	When he was -- the guests were introduced, the person who introduced them said this is 
	Dr. Rwamakuba, but I did not know whether he was a doctor or he was -- just had a doctorate.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, before I conclude, I am going to ask Mr. Hooper who said something yesterday regarding the date of 12th April 1994 in reference to the decision on the Kamuhanda matter.  Mr. Hooper asked me whether I was contesting this decision in referring to paragraph 296.  So I am going to ask Mr. Hooper in regard to this Kamuhanda decision.  I would like to ask him whether he is contesting paragraph 272.  I asked him that.  He read paragraph 296, I shall allow myself to read paragraph 272.  It is in English, so please forgive my accent.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would counsel remember to read slowly, please?
MR. HOOPER:
This is not appropriate, Mr. President.  The paragraph refers to the Chamber's finding in respect to the credibility of this witness.  The Chamber didn't have the opportunity of seeing this witness give testimony here, and it would be wholly inappropriate to introduce that into this case.
MS. FALL:
(Inaudible)

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Counsel.
MS FALL:
Mr. President, I think this decision is public.  Everybody has access to it.  If Mr. Hooper is embarrassed because the witness is there, I can ask for the witness to be removed so that the paragraph can be read.  He read another paragraph and it was -- it did not concern this trial.  And he read paragraph 296 of this same decision, I do not see why I should not be allowed to read another paragraph.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would not order Mr. Hooper to answer the question.  And, in any event, we have access to all Court decisions.  So  we have access to your -- having made reference-- you will have an opportunity during the trial, you should address us on this subject matter, but we have heard the reference you have made.
MS. FALL:
I do not wish to insist, Mr. President.  So I shall refer to this Trial Chamber decision or judgment in the Kamuhanda trial, and this is in reference to paragraph 272, which goes to the credibility of the witness.  This concludes my re-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you have now come to the end of your testimony in this trial.  I would like to thank you for your attendance and for giving evidence here. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to thank you also.  Thank you for listening to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  You are now excused.
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you and good-bye.  
	(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, we have 35 minutes, could we start the next witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, Mr. President, before that, would it be appropriate for me to submit exhibits in respect to the last witness now?  Those would be the statements and the other documents that have been referred to which have gone to you, but I don't think they have been formally exhibited.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I would normally prefer that the exhibits are done while the witness is seated in the box.  But my question comes through the transcripts are meant to include all -- everything, but -- what exactly do you have?  

MR. HOOPER:
I have got all the relevant documents that had been referred to -- in the course of this trial -- in the course of this evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I have noticed that Ms. Fall is smiling.  In that context, could you agree to a list and tender it on Monday?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall.  
MS FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, you may proceed on Monday morning.  
MR. HOOPER:
There are two or three other matters that I would like to raise at some time with the Chamber this morning, and I am in your hands.  As the witness is waiting, I have no objection to doing that at another appropriate time this morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you anticipate it is going to take?
MR. HOOPER:
Several -- just a few minutes to mention two matters.  The third matter is a question of timing -- of time, and my application would be that I am seeking a day between the Gikomero and Butare witnesses; that you grant the Defence a day of not sitting because we have reached a point where we have great difficulty in keeping up with our administrative matters in the case and, in particular, in relation to aspects of Butare witnesses.  And -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me ask a question.  

Ms. Fall, when do you anticipate that the -- resume the trial.  We have other reasons; Mr. Hooper and we will probably be in a position to give some time on Thursday next week.  Now, would that be a convenient time?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we have got two more witness for Gikomero and they involve -- both of them would involve transcripts, but I wouldn't have thought their evidence would take together more than a day and a half -- they are outside -- which would take us no later on that assessment to midday on Tuesday.  And I have got a -- I hope, they were not clear -- party coming from Rwanda to assist me in respect of certain matters with the Butare witnesses.  We have other matters as well that we need to address, both as amongst ourselves, but more particularly with the registry, and you will appreciate that the hours we sit don't allow us to partake very much of a discussion with the registry because they are not there when we sit and they are not there when we come out.  So there are difficulties in respect of that.  We also have -- I need not -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me -- as far as the convenience of the Chamber itself is concerned, all the members of this 
Trial Chamber are involved in other matters which are current, and arrangements are being made at the moment which are likely to result in us not being able to sit on Thursday and Friday or on part of Thursday and Friday.  So the point is, if we lost Wednesday as well, it means that we would not sit longer than two days.  

Now, I am not in a position to make a formal statement as yet, but the indications are that we will not be sitting either during Thursday and Friday or part of that time.  By Monday, I would expect to be more specific on that.  Now, if that is the case, it would embarrass us if we had to stop on Wednesday as well.  
MR. HOOPER:
I won't embarrass the Chamber by making that request.  And if we could have Thursday and Friday, together with the weekend, though the registry doesn't expect us to work over the weekend, we do, of course, as you know, Mr. President, that would, in fact, accommodate us very well.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Ms. Fall, I was not able to make the statement before because we are still negotiating the time, but I anticipate and that is what is going to happen next week, but I should be in a position on Monday to be more specific, I hope.  
MR. HOOPER:
I know this is a matter that needs progress in an open session.  But looking ahead realistically now, I am wondering if there might be an opportunity to discuss the matter between us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would expect that, but not today though, but I will raise it with our trial coordinator to set something up during the course of next week.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Probably, we will also have more information as well by that time.  

MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. O'Shea has a matter to raise.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Mr. President, I have a matter to raise which arises directly out of the evidence of this witness.  It is matter which, I think, all in all, should take about 15 minutes between me and Ms. Fall.  Is it something that Your Honours would prefer to defer to Monday?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the nature of the issue? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, the nature of the issue is in relation to precision in the indictment and information that's come out of the witness.  It's a concern that I have and a concern coupled with a request. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the request?  
MR. O'SHEA:
It is difficult for the request without explaining the context.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I am wondering is this, is whether it is something that would be more appropriate for a written submission.  
MR. O'SHEA:
No, it is not really a motion issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is not a motion issue?
MR. O'SHEA:
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  That is what my question was alluding to.
MR. O'SHEA:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, the witness that you are going to lead -- introduce now, how long do you anticipate the chief to last?  
MS FALL:
Mr. President, I think that we have evolved a policy in this trial, that it is not necessary if we stick to the necessary questions, it is -- we wouldn't need more than two hours.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
In-chief?  
MS. FALL:
In-chief, yes, for examination-in-chief of the witness.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
(Overlapping microphones)...your question, because I was trying to consider whether it would have been better to start the witness now or hear the argument that Mr. O'Shea wanted to raise.  
MS. FALL:
 I give my entire confidence to you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  What we are thinking of doing is to hear the argument now, hopefully, it will take about 15 minutes and then we would like to ask to have the witness start testimony and at least complete the aspect with regard to identity and the formal issues, so that we can start with the substantive testimony on Monday morning.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes, thank you very much.  

Your Honours will remember that at the beginning of this trial session on the 8th of June, we filed a memorandum on the indictment, and I just remind Your Honours, it was a memorandum asking for further precision in relation to three matters; the first being paragraph 12 of the indictment to specify the names of two communal policemen referred to in that paragraph.  The second paragraph 13, specified the name of the deputy director of the Kayanga health centre; and the third paragraph 15, specify the name of the head of doctors without borders, which were referred to in the indictment.  The following day, on  Your Honours' direction, the Prosecution filed a new indictment in which -- in relation to each of those three matters.  It was stated in the indictment that -- in relation to one, that the persons were identified as communal policemen but were unknown.  

The concern that I have is this:  At the beginning of the cross-examination from Mr. Hooper, Mr. Hooper put the following questions to the witness, whether she had had an opportunity to discuss her evidence with the Prosecution.  The response of the witness was that she had not -- that she had seen the Prosecutor, but that she had not gone into her evidence.  Before this witness gave evidence, the Prosecution provided us and the Chamber with a list of names that would be referred to during the course of the evidence of the witnesses in this trial.  In that list, we have number 57, Kayibanda; and number 92, Ngarambe.

Again, during the course of the examination-in-chief of this Witness GIN, when she was giving evidence about the two communal policemen on the 29th of June 2005, she said he was also with Ngarambe, a commune policeman and another commune policeman known as Kayibanda.  I wonder if it is a reasonable inference if Witness GIN was telling the truth when she said she had not discussed her evidence with the Prosecution before coming to Arusha.  I wonder if it is reasonable inference in those circumstances, given that the list of names provided to us includes the names of these two communal policemen.  That at the time the Prosecution responded to us in the indictment by saying these two communal policemen were unknown, in fact, that they were known or their names were known, that leads us to this:  Is the witness incorrect in saying that she has discussed her evidence with the Prosecution?  Did she discuss her evidence with the Prosecution, and was it at that time that she gave the names of the two communal policemen, or is the witness telling the truth.  And did the Prosecution not give us the two names that we had asked for and incorrectly stated that they were unknown, that leads me two requests:  The first request through Your Honours to the Prosecution, is for the Prosecution to confirm whether or not they discussed the evidence of Witness GIN with her before she gave evidence in this Court over the last few days when she arrived in Arusha, that is the first request I have.  

And the second request I have brings me back to the memorandum, which we filed on the 8th of June 2005, and that is this:  If it is the position that these two names were in the possession of the Prosecution, but through mistake or otherwise, they stated in the indictment that those two communal policemen were unknown, may we please request the Prosecution to revisit the other two paragraphs in our memorandum which we referred to, paragraph 13 and paragraph 15, where they have also stated that the name of the deputy director of the Kayanga health centre is unknown, and the name of the head of doctors without borders is unknown?  Could they revisit that issue and reconsider whether those two names are, in fact, unknown by the Prosecution.  Unless Your Honours have any questions of clarification, that is the point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  

Ms. Fall.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will rapidly respond.  We are under the impression the Defence wishes the Prosecution to stand as accused.  Yesterday when we answered, we were very clear -- the witness was very clear.  She said that  "I had gone to see her."  Indeed, that is true.  She was asked how long she spent with me and she answered, if I remember correctly, 10 to 15 minutes, which is true because I did not have much time.  

In respect of all the witnesses that I need to see, and unless Mr. Hooper has informants within the prison, I don't see how he could prove that what we are saying is not correct.  I do not wish to justify myself -- justify myself.  We may say that I saw the witness for 10 to 15 minutes, to tell her that she had to come to testify, to wish her welcome by way of mere courtesy, and I did not, at that time, need to review the statement.  I don't think we need to spend excessive time with that witness. 

As to reviewing the indictments, paragraph 12, 13 and 15, you asked whether I could do it quickly.  I said, yes, because, in fact -- indeed, when you read the witness's statement, you'd realise that the names are there; the two names are there, but when we did draft the indictment, with regard to what we were saying, the information that Rwamakuba was accompanied by two communal policemen, we did not have the names of those two communal policemen.  But in the statement it is clear that the two following people who grabbed the two young people, Ngiruwosanga a local inhabitant -- Ngarambe and Kayibanda, were the two communal policemen.  The first was just a local resident.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I don't necessarily want to stop you, you are full of oratory, but as far as the Chamber is concerned at this stage, you don't need to justify yourself.  What we would be interested in really, is the question of the giving of notice concerning the names of the parties, the names of the persons requested.  Is the information available and can it be given to the Accused?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, as I said, the two names that we have are the two names on the record with regard to the communal policemen, Ngarambe and Kayibanda, and I don't need to explain anew why we didn't put them in the indictment.  I explained that we didn't know whether it was the same communal policemen who accompanied Rwamakuba, André; or if they were the ones who had seized the two young men to take them into the little wood, that is why we said we knew that they were communal policemen, but the names had not been given to us and I didn't need to speak of it with the witness.  

Mr. President, it has just been pointed out to me because I am working only with the French version, and in the English version it appears that there is a mistake because those people who were armed --Ngiruwosanga, a local resident, Ngarambe and Kayibanda and two communal policemen, and two communal policemen.  So the names are not given of those two policemen.  I merely want to say, Mr. President, that in all good faith, we did disclose to the Defence all the information in our possession, and if we failed, we couldn't do so, it was because we didn't have in our possession -- the way we are going to do so.  Similarly, for the deputy chief of the Kayanga health centre, to date, at this point in time, I still do not have the name of the deputy director of the Kayanga health centre, in respect for 
paragraph 13.  

Now, as regards paragraph 15, the reference to the person in charge of Médicine sans frontières, we do not possess that information.  The witness spoke of a lady.  We know that it was a lady from MSF, Médecine sans frontiers.  We, for our part, have undertaken investigation to see if we could find that director's name, and it appears that at the time at Butare university hospital, there were several people who had been in charge of Médicine sans frontièrs, but we don't know the exact name at that time of the person in question.  That is the investigation we said to have undertaken, and I wish to reiterate the Prosecution's good faith.  We are not trying to conceal anything, and we provide the information as we get it, as well as that which we already possess.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall.

Mr. O'Shea, does that answer you?
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes.  I just like to indicate that I did not have the intention of putting in doubt Ms. Fall's good faith, and I am sorry if I gave the impression that I did.  If I -- if that was my intention, I would have made it very clear.  I accept that there is a reference in the statement and that's an oversight on my part, but there are two references to communal policemen, it's not -- I think Ms. Fall said this.  It is not entirely clear as to whether -- to what extent they were linked together.  

With regard to paragraph 13 and paragraph 15, it does appear that Witness GIN was not asked the question, because she was not spoken to before she gave evidence.  May I suggest that with regard to those other two names, the Prosecution seek the clarification from their witnesses because the information comes from their witnesses, and the witness can either say I don't know, or I know and this is the name, and then the Prosecution can furnish us with that information.  And I thank Ms. Fall for her clarification.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If that is satisfactory to conclude the issue?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes, except that -- I hope that Ms. Fall notes my specific request, that's the last request.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I do not think it's something the Court should make an order about, but you have made your request, it is noted.  I accept that there isn't anything else that is required to be done at this stage.
MR. O'SHEA:
That's right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I think this -- I presume that this matter is satisfactorily concluded; unless you have anything else you wish to say?  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you call the witness, please?
MS. FALL:
I should merely like to say, Mr. President, that it is my colleague, Mr. Adama Niane who will be handling this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Niane, I would suggest that you address the issue of identification and the formal issues related to the witness now, which will take us up to our mid-morning break -- our adjournment of the day.  We will try to adjourn around 12:00 noon.  Then we can start with the substantive testimony on Monday morning.  
MR. NIANE:
Agreed, Mr. President.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I am sorry, as the witness is brought in, can I just say that there is just a few minutes of a matter that I would like to mention at the close of the session today, just for the record, basically.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are going to give testimony in this trial and the registrar will give you an oath to tell the truth, are you willing to take it?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am ready to swear to the oath -- to take the solemn declaration.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Registrar.  
(Declaration by Witness GAC made in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, can you proceed?  
MR. NIANE:
Good day, Mr. President. 


WITNESS GAC
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Good day, Witness. 
A.	Good day.  
Q.	My name is Adam Niane, and I am entrusted by the Office of the Prosecutor with examination-in-chief of Witness GAV -- sorry, GAC.  

Before beginning the examination-in-chief, I should like, first of all, to confirm your identity.  Inasmuch as we are in open session, and in view of the fact that you are a protected witness, I will be showing you a document -- I was saying inasmuch as we are in open session and you are a protected witness, I will be showing you a document which bears confidential information pertaining to yourself.  You will read it to yourself and tell the Court whether the information that document bears is correct or not.  

Witness, can you read either French or English?  
A.	No.  
Q.	I didn't hear the answer.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The answer was no. 
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, could I request some assistance for the witness to be able to read the document?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Whose assistance do you request?  
MR. NIANE:
A Kinyarwanda interpreter, please.  A Kinyarwanda -- a Rwandese interpreter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) 
MR. NIANE:
A Rwandese interpreter, a Rwanda language interpreter.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is the information that this document bears correct?  
A.	I can confirm that the information is correct. 
Q.	In which case, I would ask you to date the document -- to put today's date on it and to sign it.  
A.	What is today's date?  
Q.	Today's date is the 1st of July 2005.  
A.	It is done. 
Q.	Could you please show this document to the Bench and to the Defence?  
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I would request that this document be placed under seal and entered in evidence. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence under seal.  Yes, Mr. Registrar, exhibit number?  
MR. FRY:
P. 49, Your Honour. 
(Exhibit No. P. 49 admitted, under seal)
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, you said before that we should limit ourselves to the administrative formality; is that still the case? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, but I wasn't quite sure if you have completed -- anything else to do at this stage.  If you have completed, you have completed.  
MR. NIANE:
No, I think that as regards the administrative formalities, everything that needed to be set has been set.  The questions remaining belong to the examination-in-chief proper.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President, sorry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, although you have just been brought to the witness box, we are going to have to end our session today, as it was scheduled to stop at 12:00 noon and we have just passed that hour.  So you will be excused from our session now and you are to return on Monday morning and continue your testimony at 8:45.  During the time you are away from us, you are -- you still have the status of a witness giving testimony, and that means that you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this or any other adjournment of the hearing.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  So you may now be excused and you will return on Monday morning to continue your evidence at 8:45 

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  You may recall that at the very early part of this trial, I think, drawing or following the evidence of Mr. Baghel, the Defence raised or had raised the question of witnesses who had been nominated in witness statements or, in fact, were nominated in the course of witness testimony before this Tribunal, as to whether the Prosecution in respect of such witnesses had approached them or taken a statement from them.  And it was suggested it was a matter that could be dealt with, as it should, perhaps more appropriately between counsel.  And I think it is appropriate that matter -- the position in that matter is reviewed because at present, we provided a list two weeks ago with a list of the names of witnesses who had been so nominated in respect only of at the moment, Gikomero, but we haven't had any response at all in respect of any of those witnesses.  

Now, the significance of this is perhaps best, I think, appropriately demonstrated by one of those named on the list that we included.  That was someone called Augustin Vuningoma.  It was a witness whose name appears, as my recollection serves, in the testimony and the statement of Witness GII.  And Witness GII refers in his statement, and, indeed, as I recall, he also said this in his testimony, that what he said could be backed up by Vuningoma.  Well, Vuningoma's statement -- there is a statement by Augustin Vuningoma.  It was taken, I believe, in 1999.  It has never been served on the Defence and I got it through the back door, that is, I got it handed to me by the Accused in prison.  Where he got it from, I didn't inquire, or whether it was appropriate for him to have it, I didn't inquire.  But what troubled me is that in that statement, Vuningoma makes a very clear and unambiguous statement, and it reads:  "I do not know André Rwamakuba.  I have never seen him."  

Now, I think that highlights and underscores the problem that the Defence are facing here.  First of all, it is quite plain, that is a statement that would fall four squares with the normal rules of material that should be disclosed to the Defence.  It is a Prosecution statement with a Prosecution K-number on it; it's never been disclosed.  Why is it that the Prosecution are unaware of it?  Was is it that if they are aware of it, it has never been disclosed, and it shows or indicates an area of what for us is a profound concern.  

So, the list of names that we have provided are a list of names where we hope the Prosecution and the Defence together, can review the material that is available.  We bear in mind that the electronic disclosures on which, or within which eventually all these materials will be placed, is at an early stage; not all the statements are being placed on it, but the Prosecution do have access to all their statements.  We find it difficult to believe they don't have a matrix of reliable cross-referencing in information that would allow them to discover whether a statement has been taken from a particular nominated person, and in that case, whether it is or capable of forming exculpatory material or more than that or at least, informing the Defence whether such an inquiry was made of that nominated party.  

So that's the concern I raise.  We are at a juncture almost halfway through this relatively short trial.  It's not a matter, in our respectful submission, that can really be the subject of much delay and a failure to properly address this matter may lead ultimately to the possibility of mistrial.  So these are significant matters.  I raise them now as a matter of record.  I don't, at this stage, seek any direction from you, Mr. President, but I think it is appropriate that the matter be urgently reviewed by the Prosecution in the case.  

The other matter, if I can mention, it is a separate and distinct matter.  The last witness, GIN, who has completed her testimony, we believe, in the normal course of events would have provided or being seen by the Prosecution as part of confirmation exercises in the Kamuhanda case, and we feel it is appropriate that the Prosecution should disclose the notes of or any confirmation certificate or any other document that related to that trial, given the nature and subject matter of that trial and its obvious relevance to the present one.  And those are both matters that I seek to raise.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, once again, I do not understand Counsel Hooper's request.  First of all, I will begin with his last point regarding documents in respect of Kamuhanda.  I do not fully understand what he wants us to do for him, and what -- that at all the reconfirmings from Kamuhanda to be disclosed to him.  And concerning the list of names he referred to, once again, Mr. President, I can say -- I must repeat that we have done the maximum in this trial to meet our obligations under Rule 66, as well as under Rule 68. We have done our best to communicate to the Defence all documents in our possession.  It's true that we had to assess the relevance of some statements and whether it fell under Rule 66 or 68 of the Rules.  
(Pages 26 to 39 by Sithembiso Moyo)







1217H 
MS. FALL:
I will not speak at great length.  But, what I seem to understand, for my part, is that Counsel Hooper would like, and it's not the first time he has said so, that we undertake investigations in his stead and we do not feel that it is an appropriate role for the Prosecution. 

To date, we have communicated all the documents; our case manager can give further details on that score. I do not understand the requests very well.  It's true that we are not halfway through but nearly at the end of the testimony to be given in this trial.  

Counsel Hooper, for his part, had promised that -- to file and in the context of mutual exchanges, certain documents and we have, to date, received practically nothing.  And in respect of his requests, I think the Prosecution has done, it's utmost to meet its obligations and, once again, I do not see what Counsel Hooper is driving at. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, the issue of disclosure is a matter which the Chamber is interested in because we feel that it affects the integrity of the trial process. 

Now, what I understood is that -- that during the testimony of a certain witness a specific request was given to the Prosecutor with regards to statements made by specific persons and -- and that is what I understood from Mr. Hooper.  And that he has not yet received responses from the Prosecutor in relation to that request.  I -- I don't know if I've understood you properly?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, exactly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So basically he was asking that the requests, which he considers to be legitimate, should be addressed as a matter of urgency. 

And the second request he made was for the -- which arose in the cross-examination of Witness GIN -- the issue of notes of interviews or statements made by the Witness GIN, when she was preparing for testimony in the Kamuhanda trial.  Those are the two areas of requests which I thought he referred to. 

And he was asking that they be addressed as quickly as possible.  So that is how I understand the -- the requests as they have been put forward.  They're both matters which I think should engage the Prosecutor's interests and attention. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, that is, indeed, what I understood and we responded that we are also highly concerned to respect our obligations under the Rules.  We did disclose, to date, everything in our possession.  It must be recognised that the efforts we make are perhaps not seen, but we are overburdened.  We do our utmost and each time we possess -- we come -- a document comes into our possession that should be disclosed to the Defence, we do so. 

I don't know if you've seen the list of all the names mentioned by Counsel Hooper.  We will go through it, analyse it and each time we consider that we have -- there is an obligation incumbent upon us with regard to disclosure, we shall comply.  So we will go on with this analysis, but I confirm to you that we have to date disclosed everything in our possession. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you for that.  Thank you for that assurance. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper, does that satisfactorily conclude this issue, at least, for now? 
MR. HOOPER:
It concludes the issue for now, but not in a satisfactory way.  I heard nothing there to indicate that any of the names on that list had exercised the Prosecution one jot in terms of any review.  And they -- it doesn't explain, for example, and the matter hasn't been addressed, which was only an example of how that one statement, for example, has never been served. 

So I hope it's more than just window dressing this morning or this afternoon and that the Prosecution will be exercised and concerned about the matters that have been raised, and that we will have a response, I hope, shortly in respect of the names of the people on the list as to whether they've given or provided a statement at all. 

That was the issue -- the initial issue.  The disclosure matter was a -- was a secondary matter.  So I've nothing to add and I don't invite any further comment from the Bench in any way, of course. 
MS. FALL:
May it please the Court.  

I merely wish to add that we are not in the habit of speaking loosely.  We will continue our review.  I think that every time we had to disclose served documents on Counsel Hooper, even when he already had the documents and came in and said that he had not received them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think, we should -- we should for our part, we should indicate that we take the issues of disclosure seriously because we think it's very important to protect the integrity of the trial.  

Now, obviously, we have to rely on you and we invite you to take the issue seriously and to give it your best attention at this stage. 

Yes, I think that we have now come to the end of our session today and we can take the adjournment until Monday morning at 8:45.
