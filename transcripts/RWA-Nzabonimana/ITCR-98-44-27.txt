         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the registry introduce the matter coming before the 

         4        Trial Chamber this morning, please?

         5   MR. KIYEYEU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 

         6        the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed 

         7        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, 

         8        Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and 

         9        Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, 

        10        today, Monday, the 16th of September 2002, for the 

        11        commencement of the Defence Case in the matter of the 

        12        Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, 

        13        Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  

        14        

        15        Thank you, Mr. President.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu, for the registry. 

        17        

        18        May we have the appearance for the parties, starting 

        19        with the Prosecution, if we may, please?

        20   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.  I am Ken Fleming, 

        21        senior trial attorney.  I appear with Ms. Ojemeni, trial 

        22        attorney and Ms. Dorothée Marotine, case manager.  

        23        Thank you.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Learned Counsel. May we also have 

        25        the appearance of the Defence, please?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Good morning, Your Honours, Lennox Hinds 

        27        representing Mr. Kajelijeli, and I am assisted by 

        28        Professor Bompaka, Mr. Emilien Dusabe, my assistant, 

        29        Ms. Juliette Chinaud. 

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, learned Counsel.

         1        Yes.  Perhaps, we have a little housekeeping issue that 

         2        we would like to address immediately and that is that we 

         3        would be starting our proceedings every morning at 9:00 

         4        o'clock instead of 9:30 a.m.  9:00 o'clock, instead of 

         5        9:30 am.  This is what we have been doing in other 

         6        cases, and that being that we start at 9:00, we go on up 

         7        to up to 1:00 with a break at 11:00 fifteen minutes, 

         8        resume at about 11:15 and go on to 1:00, and then we 

         9        have a lunch break for one and half hours and resume our 

        10        afternoon session at 2:30 and go on to about 5:30.  We 

        11        will work as usual from Monday to Thursday.  Unless 

        12        there are compelling reasons, we will still keep Friday 

        13        out so as to deal with other issues, particularly, 

        14        address issues of motions and other things, but when the 

        15        situation demands, we can always come to see what we can 

        16        do on Friday as well.  Okay.  

        17        

        18        Today is set for the beginning of the Defence case in 

        19        terms of Rule 84 of our Rules of Procedure.  I don't 

        20        know whether Professor Hinds -- do you have any 

        21        statements to make before you begin your defence case?  

        22        We noticed from the record that, you have filed -- if 

        23        that is the position of your statement at the opening of 

        24        the Prosecution case.  That is what we see from the 

        25        record.  

        26        

        27        But I see -- Mr. Fleming, please?

        28   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours, my learned friend made an 

        29        opening statement, in fact.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  Oh, yes, he did?

         1   MR. FLEMING: On the 4th of July 2001, pages 54 to 78 of that 

         2        day.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.

         4   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honours, we also have provisional issue we 

         5        want to raise with you in respect of the provision of 

         6        material by our learned friends.  

         7        

         8        Your Honours, on the 3rd of April 2001 --

         9   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Mr. President, Your microphone, 

        10        please.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: On the 3rd April -- please go on?

        12   MR. FLEMING:  -- made the order in respect of protective 

        13        measures for Defence witnesses.  By paragraph, 21, 20 -- 

        14        sorry, 19 and 20, Your Honours, we looked at the merits 

        15        of the measures requested by our learned friends.  

        16        

        17        Paragraph 20, says this as regards Measure H, the 

        18        Chamber considers the measure to be a normal measure 

        19        that the potential Defence witnesses remain anonymous.   

        20        

        21        As regards disclosure of unredacted statements for the 

        22        defence, the Chamber recalls the Tribunal's 

        23        jurisprudence, according to which disclosure should be 

        24        at least 21 days prior to the day in which the witness 

        25        is to testify at trial.  

        26        

        27        Accordingly, the Chamber grants measure H with 

        28        modifications while replacing the phrase, "Sooner than 

        29        60 days before the commencement of trial," with the 

        30        phrase, "At least 21 days prior to the day in which the

         1        witness is to testify  at trail.  

         2        

         3        That is, Your Honours, the reason the orders then 

         4        referred to various paragraphs of the motion and in 

         5        respect of H, it basically grants Measure H with 

         6        modifications to the effect that disclosure to the 

         7        Prosecutor, of the names, addresses, whereabouts and any 

         8        other identifying data which would reveal the identities 

         9        of victims or potential witnesses, and any information 

        10        in the supporting material on file with the registry is 

        11        prohibited until such time as the Trial Chamber is 

        12        assured that the witnesses have been afforded an 

        13        adequate mechanism for protection and allowing the 

        14        defence to disclose any materials provided to the 

        15        Prosecutor in redacted form, until such mechanism is in 

        16        place.  And in any event, that the Defence is required 

        17        to reveal the identifying data to the Prosecutor at 

        18        least 21 days prior to the day in which the witness is 

        19        to testify at trial, unless there is an alternative.

        20        

        21        The problem that we face is that our learned friends 

        22        have not provided a single piece of paper, except for 

        23        the names and the addresses and so on in respect of the 

        24        first seven witnesses that they intend to call.  We have 

        25        no redacted nor unredacted statements in respect of 

        26        those witnesses.  

        27        

        28        The second proposition is, that apparently on the 6th of 

        29        September, some time around 2:00 o'clock, which is, of 

        30        course, the end of business in this Tribunal, there was 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        4


                  KAJELIJELI                             16 SEPTEMBER 2002




         1        an alleged attempt to serve unredacted material upon on 

         2        the Office of the Prosecutor.  It is said that I 

         3        couldn't contact anybody.  Well, I for one, was on the 

         4        floor in the Prosecutor's Office until somewhat later 

         5        than that.  As is the want of many in her office, so we 

         6        didn't get any other unredacted statements from them in 

         7        respect of the subsequent witnesses until some time 

         8        after that.  

         9        

        10        The third proposition is that our learned friends are 

        11        highjacking this process.  What our learned friends have 

        12        done is to send us a letter saying they are going to 

        13        call four witnesses this week -- four witnesses -- next 

        14        week, and so on.  On that basis, they have given 

        15        disclosure of unredacted statements according to their 

        16        schedule of how this Court is going to be run.  And with 

        17        great respect, we think that is entirely inappropriate.  

        18        So, our situation is this, we have nothing except the 

        19        names and addresses of the -- what they call the alibi 

        20        witnesses.  We have unredacted statements in respect of 

        21        the then next tranche of witnesses based upon their 

        22        programme, and their estimate of what 21 days is.  

        23        

        24        What our learned friends are doing is; they are flying 

        25        loose and fast in respect of what Your Honours have 

        26        directed them to do.  Now, I don't expect help from the 

        27        Defence, not at all.  They are entitled to take every 

        28        technical point that they can in their client's favour.  

        29        However, we are also entitled to compliance in 

        30        accordance to rules.  So as we start today, I don't have

         1        the slightest idea of what my learned friend's six 

         2        witnesses -- first six witnesses are going to say -- not 

         3        the slightest idea.  

         4        

         5        Now, it is true that we have interviewed -- I think, 

         6        three of those witnesses.  The other three witnesses 

         7        come from further afield than this continent.  Perhaps 

         8        our learned friend is of the view that since we have 

         9        interviewed him, he has no obligation to give us this 

        10        material.  That, of course, would be a facile argument 

        11        because what we do, doesn't in any way whatsoever affect 

        12        his obligations to provide disclosure.

        13        

        14        Perhaps our learned is going to argue that.

        15        Your Honours might recall, in respect of alibi 

        16        witnesses, what our learned friends already have argued 

        17        that they did not have to give us 90 days anyway and we 

        18        had to flush that out.

        19        

        20        Perhaps they are going to argue that the latter part of 

        21        the order in respect of Paragraph H, and in any event, 

        22        that the Defence is required to reveal the identifying 

        23        data to the Prosecutor at least 21 days prior to the day 

        24        and so on, means that they only have to provide 

        25        identifying material.  But that makes a complete 

        26        nonsense of the balance of Your Honours' order.

        27        

        28        Now, Your Honours, we are not going to delay this trial.  

        29        However, we wouldn't mind even now getting some proof of 

        30        what our learned friends are going to call for the first

         1        six witnesses.  I have no intention of asking this Court 

         2        for adjournment.  We will get straight into it, but I 

         3        wouldn't mind knowing that they are going to actually 

         4        say, at least, five minutes in advance and, perhaps, on 

         5        our learned friends' programme as well, I will have the 

         6        material from the next five witnesses, at least, a week 

         7        or so in advance for some of them.

         8        So, we ask that we be granted that material upon which 

         9        my learned friend is -- my learned friends' witnesses 

        10        are going to give evidence.  Thank you, Your Honours. 

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Fleming.  Professor Hinds?

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honours, before we proceed to respond 

        13        to Mr. Fleming's statements  -- I would like to make an 

        14        application to the court, that Mr. Bangwana, who is in 

        15        the public sector be allowed to assist us.  As you know 

        16        in the past he has assisted us and he is our 

        17        investigator.  We are making this application -- I had 

        18        meant to do that first but Mr. Fleming took the floor 

        19        and so, therefore, I could not, just as the first matter 

        20        in terms of the completion of our term.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: What do you mean, he has always been inside or 

        22        what?

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: He has always been here with us but there 

        24        has to be a special application and the Court in the 

        25        past has granted it -- Mr. Baragahoranye, Juvénal 

        26        Baragahoranye.

        27   MR. KIYEYEU:  It is true, My Lords, Mr. Baragahoranye was 

        28        sitting in the courtroom before but there were some  

        29        orders in other Chambers which restricted that and that 

        30        was followed by the security as a general blanket for

         1        all the Chambers that is why now special applications 

         2        have to be made in that respect.  Thank you, My Lords.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: In other words, he came in today as he 

         4        normally would, but the security said that he couldn't 

         5        and we had to make an application to the court, but in 

         6        this proceeding --

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: 

         8        Any way, we shall come back to that.  Let's deal with 

         9        the essential issue first with regard to what 

        10        Mr. Fleming has said.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, I think that we have complied 

        12        not only in the spirit, but the letter of your order.  

        13        In our response to the Prosecutor's motion, we laid out 

        14        in great detail what we have done.  The Prosecutor, 

        15        says, or Mr. Fleming, for that matter, says he does not 

        16        have the slightest idea of what our witness as are going 

        17        to say.  First of all, pursuant to this Court's order, 

        18        when we, in fact, in July, were provided -- I am sorry, 

        19        in April provided our 73 ter motion, we said that at the 

        20        end towards the end of June, that we would supply the 

        21        Prosecutor with the names, pseudonym names, of all of 

        22        our witnesses that we intended to call.  

        23        Furthermore, we would provide a summary with respect to 

        24        what each of them would say.  

        25        

        26        Third we would provide the particular paragraphs of the 

        27        indictment and the charges that they would, in fact, 

        28        address. 

        29        

        30        And fourthly, even though it was not required, we

         1        indicated to the Prosecution witnesses those who would 

         2        be confidential.  Now, we provided that to Mr. Fleming, 

         3        with all witnesses including our alibi witnesses.  But 

         4        prior to that over a year ago, we, in fact, indicated to 

         5        the Prosecutor pursuant to Rule 67, what we intended to 

         6        proceed with respect to the evidence that we would be 

         7        adducing with respect to alibi.  We provided at that 

         8        time, first the pseudonyms, and once particular 

         9        provisions were in place, we disclosed the identity and 

        10        the particulars in terms of addresses of those 

        11        witnesses.  We made those witnesses available.  We made 

        12        them available during the spring.  The Prosecutor, for 

        13        time constraints, and other constraints -- 

        14        administrative constraints -- elected to interview 

        15        witnesses in Africa as opposed to witnesses in Europe.  

        16        They indicated that there were time constraints and they 

        17        could get approvals in the time that we indicated were 

        18        available.  That was about March.  They proceeded, they 

        19        interviewed witnesses in Nairobi and in Kigali.  They 

        20        took taped oral recordings with respect to witnesses.  

        21        We made no interference with them.  We only requested 

        22        that they give us copies of the tapes of our witnesses.  

        23        They never complied, and we are not making a big to do 

        24        about it.  

        25        

        26        We then were back on July the 3rd of this year, served 

        27        to the Prosecutor, and now I was travelling through 

        28        Africa, and I was sick, even hospitalised here in 

        29        Arusha.  My position was that I would not delay this 

        30        trial one day, not even from my sick bed.  I

         1        travelled -- sick, fevers, diarrhoea and so on through 

         2        the various countries to interview our witnesses, sent a 

         3        letter to the Prosecutor that I was prepared to travel 

         4        after travelling through seven countries in Africa, that 

         5        I would travel to Europe to accommodate them in terms of 

         6        their access to the very witnesses they are complaining 

         7        about.  They wrote back or they communicated to the team 

         8        that they could not be available in the first week of 

         9        August, we gave them a month.  

        10        

        11        Now, the spirit and intent of the Rules as I understand 

        12        it, with respect to not only to alibi witnesses but to 

        13        all the witnesses, is that to the extent that the 

        14        Defence has statements of these witnesses in our 

        15        possession, that we are obligated to provide it to them, 

        16        first in unredacted form and then, first in redacted 

        17        form, and then unredacted form within 21 days.  The 

        18        statements that we have of our witnesses, we have 

        19        complied.  We are holding nothing back with respect to 

        20        the alibi witnesses.  We took no statements of any 

        21        witnesses, not a single statement that we took of an 

        22        alibi witness, but more important then that they had 

        23        access to the witnesses.  They talked eight hours -- 

        24        eight hours of tape recordings of one witness, 12 hours 

        25        of tape recordings with respect to the other witnesses.  

        26        We don't have the tape-recordings, they have them.  Now,  

        27        either Mr. Fleming is not listening to the tapes, that 

        28        as far as me, or he is not reading the pre-trial briefs 

        29        that we submitted, but there are summaries there, for 

        30        him to stand up here and say he doesn't have a clue,

         1        means that either he is not listening or reading.  

         2        The fact of the matter is that we presented all of the 

         3        information.  There are no surprises here with respect 

         4        to the first witness.  If you look at our pre-trial 

         5        brief, we said what the man is going to say.  We have 

         6        disclosed his identity and so, not only have we complied 

         7        with the spirit, we have complied, particularly, with 

         8        the letter of the order.  

         9        And I think the summary substance of their arguments 

        10        that they have made, this Court already ruled on it.  

        11        That is my submission, Your Honour.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, thank you, Learned Counsel. 

        13        Mr. Fleming?

        14   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours. Obfuscation, that is 

        15        all my learned friend has practised. 

        16   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  Microphone, please.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: I object to that type of character.  It is 

        18        improper and uncalled for.  We should not be, in fact, 

        19        try to denigrate, in any way.  If my learned friend 

        20        wants to indicate that I had omissions on my part, I 

        21        will accept that.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, that's noted.  Mr. Fleming?

        23   MR. FLEMING: Obfuscation, that is what my learned friend has 

        24        just practised, because he avoided the principle issues.  

        25        Of course, he has responsibility under 73 ter.  That 

        26        responsibility is entirely different to his 

        27        responsibility under the orders of this Court.  Now, can 

        28        we just analyse for a moment what our learned friend has 

        29        just said.  He said he has provided us with a summary of 

        30        what this witness, the first witness, let's take that as 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        an example, is going to say.  But then he tells 

         2        Your Honours that he has no proof of what that witness 

         3        is going to say.  Did he make it up when he put it up in 

         4        the summary or does he actually have a statement from 

         5        these witnesses that he is disclosing to the Court?  If 

         6        he can provide it by way of summary of what they are 

         7        going to say, we are entitled to the unredacted 

         8        statement that has been taken from him.   

         9        

        10        Now, Your Honours, whatever, we have done, as I said 

        11        before, is entirely irrelevant to our learned friend's 

        12        obligation.  Is it true as I have said at the outset, 

        13        that we have interviewed three of those witnesses, but 

        14        that doesn't answer his obligations to the Trial Chamber 

        15        or to the Prosecution.  He has an obligation to produce, 

        16        pursuant to this order as he readily concedes, 

        17        unredacted statements 21 days before.  What he says is 

        18        in respect of six alibi witnesses.  His evidence, he 

        19        can -- summarises in the 73 ter document.  He has no 

        20        statement.  We find that surprising and perhaps it will 

        21        become obvious, whether he is working from a script or 

        22        something, when the witness is in the box.  But 

        23        nevertheless, on the one hand, he says we have a summary 

        24        of what they are going to say and on the other hand he 

        25        says he has no statement.  

        26        

        27        With the greatest respect, we submit his obligations 

        28        have nothing to do with our obligations or what we have 

        29        or haven't done.  His obligations are to produce 

        30        statements from the witnesses from whom he has taken 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        statements, and if he can provide a summary of what the 

         2        witness is going to say, he can certainly provide a 

         3        summary of what they are going to say.  

         4        

         5        So, Your Honours, My learned friend, in my submission, 

         6        deliberately attempted to put it back upon the 

         7        Prosecution, when all we asked for is a compliance, not 

         8        with 73 ter, we haven't complained about that.  We are 

         9        asking for compliance of the order that Your Honours 

        10        made on the 3rd of April 2001.

        11        Thank you, Your Honours.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Fleming. 

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: May I, Your Honour?

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, you are responding to Mr. Fleming, we 

        15        have heard you, Professor Hinds, you don't need to.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS:   Your Honour, because I just wonder -- I am 

        17        a little confused so that I just want to be very clear.  

        18        Is Mr. Fleming saying that we have an -- I have an 

        19        obligation to turn over my notes in terms of attorney 

        20        work practice, is that what he is saying?  That I have 

        21        to turn over notes?   That I don't understand that to 

        22        be, the rule.  The rule is that if we have a statement 

        23        from one witness, we have an obligation to turn it over.  

        24        Those witnesses with whom we have statements, we have 

        25        turned them over.

        26   MR. FLEMING:  There, we are getting to the substance of the 

        27        matter.  What my learned friend thinks is, because he 

        28        takes the notes, he has no obligation to turn them over.  

        29        The witness can come and give evidence according to the 

        30        notes he has taken and we have no right to know what the

         1        witness is going to say.  With the greatest respect, 

         2        that really is what he wants, to hide behind -- what he 

         3        thinks are technical rules, but, of course, it is not a 

         4        rule of that form at all.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Fleming, don't you think there's a 

         6        difference between knowing what a witness is going to 

         7        say and the provision of a statement?

         8   MR. FLEMING:  Yes, there is, Your Honour.  That is the basic 

         9        point that we make, that is the basic point that we make 

        10        and that is our complaint.  We have a summary, we don't 

        11        have a statement of what he is going to say or she is 

        12        going to say and my learned friend now hides behind his 

        13        notes.  In fact, you see, he has a problem, even if he 

        14        wants to use the technical rule, because by making a 

        15        summary of them, he has already waived the privilege 

        16        which might belong to him if he ever had that privilege.  

        17        So, he has an obligation to produce the material.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We have taken note of the submissions of 

        19        the parties, and we will consider this case and we 

        20        appreciate that the Prosecution is willing and ready to 

        21        proceed with this matter from the Defence side.  

        22        

        23        It is  true that the issue of statements from the 

        24        Defence could be contentious.  It could be the issue 

        25        that is contentious but we take note that the Defence 

        26        has given, in terms of Rule 73 ter, the summaries of the 

        27        witnesses they wish to call and they will continue to 

        28        provide statements that they have available to the 

        29        Defence -- to the Prosecution and as we have watched in 

        30        our previous decision, in a timely manner, so that the

         1        Prosecution may prepare itself to handle the case in 

         2        Court.  

         3        

         4        But where there are no statements the Defence cannot be 

         5        forced to take statements.  And so we can urge the 

         6        Defence where the statements are available to make them 

         7        available to the Prosecution in a timely manner.  That 

         8        is the furthest we can go on this matter at the 

         9        particular time.  Yes? 

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  Prior to the court 

        11        granting us an audience to discuss this matter, I had 

        12        made an application with respect to our investigator who 

        13        is sitting in the public gallery --

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can we defer that matter, Professor Hinds and 

        15        we start with the case and we will come back to it later 

        16        when we would have known exactly what is happening on 

        17        the ground, please? 

        18   MR. HINDS: Your Honour, we had --can I have the 

        19        September 6 --

        20   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, can I ask a couple of questions to 

        21        my learned friend as well?  I take it that he is not 

        22        calling the Accused Kajelijeli, because I don't see him 

        23        listed anywhere.  If he is going to call the Accused 

        24        then perhaps there should be a discussion as on that 

        25        topic, as to when that should be done.  And the other 

        26        person with whom there is an application is Nzirorera, 

        27        we would like to have some clarity as to when Nzirorera 

        28        might be coming, whether it's just date setting or 

        29        whether our learned friend is going to delay that to 

        30        another time.

         1        But our principal concern, and I certainly come from a 

         2        jurisdiction where the Accused is always called first, I 

         3        know that is not the case everywhere, but at least can 

         4        we have some clarification on that.   Thank you.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  Professor Hinds?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That is a point well taken.  And that is an 

         7        omission on my part.  With respect to the pre-trial 

         8        brief, we certainly intend to call Mr. Kajelijeli and he 

         9        will be our last witness.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: He will be your first witness. 

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: The final witness in this matter, 

        12        Your Honour.  There is an application we would like to 

        13        make with respect to the order of the witnesses.  I 

        14        tried to speak to Mr. Fleming and Ms. Ojemeni --

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you hold on for a minute, Professor Hinds?  

        16        Did you want to develop that matter further now that you 

        17        have known the accused will testify on his behalf as the 

        18        last witness?

        19   MR. FLEMING:  Yes, I would like to develop that, Your Honour.  

        20        That, of course, gives the accused the opportunity of  

        21        hearing the word, they say, and coming at the end and 

        22        adopting the most favourable arguments on his behalf.  

        23        Now, I understand, and, as I said that the practices 

        24        differ.  One could take civil law and please, Madam -- 

        25        Judge, forgive me if I don't understand this but in 

        26        civil law, the accused seems to me to be the first 

        27        witness who has to come and explain himself.  I know 

        28        that the practice isn't consistent in all of the common 

        29        law countries but nevertheless for the purity of the 

        30        evidence it is normal and certainly in my jurisdiction 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        and my jurisdiction is derived from the English Common 

         2        Law system, it is normal that an accused be called first 

         3        to avoid the complications of the purity of the 

         4        evidence.  We would be urging that Mr. Kajelijeli be in 

         5        the box first.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:  Well, this matter has been on for quite some 

         7        time.  It is true, there are different practices and 

         8        different experiences to all of us from whatever we come 

         9        from, but it would appear here that the accused has that 

        10        choice.  There were even some attempts a few weeks ago  

        11        to regularise this, not to regularise as to where, 

        12        because this is regular, to put in place what you are 

        13        saying, but you know it was not even possible.  That 

        14        choice is available to the Accused person.  Some do make 

        15        the  choice as in the previous case this Chamber has 

        16        seen -- was that the accused decided to testify as the 

        17        first witness.  That is the choice that is available to 

        18        the accused person.

        19        

        20        Yes, Professor Hinds?

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, Your Honour, prior to us commencing 

        22        this morning, we tried to discuss a just procedural 

        23        matter with Mr. Fleming and Ms. Ojemeni concerning the 

        24        order of our witnesses and Mr. Fleming indicated that he 

        25        was not in a position then to entertain the proposal we 

        26        had made.  

        27        

        28        On coming to Arusha and arriving here Friday night, we 

        29        had an occasion to meet with the witnesses who were here 

        30        from Europe and indicated -- three of them indicated to 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        me they had serious time constraints and therefore the 

         2        second witness whom we intended to call, we would like 

         3        him to be shifted to the third witness and the third 

         4        witness to the second witness.  This is a simple matter.

         5        

         6        I didn't want to trouble the Court with this 

         7        application, and I wanted to see if there would be no 

         8        objections from Mr. Fleming, and he indicated at that 

         9        time that he was not in a position to entertain the 

        10        request as I understand the third witness on our list  

        11        must travel to the United States, he has a plane ticket 

        12        and so on and has to leave here by Wednesday.  I 

        13        anticipate our witnesses, all will take a day depending 

        14        upon our examinations, we are going to be sticking 

        15        fairly strictly to what we have submitted in our 

        16        Pre-trial.  So, therefore, we want to try and have those 

        17        witnesses in and out. 

        18        

        19        I just want to raise one point, Your Honour, with 

        20        respect to witnesses' schedule for the week of the 22nd 

        21        and 23rd, and the week of the 30th.  Those are witnesses 

        22        who are detained witnesses in Rwanda.  We now have here 

        23        in Tanzania a total of about ten witness.  The problem 

        24        is that the witnesses we had planned to call after the 

        25        alibi witnesses and  Mr. Nzirorera, are not here.  The 

        26        Rwandese authorities have not made them available at 

        27        this moment. I am told they are expected momentarily.  

        28        Those are detained witnesses.  

        29        

        30        If those witnesses are not here by the 26th then, the 21 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        days in terms of disclosure of the identities and 

         2        unredacted statements of the other witnesses from Rwanda 

         3        that Prosecution now has in their possession, they would 

         4        not -- although the witnesses are here, they would not 

         5        be able to testify before October 1st.  It means we will 

         6        miss three days.  Be ready.  But part of the witness are 

         7        on, but there would be a technical situation that the 

         8        26th, the 27th and the 30th those were the 21 days would 

         9        not have been met with respect to those witnesses.  But 

        10        we do have -- the Prosecution does have the unredacted 

        11        statements and the identities of the detained witnesses 

        12        who right now are not here.  So, we do not want to delay 

        13        these proceedings at all at this stage, we have ten 

        14        witnesses ready to go and there are four more from 

        15        Rwanda who are detained witnesses and were not sure 

        16        exactly when they will show up.  So, I just wanted to 

        17        bring that to the Court's attention.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  But as we said in our decision that was 

        19        issued last, that you should -- the defence should try 

        20        as much as possible to see to it that disclosures are 

        21        made in a timely manner so that these constraints do not 

        22        arise.  We would like to see this trial go on as 

        23        smoothly as possible with as little as possible any 

        24        hitches that can happen here.  So, we would like to see 

        25        that you two, the two sides really cooperate and work 

        26        out as you have always done to see that these problems 

        27        are discussed and resolved and see how best they can, 

        28        you know -- you know things can be done to assist the 

        29        trial to move forward.

         1        Now, can we come to the specifics before Mr. Fleming 

         2        comes in.  You have raised an oral motion with regard to 

         3        the order of the appearances of the witnesses.  We 

         4        gather from your submissions, Professor Hinds, that the 

         5        first witness is not affected?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS:  He is not affected at all.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: The second witness you plan to call in, is he 

         8        affected? 

         9   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Microphone?

        10   MR. KIYEYEU:  I am sorry, My Lords, counsel is speaking 

        11        without the light therefore the record will be silent on 

        12        that.  No, no it wasn't on until.

        13   PROFESSOR HANDS:  Your Honour, the second witness, JK27 will 

        14        now become the third witness and the third witness we 

        15        will now call second.  We are just switching.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay  on that one, Mr. Fleming, what do you 

        17        say to that?

        18   MR. FLEMING:  We have no objection, Your Honour I won't be 

        19        taking any points like that to my learned friend.  I am 

        20        continually troubled by my learned friend's insistence 

        21        that instead of giving us the witness statements three 

        22        days early, he gives them three days late.  It seems to 

        23        me that it would make much more sense to give us all the 

        24        statements in respect to the present settings and we get 

        25        on with it.  The order does say that at least 21 days, 

        26        but he is reading very strictly, he will give it to us  

        27        on the 21st day and in some instances later than that.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  I think that one has been made understood, 

        29        yes.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I don't want to trouble the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        Chamber too much.  We are dealing with witnesses who are 

         2        in Rwanda.  I mean these are not any witnesses at any 

         3        place out.  These are witnesses whom we have to put 

         4        protective measures in place before we can make any 

         5        disclosures.  I mean these are witnesses who are fearful 

         6        for their lives and  families.  The Prosecution knows 

         7        the problems in Rwanda, they have their own problems 

         8        with witnesses.  We have limited resources compared to 

         9        them.  So, therefore, we make these disclosures once 

        10        victim and witness protection were able to put certain 

        11        things in place.  

        12        

        13        Now, I have as lead counsel here, attempted in every 

        14        single way at great sacrifice to myself to make sure 

        15        that there are no delays.  We have our witnesses, we are 

        16        ready to go. 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: All right, we reiterate that things should be 

        18        done in a timely manner taking into account those 

        19        difficulties than can arise.  On the Nzirorera motion,  

        20        I think we will check on that one and see how far the 

        21        pleadings have gone, in order to have it completed as 

        22        soon as possible.

        23   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honours, we don't in principle object to 

        24        that, there might be some technical issues for an 

        25        example, representation and those sorts of things which 

        26        will have to be addressed at some time.  That is all, 

        27        but in principle, we don't object to it.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  That is good.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, Mr. Nzirorera is scheduled to 

        30        testify next week if we move along.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS:  So this is not a matter that is way in the 

         3        future.  He will be the seventh witness who will testify 

         4        that we intend to call.  The Prosecution have no notice 

         5        on that.  I think that Mr. Nzirorera's lawyer has made 

         6        an application with respect to be present and I don't 

         7        know if there has been a ruling on it but we certainly 

         8        are making whether at this point indicated to the Court 

         9        that we are making an oral motion for an in limine with 

        10        respect to Mr. Nzirorera's testimony, if you want to 

        11        hear me on that I am prepared to deal with that.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  We will deal with that one and having head 

        13        the prosecution on this issue we will go and check and 

        14        see how far the pleading have gone and who are the other 

        15        parties that are involved.  All right, Professor Hinds, 

        16        we will now start with the defence case.  Who is your 

        17        first witness?

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, the Defence calls 

        19        Witness JK213.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: JK?

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS:  JK312.  JK312 is a protected witness. 

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. Professor Hinds, rather complicated 

        23        numbers, why?

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: You say they are complicated?

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Or maybe long, well we will take notice, there 

        26        is no problem with that. We just wanted to -- 

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, please, can you bring in the witness?  It 

        29        has taken him long.  Yes, Registry, could you please 

        30        swear the witness?

         1   MR. KIYEYEU:  I am sorry, My Lord, maybe if we can be 

         2        informed whether he would need the assistance of an 

         3        interpreter, if we can hear that from the Defence.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, will the witness need the 

         5        assistance of an interpreter or he speaks French?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think the Court may make an enquiry with 

         7        respect to what language he would prefer to speak.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right.  Could you ask the witness in 

         9        which language he could like to give his testimony.

        10   MR. FLEMING: In Kinyarwanda, the interpreters are actually in 

        11        the booth so there will be simultaneous translation 

        12        anyway.

        13   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  No, there is no simultaneous 

        14        translation from Kinyarwanda.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Sorry.

        16   MR. KIYEYEU: My Lord, the witness says he speaks French and 

        17        there will be no problem.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  Sorry?

        19   MR. KIYEYEU: The witness says he would speak in French then 

        20        there will be no problem.  He will testify in French 

        21        then there will be no problem. 

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay, can you swear him?  Can you make him 

        23        swear the solemn declaration, please.  I know then -- 

        24        let him stand up and make the solemn declaration.

        25        (Declaration made in French by Witness JK312)

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Witness, you have just made a solemn 

        27        declaration. In case you are not familiar with how your 

        28        evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few 

        29        essential things before you begin your testimony.  You 

        30        will be led in your evidence-in-chief by the Defence who

         2        questions will be put to you in cross-examination by the 

         3        Prosecution who are seated on this side of the 

         4        courtroom.  The Judges who are sitting in front of you 

         5        may also ask questions to clarify your evidence if they 

         6        have such questions to ask you.  If a question put to 

         7        you is not clear or you do not understand it, please say 

         8        so and it shall be repeated or explained.  These are the

         1        1030H

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds? 

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we will be proceeding with the 

         4        first part of this witness' testimony in closed session 

         5        because of information that we believe would disclose 

         6        his identity.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Fleming?  Any objection?

         8             

         9        I'm asking, any objection to that procedure being 

        10        adopted for the reasons given? 

        11   MR. FLEMING: I don't know what the reasons are.  He simply 

        12        said they could disclose his identity.  I know nothing 

        13        more about it, obviously, than that.  But we are not 

        14        going to take any point on the manner in which my 

        15        learned friends want to proceed.  Of course, it's a 

        16        matter for Your Honours, rather than my friend.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: You don't have the document that we have been 

        18        using previously? 

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: I have a document.  The witness speaks 

        20        French.  In order to, in fact, adduce from him the 

        21        information which would be Exhibit 14 for the Defence, I 

        22        would have to examine him in English, and for it to be 

        23        translated.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: No, no, no.  What you can do, what we have 

        25        been doing here to shorten the procedure is make the 

        26        document available to the witness and ask him whether 

        27        the details indicated on that document with regard --

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: I beg your pardon? 

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: And give the document to the witness and ask 

        30        him whether the particulars set out in that document

         1        with regard to his -- what it says, whether it's correct 

         2        or not.  If it is correct, it can be formally tendered 

         3        into the proceedings as an exhibit, of course, after it 

         4        has been shown to the Prosecution in this case.  That's 

         5        all.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness speaks French.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: And the document?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS:  English.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Oh, I see. 

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is why I am making the proposal.  Now 

        11        he may be able to read English, and I am prepared to do 

        12        that, but he says he speaks French.

        13   MR. KIYEYEU: My Lord, if I can suggest something.  If we can 

        14        call the English translator, he comes here, then he will 

        15        exchange the --

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Translate the document into -- read the 

        17        document in French and that would, you know, be done 

        18        within a short time, then it can be formally entered and 

        19        then we move on from there.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: The first set of questions I am going ask 

        21        the witness, I am prepared to put it to him, but I know 

        22        that his response is going to be that he is afraid that 

        23        it would disclose his identity.  It relates to 

        24        information about when he went to school, and so on and 

        25        so forth.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Beyond what is contained in the document? 

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Beyond what is contained in the document.  

        28        It speaks of his primary school education, and, 

        29        secondary school education, and so on.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  We will go into a closed session

         1        for a short while to enable Counsel to raise questions 

         2        which could have a bearing on the identity of the 

         3        witness, who is a protected witness.  Registry can you 

         4        see that it is done as quickly as possible.

         4   Q.   Witness 312, we are now in open session and if --

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Something -- there is a noise.  What's wrong?  

         6        Could you go on, but see how... 

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Witness 312, you we are now in open session.  If any 

         9        question that I put to you, you believe your answer may 

        10        disclose your identity, indicate so to the President of 

        11        the Court and he would then advise you on how we 

        12        proceed.

        13             

        14        Now, sir, do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli?

        15   A.   Yes, I know him.

        16   Q.   Do you see Juvénal Kajelijeli in the courtroom?

        17   A.   Yes, I can see him but he is not close to me.

        18   Q.   Can you describe what he is wearing?  You can stand up 

        19        if you --

        20   MR. FLEMING: I accept that he can identify him.

        21   A.   Yes, I can see him.  He is wearing glasses.

        22   Q.   What colour tie is he wearing?

        23   A.   I am a bit far away to be able to determine the colour.  

        24        Well, there is something between him and his tie -- 

        25        okay, I can see it now.  It's a blue tie with pears.  I 

        26        mean, at the time he didn't wear glasses but now he is 

        27        wearing glasses.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Indicating Mr. Kajelijeli, Your Honour.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: May the record indicate that he has recognised

         1        Mr. Kajelijeli in the court; in fact, the Prosecution 

         2        had no problem with that.  So we don't see 

         3        Mr. Kajelijeli, because of -- yes, okay. 

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   When did you first meet Mr. Kajelijeli, sir?

         6   A.   The first occasion on which I met Kajelijeli was in 

         7        1986.

         8   Q.   And do you know what was his employment in 1986, what he 

         9        was doing for a living?

        10   A.   At the time, Kajelijeli was the accountant for Mukingo 

        11        commune, and at the same time he was also the ad interim 

        12        bourgmestre for Mukingo commune at that time.

        13   Q.   And how did you meet his acquaintance?

        14   A.   Because of my employment, I had to be in close contact 

        15        with the bourgmestre from communes in Ruhengeri 

        16        préfecture, and at the time as Kajelijeli was working as 

        17        ad interim bourgmestre, or acting bourgmestre, rather.  

        18        I had the opportunity to work with him.

        19   Q.   Did you know him during the time that he actually became 

        20        bourgmestre?

        21   A.   Yes.  When he was appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo 

        22        commune, I also knew him as I was still employed in the 

        23        same manner.

        24   Q.   And did you know him when he left office as a 

        25        bourgmestre?

        26   A.   Yes, I knew him.

        27   Q.   Do you know when he left office?

        28   A.   I think it was 1993, if my memory serves me right.  

        29        1993.

        30   Q.   Did you know his successor the person who succeeded him

         2   A.   ********************************************************

         3        *******************************************************.

         4   Q.   And did you know when Mr. Kajelijeli, if at all, resumed 

         5        the position of bourgmestre of Mukingo?

         6   A.   No, because at that point in time I was no longer living 

         7        in the commune.  There was a short period during which I 

         8        left the commune.

         9   Q.   Now sir, when did you first learn of the president's 

        10        plane crashing?

        11   A.   I learned of it in the morning of the 7th of April.

        12   Q.   And where were you, sir, when you first learned of the 

        13        president's plane crashing?

        14   A.   I was at home in my house in**********.

        15   Q.   And who lived in that house with you?

        16   A.   It's myself, my wife and my two children.

        17   Q.   Could you tell us, in relation to the commune office 

        18        where was your house located?

        19   A.   My house was located about ************* 

        20        ************************************************.

        21   Q.   And how close was your house from that of -- withdrawn.  

        22        

        23        Do you know where Juvénal Kajelijeli lived ************?

        24   A.   Absolutely.

        25   Q.   Did you know whether or not Mr. Kajelijeli had more than 

        26        one house?

        27   A.   Yes.  I knew that he had two places of residence.

        28   Q.   And did you know whether or not he had two wives?

        29   A.   Yes, he had two wives.

        30   Q.   Now, your place of residence, can you tell us, in

         1        relation to Mr. Kajelijeli's residence *********, how far 

         2        was your place from his?

         3   A.   Regarding his first place of residence which was in the  

         4        Mukingo commune, that is, in the Nyabikenke secteur, 

         5        Mukingo is M-U-K-I-N-G-O, Nyabrenhe is N-Y-A-B-R-E-N-H-E 

         6        Nyabrenhe.

         7             

         8        So that first place of residence was about eight 

         9        kilometres, I said more or less eight kilometres away 

        10        from my place of residence in Nkuli. 

        11             

        12        The second place of residence, his place of residence 

        13        was close to the Nkuli commune; in other words, four 

        14        hundred, five hundred metres from my own place of 

        15        residence.

        16   Q.   Now, sir, when you -- withdrawn.  

        17        

        18        How did you learn of the president's plane crash?

        19   A.   To answer that one, we would need a closed session, 

        20        because my identity might be revealed through the 

        21        answer.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, Witness, if you are not mentioning names 

        23        that might not be possible.  I don't know.  What was 

        24        your question, Counsel, specifically? 

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: How did he learn of the president's plane 

        26        crash.  

        27   THE WITNESS: I can't answer, because if I do some people 

        28        might then know my identity.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Do we get it -- you would not -- does he 

        30        want --

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think, Your Honour, the witness resided in 

         2        a specific and particular type of arrangement which was 

         3        unique in that area.  In fact, he was the only person in 

         4        that situation and so he is understandably concerned 

         5        that if he describes how he came to know about this, it 

         6        may disclose his identity.  I think it relates to his 

         7        particular living arrangement.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: You want to ask him if he learned by radio or 

         9        by whatever means, unless of course he led --

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think he is going to say that someone.

        11   THE WITNESS: Indeed, I didn't hear of it over the radio.  I 

        12        didn't get the news over the radio.

        13   THE INTERPRETER: Can you hear the interpreter, sir? 

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: I can't hear clearly the English.

        15   THE INTERPRETER: I was saying -- can you hear the 

        16        interpreter?  Can you hear the interpreter, sir?  Is it 

        17        clear now, sir?  All right, sir.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Maybe we could help out, Your Honour.

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Witness 312, without in any way identifying the 

        22        individual by name or even by what type of job they did, 

        23        can you just indicate how you learned of the President's 

        24        death?

        25   A.   No, because I feel that those might reveal my identity.  

        26        I require a closed session.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Let's go into closed session, then we 

        28        will know exactly what the problem is and be able to 

        29        explain to the witness.  We will go in closed session 

        30        for a very short time to see what the witness has got to

         1        say, and determine whether the answer does indeed reveal 

         2        his identity.

         3             

         4        Registry, can you do that?

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We take a break at half past eleven, so 

         2        you can go on, Counsel.

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Sir, when you learned of the president's plane being 

         5        shot down -- sorry, crashing, what did you do, if 

         6        anything?

         7   A.   The first thing that I did was to be afraid, then I 

         8        thought I should seek further details on the incident.

         9   Q.   Why were you afraid, sir?

        10   A.   I was afraid, because on several occasions when some 

        11        event occurred in connection with the political 

        12        situation prevailing at the time, there were actions of 

        13        revenge against the Tutsis.

        14   Q.   What do you mean by certain actions occurring in your 

        15        country, sir?  Can you explain?

        16   A.   There were killings, there was a hunt for the Tutsis.

        17   Q.   Was that precipitated by any acts on behalf of any group 

        18        prior to this revenge?

        19   A.   Yes.  In actual fact -- in fact, I can answer by giving 

        20        an example.  At the time when FPR was engaged in war in 

        21        Rwanda and when there were attacks, Tutsis were the 

        22        victims of acts of revenge carried out by persons who 

        23        were angry, and that was the tenure of events. 

        24             

        25        So once the plane of the president had crashed, there 

        26        would be a lot more actions of that nature than what was 

        27        usually the case.  So it was customary for that to 

        28        happen.

        29   Q.   So what did you do, then, sir, after you learned of the 

        30        crash?

         1   A.   Well, I told you that I was very scared, then I started 

         2        calling people whom I knew who could assist me in those 

         3        circumstances.

         4   Q.   And whom did you call first, if you recall?

         5   A.   I first called my relatives in Kigali, then I wasn't 

         6        able to get the person I was looking for on the phone.  

         7        Then I called closer to my place at Gahidari.  That did 

         8        not work.  Then I tried to call Kajelijeli's place, and 

         9        I got him on the phone.

        10   Q.   Now you indicated, sir, that you knew that Kajelijeli 

        11        had two residences.  Which residence did you call?

        12   A.   I called his residence at Nkuli, *************

        13        ********************.

        14   Q.   How did you -- why did you call there and not in 

        15        Mukingo?

        16   A.   No.  Rather than the one in Mukingo, if I may correct.

        17   Q.   Why did you call his residence in Nkuli, rather than his 

        18        residence in Mukingo that morning?

        19   A.   Matter of intuition.  I wasn't really surprised to get 

        20        him on the phone, because I knew that he was not often 

        21        at his Mukingo residence.

        22   Q.   Was that based upon your observations living in the 

        23        community or other information that you had that he was 

        24        not in Mukingo but in Nkuli?

        25   A.   No.  Everyone knew that following these events that were 

        26        occurring at the time in the country, he did not often 

        27        go to his Mukingo residence as a result of -- how should 

        28        I put it? -- as a result of rumours that were 

        29        circulating in the Muhabura Radio Station.  So I wasn't 

        30        surprised to get him at the Nkuli commune at his

         1        residence.

         2   Q.   Can you tell us what you mean by rumours and Muhabura 

         3        station?  And where is that station located?

         4   A.   Well, I won't be able to tell you where the radio 

         5        station was located.  Everyone knew, I mean he himself 

         6        must have known there was music over the radio and they 

         7        were talking about his death, they were talking about 

         8        how he was going to die.  He was not seen in a proper 

         9        light.  And so my reasoning is that, that was the reason 

        10        why he did not want to stay in Mukingo, because it was 

        11        pretty close or in the area where RPF was occupying 

        12        positions.  So it was pretty close to RPF positions.

        13   Q.   And you were saying that on the radio there were 

        14        statements of threats to Kajelijeli's life by the RPF?

        15   A.   Yes, absolutely.  There was a song and they were talking 

        16        about Kajelijeli over the radio, you know, and at the 

        17        time he was demonized, if I may say so.

        18   Q.   Now, did you reach Mr. Kajelijeli the morning of the 7th 

        19        on the telephone in Nkuli?

        20   A.   Yes, I got him on the phone.

        21   Q.   And do you know around what time that was when you 

        22        called him on the phone?

        23   A.   No, I won't be able to give you the exact time.  I 

        24        learned of this news at 6 a.m. So I would say -- well, I 

        25        cool down a bit, tried to look into my own situation I 

        26        would say about 6:15, 6:30.

        27   Q.   And can you tell this Chamber what you said to 

        28        Kajelijeli, and if anything what he said to you?

        29   A.   Yes.  It's not a secret.  I called him, I picked up the 

        30        phone and I said good morning to him, and he answered, 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        and then I asked him whether he was aware of the events 

         2        that had occurred, and he told me that he had just 

         3        learned of it.  And I told him, Well I am afraid, and he 

         4        himself knew that I was the object of threats, and I 

         5        asked him whether in this kind of situation what could I 

         6        do?  Could he help me, and he said, "Well for now I 

         7        can't help you.  I myself I don't know fully well what 

         8        was happening.  I don't have enough information more 

         9        than you have and I think you should calm down and in 

        10        view of your situation where you are just cool down."  

        11        And that's all, and that's what we said between myself 

        12        and Kajelijeli.

        13   Q.   Now after you had that conversation with Kajelijeli on 

        14        the morning, what did you do?

        15   A.   Well, obviously I didn't calm down.  I was still afraid, 

        16        and I padlocked myself and I went and met my wife and 

        17        two children - at the time I had two children.

        18   Q.   Did you discuss the situation with your wife?

        19   A.   Absolutely, yes absolutely.

        20   Q.   Was there anybody else in your house besides -- at that 

        21        time besides your wife and two children?

        22   A.   No, no one else.

        23   Q.   Were you able to discern or hear anything outside of 

        24        your residence?

        25   A.   Yes.  At the time I was still afraid.  I was watching 

        26        out, listening, watching through the windows of the 

        27        house.  I heard cries, I heard some noise, a lot of 

        28        noise.  So it was not a calm situation, to say the 

        29        least.

        30   Q.   When you said you heard noise, can you describe the

         1        noise that you heard outside of the cries that you said.  

         2        What type of noises?

         3   A.   These were people who were screaming, asking for help 

         4        noise by people who were excited, noise of footsteps, a 

         5        mix.

         6   Q.   Were you hearing any noises that will -- like 

         7        explosions?

         8   A.   No, no.

         9   Q.   Or gunfire?

        10   A.   No, not at that point in time.

        11   Q.   Now -- Your Honour, do you want me to?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: We will take a break here 15 minutes and come 

        13        back, resume these proceedings at quarter to twelve,

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:

         3        The Proceedings are resumed.  We continue with the 

         4        evidence of the witness in examination-in-chief.  

         5        Professor Hinds, please, go on.

         6   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         7   Q.   Witness 312, after you had padlocked yourself in your 

         8        residence and spoken to your wife, did that calm you?

         9   A.   No, I couldn't calm down.

        10   Q.   What did you do, if anything, after that?

        11   A.   Well, specially that I wanted to go out, of course, in 

        12        hiding so that I could go and see what was happening and 

        13        then I left my house afterwards I ended up leaving my 

        14        house.

        15   Q.   And you left your house -- why did you leave your house?

        16   A.   Well, I did not feel safe in my house and I didn't have 

        17        any accurate information.  I did not have full safety.

        18   Q.   And so when you left your house what did you do?

        19   A.   Yes I left my house, I went out round the back -- went 

        20        to the back and then I went out through the back fence, 

        21        and in front of my house there is a lot of trees.  And 

        22        so I went through the street area up until the main road 

        23        that goes through Gisenyi and Ruhengeri across the road 

        24        and went on towards another wooded area.  And this 

        25        wooded area was very, very close to Mr. Kajelijeli's 

        26        second house, and so I went to his house.

        27   Q.   Did you arrive at his house?

        28   A.   Yes, I arrived at his house.

        29   Q.   And what did you do after you arrived at his house?

        30   A.   Well, I went in, I knocked -- well, first I entered the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        50

         1        courtyard, then I knocked at the door, he shouted that I 

         2        should come in, so I went in.  I went into the house, 

         3        and he was there and I immediately asked him if I could 

         4        speak with him for a moment, to which he said yes.  So 

         5        we went out together and we spoke in front of his house, 

         6        in front of his living room.

         7   Q.   And so do you know how Mr. Kajelijeli was dressed?

         8   A.   Yes.

         9   Q.   How was he dressed?

        10   A.   Yes.  At the time when he was sitting down he was 

        11        wearing pyjamas, blue striped.  He was also wearing 

        12        slippers, sandal-like slippers that we call "Kabambini" 

        13        in Kinyarwanda.  They were also blue.

        14   MR. KIYEYEU:  Can you spell that?

        15   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        16   Q.   Can you spell that term, please?

        17   A.   Kabambini is spelt, K-A-B-A-M-B-I-N-I, Kabambini.

        18   Q.   Do you have any idea, sir, what time you arrived at 

        19        Mr. Kajelijeli's home that morning?

        20   A.   No, I wouldn't be able to give you the exact time.  It 

        21        was approximately 7:15 - 7:30 a.m.

        22   Q.   Would be close to 7:15 or to 7:30?

        23   MR. PRESIDENT:  The Witness said between 7:15 and 7:30.

        24   THE WITNESS:  That is it, between 7:15 and 7:30, that is what 

        25        I said.  Maybe close to 7:30 though, because I had just 

        26        spent some time at home wondering what I would do.  So, 

        27        let's say 7:30.

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   So, sir, when you first entered Kajelijeli's home, was 

        30        he alone or was there anybody else there if you recall?

         1   A.   Yes he as accompanied by two or three persons, but I 

         2        cannot remember whether there were two or three, but in 

         3        any case, he was not alone.

         4   Q.   Did you recognise any of those people who were there; 

         5        did you know them?

         6   A.   No, that wasn't really my concern at the time.

         7   Q.   Now, sir, you testified that Mr. Kajelijeli took you 

         8        outside of the house; is that correct?

         9   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        10   Q.   Can you tell this Chamber what you said to him and what 

        11        he said to you, if anything, when you were outside?

        12   A.   Yes.  Well, we had spoken on the phone earlier and when 

        13        I came to see him he repeated the same things he had 

        14        stated on the phone.  I told him that I could see that 

        15        the situation was changing to the worst, and I asked him 

        16        what I could do.  I asked can you help me, I asked him 

        17        can I come and stay at your house with my family, and I 

        18        asked him what do you think I should do, I was just 

        19        confused, I didn't just know what to do.  And he 

        20        repeated, "With your current situation, given the 

        21        situation such as it is, you can go home or I don't know 

        22        how I could help you.  I don't know exactly what is 

        23        happening, but if there is anything I can do for you, I 

        24        can try and do something.  But in the meantime you need 

        25        to calm down.  Go home and wait there".  And so I went 

        26        back the way I had come and I reached my house and I 

        27        locked myself in my house.

        28   Q.   Can you tell us around what time you left 

        29        Mr. Kajelijeli's that morning?

        30   A.   It was around -- well, I must have stayed there between

         1        thirty and forty-five minutes.  Because we really did 

         2        have a conversation.  So, it must have been 7:00 or 

         3        8:15, in any case 8:15 - 8:30.

         4   Q.   Now, sir, how did you get back to your home, is it the 

         5        same way that you travelled or did you take a different 

         6        path?

         7   A.   No, I followed the same path.

         8   Q.   And when you got home could you tell this Chamber what 

         9        you did after you got home?

        10   A.   Upon my return I locked myself in and then I waited to 

        11        see what would happen.

        12   Q.   Did you make any further phone calls after you returned 

        13        home?

        14   A.   No, no.

        15   Q.   Can you tell us, what, if anything happened later on 

        16        that day while you were at home?

        17   A.   Yes, I stayed home waiting.  Of course, I didn't do 

        18        anything special, but later in the afternoon on or 

        19        around 2 p.m. someone came to my house -- his son  -- 

        20        Kajelijeli's son came to my house.

        21   Q.   What, if anything did Kajelijeli do or say to you?

        22   A.   No, he didn't do anything special.  But he told he had a 

        23        message from his father.  He said, "Listen, my father 

        24        has said that he will try to do something so that you 

        25        can be evacuated tomorrow, because the situation was 

        26        worsening," and that was it, he left and then I stayed 

        27        on at home.

        28   Q.   Do you know the name of Kajelijeli's son, that is, the 

        29        son who brought you the message?

        30   A.   Yes, of course, his son's name is Ingabire;

         1        I-N-G-A-B-I-R-E.

         2   Q.   On two that afternoon, sir, did anyone else visit you -- 

         3        visit your home?

         4   A.   It was late in the evening that someone came to see me, 

         5        but I wouldn't be able to tell you what time the visit 

         6        took place.  In fact, the woman came to seek a refuge in 

         7        my house.  But my wife had told me -- I noticed her 

         8        presence around 5 p.m. but my wife told me that she had 

         9        arrived earlier.

        10   Q.   And what was the condition of this woman?

        11   A.   Well this woman was in a pitiful condition. First of 

        12        all, because her husband was killed; the woman was 

        13        pregnant, and her labour had began, so her labour had 

        14        began, and so she was seven months pregnant -- sorry, 

        15        nine months pregnant.

        16   Q.   Did she give birth that evening or during this time that 

        17        you were at your house?

        18   A.   Yes, actually.  As I was saying her labour had began, 

        19        and so the baby was born around 9 p.m.  she had a boy, 

        20        in very difficult conditions because, well, she wasn't 

        21        prepared for that, and she was frightened, her husband 

        22        had been killed and so she was almost unconscious.

        23   Q.   Now, I am drawing your attention, sir, to the next day, 

        24        the 8th.  What, if anything, did you do on that day?

        25   A.   On the 8th the situation was quite serious.  I had heard 

        26        of the death of some people and I was overwhelmed of 

        27        those that were shouting around my house, in front of my 

        28        house, so that I was also waiting for death.  And then I 

        29        saw the people come to fetch me, to evacuate me -- to 

        30        collect me, rather, myself and the woman who was still

         1        virtually unconscious and my family, and we were 

         2        collected and evacuated.

         3   Q.   And so, you were evacuated on this particular day.  Was 

         4        it in the morning or evening, sir?

         5   A.   No it was not in the morning, it was early afternoon.  

         6        At a point we couldn't follow -- monitor time closely, 

         7        but it was between morning and afternoon.

         8   Q.   So to whom do you credit your evacuation and saving your 

         9        life?

        10   A.   It was thanks to Kajelijeli that I was evacuated and I 

        11        owe him my life.

        12   Q.   Now, sir, did there come a time when you left Rwanda?

        13   A.   Yes, I left Rwanda at one point in time.

        14   Q.   When did you leave Rwanda?  When I say leave Rwanda, I 

        15        mean leaving Rwanda as in going into exile seeking 

        16        refuge elsewhere?

        17   A.   It was in 2000.

        18   Q.   When, in 2000?  What month?

        19   A.   In September 2000.

        20   Q.   Why did you leave Rwanda?

        21   A.   Well, because I had been threatened, and the threats 

        22        meant that I could not continue to live being this 

        23        threatened.  I was accused of being subversive.  And 

        24        when they said this I left.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour I have one last question to put 

        26        to the witness, but the answer, I suspect we may have to 

        27        have in closed session.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  That is the last question?

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes.  It is just a follow-up of what he 

        30        just said.  I can wait for the Prosecutor if he is going

         1        to ask him about it.  But I could do it on direct.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, we can go, if it is just for a short 

         3        while and if you fear that it might reveal his identity 

         4        we can go into closed session for a short time.  Okay.

         5        

         6        Can we go into closed session to enable Counsel to raise 

         7        the question with the witness which could have a bearing 

         8        on his identity according to Counsel?  Are we there 

         9        --not yet.

        10   MR. KIYEYEU:  Not yet, My Lord, I am still waiting for the 

        11        public to go from the public gallery.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.

        13        

        14        (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the 

        15        transcript (pages 57 to 75 ) was extracted and sealed

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: We were in closed session when we took the 

         6        lunch break.  Mr. Fleming, do you think you still need 

         7        the closed session?

         8   MR. FLEMING: Probably not, Your Honours. 

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  The closed session has ended.  We will 

        10        keep on in open session and see how we develop from 

        11        here.  

        12        

        13        Witness, we are now in open session, please be cautious 

        14        not in mention any names which could have a bearing on 

        15        your identity.  Go on, Mr. Fleming.

        16   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        17   BY MR. FLEMING:

        18   Q.   Witness, you went to Mr. Kajelijeli for assistance that 

        19        day.  Why did you go to him?

        20   A.   I said so this morning.  I went to him in the morning on 

        21        the 7th of April '94.

        22   Q.   I said why. 

        23   A.   I went to him to ask him more information, but also to 

        24        ask him for some help as he had done in the past.  I 

        25        thought he could help me once again.

        26   Q.   Did you think he might have some influence somewhere on 

        27        somebody to ensure that you were rescued?

        28   A.   Not that.  It was the fact that there was some 

        29        confidence between us, and I thought he could hide me if 

        30        possible and to give me more information as to how I

         1        could flee.  All the more so, as he was a native of that 

         2        area.  That was all.

         3   Q.   But you already had protection.  Why wasn't that enough?

         4   A.   Oh yes, oh yes.  I do not know whether this question 

         5        should be raised in camera.

         6   Q.   Why wasn't it enough that you had protection?

         7   A.   Yes, as I am saying, Mr. Prosecutor, this is an issue 

         8        that might bear on my identity, if I were to venture to 

         9        answer that question.

        10   Q.   Well, we will come back to some, but we can have it in 

        11        closed session, then.  But in the interim I would like 

        12        you to answer some questions. 

        13             

        14        Why didn't you go to the bourgmestre for assistance?

        15   A.   But I told you it was a matter of confidence.  I didn't 

        16        have enough confidence in the bourgmestre, even if he 

        17        had more means than Mr. Kajelijeli.  It was a matter of 

        18        confidence, sir.

        19   Q.   So Mr. Kajelijeli had more means than the bourgmestre to 

        20        effect what you wanted to effect?

        21   A.   No.  It was not a question of means as such.  No, no 

        22        sir, but he had -- he was more of a humanitarian than 

        23        the bourgmestre, according to me.

        24   Q.   But you used the term "means" in the answer before last.  

        25        What did you mean when you said that he had more means?

        26   A.   He had more humanism.  Let me detail that, not 

        27        logistical means as such, but he was more of a humanist, 

        28        to me.

        29   Q.   But being a humanist to you wouldn't help you unless he 

        30        had means to assist you, would it?

         1   A.   Of course.  That was one of the factors that goaded me 

         2        to go to him, because I knew he would help.

         3   Q.   And you knew that he also had the capacity to help, 

         4        didn't you?

         5   A.   Well, at least I thought that if he -- if I could see 

         6        him I would have some information, as I said, and his 

         7        assistance, because he could have hid me at his house.

         8   Q.   Witness, you are not answering the question.  You 

         9        thought he had more means to assist you, didn't you?

        10   A.   What sort of means are you referring to, sir? 

        11   Q.   I am referring to the ones that you used.  You were the 

        12        one who used that word "means."

        13   A.   Well, once again I should like to say to you that words 

        14        could probably be misinterpreted.  If I say "means," it 

        15        could be material means, it could be human means, and I 

        16        said "humanism".

        17   Q.   Because he is a nice man, you thought that he could help 

        18        you.  Is that what you are saying?

        19   A.   If the synonym of humanism is nice man, it is the truth.

        20   Q.   Which wouldn't help you at all, unless he had some 

        21        capacity to remove you or help you escape from the 

        22        situation, would it, the fact that he was a nice man, a 

        23        man of humanity?

        24   A.   Well, it is along those lines, not completely.  As I am 

        25        saying, it was because I felt unsafe at my house 

        26        firstly, and I had to find ways and means of getting 

        27        out, and I did not know how to do that, and I did not 

        28        know what to resort to.

        29   Q.   So you resorted to Mr. Kajelijeli, because you thought 

        30        he might have the ways and means to help you?

         1   A.   Not that.  Rather, let me come back to the first word I 

         2        used; that is, "humanism." 

         3   Q.   Humanity or humanism wasn't going to save your life, was 

         4        it, in the circumstances in which you found --

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, maybe the Prosecutor is not 

         6        satisfied with the answer, but the witness is simply 

         7        repeating what the witness felt, and I think that is the 

         8        evidence that we have to accept.  It's been asked and 

         9        answered several times.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  But I think the witness has not answered 

        11        that question.  If he can listen carefully and we would 

        12        like to get the answer to that question.

        13   THE WITNESS: Prosecution, could you repeat your question.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: I think it has been asked a number of times.  

        15        It might help us, if you don't understand a question say 

        16        so, but if you understand it, answer it.  It might help 

        17        us to move forward.

        18   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        19   THE WITNESS: Yes, Your excellency.  I thought I had answered 

        20        the question, but if it so happens that I am required to 

        21        repeat my answer, I should require a simpler question to 

        22        that effect so that I can give an adequate answer.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you put it.

        24   BY MR. FLEMING:

        25   Q.   Witness, your first thought in going to Mr. Kajelijeli 

        26        was to find a way to save your family and yourself, 

        27        wasn't it?

        28   A.   Yes, sir.  In one way or the other that was the purpose, 

        29        that was the purpose.

        30   Q.   And you chose Mr. Kajelijeli, because he was first, a

         1        friend, and second, somebody who had some influence who 

         2        might be able to assist you, didn't you?

         3   A.   No, sir, I didn't say so.  That was not the answer I 

         4        gave you this morning, sir.

         5   Q.   I'm sorry.  I asked you a question and is that your 

         6        answer?

         7   A.   I am saying no, sir, that was not the purpose.

         8   Q.   Mr. Kajelijeli did in fact, help you, didn't he?

         9   A.   Well, when I went to his house he did not help me, 

        10        because what I wanted at the time I did not obtain.

        11   Q.   But you told us that in the afternoon, his son came with 

        12        some hope that you would be evacuated, and you were 

        13        evacuated.  Isn't that the case?

        14   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        15   Q.   So the fact is, in the midst of this chaos, in the midst 

        16        of the violence Mr. Kajelijeli was able, in fact, to 

        17        ensure that you were evacuated?

        18   A.   No, sir, no, sir, because firstly, it was not him that 

        19        ensured my evacuation, but also he was not the one who 

        20        evacuated me.

        21   Q.   So your comment this morning that Mr. Kajelijeli saved 

        22        your life is not true at all, then?  He wasn't 

        23        responsible for your evacuation?

        24   A.   No, sir.  I did not say so, and what I said is true, 

        25        because I am here to speak the truth.  I was evacuated 

        26        indeed since he was able to make arrangements for that, 

        27        but he was not the one himself that evacuated me.  I 

        28        believe that he didn't have the means himself to do so 

        29        at the time.

        30   Q.   However, he had the influence to ensure that you were

         1        evacuated, didn't he?

         2   A.   No, sir, no, sir.

         3   Q.   You were afraid on the 7th of April because of all that 

         4        was happening, and the possible violence against 

         5        yourself.  Now, I want to come back to what you saw.  

         6        Did you see people in uniforms that day, the 7th of 

         7        April?

         8   A.   Well, I will give you a partial answer, because if I 

         9        were to give you a complete answer that might have a 

        10        bearing to my identity, sir.

        11   Q.   How could the fact of whether or not you saw uniforms 

        12        that day that requires a yes-or-no answer have a bearing 

        13        on who you are?

        14   A.   No, precisely, sir.  That could really reveal my 

        15        identity, and I do not want it to be revealed because of 

        16        my safety and the safety of my family.

        17   Q.   All I want is "yes" or "no".  Did you or did you not see 

        18        people in uniform on the 7th of April?

        19   A.   No, you are pushing me sir to do what I called into 

        20        question.  I couldn't answer by "yes" or "no".  Probably 

        21        in a closed session.  It might take just seconds. 

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: I think we may go to that if that is your 

        23        wish, but on the basis of the question asked which calls 

        24        for "yes" or "no" we don't see how your identity could 

        25        become an issue at this stage.  Certainly Mr. Fleming 

        26        would like to go on, and you think that it might have a 

        27        bearing on your identity.  He will tell the Trial 

        28        Chamber not to do that in open court.  But the question 

        29        as put, we don't see how it could reveal identity.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't think there is any hesitancy on the 

         3        witness to answer the question, but in the witness' mind 

         4        in terms of where he saw the uniform and who was wearing 

         5        it --

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: No.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: No, no.  I am saying in his mind, he is now 

         8        thinking of more than just yes or no.  And so I think 

         9        that he is assuming that if he says yes it means more 

        10        than that, and --

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Let him answer that question and then we will 

        12        move in closed session, if need be. 

        13   MR. FLEMING: And with respect to my learned friend's surmise 

        14        as to what is in the witness' mind, it is entirely 

        15        offensive.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Could you answer that question and if there is 

        17        a need we go into closed session, without elaboration.

        18   THE WITNESS: Your Excellency, Your Excellency, as I have just 

        19        said, precisely, you do not know the answer that I am  

        20        going to give, and to my mind that answer may be a sort 

        21        of a trap that could expose me, that could reveal my 

        22        identity, sir.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: We won't allow that to happen.  The question 

        24        is whether you saw -- did you see any people in uniform.  

        25        If not, no; if yes, yes, and if there is a further 

        26        question that may -- the Prosecution wishes to ask, then 

        27        we go into closed session. 

        28   THE WITNESS: Well, that's it.  If there is a sequence to that 

        29        question I always say, yes, yes I did see people in 

        30        uniform.

         1   BY MR. FLEMING:

         2   Q.   Are you aware of a group of people called the 

         3        Interahamwe?

         4   A.   Yes, I was aware of a group called Interahamwe.

         5   Q.   And what were they?

         6   A.   The Interahamwe were people according to what I saw, 

         7        fanatics.  They were fanatics of a political party that 

         8        was there at the time in the country.

         9   Q.   What political party?

        10   A.   It was the MRND political party.

        11   Q.   And as fanatics what did they do?

        12   A.   Well, I heard them singing out chanting the party's 

        13        glory.  They organized rallies, that's it.

        14   Q.   Are you sure that that is all they did?

        15   A.   At least that is what I thought, because I have never 

        16        been an Interahamwe, I have never participated in their 

        17        demonstrations, and personally, that is what I think.  

        18        Concerning all the things they did, I wouldn't know.

        19   Q.   Did you see any Interahamwe on the 7th of April 1994?

        20   A.   No, sir.  I saw people who carried traditional weapons 

        21        running left, right and centre, as I said at the 

        22        beginning.

        23   Q.   What were they doing with their traditional weapons?

        24   A.   I saw them running around, probably if I can goad my 

        25        imagination I would say I saw them carrying lamb and 

        26        legs of cattle.  I would have thought that they were 

        27        running up to the Tutsi, but I don't think so.  I 

        28        thought it was sort of a vengeance.  It might have been 

        29        because of an RPF attack or any of the events.  They

         1        them.  That was quite current at the time in that area.

         2   Q.   They wanted to maltreat them with traditional weapons.  

         3        What were they doing to the Tutsi?

         4   A.   As I said, the Tutsi were massacred.  Everybody knows 

         5        that in '94 they were massacred.

         6   Q.   And this was going on around your house on the 7th of 

         7        April?

         8   A.   Well, to tell you the truth I didn't see people killed 

         9        on the spot, but I saw people running around with 

        10        traditional weapons.  I heard cries, I heard people 

        11        calling for help, as I said to you, sir.

        12   Q.   All of this was within 400 metres of Mr. Kajelijeli's 

        13        house, wasn't it?

        14   A.   Four hundred, five hundred, yes, yes indeed, sir.

        15   Q.   And it is your version of the fact that whilst this 

        16        chaos is going on around them Mr. Kajelijeli is dressed 

        17        in his pyjamas and slippers.  Is that right?

        18   A.   Yes, yes in the morning I saw him at his house in his 

        19        pyjamas and in slippers.

        20   Q.   Surely he must have expressed something to you about his 

        21        concern that there might have been killing going on?

        22   A.   Please, could you be so kind to repeat that question, 

        23        sir.

        24   Q.   Surely he must have expressed his concern to you that 

        25        there was killing going on.  You went up there, because 

        26        you were afraid of being killed?

        27   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        28   Q.   So he expressed a concern that there was killing going 

        29        on, did he?

        30   A.   He told me, as I have repeated this morning, that during

         1        our conversation we talked about the crash of the 

         2        presidential plane.  I told him I was concerned about my 

         3        personal safety as well as the safety of my family, and 

         4        as I told him that the situation, as you have said if I 

         5        might use your terminology, that it was chaotic.  Yes, 

         6        he was concerned he expressed concern, and this is the 

         7        reason why he himself he told me that I should stay put, 

         8        I should be calm.

         9   Q.   And as he stayed put in his pyjamas whilst the screaming 

        10        and the people running around with traditional weapons, 

        11        and the explosions in the distance were all occurring.  

        12        That's is what you are telling us, are you?

        13   A.   No, that was not what I said, that is not what I said, 

        14        sir.

        15   Q.   Well, he did stay in his pyjamas, according to you, 

        16        until 8:30 or something?

        17   A.   Well, at least when I left him, yes, that's right.

        18   Q.   (Microphone off) you told us that once?

        19   A.   Yes, when I left him he still had the same clothes on, 

        20        same pyjamas.

        21   Q.   He was a man of some influence in that community, wasn't 

        22        he?

        23   A.   No.  It's a matter of personal appreciation or 

        24        interpretation, because I never said he was a man of 

        25        influence in the community.

        26   Q.   He was bourgmestre, wasn't he?

        27   A.   Yes, he was bourgmestre, but at that time he was no 

        28        longer one.

        29   Q.   But he had been bourgmestre for an extended period of 

        30        time in that community, hadn't he?

         1   A.   Yes, that's correct.  He has been a bourgmestre for a 

         2        long period.

         3   Q.   And he subsequently became the bourgmestre again, didn't 

         4        he?

         5   A.   No, I am not aware of that.

         6   Q.   Are you suggesting to this Court that a man who had been 

         7        bourgmestre for an extended period of time didn't have 

         8        any influence in the community beyond his post as 

         9        bourgmestre?

        10   A.   I did not interpret it that way, because that's the way 

        11        I see it.  It's an interpretation.

        12   Q.   You heard people screaming for help, didn't you?

        13   A.   Yes, that's correct.  I heard them.

        14   Q.   They were Tutsi, weren't they?

        15   A.   Well, they could be Tutsi, as well as other people too 

        16        who were asking for help at that time.

        17   Q.   And within four or five hundred metres you want us to 

        18        believe that Mr. Kajelijeli was still there, and despite 

        19        these screams for help you didn't see him come and 

        20        render any assistance, did you?

        21   A.   The screams occurred around me.  I do not know if he was 

        22        able to hear the screams at five hundred metres, I am 

        23        not sure if he is able to do that; however, I must say 

        24        that myself, I heard the screams, I heard cries.  For 

        25        him, I do not know because when I was at his house I did 

        26        not hear any screams or cries.

        27   Q.   Had you gone up there?

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: I think he has answered that question.

        29   MR. FLEMING: I just want to put one proposition to him.

         1   Q.   You went up there, because you were afraid for your 

         2        life, didn't you?

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, that has been asked and 

         4        answered several times.

         5   BY MR. FLEMING:

         6   Q.   You weren't the only one in fear for your life, weren't 

         7        you, that day?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour:  How does he know?  

         9        I mean, a proper foundation hasn't been laid.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: I think that is a proper question to be asked,  

        11        and can be answered by the witness.  He could ask if 

        12        there were any other people who were there.  But the 

        13        reasons why he went there, that has been answered not 

        14        once but many times.

        15   MR. FLEMING: Thank you.

        16   BY MR. FLEMING:

        17   Q.   The fact is that, the people screaming were people 

        18        screaming for their lives, weren't they?

        19   A.   Yes.  Now I am responding to the question as to whether 

        20        others were scared.  Yes others were scared, including 

        21        my wife who was there.  Other people were scared.  I was 

        22        not in that frame of mind but I assume when I saw her 

        23        that she was scared, just like I was.

        24   Q.   Violence had been going on in that commune for a number 

        25        of years, hadn't it, before 1994?

        26   A.   Yes, yes, because as I have stated, I was aggressed at 

        27        another time.  Yes, any time there was an RPF attack you 

        28        had revenge attacks on the Tutsis, and this is the 

        29        reality.

        30   Q.   And in fact there were many Tutsis who died in 1992,

         1        1993, weren't there?

         2   A.   Well, I cannot confirm that.  At least I escaped at that 

         3        period.  I was not killed.  I was aggressed but I was 

         4        lucky enough not to have been killed.  I was attacked.  

         5        But it is true some Tutsis were killed.

         6   Q.   How many do you think were killed?

         7   A.   How would you expect me to know?  I could not, you know, 

         8        my work at that time did not enable me to undertake that 

         9        activity.

        10   Q.   Did you personally know people who disappeared, Tutsi 

        11        who disappeared during that period of time?

        12   A.   Are you saying before '94?

        13   Q.   Yes.

        14   A.   No, I do not know.

        15   Q.   In any event that was during a period of time when 

        16        Mr. Kajelijeli was bourgmestre, wasn't it?

        17   A.   What period are you referring to, sir? 

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the law of this Tribunal is 

        19        very clear with respect to what types of evidence could 

        20        be introduced, whether it be through the Prosecution's 

        21        witness or any witness.  Maybe we could have a proffer 

        22        from the Prosecutor in terms of where he is going.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Mr. Fleming?

        24   MR. FLEMING: First, Your Honour, it's prior consistent 

        25        behaviour.  Second, it's the authority that 

        26        Mr. Kajelijeli had within the commune.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Prior?  That is not an exception with 

        28        respect to the rulings of this Tribunal.  When he talks 

        29        about prior behaviour, assuming a witness says, I saw 

        30        Kajelijeli string up a hundred people, does that --

         1        assuming that the witness says that, is it admissible?  

         2        No.  The ruling is that, if there is evidence to adduce 

         3        which goes to acts which, in fact, may constitute a 

         4        conspiracy, then that is what it is.  This witness is 

         5        testifying to acts which is within the temporal 

         6        jurisdiction.  The fact that he was saved prior to 1994 

         7        is a fact that the Prosecutor elicited.  I did not get 

         8        into that area.  The Prosecutor went in and he wanted to 

         9        know the details, et cetera, and he got his answer.  But 

        10        he cannot, he cannot try to adduce the evidence at this 

        11        point, and I don't know for what purpose.  That's why I 

        12        asked and the answer that he gave is not helpful.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Mr. Fleming, I think we have been 

        14        through that exercise before in the course of this trial 

        15        with regard to events that predate 1994, and the context 

        16        in which it could be admissible or, you know, relevant 

        17        in the proceedings before this Trial Chamber within the 

        18        context, indeed, as Professor Hinds has said, in the 

        19        context of conspiracy.  

        20        

        21        So we do understand, for example, why you have been able 

        22        to pursue the first time, indeed, he was -- the witness 

        23        was said too have been saved by the Accused and you were 

        24        perfectly entitled to follow it up, because it came from 

        25        the evidence in chief about the first -- it was simply 

        26        mentioned this wasn't the first time he had come to his 

        27        rescue.  So maybe in that context you can address the 

        28        issues.

        29   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, Rule 93 specifically says, evidence 

        30        of a consistent pattern of conduct relevant to serious 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        violations of international humanitarian law and of the 

         2        Statute may be admissible in the interest of justice.  

         3        It is certainly discretionary for Your Honours.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: And I think in the previous decisions we have 

         5        spelled -- I cannot remember which one, about the 

         6        balancing of the initial effect to what you could have 

         7        before proceeding before the Trial Chamber.  So it's 

         8        only within that compass that I think as we said in 

         9        previous decisions that events that predate 1994 can 

        10        come or be adduced in evidence.  We are aware of that 

        11        provision.

        12   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, jurisprudence has consistently 

        13        been that other material can be adduced outside of the 

        14        temporal period.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Within specified areas.  Yes, next point.

        16   MR. FLEMING: Thank you. 

        17   BY MR. FLEMING:

        18   Q.   Were you afraid of the Tutsi or the Hutu in 1994, 

        19        Witness?

        20   A.   I was afraid of some Hutu.

        21   Q.   Were you afraid of Tutsi?

        22   A.   No.

        23   Q.   You subsequently became afraid of Tutsi, didn't you?

        24   A.   "Subsequently", what do you mean by that, please? 

        25   Q.   The year 2000 you left the country, because you had been 

        26        threatened?

        27   A.   No.  I was not afraid, no.

        28   Q.   It wasn't your evidence that you left the country 

        29        because you were threatened.  Is that what you are 

        30        telling us now?

         1   A.   It was a different thing.  I was scared of the threats 

         2        and not the individuals.

         3   Q.   Who were the threats coming from?  The government?

         4   A.   I don't know if I should explain here the reasons.  You 

         5        know, these are personal reasons, my personal viewpoint.  

         6        It's private.

         7   Q.   I am asking you about it?

         8   A.   It's a question which actually has a bearing on my 

         9        private life.  The reasons why I did not stay in Rwanda 

        10        any more, I think that's private.

        11   Q.   You are not going to answer it?  Is that what you are 

        12        telling us?

        13   A.   I am trying to explain why I can't explain.  In terms of 

        14        replying, I believe I have done so.

        15   Q.   Were you considered to be a Hutu sympathizer?

        16   A.   In any way, yes.

        17   Q.   In 1994, were you considered to be a Hutu sympathizer?

        18   A.   No, no, because at that time I had problems just like 

        19        other Tutsis.

        20   Q.   But you had problems from the Tutsis as well, didn't 

        21        you?

        22   A.   No.  We had the same problems.

        23   Q.   Did you have problems from the Tutsi in 1994?

        24   A.   No, never.  This has never been the case.

        25   Q.   When Mr. Kajelijeli was the accountant of the commune, 

        26        what was your association with him, then?

        27   A.   We only had professional relationships.

        28   Q.   Were you on the payroll of the commune?

        29   A.   No.  I was an employee of the ministry.

        30   Q.   And did the ministry administer itself in any way

         1        through the communal office?

         2   A.   Yes, of course.

         3   Q.   Did you collect your pay from Mr. Kajelijeli, for 

         4        example, as the accountant?

         5   A.   No, never.  I was paid by the ministry.

         6   Q.   All right. 

         7   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours, that's the 

         8        cross-examination.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Fleming.  Any re-examination?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes Your Honour, just briefly. 

        11        

        12                           RE-EXAMINATION 

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        14   Q.   Witness 312, you testified sir, that you in the morning 

        15        of April 7, that you heard screaming and you also said 

        16        that you saw people running helter-skelter.  When you 

        17        made those observations, where were you?  Were you at 

        18        your house or were you at Mr. Kajelijeli's?

        19   A.   Please, sir, allow me to clarify one issue relating to 

        20        what you have said.  Maybe it's a translation error.  No 

        21        it was not the 3rd of April.  Rather it was on the 7th 

        22        of April.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you repeat your --

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, maybe I said the 3rd but I 

        25        thought I said the 7th, but if I did, I am correcting 

        26        myself.  

        27   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        28   Q.   The question was, on the 7th, the 7 of April and where 

        29        you said that you saw people running and screaming, when 

        30        you made those observations where, were you?

                  KAJELIJELI                             16 SEPTEMBER 2002




         1   A.   I was in my house inside my house, and I was able to 

         2        observe this by looking through the curtains of my 

         3        window.

         4   Q.   After you made your way to Mr. Kajelijeli's and while 

         5        you were there, did you, in fact, see people around the 

         6        area where he was living, and while you were talking to 

         7        him did you see people running and hear screams and so 

         8        on during the time that you were with him?

         9   A.   No.  I did not see anybody escaping or screaming.

        10   Q.   Now, sir, you indicated that the reason why you went to 

        11        Mr. Kajelijeli for help was because of his humanism.  

        12        What do you mean by that?

        13   A.   Well, as far as I know, that -- it probably is not an 

        14        exact synonym -- it means someone who appreciates the 

        15        value of a human being, somebody who behaves in a 

        16        certain manner vis-à-vis other people.  He does not hide 

        17        the fact that he is very, very frank.  Well, these are 

        18        traits which qualify an individual to whom one can have 

        19        confidence.

        20   Q.   And sir, did you have confidence that Mr. Kajelijeli, 

        21        using his humanism, would attempt to help you in some 

        22        way and your family?

        23   A.   Yes, yes, and this is the reason why I am here today.  I 

        24        am here to protect this person who has been accused 

        25        maybe following rumours.  You know, I believe it's a 

        26        moral obligation for me to come here and say the truth.  

        27        That is what I am here to do.

        28   Q.   Now, sir, when you say that you saw Mr. Kajelijeli and 

        29        you indicated the times that you saw him, the Prosecutor 

        30        asked you, how could you determine those times?  How

         1        could you recall them, given the events of that day?  

         2        Can you explain that to the Court?

         3   A.   I do not understand your question.  Could you kindly 

         4        rephrase the same question, Counsel? 

         5   Q.   The Prosecutor, before the break, had said to you, how 

         6        could you explain that you remembered the times, for 

         7        example, when you made a call to Kajelijeli when you 

         8        heard of the President's death, when you went to his 

         9        house and the time that you left there?

        10   A.   You know, when I was scared in a scary situation, I was 

        11        aware, I am a person who is aware of things.  Can you 

        12        imagine that I cover a distance of 400, 500 metres, and 

        13        I was able to calculate the time I spent.  I left 

        14        immediately as soon as I got to my sitting room.  There 

        15        was a clock in the sitting room.  I saw it.  But, then,  

        16        from that time onwards all that I did is estimations.  

        17        So this is why I said it took me 20 to 30 minutes.  You 

        18        see, these are estimations, these are estimates; 

        19        however, given that I had other things to do than look 

        20        at the clock every time, so part of my confidence -- I 

        21        do hope anyway I have responded to your question, sir.

        22   Q.   You said that you were evacuated on the next day.  Is 

        23        that correct?

        24   A.   Yes, that's correct.

        25   Q.   Do you know from your own information what if anything, 

        26        Mr. Kajelijeli did, who he called, who he spoke to, that 

        27        you credit him with saving your life?  Do you know how 

        28        it was done, what Mr. Kajelijeli did?

        29   A.   What I do know is that I was evacuated, thanks to 

        30        arrangements he made.  If not, I do not know the

         1        details.  All I know is that he made arrangements for 

         2        that.

         3   Q.   Now, sir, you testified that Mr. Kajelijeli was a -- a 

         4        question put to you by Mr. Fleming, the Prosecutor, that 

         5        you knew that Mr. Kajelijeli was a bourgmestre in the 

         6        community.  What community was Mr. Kajelijeli a 

         7        bourgmestre of?

         8   A.   No.  He was not a bourgmestre of a commune.  There was 

         9        no particular community as such.

        10   Q.   Was Mr. Kajelijeli a bourgmestre of a commune?  Were you 

        11        aware that he was a bourgmestre of a commune?

        12   A.   No.  He was not bourgmestre any more.  He was not a 

        13        bourgmestre of any commune.  He was just a normal 

        14        citizen.

        15   Q.   That was in April of 1994.  Is that correct?

        16   A.   Yes, that's correct.

        17   Q.   And when Mr. Fleming, the Prosecutor, was asking you in 

        18        terms of Mr. Kajelijeli's influence, he asked you 

        19        whether or not in that community in which Mr. Kajelijeli 

        20        lived, wasn't he a former bourgmestre?  And I just want 

        21        you to tell this Tribunal whether or not Juvénal 

        22        Kajelijeli was ever a former bourgmestre ***?

        23   A.   No.  Kajelijeli was never a former bourgmestre in *** 

        24        commune.

        25   Q.   Sir, concerning the events that caused you to leave 

        26        Rwanda, you, in your testimony on direct examination 

        27        this morning, said that you were accused of being 

        28        engaged in superfluous activities.  Is that correct?

        29   A.   Yes, that's correct.

         1         1530H

         2   Q.   And we then went into closed session and you explained 

         3        what those activities are all about?

         4   A.   Yes, that's correct, sir.

         5   Q.   Now, you also testified that you, didn't testify, sir, 

         6        that you did not have any problems with Tutsis in 1994; 

         7        is that correct?

         8   A.   That's correct, sir. 

         9   Q.   Now the NGOs that you were working for in year 2000 --

        10   A.   Yes that's correct, sir.

        11   Q.   Can you tell the name of the NGO?

        12   A.   Can I kindly request for a closed session so that I can 

        13        comment on that, sir? 

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour?

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  You want to go into closed session?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I would like the witness to tell us 

        17        about the NGO and the work that he was doing for that 

        18        NGO which caused --

        19   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, in addition, it doesn't arise in 

        20        cross-examination.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: I think it doesn't arise in cross-examination?

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: I beg, your pardon?

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: It doesn't arise in cross-examination.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, what we are dealing with now 

        25        is the witness' statement concerning the circumstances 

        26        under which he left Rwanda.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: The question is not where he was employed.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS:  The question of why he left has some 

        29        bearing in terms of how he was accused of Hutu 

        30        sympathising.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, that you could do, but not a place 

         2        arising from the NGO.  He did mention the NGO in 

         3        examination-in-chief.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour, if you may.  The witness 

         5        been asked whether he was accused of Hutu sympathising.  

         6        I could not to compromise this witness at this point, 

         7        but his job, what he was doing, with respect to Hutus 

         8        and NGOs he worked for occasioned a situation where he 

         9        was accused.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT:  That might be so but it didn't arise in cross 

        11        examination.  It wasn't developed.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: It wasn't developed. 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: There is a ruling on that.  If you can find it 

        14        from another angle, you can, but certainly the NGO, that 

        15        did not arise.

        16   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        17   Q.   Sir, can you tell this Tribunal why you were accused 

        18        being a Hutu sympathiser?

        19   A.   Yes,  may be my reply may put more light on the 

        20        question, however, if you could allow me, could I 

        21        request for a closed session for half a minute?  Half a 

        22        minute, I am sure I could be able to conclude during 

        23        that time.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we will go to closed session if that  

        25        will help to answer the question without revealing the 

        26        itinenary of the witness.

        27   THE WITNESS:  Thank you, Your Honour.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Registry, can we go to closed session?  Are we 

        29        there?

        30   MR. KIYEYEU:  We are just waiting for the evacuation of the

         1        1630H

         2        (After recess)

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Professor Hinds, your next witness?

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, we had made an application 

         5        concerning Mr. Bangwana, and in the interim we have been 

         6        sending people out of the courtroom to try to get him 

         7        and the information that he has given to us.  It is a 

         8        problem.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, we are seized of that matter, as we 

        10        said, we are looking into it, we would like to see 

        11        exactly what is happening with the registry and what 

        12        have you.  We have been following it up.  So, you know, 

        13        it is not that we have forgotten about it.  Please.  Can 

        14        you call your next witness.  We should be able maybe by 

        15        tomorrow in the course of the day to know exactly what 

        16        has been the practice and what exactly has been the 

        17        problem.  We are trying to see from all the people 

        18        concerned.  Yes.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS:  The Defence calls Witness 311.  Also there 

        20        has been two pseudonyms that he is known by, one is JK 

        21        34 and the other is JK 311.  I just --

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  Sorry?

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS:  There are two pseudonyms that he has been 

        24        known by, and so you may see a document that says JK 34, 

        25        but we identified him to the Prosecutor as JK 311.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT:  So what would you like to call him?

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS:  We will call him JK 311.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  JK 311.  Okay.  Any problem, Prosecutor?  No.  

        29        And maybe, perhaps, we have noticed this, the previous 

        30        witness was noted at the beginning as JK 312.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That is correct.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  But we noticed in the course of the 

         3        examination sometimes only the figures were being used.  

         4        So, I think, for a completeness and for clarity of the 

         5        record, I think we suggest, difficult as it may be, the 

         6        full pseudonym of the witness be spelt out.  If it is JK 

         7        311, then it should be JK 311 throughout.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Correct, Your Honour.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can you bring in the witness, please?

        10   MR. KIYEYEU:  I am going to do so, My Lord.  The witness is a 

        11        protected witness.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Professor Hinds, in the summary that you made 

        13        in terms of Rule 73 ter, the witness is also known as JK 

        14        311, in the summary?

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS:  No, I think we have him as JK 34.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay, all right.  Could you check and have 

        17        that confirmed, please? 

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes I know, it is JK 34.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes can you please swear the witness.

        20   (Declaration made by Witness JK 311 in Kinyarwanda).

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Yes witness JK 311, you have just 

        22        made a solemn declaration.  In case you are not familiar 

        23        as to how your evidence will be taken here, we will 

        24        explain a few essential things before you begin your 

        25        testimony.  You will be led in your examination-in-chief 

        26        by the Defence who are seated on this side of the 

        27        courtroom.  Thereafter questions will be put to you in 

        28        cross-examination by the Prosecution who are seated on 

        29        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

        30        of you may also put questions to you to clarify your

         1        evidence if they have such a question to ask you.  If a 

         2        question put to you is not clear, or you do not 

         3        understand it, please say as such a question shall be 

         4        repeated or explained.  These are the few essential 

         5        things we wanted to bring to your attention before you 

         6        begin your evidence.  Yes Professor Hinds

         9   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        10   Q.   Good afternoon, JK 311, how are you this afternoon?

        11   A.   Good afternoon.  I am well.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, may we have this document 

        13        Defence Exhibit 15, for identification, and I would like 

        14        to have the witness after the Prosecution looks at it to 

        15        take a look at the document.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS:  We had not made an application, Your 

        18        Honour, with respect to Exhibit 14, but we assume that 

        19        will be sealed.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT:  We did say that.   It was so directed.

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        22   Q.   Witness JK 311, can you read the information that is on 

        23        that document which is in English?

        24   A.   Yes, I can read the information.

        25   Q.   Okay.  Looking at the information Witness JK311, is it 

        26        accurate?

        27   A.   Yes, the information is accurate.

        28   Q.   Could you then sign the document at the bottom and put 

        29        today's date on it, please?

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  16 September 2002.  Yes, are you producing

         1        it?

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, I am moving now that that document be 

         3        tendered into evidence as Defendant Exhibit 15.

         4   MR. FLEMING:  No object.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, let the document containing the personal 

         6        particulars of Witness JK 311 be admitted as Defence 

         7        Exhibit No. 15 and the same shall be kept under seal as 

         8        it contains the personal particulars of the witness who 

         9        is a protected witness.

        10   MR. KIYEYEU:  We have taken note, My Lord.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS:  May I, Your Honour?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, please.

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        14   Q.   JK 311, now I will be asking you some questions and 

        15        before you answer them if you in any way think that your 

        16        answer may, in fact, reveal your identity please 

        17        indicate it to the President of the Chamber and he will 

        18        instruct you what to do.  Do you understand that?

        19   THE INTERPRETER:  He says he has understood.

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Sir, where did you go to primary school?

        22   A.   I think that the subject should be dealt with in the 

        23        closed session because it might reveal my identity.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour I am going to request -- I am 

        25        going to get into some information dealing with his 

        26        education and perhaps activities relating to that which 

        27        would be preliminary for us getting into substance in 

        28        other area and other than us getting back and forth for   

        29        each question I am making the application that we 

        30        conduct those matters in closed session and then we go

         1        into open session.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  Mr. Fleming, what do you say to that?

         3   MR. FLEMING:  I don't oppose that, nor do I oppose my learned 

         4        friend asking leading questions in some of these 

         5        preliminary issues.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:  No, with regard to closed session.

         7   MR. FLEMING:  That is what I said, I don't oppose that.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I don't intend to lead.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  We go in closed session to enable 

        10        Counsel to raise questions which could have a bearing on 

        11        the identity of the witness.  We regret to members of 

        12        the public.  This is a necessary procedure that has to 

        13        be invoked.  Registry, are we there?

        14   MR. KIYEYEU:  Technically, yes, but I am waiting for the 

        15        evacuation from the public gallery.  It will soon be 

        16        done, My Lord.  Yes, now we are ready, My Lord.

         2   MR. KIYEYEU:  We are ready for the open session, My Lord.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Thank you, Your Honour.  May I?

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness can you tell this Chamber, between the years 

         7        1993 and 1994, were you aware of any military training 

         8        that was taking place at the Mukingo commune office -- 

         9        in front of the Mukingo commune office?

        10   MR. PRESIDENT:  Between which year?

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS:  The years 1993 to 1994.

        12   THE WITNESS:  Counsel, could I ask you to clarify the 

        13        situation.  I have told this Court that during this 

        14        period I was a student.  I only had as free time end of 

        15        year holidays in Christmas, two weeks, as well as Easter 

        16        holidays two weeks, and then the main holidays from July 

        17        to August.  So, could you clarify which period do you 

        18        want me to refer to?

        19   A.   I would also like to add that when I was studying at 

        20        Maddened, we did not have any Easter holidays.  No 

        21        holidays in the months of April.

        22   Q.   The time period, Witness JK 311 is 1993 to l994 and I am 

        23        asking you whether or not you were aware if there was 

        24        any military training that was taking place in front of 

        25        the commune office during that time period?

        26   MR. PRESIDENT:  And he asked for clarification which we think 

        27        is that, for some time maybe during that period of time 

        28        and the time frames he was in school and he gave the 

        29        time in which he could have been home on vacations.  I 

        30        think that was his answer and he wanted you to clarify

         1        which specific -- I don't know.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I am giving, him, Your Honour, the time 

         3        frames, I am just asking him whether or not he was aware 

         4        either by directly when he was home or when -- However, 

         5        if he was aware whether or not he knows if there was any 

         6        military training taking place in front of the commune 

         7        office.

         8   THE WITNESS:  Once I was on holidays I was not any witness to 

         9        any such training, and I have not heard mention being 

        10        made of this.

        11   Q.   When you were on holidays, sir, what contact did you 

        12        have with individuals from throughout the community who 

        13        could have shared this information with you, what sort 

        14        of contact did you have?

        15   A.   It was during the holidays that could have access to 

        16        such information through the other students whilst we 

        17        were at meetings, or whilst we took part in football 

        18        training sessions.

        19   Q.   And during any of those meetings or any of those 

        20        football session, were you informed by anyone that there 

        21        was military training taking place in front of the 

        22        commune office?

        23   A.   I did not hear of any such training.

        24   Q.   Do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli?

        25   A.   Yes, I know Juvénal Kajelijeli.

        26   Q.   How long have you known Mr. Kajelijeli?

        27   A.   The first time I met Juvénal Kajelijeli *******.  

        28        This was during a student's party, and we had invited 

        29        the parents, as well as youth leaders in the commune, as 

        30        well as the bourgmestre.

         1   Q.   How old were you then when you first met Mr. Kajelijeli 

         2        in 1989?

         3   A.   I was in *******************************************

         4        ****************************************

         5        *******.  Please let me clarify that this was during 

         6        the August holidays.  So, after the August holidays I 

         7        was supposed to go in fourth year in secondary school.

         8   Q.   Now, did you know where Juvénal Kajelijeli lived?  Did 

         9        you know where his house was located?

        10   A.   I did not know where his residence was, but I do know 

        11        the secteur where he lived.

        12   Q.   And where is that sector?

        13   A.   The Rwinzovu secteur.  Let me spell Rwinzovu, 

        14        R-W-I-N-Z-O-V-U, Rwinzovu.

        15   Q.   Do you see Mr. Kajelijeli in the courtroom?

        16   A.   Yes, I can see Juvénal Kajelijeli.

        17   Q.   Can you describe what he is wearing?

        18   A.   Yes, he is wearing black or blue clothes.  He is seated 

        19        next to a person who apparently is wearing military 

        20        uniform Kajelijeli has spectacles and he is behind other 

        21        people situated on the left-hand side.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Indicating, if I may, Mr. Kajelijeli.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT:  Mr. Fleming?  Yes, the witness has indeed 

        24        pointed out Mr. Juvénal Kajelijeli in the courtroom.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS:   Your Honour, I am thinking of having the 

        26        witness draw a map.  I don't think it is going to 

        27        violate his confidentiality unless the map is shown.  We 

        28        are going to ask that it is sealed.  But I need for him 

        29        to draw a map indicating where his residence was 

        30        located.  The direction or the area where

                                       123


                  KAJELIJELI                             16 SEPTEMBER 2002




         1        Mr. Kajelijeli's home was located in Rwinzovu.  His 

         2        residence location to the road and the commune office, 

         3        Busogo church area, the commune office -- that is the 

         4        Mukingo commune office and Byangabo and the direction to 

         5        his school.  So, I would like him to do that in 

         6        preparation for his testimony concerning an 

         7        identification that he made at a certain time.  So, I 

         8        mean, we can -- there is some preparatory questions that 

         9        I can ask and then have him do that.  We can have him 

        10        draw a map, let him bring it in, I am just asking for 

        11        some guidance on how you want to proceed at the moment.

        12   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, as a practical suggestion, we have 

        13        no objection to my learned friend continuing to ask 

        14        questions and having the map prepared overnight and have 

        15        it brought in so that we don't take up the Court's time 

        16        while he is sitting and drawing a map.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, and we would like to hear his evidence 

        18        about these directions which he can ultimately 

        19        concretise them in the map if he has to draw another map 

        20        -- if he has to draw another map at all.  So you can ask 

        21        him questions.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, I don't intend to ask the 

        23        witness any questions concerning that would need the 

        24        map.  I will move to another area.  I am just alluding 

        25        to the Court that as a preparatory matter I would have 

        26        moved in that direction, but if there will be no 

        27        objection by the Prosecutor to the witness drawing a map 

        28        outside of the presence of the Court, I am happy with 

        29        that, and so we will then move on that basis.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, he can do that.  Of course, tomorrow

         1        when you start, if it is tomorrow at all, then of course 

         2        you lay the background then you see how we move through 

         3        the map.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS:  No problem.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, the usual procedure.  All right, move 

         6        on.  We have ten minutes.

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Sir, did there come a time when you learned of the 

         9        President's plane crashing or the crash of the 

        10        President's plane?

        11   A.   Yes, I learnt the news.

        12   Q.   Can you tell the Court how you became aware that the 

        13        President's plane had crashed?

        14   A.   The Government of the Republic of Rwanda had a national 

        15        radio and the population was informed through this radio 

        16        station.  So, it is through -- over Radio Rwanda that I 

        17        learnt that news.

        18   Q.   What time of day did you first learn of the President's 

        19        plane crash?

        20   A.   I remember that I learnt of the news around 9 o'clock in 

        21        the evening.  However, at that time they did not provide 

        22        us with details about the crash.  All that was said was  

        23        that the President's plane was burning.

        24   Q.   What was the date it was when you heard that?  What day 

        25        of the week at 9:00 in the evening when you heard this 

        26        on the government radio?

        27   A.   I recall this was on the 6th.  However, I cannot recall 

        28        what day of the week it was.  But if you give me time to 

        29        think over it, maybe one day I will be in a position to 

        30        do so.  Please let me remind you that I am not a

         1        computer.  And you know, even a computer needs a 

         2        program.

         3   Q.   Sir, were you subsequently given details of the 

         4        President's plane crash?

         5   A.   It was on the 7th, around 6 o'clock in the morning that 

         6        we had news over the national radio, and they talked 

         7        about the death of the President as well as people who 

         8        were in his company.

         9   Q.   On the 7th, the following day where were you at that 

        10        time when you heard the follow-up information?

        11   A.   I might run the risk of revealing my identity if I 

        12        respond to that question.  However, if we could possibly 

        13        go into closed session, I will be able to respond to 

        14        that question.

        15   Q.   Without giving the name of the institution that you were 

        16        in, can you tell us where you were?  Were you in the 

        17        same place that you were in the night before when you 

        18        heard of the President's plane crash the following 

        19        morning?

        20   A.   Yes, I was at the same place.

        21   Q.   Witness JK 311, you testified in closed session and gave 

        22        the names of the institution and the dates.  No one in 

        23        the public knows that information at this point.  So you 

        24        can talk about the school you were in without giving the 

        25        date and it will not compromise your identity.  Do you 

        26        understand that?

        27   A.   Counsel, I have the floor.  Now, if I give the name of 

        28        this institution it will have a bearing on my identity 

        29        because I am the one who knows how my identity could be 

        30        affected.  I would like to rectify what the interpreter

         1        said.  I did not say that I was the one talking.  What I 

         2        was saying is that I am the one giving the information 

         3        and I know how my identity could be compromised if I 

         4        provide that information.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, I not sure whether there is 

         6        some confusion in interpretation.  But it is a very 

         7        contrary instruction I gave to the witness than what his 

         8        understanding is.  So I am not sure whether it is the 

         9        interpretation or it is my lack of conciseness.  I doubt 

        10        the latter.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  I don't think there is -- there could be a 

        12        problem of interpretation.  What he is saying is, 

        13        according to him that in giving -- reacting to the 

        14        question you have just put to him that his identity 

        15        might be revealed.  I mean, that is the essence of what 

        16        he is saying, and he knows -- he says he knows best 

        17        because he is the one providing the information.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, again, maybe everybody is 

        19        confused again but me.  Let me just -- I gave the 

        20        witness some instruction, and what I said, and I repeat 

        21        it very slowly:  Witness JK 311, you gave testimony 

        22        earlier in closed session where you identified your 

        23        university by name, and dates, et cetera.  That no one 

        24        in the public knows that.  At this point you can say 

        25        where you were without giving the name of the university 

        26        and it would not compromise you.  You don't have to give 

        27        the name.  The question is, were you in the same place 

        28        as you were the night before when you heard of the 

        29        President's plane crash?

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  Counsel, I think in view of what might follow

         1        after the answer, and also for clear chronological order 

         2        of this witness with regard to the sequence of events 

         3        after that happening it might be better to follow it up 

         4        in closed session.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS:   I am only trying to accommodate the Court.  

         6        The witness asked to go into closed session, but I am 

         7        trying to accommodate you by trying to work around it.  

         8        But I am glad we are all in agreement.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, but you see, it is not very clear he 

        10        mentioned quite a number of things a number of 

        11        institutions.  So you have to go back, maybe 

        12        cross-check, what-have-you.  So for clarity's sake it 

        13        might cause problems at a later stage.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I agree.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  So what we will do; could you hold up the 

        16        questions of this particular point.  Tomorrow morning -- 

        17        it is 5:30, we start after the usual introductory 

        18        observation then we shall go straight away into closed 

        19        session and start from this particular point for as long 

        20        as it will last.  Okay?

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I am in total agreement, Your Honour.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  So we will adjourn these proceedings 

        23        to tomorrow at 9 a.m., that is one.  And two, that 

        24        Witness JK 311, since you have started your evidence and 

        25        you are still continuing, you need not discuss your 

        26        evidence with anybody until its completed.

        27        

        28        Okay.  So until tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. these proceedings 

        29        stand adjourned.
