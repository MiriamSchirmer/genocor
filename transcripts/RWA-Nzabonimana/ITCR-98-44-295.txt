MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Madam Registrar, can you open the proceedings please?  
MS. KOUO:
Yes, Your Honour.  Thank you.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of                                   Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gberbao Kam, is now           sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 31st of October 2006, for the continuation of trial in             the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I remind you, as usual, that you remain under oath to tell the truth, the oath that you took at the commencement of your testimony.  Your cross-examination will continue. 

Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Most obliged, Mr. President.

CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, let me remind you, you are a protected witness so you want to pay attention to that state of affairs, so that in your answer you should avoid giving information which may lead to your identity being revealed because even though it is not our wish, you are actually a protected witness.  You have heard me.  

Witness, I would like to very briefly revisit some of the information that you gave in connection with the training of the Interahamwe, about which you said you were not an eyewitness but which you learnt of at a date, I really do not understand whether it was prior to or after April 1994.  You also said that the Interahamwe had been issued with weapons.  Can you tell us whether you witnessed that with your own eyes? 
A.	Concerning weapons distribution, sometimes I witnessed the weapons distribution and other times I got the information from other people. 
Q.	I was referring to situations when you saw Interahamwe receive weapons to distribute, that was what I meant.
A.	Counsel, kindly ask your question once again because I realised that the first question put to me is different from the one you've just asked.  So if you could repeat your question, sir?  
Q.	Witness, let me repeat my question.  Were you an eyewitness to the handing over of stocks of weapons to the Interahamwe for distribution purposes? 
A.	Yes, on certain occasions I witnessed that, and on other occasions I was informed. 
Q.	Witness, you said, among other things, that weapons were given to the Interahamwe by the        general staff headquarters.  Were you present when, according to you, weapons were given to the Interahamwe by the general staff headquarters? 
A.	On certain occasions I was not present, but there was a senior officer who was attached to               general staff headquarters, and whom I saw at Kigali préfecture office distributing weapons. 
Q.	My specific question, Witness, was to know whether you accompanied the Interahamwe or you saw them being issued with weapons at staff headquarters; please answer that specific question.
A.	No, I did not see Interahamwe being issued with weapons at staff headquarters, but I learnt of it. 
Q.	I will take the first part of your answer which is the only answer to my question, to wit; you did not witness the handing over of weapons to Interahamwe at staff headquarters.  The remainder is hearsay; you are not an eyewitness to that.  Are we in agreement? 
A.	Counsel, you are right, but let me give you explanations.  Perhaps you did not ask any question in that connection.  However, let me say that there was a senior officer who came to staff headquarters to distribute weapons to the Interahamwes and I was eyewitness to that.  Well, he came to the         Kigali-ville préfecture office. 
Q.	Witness, perhaps we have not understood the ground rules.  When I ask you questions, my wish is for you to answer them not for you to add things unnecessarily which may give you the pretext to answer what is not the question I have put to you.  So in order for us to save time I would like you to answer my questions.  Let you not seize the opportunity to give answers to questions I have not asked you,  always using the (unintelligible) and whatever you are using the bat (sic) to give an out-of-topic answer.  I would like to seek this clarification from you; when you say you saw an officer distributing weapons at the Kigali-ville prefecture, who was that officer?  And now, Witness, kindly answer only my question? 
A.	That officer's name was Gratien Kabiligi.
Q.	What was the date of that event? 
A.	I cannot recall the specific date, but it was in the month of May.  By the way, he did not go there only once, he went there on several occasions; it was in the month of May and June. 
Q.	The months of May and June of which year, sir? 
A.	1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
A.	I thank you too, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, am I correct to say that you attended many MRND rallies? 
A.	You are right, Counsel. 
Q.	You gave us a specific example, it was a rally of 16th of January 1994; do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Did you attend that rally or meeting of the 16th of January 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech on that occasion? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	On that occasion did you hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse say that you had to prevent a situation where by the Tutsi would take over power? 
A.	Yes, I heard that. 
Q.	Are you being categorical about that? 
A.	He did not use the same words, he said it indirectly.  I even believe the question had been put to me by Prosecution counsel and I mentioned the terms that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had used. 
Q.	So it is your interpretation, not what Mathieu Ngirumpatse actually said? 
A.	That was the message he conveyed.  It is not my interpretation.  Granted, he did not use the same words, but the message he conveyed was just that. 
Q.	Am I to think that you ascribed to him your feelings which were not his? 
A.	Counsel, let me repeat this to you once again:  That was the message he wanted to convey. 
Q.	Let me rephrase my question.  Was it a message he conveyed or was it a message you wanted to hear? 
A.	Counsel on that occasion it was obvious.  You see, Rwandans like to speak using parables, they always like to use metaphors, so it is difficult to understand directly.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse often used the word "enemy" and all Rwandans knew those who were being referred to when the word enemy was mentioned, when somebody said, "we would never tolerate people who would not accept the achievements of the 1959 revolution, the enemies of the republic and of democracy.  We will never accept that those people take over power."  At that time, many rallies were organized, and whenever that was referred to and when reference was made to people who had fled the country, people understood very easily that those being referred to were the Tutsi. 
Q.	Witness, if you may, let us kindly focus on my questions.  And right now my questions concern the rally of the 16th of January 1994 which we are fortunate enough to have the transcripts of.  During that rally, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse utter the word "enemy"? 
A.	Counsel, I am very delighted when you say that you are in possession of the transcript of that rally.  I know very well that I am not going to convince you because you have your client to defend, so you want me to give the answers you want.  It is easily understood that you are trying to shroud or to discredit the truth.  However, Mathieu Ngirumpatse referred to that, perhaps in an indirect or roundabout manner, but he said it. 
Q.	Witness, you told us that Rwandans have the habit of speaking in paraphrases (sic).  But in order for us to save time I would like you to answer using direct sentences.  I asked you one question; during that rally did Mr. Ngirumpatse mention the word "enemy"?  You can answer with a yes, a no, or a -- something else like I don't know.  What is your answer? 
A.	But Counsel, sometimes when you want me to answer either yes, no, or I don't know I have the feeling you want to lay an ambush for me.  Someone can relay a message which people can understand that he is referring to the word enemy.  He may do so in an indirect manner but I know that message was conveyed. 
Q.	Witness, that was not my question, and I would like you to answer my question.  If you do not want to do so, then I will have to ask the President to request you to give a specific answer to my specific question.  Did you hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse mention the word "enemy"; yes, no, I don't know, I don't remember? 
A.	I don't remember whether or not he directly used the word "enemy". 
Q.	Thank you for that short answer to a specific question, Witness.  Now, during that meeting of the      16th of January 1994, did you hear him call for war or for peace? 
A.	Counsel, in his speech one could easily analyse that Mathieu was calling on people to wage war, not to make peace. 
Q.	Now, Witness, let me come back to what I said earlier on, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse call for war or did you construe his message as a call for war? 
A.	Counsel, I believe I have answered your question.  He called on the people to wage war.  So from his message one could easily understand he was calling on the people to wage war. 
Q.	Witness, so is it your evidence that in his message Mathieu Ngirumpatse said, "We have to wage war against our enemy"? 
A.	When he said, "We would never accept this" and other utterances of such a nature, what would you understand?  And sometimes when you listen to someone, you need to take into account the tone and context of the speech.  That way you would easily understand exactly what he means by his message. 
Q.	Witness, did you hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse, on the 16th of January 1994, say that democracy had to be trampled, on or did you hear him say that democracy had to be upheld? 
A.	Regarding democracy, he said democracy had to be safeguarded, but I would like to explain to you the type of democracy that prevailed at the time.  It is not the type of democracy which everybody knows, especially during that period.  When reference was made to democracy, all Rwandans could easily understand what was being referred to. 
Q.	Witness, I am not going to take into account the answers wherein you say that you are right, but I just heard another bit which is a transition to an answer to something else than my question.  Witness, you said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse denounced the Arusha Accords.  Did he denounce the Arusha Accords during that meeting of the 16th of January 1994? 
A.	I would say that that was the purpose of the rally.  The purpose of the rally was to denounce the accords, when one looked at the speeches made during that rally. 
Q.	Witness, I have before me a transcription of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech of the                             16th of January 1994.  And I would like to read some paragraphs thereof to you; and you let me know if they confirm what you have been saying.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse made this call -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
We have the transcript of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech in evidence at P. 14, and I think it would be helpful if Mr. Weyl gave the exhibit to the witness.  It is available in Kinyarwanda, French and English.  And rather than selectively reading a sentence here or there, cross-examining on the content of the speech than the entire transcript should be placed before the witness. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think that at this stage it would be a waste of time.  It can be done, but the witness said that he was perfectly familiar with the speech made on the 16th of January 1994.  So I think it can suffice to ask him to make some comments to portions of the speech.  

Now, if Prosecution counsel wants to proceed otherwise, well, he ought to have done so in his examination-in-chief.  He did not do so.  I prefer to proceed through this manner.  This way we are going to save time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Proceed, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  But the witness wants to say something. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would also like that the full transcript be handed to me because perhaps Defence counsel is going to be selective and would focus on certain parts which are favourable to him.  So I support what Prosecution counsel just said. 

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am afraid that such a solution would undermined the quality of what we will have in the morning break because this transcript is something which has already been discussed upon in court.  And if we have to do that, we will -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) ... it is not necessary to prolong the discussion. 

Mr. Witness, counsel is entitled to put your recollection to the test.  So I will have to permit him to cross-examine as he choses.  We will be ensuring that nothing unfair happens.  And if the interest of fairness requires that you see the document at some stage, I will make such an order.  But I will allow him to continue for the time being.  

Mr. Weyl, do you have copies for the Chamber?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it is, indeed, Exhibit P. 14. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can anybody assist us with a copy?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We have copies in my office, Your Honour, I can run -- I think it should be available -- we can look at the same text in the Prosecution exhibit bundle at tab 152.  I believe 152 was placed in evidence as    P. 14.  So, I think the Trial Chamber has the electronic bundle from the Prosecution.  And it is available in all three languages.  I can find the page references from Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech if you give me two minutes. 

In the English at tab 152, Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech starts at page 3 and goes on for another three or four pages.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Let me say I would appreciate it if counsel, on both sides, are going to refer to speeches or transcripts, that copies -- hard copies are made for the Bench so that we can follow the speeches or the transcripts.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. Justice Short, I had the impression that the document was already in evidence as P. 14.  I have only one working copy.  I do not have a second copy.  I am really confused here.  I am earnestly sorry for this difficulty because I thought once the document was in evidence it was at the disposal of the  Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, that is fine.  We have access to it if we had time to search it.  It would just have facilitated the process of your exercise if you were able to comply with the requirement.  As you can see, the registrar is finding the document for us now. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, to be complete, it was mentioned in the list of material which we had said that we would use for our cross-examination and I thought that it would allow for the document to be at the disposal of the Trial Chamber. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I have already submitted my exhibits for this witness and I did not do what Judge Short has asked us to do, and I'm a little bit confused about my responsibilities to supply exhibits to the Chamber.  

It is my understanding that if something is already in the tabs that we were going to refer to, it was not necessary to again make a copy as part of the Defence exhibits, or if something was already in evidence as admitted as a previous exhibit, it was not necessary for me to once again provide a      copy -- a hard copy of that in my list of exhibits.  

So, perhaps you can discuss this amongst yourself, or you can give us some clear guidance because I was not understanding the method of proceedings that Judge Short has just requested, which I'm happy to comply with if that is what needs to be done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you see, we would normally have -- the electronic folders have -- are taking some time to search.  They are not well organised at the moment and that is the problem we have faced with this particular document.  But we will discuss it and give you clear guidelines in the future. 

Mr. Weyl, you may continue.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, I wanted to -- essentially what I wanted was the witness's comments on this paragraph which is on page K0244053 of the transcript: 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	"Militants, dear brothers, we consider, as far as we are concerned, that what might bring back peace is that people should sit together in concert and truly and fairly share power without having to kill each other.  Indeed, they are preparing massacres, and I have said that we left after accepting the       Arusha Accords in order that Rwandans might know peace; and that is our position to date.  We have accepted to participate in the government so that Rwandans might have peace.  And we stand by that to date.  However, I would add that there is no law which obliges a party to participate in a government, just as there is no law obliging a party to stay in it.  No dictatorship, therefore.  We are seeking and fighting for peace.  All MRND militants' purpose -- aim is to not provoke disturbances, and should not like anyone to cause such disturbance to them." 
Witness, do you remember having heard that said during the course of the rally in which you attended?  
A.	They are the -- some of the words uttered by Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Witness, I assert, under, of course, the guidance of the Chamber, that the complete -- under the control of the Chamber and the parties, that in the entirety of the transcript of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech at no point is the word "enemy" -- at no time -- at no point is the word -- can you find the word "Tutsi"; at no point is there incitement to war, incitement --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, Mr. Weyl, when you make that sort of statement to the witness and he doesn't have the document before him, it is impossible for him to answer.  So, basically, you are just telling him what your conclusions about the document are, but he can't answer that question unless he sees the document, if it was intended to be a question. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I should like to finish my statement and ask the witness if he persists in his recollection to deny what I am saying, and eventually give him the document.  But I should like him, from memory, to confirm or deny before, if necessary, refreshing his memory. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this is not a memory test.  I mean, if you are asking him about the content of the document, do you know whether he has ever seen the document?  You know, I don't see how he could answer the question properly, the way you have phrased it, without looking at the document. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Mr. President, if my learned friend is going to insist on proceeding in this way, the Prosecution renews its application for the document to be placed before the witness. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am coming back to what I said.  For the time being, I am not asking him to check if there is in the transcript anything he would deny.  I'm putting it to him a last time, since we have laid the grounds of his presence at the rally.  We had the confirmation from him that he remembers         Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech.  I should like him -- one last time with his memory as it stands before it be refreshed, by reading the document, I should like him to tell me if he remembers having heard what I deny, what I contest, what I challenge, which is that Mathieu Ngirumpatse said one way or another at the meeting.  I am drawing upon his recollections one last time. 
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Respectfully, Mr. President, it is a waste of time.  My friend has already gone through the exercise of asking the witness if he recalls certain words or certain expressions.  So, we are now at the stage for the document to be placed before him. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it seems to me that the witness was coming to tell the Trial Chamber what he had heard, to answer my questions, and it is only in the last stage that we go to verification with documentation; otherwise, it would merely suffice to enter the document without having witnesses whom -- whose testimony has to be tested. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the witness has already given his testimony about his recollection of what was said.  But you are trying to put it to the witness that you, having read the document, have not seen certain statements in the document.  And you are asking the witness to confirm that.  Now, the witness cannot confirm that without looking at the document.  So if you want to use the document to contradict the witness, you should show him the document.  But he has already given his testimony.  If the document contradicts what he says, you should show him the document. 
MR. WEYL: 
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but that is the ruling now, unless you want to ask another question.  But before you put that question to him, it is not fair to do it without him seeing the document.  But if you wish to ask another question, you may move on. 
MR. WEYL: 
Well, Mr. President, therefore we will take the Trial Chamber's time to show the document to the witness to refresh his memory before giving him a last chance to answer my question which was drawing purely upon his recollection.  We are going to give him the document.  And, sorry, only that I couldn't go to the end of the exercise, which is to use the witness for what he is, not the reader of documents was called here to confirm the contents of documents, but to come here and speak of what he knows and -- and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, Mr. Weyl, I have already ruled.  The witness has already given his testimony, and you are trying to contradict him.  Let's get right to the point. 
MR. WEYL: 
But, Mr. President, I responded to your decision by asking that the entirety of the transcripts of   Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech of the 16th of January 1994 be shown to the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, Your Honours, I stepped out for my copies of that exhibit now, because I have two copies in English and my assistant is bringing down another copy in French and Kinyarwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, an additional English copy would be helpful. 
Mr. Weyl, what is the problem?  Mr. Weyl, what is the problem?  
MR. WEYL: 
Well, Mr. President, I have my version, my personal copy of exhibit 14, the French transcript; and Mr. Issa does not have the French transcript.  So, if we are going to give a Kinyarwanda version and I have to work -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have a copy of the French transcript that we can make available to the witness.  Just let Mr. Weyl confirm that that is the right document, please. 
MR. WEYL: 
This is the version, but it is at -- it begins at K0244051.  And Mr. Issa is only showing me K0244053, so a page is missing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, can you come to our assistance?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, an assistant should be on her way here shortly with the French and the Kinyarwanda, and I have two copies of the English here and then you will each have complete copies.  Actually, I have a copy of the Kinyarwanda that is unblemished. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Show it to Mr. Weyl so he can confirm that it is the document that he wants the witness to see. 

Mr. Issa, if you could get the document from Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEYL: 
That is it, Mr. President.  So, I should like the witness to read the entirety of the speech, from K024401 to K0244055. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think Mr. Issa understood me.  The French text is for Judge Kam and the two English texts that he put on the registrar's desk are for each of the two Judges.  And the witness now has the Kinyarwanda text. 
MR. WEYL: 
I am not in a position to follow the Kinyarwanda with the witness.  You can give him that version, but it wouldn't be the same exercise.  I should like that, to the extent that he knows French, that he work on the same version as I. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, could you read it and tell us when you've finished reading it? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, Mr. Weyl, what is the next question you want to put to the witness?  

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, you are speaking of the speech of the 16th of January 1994?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, I asked, what was the next question that you wished to put to the witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Well, if it is anything other than this speech of the 16th of January 1994, it will nonetheless be something based on the answer that he will give me regarding the speech of the 16th of January 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, you are misunderstanding me.  I don't relish sitting here doing nothing for half an hour.  So I wanted to know what was the question you were going to ask the witness to see whether it was necessary for us to wait for him to read the entire document.  

So what was the -- what was the question you were going to ask him, about so let's whether he can answer it or not?
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I do not want the witness to know at this stage what will be the chain of questioning, because I will no longer master the questioning and how to call upon his memory as I wish.  He has got his earphones and he hears everything we are saying.  I cannot answer you, Mr. President, without betraying the chain of questioning and without revealing everything to the witness who hears everything. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we did not say that you should direct the witness to read the entire document before you asked your question.  We said the witness should have access to the document.  So now I am asking to you continue your cross-examination.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, there really is a problem of understanding as to the way I wish to put the questions to the witness and the way I am being asked to proceed by first refreshing his memory.  I wanted to ask him if he remembered that in the Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech there was the word "Tutsi".  I am told for that, for the questioning to be fair he should have access to the entirety of the speech before him to answer my question, is the word Tutsi present in the speech, he has to finish reading it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, that is not why the witness was -- I said the witness should see the document.  You began to make an assertion that in that document you had certain things were not in it, and you wanted the witness to comment on that.  He could not comment on that without seeing the document.  Now could you have asked him, if you wanted to, whether he recalled whether the word Tutsi was used in the speech, which is a completely different question?  

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, my work -- my question was and is --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is why I am telling you that it is not necessary to wait for half an hour before continuing your cross-examination. 
MR. WEYL: 
Well, Mr. President, I will put the question to the witness. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Is it in Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech between the first page and the last page; does he say the word "Tutsi"? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you say the question in that form the witness must read the document before he can tell you what is in it.  That is a completely different question to asking him what his recollection was.  

I'm wondering whether we should just rise. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, since the outset, regarding the speech of the 16th of January 1994, the line of questioning has been to lead the witness to see -- to say there is not the word "enemy" not the word "Tutsi", no call to violence, no call to war, there is no denouncement of the Arusha Accords.  The things he said, Mathieu Ngirumpatse said, I wanted to say from his memory that he confirmed that there was not the word Tutsi, not the word enemy, no denunciation of the Arusha Accord.  I'm told that to undertake that exercise he has to check the speech, either he checks it or he doesn't, but I don't know what to do any more, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're going to rise for five minutes. 
(Court recessed from 0950H to 1001H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, you know we do have reluctance to make certain types of remarks, but the point is we have been following this case.  This particular speech, there has been a lot of evidence about it already, and we have the transcript of the speech.  So we understand the issue involved, but you are going about it in a very strange manner.  There is abundant evidence on the record that the particular words that you are referring to are not in the transcript that is put into testimony.  But we already have had that evidence.  We already read the transcript.  It is already on the record, so we know that.  So we understand the issue which is very simple; was the metaphors to which the witness referred capable of the meaning that he has given them or not.  
So I don't understand why you are going about your cross-examination in this manner because we understand what the issue is that you are driving at, and you can come to it quite simply and directly if you need to do it again because it has been addressed with other witnesses already.  And we recall what has transpired in our case. 

You may proceed now.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have to argue with me.  Continue with your cross-examination. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, please don't address me.  Please continue with your cross-examination. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you have read the full speech of the 16th of January 1994 I believe, is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, I just read that speech, but I have not had the time to analyse it. 
Q.	Witness, without it being necessary for you to analyse it, is there any mention of the word "enemy" in that speech? 
A.	Counsel, as I just said, you remember I told you that Rwandans speak in paraphrases.  If the translation made was adequate, if someone was able to translate the speech into French, it would be quite surprising, it would be a feat because I know that that speech has many paraphrases in Kinyarwanda which are very complicated.  I really don't know whether the translation done was of this speech.  I do not know whether you have the translation.  If you do have it and if you ask me to then I'm going to peruse certain portions of that speech.  But as far as I know the entire speech only conveyed the message I have talked to you about. 
Q.	Witness, my question was simple:  Does the word "enemy" appear in that speech, yes, no, I have read the speech, I have not read it?  Does the word appear in that speech or not? 
A.	Counsel, I think you want to be direct.  You want to find out if we must see the word enemy in the speech, but I am telling you that Rwandans speak in paraphrases.  It is true you are not going to see the word "enemy" in the speech.  If you look closely, if you carry out a deep-seated analysis you will realise that Mathieu was only conveying the message that I have told you from the beginning to the end of this speech.  

If, for instance, you go to page 4, that is, if you are willing to -- counsel, if you are willing to, when you look at page 4 it is said:  "Those people who prepare lists to kill people ought to sit at the place where they did that and think about the fate of those who prepared the ones of 1959."  So in the entire speech one realises that Mathieu is referring to the 1958-59 period, during which period people were killed.  We know very well the category of people who were killed during that period.  And in that speech, in the entire speech reference is made to those category of people.  

They talk about the presence of the UN in Rwanda.  There is reference to the people who killed Nydadaye, and it is said, "In Rwanda, we will never accept what happened in Burundi at the time of Ndadaye's murder would also occur in Rwanda."  Let me continue.  He says as follows:  

"So we cannot claim that there is security insofar as we are planning to prepare lists of people to be exterminated.  The blood of President Habyarimana, the blood of Justin Mugenzi,                        Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Karemera and so on will never wipe out the existence of the republic." 

Then he continues by saying:  "If ever the blood was spilled, then rest assured that it will have an impact, it would not be the same situation as we had in Burundi at the time of Ndadaye's murder."  

So, Mr. President, I would like to tell you that in the entire speech of Mathieu Ngirumpatse only calls people to wage war.  If you carry out a comprehensive analysis of this speech you will realise this easily.  On page 5, the last but one paragraph, he says as follows -- and I would ask you to refer to page 5.  I have only the Kinyarwanda version which states thus: 

"Those who went to tell the UN soldiers and the United Nations secretary-general special representative that we are preparing for fighting, that we have distributed weapons, that we are organising military training and so on and so forth, it is as if the MRND is doing only that, as if the MRND is no longer working." 

Once again, I am telling you that if Rwandans want to speak, they do not speak directly. The reality is there.  At least we are prepared.  They were distributed.  Tutsi were killed, as was the case in 1959.  He talks about the republic, and while referring to the republic he means we no longer want monarchy.  So you need to understand by that that the republic had toppled the monarchy.  So it was along those lines that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was speaking.  I think what I said is correct.  

You said the word "enemy" does not appear here, but when you talk about fighting, do you fight a friend or an enemy?  So he was calling on people to prepare for the war, and this is apparent throughout this speech.  I remember that you asked me the question whether in this speech the word war could be found.  Yes, I have seen it.  You need to take into account the context of that period.  

Here and now we are in 2006, but let me tell you that the speech was delivered in January 1994.  You need to know what the prevailing situation was.  President Habyarimana had just been sworn in, and on the 8th there were demonstrations organised by the MRND, which did not want to participate in the government.  And this rally took place on the 16th of January 1994.  That was after Bucyana's death.  His death was followed by the massacre of Tutsi in Gikondo.  So as you can see, when he talks about President Habyarimana's death, Mathieu was warning people saying, if ever the president were to be killed then the Tutsi were to be ready for something bad.  And that is what happened.  When the president was killed, Tutsi were killed.  That is what happened.  

Mr. President, I think I have answered the question put to me.  You had asked me to analyse the speech.  And I have realised that he is only relying on the words without carrying out any analysis.  But if one were to carry out a comprehensive analysis, we would realise that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was calling on the people to wage war and were engaged in killings.  

Mr. President, I would make this request of the Chamber to analyse this speech.  I don't know whether the translation was properly done.  I am not sure that the French document is a perfect translation of the Kinyarwanda version.  
Q.	Witness, a question was put to you, which question you could answer with a yes or a no, because my question could be answered simply.  But you rambled and argued during a period of 16 minutes.  I'm sorry, this is delaying my cross-examination.  You have wasted time to answer my question.  

But according to you, it was necessary to accept for lists to be prepared because you are blaming Mathieu Ngirumpatse for condemning those people who were preparing lists for people to be assassinated.  So, according to you, was it necessary for lists to be prepared? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you for this very interesting question.  I am not of that opinion that it was not necessary to prepare lists.  But if he was aware that opponents were preparing lists, the conclusion I can draw is that on its part the MRND was preparing its own lists, and it used those lists to kill people.  So as you can see, lists were prepared, everyone could observe that. 
Q.	Witness, you blamed Mathieu Ngirumpatse for saying that President Ndadaye's fate was inacceptable -- was unacceptable.  Do you think it was necessary to accept President Ndadaye's fate? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  What I am saying does not mean that I was in favour of what happened in Burundi.  But when he referred to that and when, subsequently, the president was killed, his death was followed by killings.  So I could not accept that.  If the president was killed, that did not mean that people had to be killed.  So if he said it that way it means that he was planning something. 
Q.	Witness, if Mathieu Ngirumpatse was sounding the alarm on the risk of an exacerbation of the situation and also urging people to make peace, was it to avoid blood bath, or, otherwise, was it to sound the alarm that warmongers were risking a blood bath? 
A.	Counsel, from what I can see you are still relying on the words which were used.  You are interpreting them directly.  It is true that the speech had some beautiful language, but you need to look at what ensued.  That is how we spoke, but you need to know what was in his heart.  Besides I am sure that if Tutsi were killed it was not because of President Habyarimana's death, because even before his demise Tutsi were already being killed. 
Q.	Witness, in the course of your testimony, and even a short while ago in connection with               Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech of the 16th of January 1994, you reminded us of the prevailing situation in Rwanda.  Rwanda had been at war since 1990; is that correct? 
A.	At that time there was war between the government forces and the RPA troops, the Inkotanyi.  But there was a cease fire in place.  Quite the contrary, during that period there were many demonstrations.  People were trying to secure positions for themselves in the government which had to be set up. 
Q.	Witness, you just used the expression "the RPA of the Inkotanyi," I believe it is not a translation problem; is it?  
A.	Indeed, I said RPA. 
Q.	Witness, you said "RPA of the Inkotanyi"? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  So even in 2006 when you refer to the RPA you still attached to that abbreviation the term Inkotanyi.  And let me remind you, Witness, that we are still in 2006. 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	Witness, there were occupied territories in 1994, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	There were displaced persons? 
A.	Quite so. 
Q.	Since 1990? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	From 1990 to 1994 the attacks committed by the RPA or the Inkotanyi were in great numbers, regular and were constant? 
A.	That is possible, but I was not aware of that. 
Q.	Yesterday, when we looked at some portions of Lieutenant Ruzibiza's book referring to attacks carried out by the RPA of the Inkotanyi, garbed in Interahamwe uniforms, you confirmed to me that it was the case? 
A.	Counsel, you are putting words in my mouth.  I didn't say that. 
(Pages 1 to 16 by Donna M. Lewis)






1030H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, the words you've been using since your evidence-in-chief --
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I'm sorry to interrupt, but recalling our -- the discussion of this point on -- yesterday, that I don't recall anywhere in Ruzibiza's book where he says that there were APR members that were garbed as Interahamwe.  If Mr. Weyl can find it, he can direct me to it, but I would prefer that that inaccuracy not be put to the witness as something that Ruzibiza himself stated. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Amongst the two portions which were entered yesterday, there is this passage, which says as follows:  "Minister Félicien Gatabazi was murdered by members of the RPA, who had dissimulated themselves amongst the Interahamwe."  Is that sufficient information for my learned friend? 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's fine, that's exactly what was written in the book, but I don't think that that was what Mr. Weyl said earlier.  He said they were dressed as Interahamwe; it's two different things.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'm very sensitive to Mr. Webster's interruption, which simply highlights the fact that there was extreme difficulty in identifying Interahamwe who could not even be identifiable.  I don't think it is necessary for me to read the second portion which was entered into evidence yesterday, which shows that even with or without uniforms many things were ascribed to the Interahamwe.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, to come back to my question, which was interrupted by my learned friend, during your evidence-in-chief on countless occasions you used the word "war".  Correct? 
A.	You are talking about war -- that I often referred to war, but I would like to know under what circumstances?  And, let me tell you that I am concerned by your use of the word "often".  
Q.	Witness, I think if we read the transcript we will be able to know how many times you mentioned war.  You also talked about the front, isn't it (sic)? 
A.	That's possible, given that there was war in Rwanda.  In Rwanda, there was war and there was genocide.  
Q.	From 1990 to 1994, there was a permanent situation of war.  There was a war front; there was occupied territory; there were displaced persons; there were casualties; there were attacks; there were mines laid and there was shelling.  Do we agree? 
A.	Please tell me the people who were killed and which category suffered most, because I have the feeling you want to lay an ambush on me?  Which ethnic group suffered the situation more than the other? 
Q.	Witness, you see, as far as I'm concerned, Rwandans suffered.  So, my question was simply to review the circumstances in which you yourself mentioned regarding the state of war with the war front, occupied territories, displaced persons, casualties and attacks.  Now, if you make a distinction between those who should be given preference over others, that is not my case.  But, if you are asking me to recall all that and to confirm that you have it all in mind -- to ask your question:  On both sides of the front, what do you have, friends or enemies? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel, for this conclusion that you've drawn, I fully agree with you.  But I should like to ask you to distinguish between war and genocide.  If I am here, it's because there was a genocide. Everyone knows in what context a war takes place and everybody knows in what context a genocide can occur, and it's quite different from waging war than from committing genocide.  Because you're waging war, doesn't mean you have to indulge in genocide.  The one does not justify the other.  Those who were the victims of the genocide were the Tutsi, and if you're trying to push that aside, the only conclusion one can draw is that there was no equality in Rwanda.  
Q.	Witness, on either side of a battlefront, are there friends or enemies? 
A.	I agree with you.  You have an enemy and your enemy looks upon you as his enemy, but you have to know who were the parties at war and see whether the war was necessary.  I think that the war was not necessary.  A war between Rwandan brothers -- the sort of war it was -- the sort of wars we know are wars between different countries.  As to that war, it was a fratricidal war, and in a war only soldiers are concerned.  I know that there are laws to observe during war, but in the situation that prevailed in Rwanda, it was the civilians who suffered from the war.  Civilians were not involved in the war and those civilians were killed by people bearing weapons -- arms, firearms.  
Q.	Witness, it was the RPF which attacked in 1990? 
A.	I agree with you entirely.  
Q.	Witness, it was the RPF and the RPA which occupied the territory that was occupied? 
A.	Yes, but they didn't occupy the whole territory.  The major part of the country was not under RPF control.  
Q.	Witness, on one side of the battlefront there was the RPF and the RPA, we agree on that? 
A.	Yes, the RPF is the political branch whereas the RPA is the military branch.  The RPF is the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front, which is a political front.  It is like a political party, if you will, and there also was the military branch of that political party which was called the RPA.  
Q.	You told us before that RPA means Inkotanyi? 
A.	That's what you say.  I never said that the RPA is synonymous -- synonymous with the RPA.  I said the RPA-Inkotanyi.  I never said that one meant the other.  
Q.	Witness, in a country at war -- a country, part of which its territory is occupied, a country where there are regular incursions by the RPA and a country where there are incursions by armed forces, is it absurd to speak of an enemy? 
A.	Yes, you can use that term but I wish to repeat, Counsel, that you have to ask yourself who was attacking and who was being attacked.  Who, in other words, were the belligerents?  That's what you must ask yourself:  Who were the belligerents?  Were they civilians or were they soldiers?  As I see it, it should be soldiers who fight.  
Q.	Witness, when you speak of belligerents, is it absurd that prominent figures might speak of the existence of an enemy? 
A.	Counsel, it's really a shame to go on using the term "enemy" up to the tragedy of the genocide.  Between times, there was a war, but subsequently, there were negotiations.  It is true that in 1990 a war broke out in Rwanda, but there were the Arusha Accords signed on the 4th of August 1993.  And the fact of having signed the agreements and go on speaking of "enemy", whereas you've already signed a peace agreement, therein lies the problem.  You are the jurist -- the legal expert.  You know the law better than I.  You know the contents of the Arusha Accords and the Arusha Accords were not respected.  
Q.	Witness, as of which moment which speech includes the word "enemy"?   At which time could the speeches contain the word "enemy" and at which time do they no longer include the term? 
A.	Well, in the years -- in the '60s -- in the '60s, that was when the word "enemy" was used very often.  But after the people went into exile, they used the term, enemies of the country -- to be more precise, and then towards the '90s -- in 1990, they used the words enemies of the country.  But more precisely, they said the enemy that had attacked the country, and that the enemy were, for the most part, Tutsi who came from Uganda.  That is what was said at that time and I think I have already spoken of that.  
Q.	Witness, that is not quite correct --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness interjects or answers --
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, I was present in my country; it wasn't you who was in Rwanda.  I confirm that what I'm saying is the truth.  I am the one who lived through the situation.  I'm a Rwandan and I've learnt the history of Rwanda.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I don't challenge that, but I'm saying that to specific questions you answered with paraphrases, and each time you say that Rwandans speak in paraphrase -- in paraphrases, sorry -- and I'm telling you that the one I am representing here never spoke in paraphrases and always named things by their name and you are the one ascribing intentions to him.  I say that when 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse speaks of those who, in 1994, continued to perpetrate attacks in spite of the Arusha Accords -- that they should stop, you agree with that? 
A.	Counsel, I think I've answered that question, but if you want me to I will repeat my answer.  Who was he talking to and how?  If he says that there are people killing other people, he's speaking in favour of his own political party -- in favour of his militants and more particularly, the Interahamwe.  He didn't speak of the acts committed by his own party.  On the contrary, he was accusing the other parties.  He wanted to say that the other party was committing -- the other parties were committing misdeeds.  But he considered his party to be innocent.  I think I spoke of the acts committed by the Interahamwe yesterday -- or, previously, you were speaking of the death of Gatabazi, but he wasn't the only one killed.  Many people were killed.  But he never blamed the Interahamwe.  Why?  Why didn't he blame the -- why didn't he blame the Interahamwe? 
Q.	Well, other people took charge of that, including accusing them of acts that they didn't commit.  I will come back quite simply to what I was after when there were attacks committed by the RPA-Inkotanyi -- by the Inkotanyi.  Was it legitimate to denounce the attacks committed by the RPA-Inkotanyi or should he have kept quiet? 
A.	Well, Counsel, you just said it.  One should be categorically opposed to misdeeds, but you mustn't forget your own part.  Other people committed acts, you say, and they said that it wasn't the Interahamwe that had done it.  But do you mean the Interahamwe were really innocent, that they did not commit acts of violence? 
Q.	Witness, it is not me answering the questions, so don't interpret in any way my intention not to answer your question.  
MR. WEYL:
Now, Mr. President, I don't know if you want to make a break or when you want to make it in view of the short break we had before.  Should you wish to make a break now, I'm prepared to put my last question before we have the break.  I will abide by the Bench in view of the time, which is already ten to eleven, as I see. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take the recess after your next question. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, my last question at this stage:  When in a speech one denounces acts committed by the RPA, acts committed by the RPA -- by the Inkotanyi, to speak of those acts committed by troublemakers or by enemies, is it to say that the enemy is the Tutsi? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, for putting that question to me.  The fact that you have put that question to me allows me to be more explicit than in the answer I gave before.  When you use the word "enemy" in the context of the time, I have explained that the Interahamwe and soldiers, when they killed people, they said they were going to fight the enemy.  Now, at -- in that -- at that time, the enemy was the Tutsi and whoever opposed Habyarimana's regime.  
Q.	Witness, your answer provokes a post-last question:  According to you, therefore, and contrary to what you have been saying up to now, there was no enemy, no RPF, no RPA, no front, no war, no occupied territory, no refugees, no exodus provoked by the RPF attacks or the Inkotanyi?  Or, there was nothing of all that, so there was no enemy? 
A.	I think I have answered that question on several occasions many times.  When there are belligerents, the other party is your enemy, but there was no reason to consider a neighbour with whom one shares every day -- a civilian, there's no need to consider him to be an enemy.  All Tutsis were not enemies.  It's true that there were Tutsi at the front, but if you consider everyone -- your neighbours, civilians who were unarmed -- unarmed civilians as an enemy, then it becomes a very serious problem.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have only one thing to say, it was my last question at this stage in the morning and I will attempt to finish my cross.  I'll do my best to finish before the end of the morning.  But it might be that I will take a bit of time in the afternoon in view of the way things have unfolded.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take our short recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1050H to 1126H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl, you can continue.  
MR. WEYL:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, just before we took the morning adjournment, you told us that there's no reason why you should consider a neighbour with whom you share everything on a daily basis and who is a civilian as an enemy.  I agree with you in total.  

Were you home from the 6th to the 11th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I was home up until the 12th.  
Q.	So you were home up until the 11th in any case, and did you listen to the radio on that occasion? 
A.	I listened to the radio, but from time to time, whatever the case throughout that period, I was home.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, did you hear the speech made by Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 10th of April 1994? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Witness, fortunately we have that speech because it is in evidence with Exhibit No. D. NZ22A, B and C.  Since you tell me that you did not hear it, I would like you to familiarise yourself with it, and here I will need the assistance of Mr. Issa to give you a copy thereof.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, we have a courtesy copy for you, if you wish to have one. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, in what language? 
MR. WEYL:
The choice is yours, Mr. President, exceptionally.  

I will give you an English copy, Mr. President.  

This is for the witness.  I have other copies in French for Mr. Justice Kam, if he wishes to have one. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we just need one copy in English, thank you.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	The document is before you, Witness, you may now read it.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	To save useful Court time -- but, of course, I will defer to the determination of the Court, we could look at the last two lines of the part which is in the box, Witness, and read it to us.  Have you found it, Witness? 
A.	Please, Counsel, can you leave me enough time to read the entire extract?  If I'm going to read it, I wish to read it all.  

I have finished, Counsel.  
Q.	Could you read for us on the right-hand side of the page the three last lines beginning with Niba rero ... in Kinyarwanda.  I think you have the Kinyarwanda version, is it? 
A.	Yes, that is correct and I have finished reading.  
Q.	Could you then read it to us? 
A.	Thank you.  "Nibyorero -- so it is true the person who -- who attacks our militants are the -- those who attack them are Inkotanyi and not simple civilians at home.  So, the population has to ensure its security jointly with the army.  Like I said, one must protect oneself ... in con -- in con -- jointly with the soldiers" and, then, there is something missing.  

Then, they say:  "It is true that the person who attacks are militants -- are members of the 
RPF-Inkotanyi."

In -- in brief, all I can say -- I just don't get what is meant here, because it's full of dots; it's unclear what it means. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, either it's the exercise of reading which is complicated or the exercise of translating it which is complicated.  Because in the translation I have before me, the paragraph that I wanted him to read is just this:

"Our militants must know that those who are infringing on their rights, who are attacking them, are the Inkotanyi, not the simple citizen at home on his hill." 

And then you have three dots, and I wanted to ask the witness:  Please, Witness, this sentence, "Our militants must know that those who are infringing their rights and attacking them are the Inkotanyi, not the simple citizen at home on his hill." 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Is that very different from what you told us a while back before the break -- the enemy is the RPF, not our neighbour? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel, I thank you for having shown me this extract and given me an explanation which allows me in turn to give you a few explanations on the subject of this extract.  

What you see is that there was killing and, as you know, the military Inkotanyi occupied part of the country, but there was another part of the country that wasn't under the control of the Inkotanyi.  You spoke of hills where people lived and the Inkotanyi military was not fighting in people's houses.  What I know is that people who killed people went to kill them at home -- in their homes.  It wasn't the Inkotanyi who went to people's houses to kill them.  

I see that you don't seek to put what I'm telling you in context.  Here, they refer to the Inkotanyi.  Well, I should like to ask you whether Inkotanyi would go to people's houses to kill them at home.  It is just distracting people's attention.  
Q.	Witness, I will take your comments for what they are -- and I'm coming back to this comparison of what you're saying and Mathieu Ngirumpatse's conclusion, "Our militants must know that the people infringing their rights, who are attacking them, are the Inkotanyi -- not the simple citizen at home on his hill."  You don't even want to share that with Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I do not agree with what Mathieu Ngirumpatse is saying.  I know that the Inkotanyi never attacked the civilians at home on the hills.  The Inkotanyi did not kill people who were not in the combat zone -- on the battle zone.  
Q.	Witness, you have read the entirety of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech on the 10th of April 1994.  Do you agree with him when he says that the militants must leave the roads; that thieves must stop thieving, that killers must stop killing?  Do you agree with him when he asks all militants instead of wrongdoing -- rather, to ensure each other's security, especially that of the weak?  Can you share that with 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Counsel, I think that the speech could be interpreted as that if Mathieu Ngirumpatse had asked the Interahamwe not to kill people -- in that speech, he's speaking to militants -- MRND militants as a whole.  It would seem that the Interahamwe were not part of the MRND membership.  That speech fits well with a communiqué from the top-ranking officers in the army who were asking the members of the population to stay at home.  And then the Interahamwe would go to those people's homes to kill them  and that -- as of the 7th of April until July.  So as you have observed, Mathieu Ngirumpatse never made an appeal to the Interahamwe to stop killing people.  
Q.	Witness, without entering into a debate on Mathieu Ngirumpatse's authority -- alleged authority over the Interahamwe, I should like to re-read what I have just read because you mustn't -- you can't say see daylight when it's blinding.  But what I just read:  "In my capacity as president of the MRND -- 
chairman of the MRND, I should like to appeal to all members of the MRND, especially the youth, instead of doing wrong, to ensure other people's security, especially that of the weak."  You persist in not wanting to see daylight -- in not wanting to see the light.  
A.	Well, thank you.  Once more I should like to make it specific -- specific and make it clear that that speech is vague.  It contains lovely words, but that was not translated into action, where if you go on with this extract, you'll see that he says:  "We have sent people to ensure the security of others."  But one did not note the presence of those people among the population.  All one saw was that the killing continued.  We never saw the presence of those people.  We never saw that delegation that was supposed to go to the Interahamwe and ask them to stop killing.  So, he only said so but it was never translated into fact -- into action, whether it be members of the population or secteural conseillers, no one saw that delegation.  
Q.	Witness, it's normal that you wouldn't have seen them, since you told us you were at home from the 
6th to the 12th of April, so it is normal that you didn't see what happened between the 
6th and the 12th of April.  
A.	Counsel, certainly I was at home, as you say, but at that time there was a communiqué by the top-ranking officers asking people to stay home.  So, I don't see how those people could have left their homes, whereas there was a communiqué asking people to stay at home.  There were people I worked with, who would give me reports -- who reported to me and they never told me of anything like that.  They never reported on -- on things in that fashion.  
Q.	For things to be clear, I won't put questions to you which you can't know because you were at home.  For things to be quite clear, I wish to say that we've heard at length witnesses in preceding sessions speaking of the pacification tours by missionaries at the time when you tell us you were cloistered at home.  

There is one thing I didn't understand very well.  In examination -- in your examination-in-chief and which you might set right, as you know how to do, you told us on the 26th of October, page 25 of the French transcript:  "I told you the time at which I arrived ..." I won't say the place because you're a protected witness -- "When I arrived there, there were people who spoke to me about it.  For example, someone whom I met at Kigali-urban préfecture on the 7th."  

I don't understand very well how you could meet someone at the préfecture on the 7th, if you were at home from the 6th to the 12th.  Can you clarify that difficulty for me? 
A.	Counsel, perhaps there was a problem in the translation.  I don't think I said that.  What I said was I went to the Kigali-urban préfecture on the 12th, not on the 7th.  
Q.	Well, it's terrible if transcripts are incorrect. 
Well, Witness, whether it was the 11th or the 12th, you've told us just now it was the 12th, you had to cross several roadblocks when you went to Kigali-urban préfectoral offices? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	You passed without difficulty, you passed freely? 
A.	I think that question was put to me by the Prosecutor and I told him it was very difficult to cross those roadblocks.  
Q.	But, nonetheless, you did cross them and, moreover, your presence here among us today is proof of that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	You crossed all of the roadblocks -- tens and tens and tens -- or, dozens at which you detailed the positioning of in your response to the OTP.  
A.	Yes, it is obvious that I crossed them.  But that doesn't mean that I crossed all the roadblocks on 
merely -- solely on that day, the 12th.  
Q.	You had the necessary authority to cross the roadblocks.  Don't tell me what your position or function was but -- you're protected -- but you must have had authority to cross them as easily as you did? 
A.	Yes, first of all I had to explain and when they understood who I was, they would let me cross.  
Q.	Did you participate in establishing the criteria for those who passed and those who didn't pass, is that correct? 
A.	It was not stated openly, but it was the procedure that was adopted.  
Q.	You are well placed to describe those criteria? 
A.	Counsel, a while back you said that I had explained everything, including those criteria.  Are -- are you inviting me to repeat the answer that I gave? 
Q.	No, I'm merely asking if you knew what the criteria were if you were well placed to know them, or if you didn't know them? 
A.	I did not know the criteria, but it was blindingly obvious.  In fact, I spoke to you of the situation that obtained and of the practice as it was.  
Q.	I have your testimony, in addition to your plea of guilty -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Counsel, please repeat that K number.  

Sorry, Mr. President, we missed it.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I will repeat:  I have before me your additional statement -- supplementary statement of the 
*************** 2004, K0458474 in which you state:  "Only the Interahamwe and soldiers who generally cooperated with the Interahamwe can describe the criteria they applied to identify the Inkotanyi and their accomplices."  Any comment?  
A.	Counsel, I should like to ask you to go on reading and when you come to the following line, you will be able to see what it's about.  
Q.	I'm getting there, I'm getting there.  
A.	I'm saying it because I think that it is the answer to your question -- or, an answer to your question.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, except that the beginning of the sentence, the first two words are "later" -- it's one word in English, two words in French.  So I am before that -- open quotes "later" end quotes, when you are on the roadblock -- at the roadblocks the first days, did you know the criteria? 
A.	Well, it's easily understandable, but I didn't know the criteria as such, which is why I added that sentence.  And I should like to ask you to read the sentence so that everybody hears it.  
Q.	I'm getting there, Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would like the document to be placed in front of the witness so he can read the sentence himself if he chooses to.  That's part of his answer; he has asked twice already that it be read into the record.  

Does the witness have a copy of his statement in front of him? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, my copy is available to the witness, but I must say that the witness has given a clear indication of his memory of his statement because I read him the first lines and he says, "Go on, read the following two lines."  He has a very clear brilliant memory.  But to help him, I'm quite ready for 
Mr. Issa to come and hand to him the copy I have here.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	May I continue, Witness? 
A.	Counsel, you may continue.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I thought we were going to read the second sentence into the record? 
MR. WEYL:
Well, that's what I was going to do, Mr. Prosecutor, if you would be kind enough not to interrupt me. 

Can I proceed, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, proceed. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	"Later on, it became apparent that the killers and bandits were taking it out against Tutsi, especially because they said most of them were supporting the RPF.  Let me also recall that amongst the Interahamwe were Tutsi who were killing their own."  Does that refresh your recollection regarding your statement -- you have it before you?  You have nothing to say about it? 
A.	I confirm my statement; I have the French version here.  It would be perhaps better for you to give me the Kinyarwanda version, but so far everything is consistent with what I said.  
Q.	Witness, slightly on top of that same page, starting with K0358474, on line five, is written as follows: 

"The youth wings of the various political parties took advantage of it; they allied themselves with certain civilians who could not be recognised because sometimes they were in civilian attire to, according to them, avenge the death of the president of the republic.  They said that the Inkotanyi and their accomplices had to answer for the death of President Habyarimana."

Do you have anything to change to this statement? 
A.	What you just read is correct.  
Q.	Witness, now, turn two pages over and go to page 4, which is K0358476.  Please go to the last paragraph starting with, "I know nothing regarding the planning of the genocide" in French, at the end of the fourth line you have the word "I" in French.  Could you read what follows? 
A.	Counsel, before I read I would like you to continue reading a little bit further.  If you could continue reading that sentence; it is not a long sentence.  You are deliberately skipping the most relevant parts for me and you are looking at parts which are favourable to you.  
Q.	Witness, that's my duty -- as the distribution of roles, but, if you want, I am going to read your statement myself:  "Let me once more state that the youths, who political parties say were fighting for the power of the Hutu also became Interahamwe after that date of the 6th of April 1994.  It was like in the jungle, the authorities had no inference (sic)."  Do you have anything to change to your statement? 
A.	That was the state of affairs.  
Q.	Witness, I would like to come back to the first statement, which you gave Mr. Don Webster on the 8th, 10th and 15th of October 2002.  On page 6, number K0257071, you state as follows:  "From the 
6th of April, the youth of all political parties became Interahamwe and amongst them most were bandits and uneducated people."  Do you have anything to change to that statement? 
A.	That is correct, nothing to change.  But it would be better for you to keep on reading; there is a very interesting portion.  
Q.	Witness, I think the entire statement is in evidence.  It was entered yesterday, at the end of the day following my cross-examination.  But, here, if I want to draw the attention of the Court to what is of relevance to me I think that is my entitlement.  

Now, Witness, I would like to look at another statement which you have given.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm -- I'm also looking for the reference in this  statement that Mr. Weyl was referring to and I'm having trouble finding it.  The proceedings would go much more smoothly if we could be directed to exactly where he's address -- you know, where he's pulling in what he reads from because I can't follow at -- at this pace and I would like to see everything that the witness is trying to address.  The witness wanted another -- the following sentence read.  I can't even find it with the reference that Mr. Weyl has given me and I would like the witness's request to be honoured.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are trying to attract my attention? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I would like that it be placed on record that Mr. Weyl just said that he chooses only the portions which are of interest to him -- which are favourable to him, and that he's discarding portions which I am suggesting to him -- for him to read.  When I asked him to continue reading, because I find those portions very interesting, he refuses to read the portions and he deliberately skips the truth.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I would like to continue with my line of questioning concerning the identification of the Interahamwe, because it is in this connection that I would like to remind you of my cross-examination at this stage and the statement you had given.  I think we should comply with these reminders, which are within the subject -- which are not out of topic.  But since you are insisting for me to read out certain portions of your statements I have before me and, here, I would like to apologise for this back and forth movement, I still have before me your statement of **************2004, on page 1, where you wrote under paragraph 3 as follows: 

"It was difficult to make a difference between the Interahamwe and bandits.  It was the situation of anarchy; they indulged in looting and killings such that it was difficult to make a difference between the criminal acts of the Interahamwe and those of the bandits."

You have nothing to change to this statement, I believe. 
(Pages 17 to 28 by Jean Baigent)








1215H
THE WITNESS:
Yes, those Interahamwe conducted themselves like bandits.  That is what it means.  But you did not read everything, and this is very important.  It is good to know that the Interahamwe and the youth wings -- well, you did not continue reading for us to know where the Interahamwe came from and the parties they belonged to. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, you described it at length in a statement which you gave.  It's your guilty plea, which was given to the International Criminal Tribunal, and it is handwritten.  Attached to it is a letter of the 
************ 2004 with number K0295453.  On line 3 -- I am sorry, on line 1, in the middle of the line, this is what you state:  

"The roadblocks had already been set up in all secteurs.  Soldiers and civilians; patrols were conducted also.  Those who killed people were soldiers, Interahamwe, young members of the CDR and other political parties of the power faction, JDR, Inkuba, JPSD, Abakombozi, JPL, JPDI, who, just like the Interahamwe and the CDR, conducted themselves like armed militia and looters.  Ordinary bandits had also joined the fray.  Killings took place both during the day and at night.  It should be noted that the Interahamwe and the CDR, as well as the youths of other political parties, comprised mainly vagabonds, the unemployed, and bandits, who were not afraid of killing, who were uneducated and who lacked any moral rectitude.  From 1994, all those young militia took the name Interahamwe; they banded together.  Whereas, before, they were always in confrontation."  

Do you have anything to add or anything to change to your statement? 
A.	What you just read is correct. 
Q.	Witness, under such circumstances, how were you able to identify who was at the roadblocks? 
A.	You are asking me how I could distinguish them.  Well, it was not possible because they had all ganged up together. They were all called Interahamwe.  They had all become Interahamwe.  Yeah, that's true.  That was the prevailing situation at the roadblocks.  I was going to elaborate, but I will end here. 
Q.	What were the Interahamwe from the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I think you just read that.  As I had already explained, you just read the definition of the Interahamwe from the 6th of April. 
Q.	Witness, you were, however, able to cross the roadblocks which you had mentioned to us in a list? 
A.	That's right.  But I told you that on that day, that is, the 12th, I did not cross all the roadblocks.  I did not go through those roadblocks on the 12th.  I prepared a list of roadblocks which were there between April and July. 
Q.	Witness, I am going to end on this line of questioning.  In your evidence in court on the 26th of October, pages 23 and 24 of the French transcript, Prosecution counsel asked you a question as follows:  
"You said that some of the roadblocks were manned by Interahamwe.  How did you know that those people were Interahamwe?" 

And your answer was, "I saw their conduct.  Actually, it is not easy to answer your question."  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, that is not an improper answer.  The fact that I talk about their conduct is because I saw their conduct. 
Q.	Witness, you know that there are some of your answers which we can agree with in toto.  You also added that, "We must say that it was not easy to recognise them, that several of them were dressed in ordinary civilian attire, but from their conduct one could know that they were Interahamwe."  Do you confirm that? 
A.	There is nothing out of the ordinary in what you just read.  I said that, from observing their conduct, I concluded that they were Interahamwe.  But I think that today I have explained how I was able to conclude that they were all Interahamwe. 
Q.	You continued in your answer, "More specifically, Witness, at the roadblocks, which, according to you, were manned by Interahamwe, what was the conduct of those people?"  And your answer was, "They were furious at the roadblocks".  Do you remember that, Witness?  
A.	That's correct, that's what I said.  
Q.	And you continued by saying that even when they did not speak, they looked at you in a foreboding manner, as if they had smoked hemp; they were furious, armed with traditional weapons and guns.  And when they saw people passing by, they would display their weapons.  Do you remember that answer?  
A.	I have something to say with regard to this last part of the excerpt.  What you just read is correct, but I may have a thing or two to say regarding the last part of the excerpt; that is, the fact that they were displaying weapons to people who passed through the roadblocks. 
Q.	Witness, this is my last question regarding the presence of those people who were not easily identifiable at the roadblocks.  You said in chief, as follows:  

"There were, besides, some Hutu whose property were looted by the Interahamwe.  But, generally, they conducted themselves like people who had lost their mind completely, people who had lost all sense of humanity.  They were like mad people.  They were so enraged that they could not even hear what you were telling them."  Do you stand by that assertion?  
A.	Thank you.  Perhaps you did not understand everything.  But, essentially, it is there, saying that Interahamwe took the property of the Tutsi.  They did not take only their property, they also killed them at the roadblocks, they confiscated the belongings of people who passed through roadblocks.  It's not only for Tutsi.  

I would also like to clarify something which I had forgotten, but which I remember now.  The fact of saying they were "like crazy", I think they forgot to mention the word "like".  They were not crazy or mad, they behaved as if they were mad.  
Q.	That they could not hear what you are telling them? 
A.	That is true.  We tried to convince them to discontinue the killings, but they did not want to hear anything.  I told you at some point in time that there was a time that I myself was afraid of being killed.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, perhaps we can take the adjournment now.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE:
Before we do, Mr. President, if it pleases you, I had expected my learned friend to go to the next question in line in the transcript, where the witness was asked, "Do you know the names of any of these Interahamwe who you saw manning these roadblocks" and he provided some names.  We wouldn't want to leave that hanging.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I was not aware we had already started the re-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much more time do you need, Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think half an hour when we resume in the afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  And who is going to be following?  Mr. Sow?  
MR. SOW: 
Yours truly, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, in response to the inquiry you made this morning:  We actually prefer to have the exhibits in electronic format.  There was a little problem this morning, as you know.  But in terms of your cross-examination, the electronic filing that you have made is adequate.  We can take the adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1415H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we continue, Mr. Weyl.  

I am sorry, Mr. Witness, you wish to address me. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to ask you to grant me leave to say something.  Even if counsel says that he has a few minutes extra in order to wrap up his cross-examination, I would ask you to have this afternoon off so that the following counsel may put questions to me tomorrow.  In fact, I haven't slept very well.  I have a problem with sinusitus, and I would like to ask you to grant me leave to go and see a doctor this afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, just for clarification, were you willing to complete your -- the cross-examination of this counsel, and then have your medical consultation afterwards?  Is that what your request was?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I will try to hold out with Counsel Weyl until the end of his cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Thank you very much.

Mr. Weyl, you may continue now.  
MR. WEYL: 
I thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, if you synthesise somewhat your answers to my questions, I think you will be able to go and consult a doctor more rapidly.  And I do not want to put your health under any further pressure, so I will try and stick to the half hour that has been imparted to me and ask you to keep your questions (sic) short.  So I would like to remind you that you are a protected witness and I would like to remind you not to provide any information that might disclose your identity in your answers.  

Now, Witness, during your examination-in-chief you, for the first time to my knowledge, mentioned the fact that meetings were held during which Mathieu Ngirumpatse allegedly, according to you, gave instructions for roadblocks to be set up.  Do you remember having provided that information during your examination-in-chief? 
A.	Yes, I do remember that.  
Q.	Witness, do -- Witness, do you still claim that those meetings took place? 
A.	I responded to that question, and I am not changing my answer in any respect. 
Q.	Witness, I am not asking you to change your answer, but to provide further clarification for us to be able to do something with your answer.  So I am going to ask you to be more precise in your claims that I am contesting, and I am going to ask you to provide me the location where that meeting allegedly occurred, according to what you said.  
A.	Counsel, I think I told you the place where that meeting took place.  The Prosecutor put a question to me on that subject specifically, and I believe that I answered it.  You can check in the available documents, but if you like I can repeat it.  

I said that I heard that on the 10th of April 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, president of the party, chaired a -- or, led a meeting of the Interahamwe -- of Interahamwe leaders, notably, and of MRND leaders at a préfectoral level within Kigali town.  That's what I said. 
Q.	So you did say that it was the 10th of April 1994, did you not? 
A.	I think that that was the case.  It was between the 10th or the 11th of April, but I would think it was more likely to be the 10th. 
Q.	So, according to you, between the 10th and the 11th of April, Mathieu Ngirumpatse convened a meeting during which he gave instructions for roadblocks to be set up.  We agree on that point.  
A.	Counsel, I explained, if my memory serves me correctly, if I did not mention this fact, then I would like to underline it now.  Even if he gave instructions for roadblocks to be set up, those roadblocks were already in place from the date of the 7th of April. The Interahamwe had already set those roadblocks up.  All he did was insist on the existence of roadblocks and the guards circulating.  
Q.	Is that the only meeting that you have in mind, the one you have just mentioned? 
A.	That is the only meeting that I am aware of that was convened and chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Witness, is that the only meeting that you are aware of that Mathieu Ngirumpatse took part in? 
A.	No, that was not the only meeting that he took part in.  On the 8th, he took part in another meeting, and even on the 7th of April 1994 he took part in another meeting too.  

The Prosecutor did not put that question to me, but even later in Murambi he chaired meetings and took part in meetings after the government moved to Murambi and Gitarama, and those meetings took place even in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I thank you very much for having kick started your memory in order to provide us with a consistent explanation.  

Now, Witness, you said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse sent a letter giving instructions for people to follow military orders.  Do you remember that part of your examination-in-chief?
A.	Yes, instructions given by soldiers; I did say that.  
Q.	And, Witness, did you see that letter? 
A.	As I explained to Madam Prosecutor, I did not see that letter.  I was given information with reference to that letter, and I believe that I gave the names of those people who talked to me about those letters.  I gave those names to Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Witness, could you please remind me of those names? 
A.	Even if you want to make life difficult for me, Counsel, I know that you have those names at your disposal, and you told me that you also had that report in your possession and you said that if ever I were to forget a name or to add a name that was not there, then you would excuse me.  However, I believe that I did give the names.  I remember that amongst other people who talked to me about that letter, there was Bernard Maniragaba, who was a national Interahamwe member, Joseph Setiba who was also an Interahamwe member at national level and who was also the coordinator of Interahamwe activities within Kigali town and greater Kigali; he was also an Interahamwe of Kigali-Rural préfecture.  Now, another person who mentioned that letter was a person by the name Jean Habyarimana, who was president of the MRND party in Kigali town. 

So, those are the people who I remember talked to me about the letter that we are referring to.  Those are the people who talked to me about that meeting as well, the meeting that we were talking about a little earlier. 
Q.	That is the meeting of the 10th of April, is it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Of the year 1994? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Witness ALG, did Bernard Maniragaba, Joseph Setiba, and Jean Habyarimana, did they say that they had seen a letter written by the hand of Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	They did see that letter.  
Q.	And, Witness, did they say to you that they had read the letter? 
A.	I don't really remember, but I think that in view of the fact that they gave me that information, they had read the letter. 
Q.	Did they tell you, Witness, at what date they saw that letter? 
A.	They saw the letter on the 8th of April 1994 -- 8th of April 1994, in the morning.  
Q.	Did they tell you whom the letter was addressed to -- who it was intended for? 
A.	The letter was addressed to the Interahamwe -- a letter addressed to the Interahamwe in general.  I think that the addressee was Robert Kajuga, the president of the Interahamwe, but it was addressed to the Interahamwe in general, I was told. 
Q.	Was it a handwritten letter or a typed letter, Witness? 
A.	That was not specified to me, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, the letter was seen at Mathieu Ngirumpatse's or at the addressees? 
A.	I don't know.  I don't know where Habyarimana saw that letter.  I was not able to ask him, nor did I ask Bernard where he'd seen the letter.  But, as regards Joseph Setiba, we spoke of it and he told me he saw it in the forenoon of the 8th of April, and Robert Kajuga had it in hand when he went to see him at Gitikinyoni, where he was at the roadblock in the company of soldiers. 
Q.	On what date did Robert Kajuga have the letter when he showed it to your interlocutor?  
A.	I have just told you it was the 8th of April in the forenoon; he showed it to Setiba when he saw it at the roadblock at Gitikinyoni where he was in the company of soldiers.  Gitikinyoni was in former Butamwa commune, the crossroad of the Kigali-Ruhengeri road and the Kigali-Gitarama road. 
Q.	Witness ALG, your informant therefore saw the letter when Robert Kajuga showed it at the roadblock; is that what you said? 
A.	Absolutely, Counsel.  I think I am repeating myself.  
Q.	Witness, he did not -- did he see other versions of that letter? 
A.	I don't know, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, your other informants did not see other versions of that letter? 
A.	They didn't say anything to me about that.  I should say that Bernard Maniragaba was not a co-detainee of mine as others were.  He told me when he came to the Kigali urban préfecture.  He was in a hurry.  He told me he was going to Murambi to see Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  It was after the 12th of April 1994.  
Q.	Witness, you confirmed to me that, according to you, the letter ordered the addressees to obey the soldiers? 
A.	Yes, the tenor was to obey the military, the soldiers.  They had to do what the soldiers asked them to do.  That's what I was told about it.  
Q.	Witness, I thank you very much for your answer.  You see that when they are brief, we can progress with more dispatch, more expeditiously.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, I should briefly like to talk with you about the removal of corpses in the streets of Kigali in the month of April 1994 on the orders of Prefect Renzaho.  Do you remember that? 
A.	I did mention that, it's true.  
Q.	Witness, without going into further details so as not to reveal your identity, you told us that it -- on occasion,**********************; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  They came to ask me to intervene so that I assist them in their assistance -- to help them in the assistance they were giving.  
Q.	You know that when corpses decompose, it can lead to epidemics? 
A.	That is correct.  I know that.  I am aware of that.  
Q.	Witness, you mentioned the removal of corpses after the 12th of April, if my memory serves me right, and you said that the killing had started in the night of the 6th to 7th April; is that correct? 
A.	I said after the 12th.  That is what he said at the time of a meeting called, and, indeed, I told you that the massacres had begun in the night of the 6th to the 7th, but more especially as of the 7th.  That's when the massacres intensified. 
Q.	Witness, as of the 12th of April 1994, there might, therefore, be problems of hygiene and sanitation because of the presence of those decomposing corpses? 
A.	Counsel, I don't know whether you have the statement that I gave in which I said the people killed in their houses were buried there in their own houses or their corpses were taken to mass -- to common graves -- mass graves.  Even if Renzaho said it at that meeting after the 12th, it doesn't mean that all the corpses were lying around on the road.  There were only a few, because other corpses had been buried.  So don't think that the corpses of all the people killed were scattered on the roads.  
Q.	Witness, do you know that the Red Cross had asked for public hygiene measures be taken to remove the decomposing corpses that were giving rise to hygiene and sanitation problems and could lead to epidemics? 
A.	Thank you for the information.  I didn't know that the Red Cross had asked for the corpses to be removed.  As far as I know,********************************************.  I did not intervene in the activity you refer to.  ****************************************
Q.	Witness, I am coming to my last series -- the last series of questions I had for you referring to your statement -- statements, according to which, in response to a question by Madam Prosecutor, you said that Renzaho -- Prefect Renzaho made an appeal once at a security meeting, a préfectoral security meeting.  You add a bit further:  "In fact, he spoke of it, but he did not speak with his heart -- he did not have the matter at heart." 

Witness, did you hear on any other occasion Prefect Renzaho speak of humanitarian problems? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  He did speak of it, especially in connection with the lack of food in the town. 
Q.	Witness, did you hear Prefect Renzaho speak of the evacuation of the refugees from the 
Hôtel des Mille Collines and of the refugees in Amahoro stadium? 
A.	He did speak of it.  Moreover, ************************************************in order to undertake that activity successfully. 
Q.	Witness -- and I invite you to be quite specific in your answer, and listen with --
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am a bit difficult -- I have taken all the necessary precautions.  I did remind throughout my questioning, recall the difficulties connected to being that of a protected witness, and in spite of that I must ask for a closed session in spite of all my warning and calls to caution because of the answer just given by the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have other questions which are likely to reveal his identity?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, exactly.  The whole series of questions where I was careful to avoid the difficulty, but what the witness is now saying compromises my task and there is no other outcome -- no -- than for me to ask for a closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the public, this witness has been the beneficiary of a protection order, and one of the elements of that order is that he is entitled to have his identity concealed from the public.  Counsel informed us that the next questions that he will ask are likely to reveal his identity, and we have to exclude the public from the session during that (inaudible).  So we now go into a closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 37 to 41] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, the time has now come for me to draw my cross-examination to a close, and I would like to ask for the exhibit to be admitted into evidence, that is, the document that we examined under closed session, that is, the transcript of the broadcast.  I won't say exactly what that exhibit is, I think I might explain that to Mr. Issa.  But that was the document that we examined during the closed session.  I would like that to be entered into -- or, admitted into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) ... radio interview?  
MR. WEYL:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) ... identified that by its date.  We are admitting it under seal.  
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, it is D.NG. 38.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. D.NG. 38 admitted, under seal) 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

And I would like to thank the witness, whilst we are parting company, and wish him all the best for his court case -- his subsequent court case, despite the answers that he has given us during this hearing.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have made inquiries and the WVSS is ready to take the witness to the clinic, now.  So we will, on his request, take the adjournment to facilitate him having a medical consultation at this time.  

Now, Mr. Sow -- Mr. Sow, I think we will have to come to you tomorrow morning.

1515H
MR. SOW:
Yes, I'm ready Mr. President, I agree.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we have acceded to your request to have a medical consultation this afternoon.  I think the Registrar has put the mechanism in place and we will take the adjournment now.  I remind you that during this or any other adjournment you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody. 
(Microphones overlapping)
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.
(Court adjourned at 1523H)
