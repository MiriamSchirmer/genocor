CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	We will continue cross-examination.  You may recall that yesterday we were dealing with the MRND.  I would like to ask you to tell me which organ determined party policy from the time multiparty politics returned.
A.	The structure responsible for determining the party's policies, I think we should just set up -- we had just set up the structures.  And after those structures were set up at national level, the country's leaders were supposed to define the party's policy. 
Q.	Witness, I do not think you have understood the question.  Considering the statutes you signed, can you tell me which structure defined the party's politics or policies? 
A.	Yes.  We did sign the statutes, as you say.  I wanted to give you a presentation of the existing structures which had their respective duties; there was a political bureau, the national committee.  And these two structures were supposed to determine the party's policy and ensure that decisions taken were respected.  It was the party's executive bureau that was responsible for execution of all decisions taken within the party.  That is my answer to your question. 
Q.	If I go by your answer, can you tell me if the executive committee actually executed decisions taken by the political bureau? 
A.	I think the political bureau should answer your question because I was not a member and I can, therefore, not tell you if decisions taken by the political bureau were executed by the executive bureau.  I was not a member of those bodies at the national level and I cannot tell you, therefore, whether decisions taken were put into action. 
Q.	But, Witness, since you are just an ordinary member and, therefore, do not know whether decisions were taken, then as an ordinary member how can you say that on a number of occasions the executive committee did not do its duties by stopping the killings? 
A.	I said that the structure I belonged to, or, at least, at my level, I was in a position to know if anything had been done to stop the killings.  And I can say this because, as a matter of fact, the killings were not stopped.  They were perpetrated by MRND members.  And by members, I mean the Interahamwe.  And the killings were never stopped.  It is, therefore, very easy to understand that nothing was done by the executive organs in the parties at national level in order to stop the killings. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like you to give me some clarification on the structure, or body, that proposed restructuring of the MRND to transform it from single party to a party that would be fit to operate in a multiparty environment.
A.	Yes, initially the MRND was a single party.  It had not authorised the creation or establishment of other political parties.  It was, therefore, reformed in order to conform to multiparty politics.  The time had come.  And, therefore, there was a need for change so that we could enter the multiparty phase.  And so the MRND agreed to move from a single party system to the multiparty system.  It was, therefore, necessary to amend the party's statutes so that it could compete with other parties in the multiparty system. 
Q.	So, which commission actually effected amendment of the statutes, and who chaired that commission? 
A.	This commission was appointed by the party president, who was also president of the republic.  And the commission was headed by a secretary general, namely, Édouard Karemera. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you certain that Mr. Édouard Karemera chaired the commission to reform the statutes? 
A.	I would like us to be clear on one thing; you speak of a commission, I know that he was appointed secretary general and he also had deputies appointed so that they could effect this reform.  And I know that the secretary who was appointed on that occasion was Édouard Karemera.

The party, that is the MRND, had always existed.  Therefore, it was only a matter of amending the statutes.  I did not, therefore, say that this commission existed within the MRND.  There was a social committee, a committee responsible for foreign affairs.  I know that there were a number of committees, so I wonder what commission you speak of.  And I know that Édouard Karemera was heading the party in his capacity as national secretary of the party.  And he should, therefore, know if such a commission existed.  I was just an ordinary member.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell me who was chairman of the national commission for reform of the constitution? 
A.	I do not know that person because I was never a member of any commission.  I was not a member of a commission or a committee appointed by President Habyarimana, and would, therefore, not be able to tell you whether there was a commission that was headed by any given person.  So I said that somebody was appointed to head a commission that was supposed to reform the statutes, but I cannot tell you who. 
Q.	Witness, if I were to tell you that Mr. Édouard Karemera never chaired the statutes reform committee, would you agree with me? 
A.	No, I do not agree with you.  I know I was not a member of the committee.  But I know that                 Mr. Karemera was secretary general of the party.  So, if you mean he was not a member of the committee, you might be privy to this detail.  But I know that Édouard Karemera was secretary general of the party at the time; and that, therefore, when the committee was appointed he was responsible as party representative.  Whether or not he was a member, I do not know.  But since you say so, it is your right to. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, these are facts, it is not a right of mine.  And what I am concerned about is your certainties, which are unfounded.  The chairman of the statutes amendment committee was Munyazesa, M-U-N-Y-A-Z-E-S-A.  He chaired the statutes amendment committee.   
	Mr. Édouard Karemera chaired the national synthesis committee for reform of the constitution? 
A.	You give names of people who chaired committees.  All I know is that Édouard Karemera was secretary general of the party, and he had replaced another person.  Of course, he could have sat in more than one committee.  I know that the MRND executive committee, or the one you mentioned, when these were set up, I know that at the time Édouard Karemera was secretary general of the MRND.  

	If Munyazesa was supposed to head the synthesis committee, I believe that that commission or committee was one of the committees appointed by the MRND party.  And I, therefore, did not seek to determine which committees were headed by which persons.  I know that there were a number of commissions, members had been appointed, and that these were the members who effected reform to enable the MRND to enter the multiparty phase.  

So if you say that Munyazesa was a member of the synthesis committee, I have no comment.  Maybe you are basing this on the difference between commission and committee.  I know that the secretary general of the party was initially Habyarimana Bonaventure, followed by Édouard Karemera, thereafter Joseph Nzirorera.  I am, therefore, not very well versed in this.  Maybe you have documentary evidence.  I have no documents to rely on.  And I can, therefore, provide no further detail. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would rather we did this -- when you do not know, say you do not know, but do not go out on a limb and make erroneous statements.  You have just said Mr. Karemera was secretary general and, therefore, he chaired the statutes reform committee.  Are you certain that at the time of creation of the committees, that Mr. Karemera was, indeed, secretary general? 
A.	I see you ask me questions about the MRND statutes, but I never have given evidence on MRND statutes reforms.  But I see that although this is not my objective, it is yours.  These statutes were drawn up by experts.  And, therefore, statutes that were drawn up by Mr. Édouard Karemera who was of the MRND, I cannot be held responsible for that.  All I am doing is answering questions. 

	 I know that Édouard Karemera was secretary general of the party.  Now, as to whether             Édouard Karemera was secretary general of the party when the committees were set up, I only know that three persons held the post of secretary general of the MRND party. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you see -- you see the reason I am asking you so many questions about the MRND is that the bulk of your testimony is on the MRND.  And your accusations are leveled at the executive committee of the MRND.  And, therefore, as a party cadger, you seem to be well acquainted with the party.  And I'm asking you questions in order to verify the credibility of your testimony.  It is not to try and put you in a tight corner.  It is simply because you have been testifying about the MRND.  

So you said that when the committees were created, Mr. Karemera was not secretary general, or it is not because he was secretary general of the party that he must have chaired the synthesis committee? 
A.	You are right.  I came here to testify about the MRND party, but not about the committee you are referring to.  I have been testifying on party officials.  I was just saying that killings had taken place in the country.  Tutsis were targets, and that party officials did nothing to end the killings; that is why I came to testify here.  Now, if you say that I have spoken about the MRND, I was not talking about MRND committees.  I was saying that committees would meet to make -- to take decisions on killings to be effected.  All I said was that it was the top party authorities who failed to stop the killers from engaging in such acts of violence.  And it was the people who were in the MRND who were doing this.  I said the statutes were signed.  And had they been respected, the slaughter would not have taken place.

I am not here to accuse the committee you are referring to.  I think you agree with me that you are not here to make my life difficult.  You are armed with documents that you are submitting to the court, and I was an eyewitness to certain events.  And I am talking about those same facts.  That is what I am testifying about.  
Q.	Then let us stick to the facts, Witness.  Can you tell me, Witness, if the party reform occurred before the multiparty system was ushered in? 
A.	I have not quite understood your question.  Do you mean the facts or the MRND statutes; you mean when the MRND was reformed?  
Q.	Let me repeat my question, Witness, so that you understand it better.  The MRND was reformed.  And I wanted to know if this reform took place before the multiparty system was ushered in, or after it was ushered in. 
A.	The reform took place before multiparty politics.  So the party was reformed because it wanted to be acceptable as a party in the multiparty phase. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell me what were the consequences of multiparty politics on the MRND, as far as the MRND's population was involved?  In other words, with the advent of multiparty politics, did the MRND's popularity grow or did it subside? 
A.	There were lots of political parties, but under the one-party system, there was only the MRND.  So when the multiparty system began, everybody joined the party of his or her choice.  So the MRND lost some ground.  There were people who had actually signed the statutes of the MRND who later left to join or form other parties.  So, with the advent of multiparty politics, the MRND was less popular. 
Q.	Thank you for your answer, Witness.  What about the MRND's influence in government? 
A.	I was not a member of government so as to know how the government functioned.  I do know that the MRND had several ministers serving in government, but I cannot tell you that when the cabinet met, whether some party or another party was more or less influential. 
Q.	Let me help you out, Witness so that you understand the question better.  Prior to multiparty politics, the government in place was solely composed of MRND members, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	With the advent of multiparty politics, there was now a government comprising several parties? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	Does this not mean that the MRND was no longer -- did not -- no longer had a complete hold over the government? 
A.	Yes, you are saying that the MRND was no longer in complete control.  I am not a lawyer.  It is clear that the government was controlled by the prime minister, but that the overall leader was the president.  And, of course, the MRND was not the only party in government -- forming government, I agree to that. 
Q.	Now, what about the préfecture and commune level?  Were there fresh appointments tending to ensure that such préfectures and communes, in particular, commune level, that people were included in these structures who were not members of the MRND but members of other parties? 
A.	Yes, just as in government or cabinet, the MRND agreed with other parties to share out post.  However, its members formed the majority in government.  And that was also the case at préfecture and commune level.  I remember that at the préfecture level, that was the case.  And it did not trickle down to the communal level, not -- there were no significant changes there in positions.  Whenever a bourgmestre resigned or was dismissed, elections were held.  So there were no questions of sharing out positions at communal level as had been the case at préfecture and government level. 
Q.	Under the one-party system the MRND was financed by the state; is that not correct? 
A.	I do not understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	I said that under the one-party system, the so-called party state, is it not true to say that the party belonged to the government, and that the party was funded by the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  The state financed the MRND, but there were also members' contributions. 
Q.	With the advent of multiparty politics and when the party was reformed, did the assets of the MRND, were they now ceded to the state? 
A.	I cannot answer the question because at -- in the post that I held, I was not in a position to know if the assets of the party now fell to the government.  I just know that property, for instance, buildings were handed over to government because the MRND had not built any buildings.  So property was handed over to the state; that is what I heard.  However, I am not certain of it.  I do not know if that is what actually happened. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you agree with me that the MRND as the party state was stronger than the MRND reformed? 
A.	Yes, the MRND as a one-party state was stronger than the reformed MRND, but the Rwandans kept on believing that the MRND was the strongest party, and were convinced that MRND members were stronger than members of other parties.  But I quite agree with you when you say that the MRND was stronger as a single party than as a party operating in the multiparty system. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I would like to be enlightened as to why the MRND, as a single party, did not take advantage of its power to exterminate the Tutsis from October 1990 when the RPF attacked Rwanda. 
A.	They had to wait; they could not plan something and execute it immediately.  Maybe the MRND did not want to put the plan into action for fear of the reaction of the international community.  But I must point out to you that the MRND was very strong as the single party.  And that is why the Interahamwe were not in existence at the time.  But when the MRND proceeded with the multiparty system, they realised there was a need to put -- to create the Interahamwe.  And if the Interahamwe were created, there was an objective behind that action.  

	Why don't you ask me -- by the same token, why the RPF did not attack in 1970 instead of 1990?  After all, a plan had to be elaborated and only later could it be implemented.  When the party was the only party, it was strong, but that did not preclude it from putting a plan in place and executing it even 20 years after its creation.  

You see, I was not a bigwig in the MRND.  And the only answer I can give you is that if they had not put it into action it is because the time had not yet come. 
Q.	Witness, there is a problem in the logic of your answer, because you do acknowledge that in October 1990 the RPF attacked Rwanda and sowed disorder among the ethnic groups; and, therefore, gave rise to hatred between the ethnic groups.  And yet at the time the MRND was very strong, was the only party in Rwanda; why is it that the MRND did not immediately exterminate the Tutsi and waited a full four years to exterminate them? 
Q.	The RPF Inkotanyi launched an attack in 1990.  I said that when the RPF attacked, it had Hutus and Tutsi in its ranks.  As far as I know, the RPF had Hutu as well as Tutsi leaders, which means that this was a combined effort by Hutus and Tutsi in attacking Rwanda.  Immediately after the attack, Tutsis were branded accomplices.  And at that point, that is 1990, the MRND was the only party in place.

Tutsis were arrested, thrown into jail, called accomplices, some of them were killed, others released.  But those who were released were the first to be killed when the massacres began.  I can, therefore -- did you say this was a plan that was put into place after the RPF attacked, prisons were overflowing with Tutsi prisoners, some who were placed into containers even.  I remember that in October 1990 the Nyamirambo stadium was full of prisoners, so the MRND did not immediately commence the killings.  But these arrests were assigned; and, therefore, the plan to exterminate the Tutsi was not yet -- had not yet been drawn up.  It was drawn up during the multiparty politics phase, after it has ceased to be a one-party state.  
Q.	Witness, if I were to go by your theory that the extermination plan was drawn up when the MRND was the single party, then why was it not executed?  If there had been no plan I would have agreed, but why if this plan was already in place was it not executed when the party was the only one in government? 
A.	I told you that at the time, the MRND demonstrated that it had a plan, when Tutsis were arrested and jailed in October 1990.  Now, you are wondering why the MRND did not execute its plan, but we saw this in October 1990.  This was not the result of somebody waking up one day and ordering that Tutsi be killed.  Maybe at that point in time, the time had not yet come.  They had to proceed in stages.  They definitely draw up this plan in 1990, 1992, 1993 and 1994.  And by 1994 they felt the time had come to put the plan into action.  But even from what I observed in 1990 since I was in the country, I believed the MRND had a plan.  

	You should not ask a killer, "Why are you killing me today and why did you not kill me yesterday?"  It depends on the killer's plan.  He will kill you when he wants to kill you.  So they hatched the plan, and executed it when they wanted to. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you say that in 1990, only Tutsi were arrested.  Can you back up your assertions with evidence? 
A.	What proof are you talking about?  I was a responsable of the secteur, and persons arrested in my secteur, at least, just like persons arrested in other Kigali secteurs were Tutsi.  I believe in my secteur only Tutsi were arrested.  The same was true in neighbouring localities. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I could agree -- I would be willing to concede that you are fully acquainted with what happened in your secteur, but I am not so sure that you could, from your secteur, say that only Tutsi were arrested; whereas, you yourself maintain that the RPF was composed of both Hutus and Tutsi.  I think this is pure speculation on your part.  
Did you have, or could you tell us which people were killed? 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Would Counsel repeat the last part of his question?  The Kinyarwanda booth is asking Mr. Sow to repeat the last part of his question. 
(Pages 1 to 8 by Donna M. Lewis)

































0942H 
MR. SOW:
I will repeat it. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, earlier on you stated that the RPF was composed of both Hutus and Tutsis, most likely so that we could be led to believe that the RPF's main constituency was not just the Tutsis.  Now, if I go by your theory, when the RPF attacked, persons were arrested.  And you seem to be saying that only Tutsis were arrested, and I am saying, what is the basis for your assertion?  

And my second question is, you say Tutsis were killed; then you should tell us, since you saw the Tutsis who were killed, and, by the same token, give us their names.  
A.	I've just said that the Tutsis were arrested and imprisoned, and some of them were killed.  Others were freed.  I was also saying that the RPF included both Tutsi and Hutu, but it is the Tutsis who paid for -- for it.  It is the Tutsis who bore the consequences.  

And you are trying to tender evidence to indicate that only Tutsi were killed or arrested, but I'm telling you that, at the Nyamirambo stadium, you had Tutsis there.  And it was Tutsis who were thrown into jail.  It is the Tutsis who were imprisoned, especially in the Kigali central prison.  We, the conseillers, following the instructions we were given, went to Kigali prison to visit the people who had been put there.  

So you are saying that I am generalising these events.  We lived in **************town, and we knew what happened.  I know what happened in my secteur.  I know what happened in other secteurs that were next to mine.  I went to Kigali prison to see the people who were piled up there.  I went to Gitarama prison.  I was a member of the commission of conseillers that went to Gitarama, Butare, and Kigali.  In all the prisons in these places, there were people whom I saw, and our objective was to check out the Hutus who had been imprisoned in those prisons.  That is the first bit of evidence that I can offer.  

In addition, you are asking me for the names of the people who allegedly died in the prisons.  In my secteur, three people died in prison.  If other people did die subsequently as a result of being beaten, well, don't ask me what their -- their names are.  They are people who died.  You have to go to their homes to find out who they are.  So we agree that the Tutsi were arrested and imprisoned at that time.  

They went to their homes, that is, the homes of these Tutsi, and took them to prison, based on what was indicated in their identification documents.  I never saw anyone from the families of the RPF, Hutu, who was arrested and imprisoned.  
Q.	Witness, from your answer, am I to take it that no Hutu was arrested? 
A.	I am telling you that, among the prisoners that I saw in Kigali prison, there were no Hutu, to my knowledge.  I don't know whether you know of any, but I was present, and I saw only Tutsi in the Kigali central prison.  
Q.	Witness, when it suits you, you limit your testimony to Kigali, and when it suits you, you talk about the whole of Rwanda.  You said that Tutsi were arrested, not only in Kigali, but also in Gitarama and, generally speaking, all over Rwanda.  So I am asking you, since you seem to be a man who is well informed, do you know whether there were any Hutu who were arrested? 
A.	The answer is no, because I never saw any Hutu arrested in the area where I was.  
Q.	Mr. Froduald Karamira was arrested in 1990, and he was in Kigali prison.  Did you not meet him?  Were you not aware of that? 
A.	Yes, I saw him there.  Give me another name, please.  Yes, he was tried, and his judgement was announced on the radio.  

Actually, Karamira never admitted to being Hutu.  I do not know of any Hutu who was arrested and imprisoned, apart from Karamira.  However, more than 8,000 Tutsi were arrested and imprisoned.  I know that in Kigali secteur 2,000 people were arrested and imprisoned.  

I do not know why you pick on this single exception of the case of Mr. Froduald Karamira to indicate that Hutu were arrested, whereas there were thousands of Tutsi who were packed into the Kigali regional stadium.  The people who were arrested and imprisoned were Tutsi, at least as far as the Kigali prison is concerned.  This is a prison that was in the capital, in Kigali.  There are very many people who were arrested thus, so I cannot give their names.  But the Tutsi, or most of the Tutsi, who were in Kigali were arrested and imprisoned.  
Q.	Witness, need I recall that your role here is to say what you saw and not decide on talking about what you saw?  I did not put the question to you about Karamira.  If I had not put that question to you, you would have told the Trial Chamber nothing of this, which raises serious doubts in my mind as to your good faith when it comes to telling the Trial Chamber the truth.  I shall not give you any more other -- any other examples.  I shall continue with my cross-examination.  
A.	I think it is up to you to make such accusations against me.  You do not agree with anything that I have told you.  That is understandable.  But don't try to pit me against the Judges.  It will be up to the Judges to take the right decision about what I have said.  You say that you have doubts about what I have given here as testimony.  That is understandable.  It is normal.  I know that anyone who comes into the -- who comes into the witness box will be subject to your doubts about their testimony.  

I have given you answers based on what I witnessed.  You are looking -- you were watching what was going on on television.  I was in the country.  Give the Judges the opportunity to determine whether these things did not happen as I say they did.  You are fully entitled to cast doubt on my statements, but you must leave all of that to the discretion of the Trial Chamber, because you have your arguments and I have mine.  So it will be up to the Judges to decide who is telling the truth. 
Q.	Witness, I would like to assure you that I have no accusations to levy against you.  You are giving testimony, and I hope that you will limit yourself to the facts and not extend your testimony to cover your arguments.  We are not interested in your arguments.  What we are interested in is what you saw, what you heard, or what you learned of.  

I am going to put questions to you now about the war situation that prevailed in Rwanda at the time.  Here is my first question:  Did the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana not have as a consequence the resumption of the war? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Immediately after the aircraft of President Habyarimana crashed, the war resumed; the killing began.  
Q.	How did the RPF in Kigali respond? 
A.	The RPF did not have control of the city of Kigali.  I cannot tell you how it responded.  It was not even a political party, so I cannot tell you about how the RPF in Kigali responded because the RPF had no power over Kigali, nor did it control the city.  
Q.	Witness, I will ask you to be objective.  I am asking you whether the RPF didn't have a regiment stationed in Kigali itself when the president's aircraft was shot down.  
A.	The RPF had a regiment there.  I was supposed to protect their leaders.  They were in Kacyiru commune. 
Q.	So, Witness, I would like to know, when the hostilities resumed, did the RPF regiment just fold its arms and wait, or did it begin to attack? 
A.	I have no idea.  I know that where the RPF was stationed there was a military camp of the Rwandan armed forces nearby, so I cannot say whether the RPF battalion did not respond.  It is obvious that these two belligerents began to fight.  I was not in charge of military strategy.  I do not know what happened on that day.  I do not know who started it.  I do not know who started to attack, but we were informed that at that time the Rwandan government was fighting with the RPF; both armies were at the fighting front.  
Q.	Witness, I know that on the war front both armies were fighting, but, tell me, in Kigali, was there fighting?  Did you hear shelling?  If you prefer to tell me that it is the Rwandan army that was fighting by itself, then you should tell me.  Tell me what happened in Kigali.  Was there fighting between both armies?  Was there shelling?  Were the people shot at?  I would like to know the exact situation.  
A.	Gunshots or gunfire was heard immediately after the death of President Habyarimana.  We were near a military camp, and we began to hear gunfire.  But we -- the problem is finding out who it is who started the shooting, or how the fighting started.  There was fighting for four or five days in the city of Kigali.  It was obvious that there was a battle that was being fought during those days.  
Q.	Thank you.  That's clear, at least.  

So, tell me, was there security in Kigali at that time?  Or, if you will, I'll put it differently.  Were the people of Kigali able to move about in peace? 
A.	There was insecurity in Kigali.  The public, members of the public, were being killed.  Here and there in the city of Kigali, killing was going on.  So I cannot say that there was security.  People were waiting for death.  
Q.	Can you tell me whether, in the Kigali -- in Kigali there were RPF infiltrators? 
A.	I do not know what infiltrators you refer to.  I cannot give an answer to your question.  What infiltrators are you referring to, Counsel?  How do you expect me to know about these infiltrators?  I do not know what infiltrators you are referring to.  It was RPF soldiers who were fighting with soldiers of the Rwandan armed forces, so I do not know what you mean when you refer to infiltrators. 
Q.	Witness, you stated in this Court that in your reports to the bourgmestre, and even to the préfet, you indicated the presence of people who had no leave to reside there, and you said that these were suspicious persons, or people who aroused suspicion.  It was also noted that the RPF sent in soldiers who passed as civilians and who infiltrated the people.  This is the reason you said why mines or bombs were located everywhere in Kigali.  Since you were the conseiller of a secteur, do tell me what you know about this.  
A.	I think you're adding to what I did actually say.  You say that in my reports I mentioned people who did not have identification documents and who were in Kigali, and you add that it was known that the RPF had infiltrated its agents into the city of Kigali.  That is what you have just added.  In my reports, I did not at any time state that such agents had been infiltrated into Kigali.  I was making -- submitting reports to indicate to my superiors that there were people in my secteur who did not have identity cards.  There are people who came from the préfectures of Ruhengeri, Gisenyi, or elsewhere.  The law provided that all residents of Kigali had to have residents' permits.  So in my reports I said that there were people who did not have these residents' permits.  I was not referring to RPF soldiers.  

Now, as to saying that such people came to my secteur and I considered them to be RPF infiltrators, that is not true.  However, it is true that some people came from all around the country, and they lived in my area.  I had to report this to the authorities because I needed to indicate that these people did not have identification documents.  
Q.	Witness, if in spite of your alertness, in terms of stating that such a Tutsi was killed or an Interahamwe had killed, I find you -- you are not vigilant enough to point out or find infiltrators, well, so be it.  But, tell me, who caused the explosion -- explosion of bombs or mines in Kigali?  Is it the army who planted these bombs and mines, or is it the RPF? 
A.	There were political parties who viewed each other as adversaries.  There was also the Rwandan army that was pitted against the RPF.  Rwanda had people who were qualified to study military matters.  I cannot know who put a bomb in Nyamirambo or elsewhere.  I cannot say that such a mine may have been planted by the Inkotanyi.  People were being attacked in their homes.  Grenades were thrown into their homes, and their property was stolen or looted.  

You say that there was insecurity in the country.  If there was such insecurity and you think that it is the RPF that was causing such insecurity, then measures had to be taken to put an end to it.  So you're criticising me for failing to recognise the infiltrators, but what are infiltrators?  How do you recognise them?  The only Tutsi that I saw were the members of the public in my secteur who had identity cards.  

Now, regarding the matter of grenades, you want to indicate or to suggest that these grenades were planted by -- or, thrown by the RPF.  I cannot be sure of this.  I know that there was general insecurity in the city of Kigali and that there were bombs and grenades thrown here and there, but you mustn't force me to say that it is the RPF that was planting these bombs because I'm not at all sure of that. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell me whether, from April to July 1994, there was a curfew in Kigali? 
A.	Yes.  Between April and July 1994, there was a curfew in Kigali.  One was not allowed to move about at night.  
Q.	Who declared that curfew? 
A.	The curfew was imposed either by the préfet of Kigali, or he may have taken such a decision because his superiors had asked him to do so. 
Q.	Was this curfew not moved, destined to provide security in Kigali? 
A.	No, I do not think that it was to provide security.  Because even if people stayed in their homes, it didn't have much effect.  Some people were arrested in their homes at night.  I think that -- that the authorities had a specific, secret plan.  People moved about in the daytime.  They were allowed to do so, but there were some who preferred to stay at home because they did not feel safe. 
Q.	Witness, I'd like to understand what you are saying.  You often criticise the authorities for not taking measures, and when such measures are taken, you seem to indicate that they did not have any real meaning.  Do you agree with me that there was insecurity?  Would it not be normal, then, in such a case for there to be a curfew imposed at night? 
A.	You say that I do not understand you when you refer to the matter of providing security, and you talk about decisions that were taken.  These are only documents, I assure you.  These documents, or the decisions contained in these documents, were not implemented.  

You say that security had to be provided, and that is the reason why a curfew was imposed.  But there were people who had leave to move about as they wished.  If there was such a curfew, and if the decision had been implemented, I think that security would have been restored.  
Q.	Witness, is it correct that at 4 p.m. on the 7th of April 1994 the RPF broke out of the CND, where they were located, and attacked the Presidential Guard? 
A.	I know nothing about that.  I have already told you that the CND is located in Kacyiru commune.  I do not know whether RPF -- the RPF came out of the CND to go and attack the Presidential Guard.  I have no idea.  I was not there.  

Even if I were in that place, I would not have known who had attacked first, the RPF or the Rwandan army.  If you have tangible proof to that effect, since these camps were opposite each other, you might be right.  But I cannot tell you because I was not present.  
Q.	Did you hear about this attack? 
A.	Yes.  It was reported to us that the RPF had attacked or was fighting the Rwandan army.  But at the same time, the RPF was also asserting that it had been attacked by members of the Presidential Guard and that the RPF had merely sought to protect itself, defend itself.  So there were two versions.  I do not know who attacked first, whether it was the army or the other party.  All I know is that, if it had attacked first, the Presidential Guard sought to defend itself.  And the converse would be true.  If it was the RPF that had attacked first, it would have been seeking to defend itself. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in this climate of insecurity reigning over Kigali, can you tell me what role was played by delinquents in Kigali? 
A.	I don't know what hoodlums you are referring to.  That is a term you use.  And in certain circumstances, when you say "delinquents" or "hoodlums," I'd like you to make this clear for me.  
Q.	Let me remind you, Witness, that here, when asked to explain the purpose of the weapon you were provided, you said this was supposed to protect you from thieves, criminals, et cetera.  So when I say "delinquents" and "hoodlums," I think I'm talking about the same thing.  

In Kigali were there no people whose sole interest was looting and theft, and so on?  That is why I asked you if there were delinquents in Kigali who were behaving as they wished.  Your answer could be no, and you wouldn't have to make any comment.  
A.	No, I cannot give a "yes" or "no" answer.  You are trying to ambush me.  When you say "delinquents," you cannot just observe a person and conclude that that is a delinquent.  You cannot conclude that someone is a delinquent or a thief by just looking at them.  The weapon I was given was for my self-defence were I attacked in my home.  So if these hoodlums existed and if they were committing violent acts under cover of the political parties, you see, when a political party took in members, it could not be selective.  For instance, an Interahamwe could actually be a hooligan or a person with integrity.  

Now, as for the conduct of persons during this period, if any louts had joined the party and were masquerading as party members, it is not upon entering the party that they became delinquents.  There was no way of knowing whether somebody had been a thief or delinquent before joining the party. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you aware of groups or brigades of delinquents who were released following the RPF attacks, in particular, at Nyamirambo? 
A.	You are referring to attacks launched at Nyamirambo?  Are you referring to some attack that was launched against the Nyamirambo brigade or Nyamirambo secteur?  
Q.	I'm referring to attacks in brigades, brigades of delinquents who had been released.  It's not just Nyamirambo.  There's also Gikondo and Remera.  
A.	I'm going to talk about Nyamirambo because Nyamirambo brigade, there were gendarmes.  So the attack would have been directed at this brigade of gendarmes.  But I know that later the gendarmerie handed over the brigades to Interahamwes, so that the Interahamwe were running the brigade.  And, therefore, there was no way the RPF could have launched an attack to release hooligans.  It was not easy to have access to Gikondo, so I do not know whether the RPF could have attacked it and released delinquents.  Maybe the same was true in Remera.  They could have released people there because this was an RPF-controlled area.  I, therefore, cannot say anything about Remera because I had no access to it. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I have four more questions to put to you before I finish.  

Are you able to tell me how civil defence was organised in Kigali? 
A.	Civil defence was organised by the soldiers.  They had the capability.  A soldier was supposed to be in charge of civil defence in Kigali, and he was, therefore, in charge of all activities related to this? 
Q.	Did you take part in civil defence? 
A.	No, I was not supposed to take part in civil defence activities.  We were simply told that the civil defence system had been put in place.  Civil defence members were youths.  I was not young.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, your country is attacked.  You are a Rwandan citizen.  Can you tell me how you contributed to the effort to defend your country against the -- from the RPF? 
A.	I do not understand your question.  You want to know what I did when the country was attacked by the RPF?  Well, the RPF attacked.  It was not up to me to take a firearm and head to the front.  There were young people who were able to do this.  What I did was provide security in my secteur, to watch over the security situation prevailing.  So I did not go to the front because there were many young people who could do that, who could go there. 
Q.	So you confirm that in no way did you contribute to defending your country? 
A.	No, I never went to the front.  But I think there should be a distinction between two things:  We had soldiers at the front who were supposed to defend the country and provide security for the population.  Therefore, not all Rwandans had to go to the front.  

You say I did nothing.  No.  I stayed in my area to provide security there.  I was not an army commander.  I, therefore, did not have to go to the front.  But whenever we were asked to provide young people to be sent to the army, we would facilitate that.  This was one of our duties.  We had to sensitise young people in order to convince them to go to the front. 
Q.	One last question, Mr. Witness:  If civil defence was organised, was this not because the army could not alone face the RPF, given the latter's attacks? 
A.	Yes, I think that, when one sets up a civil defence, it is because perhaps one has noticed that one cannot wage war alone and defeat the enemy.  
Q.	Well, Witness, thank you.  I have just concluded my cross-examination, and I wish you a safe return home, and I also pray, that as we share the same religion, that the Almighty God will guide you.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. -- (microphones overlapping) 
MR. SOW:
And enlighten your heart with truth. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Now, Mr. Witness, the rules of procedure permit the Prosecutor to ask you some further questions in re-examination, and you have to answer the Prosecution now.  

I think we'll take the midmorning recess now, and we will commence his examination immediately after that.  

Mr. Morley, do you have any hints as to your duration? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour is invited to shoot me if I don't finish this witness finally today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, you're thinking of going on all day? 
MR. MORLEY:
I think we'll go into the afternoon, but what I'm saying is I'm not going into tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Volunteer, Defence, the shooting? 
MR. MORLEY:
That would give Mr. Robinson far too much satisfaction.  Your Honour is invited to. 
(Court recessed at 1028H) 
(Pages 9 to 16 by Ann Burum)




(Court resumed at 1111H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We are ready to resume now.  

Mr. Sow, I can hear you. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I wanted to point out that Mr. Karemera has given me to understand that he is beginning to feel the pain again and that he is finding it very difficult to stay in court, especially as the physiotherapist who is supposed to massage him can only come next Friday, so with your leave, he would like to withdraw now and return to the UNDF and take a rest because he is having great difficulty to follow the proceedings and bear the pain.  If he is in the UNDF, he may avail himself of the cream that he was given so that he can apply it to the part where he is feeling the most pain.  Since I have just finished my close -- cross-examination, I do not think that there will be much difficulty in allowing him to withdraw.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Once he remains to take care of his interests -- he has his permission -- he has our permission to withdraw. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. MORLEY: 
With Your Honours' leave.  
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness UB, you may be pleased to hear that almost certainly, you will be finishing your evidence today.  Do you understand what I have said?  
A.	Yes.  I am very pleased to hear that. 
Q.	There are some matters that I would invite you to tidy up as a result of the long days of questioning from the Defence.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	As long as two weeks ago, you were shown a document, IDNZ. 10.
MR. MORLEY:  
Your Honours will recall this document.  It was the document helpfully provided by Mr. Robinson entitled Structure du MRND of 6th April, 1994.  And I am looking to the helpful replacement to Mr. Issa, to locate IDNZ. 10.  And to assist, Your Honours, I am holding up the documents so that Your Honours see it.  I am sure Your Honours remember it. 
On dear, I can feel the firing squad growing closer.  

Perhaps if my document goes to the witness, but if you could helpfully show Their Honours the document first.  If you could helpfully show the -- could you please show Their Honours the document first and also members of the Defence so that they know which document we are dealing with?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Witness, when you look at that document, do you remember it from two weeks ago? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	As we deal with this final set of questions, I am going to invite you to keep your answers short.  I hope you will find that many of the questions I ask you can be answered in a sentence or two.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes, I understand you, Counsel. 
Q.	That document was prepared by the defence for Mr. Nzirorera and it is suggested that it shows the structure of the MRND in April of 1994.  Do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	In April of 1994, what was the most powerful office within the MRND, please, according to you? 
A.	The most important organ of the party at the time was the steering committee, that is, the members of executive bureau. 
Q.	In 1994, just so that we remind ourselves, although I think we know, the names, please, of the members of the executive bureau were? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I think this is totally -- this has been asked and answered about ten times.  I think if we are really going to move on, these rhetorical devices should not be employed.
MR. MORLEY: 
It is not a rhetorical device.  It is simply a means of setting the evidence in its clearest context.  It is one question and it will be answered within -- I would imagine four names.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	With Your Honour's permission, the names, please, of the four members of the executive bureau. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me.  I would like a ruling on my objection. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I can see the firing squad is going to assemble.  I can see it now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Although it is true that the evidence is on the record, I don't see any harm if he answers it again. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The four names, please, of the members of the executive bureau. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I do hope that you don't just use to establish the details (inaudible) to go over material which is already on the record. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I am not going to do that.  And, in fact, if we hadn't had the interruption, we would now be three questions further down the line.  It is a short question.  It is a short answer. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the names please, of the four people in April 1994 running the executive bureau were?  
A.	They are Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who was chairman; vice chairman was Edouard Karemera.  There was a second vice president called Bagema, and the secretary general of the party who was 
	Joseph Nzirorera. 
Q.	Looking at the document in front of you, the executive bureau is placed in the fourth position as being subordinate to three other bodies.  Was that the reality?  Was the executive bureau run by those four people subordinate to those three bodies? 
A.	The most important party organ is the one that I have referred to, which was composed of these four people and this was the organ that was responsible for implementing all decisions taken by the party.  The other organs were responsible for advising these four people so that they would perform their duties correctly.  I have said this before.  So the most important organ is the one that I mentioned it was responsible for the daily business of the party. 
Q.	Thank you.  There was frequent reference to the statutes and rules of the MRND.  Do you remember that from two weeks ago? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	Were the rules as they were written down, actually followed? 
A.	No.  The rules were not followed 100 percent. 
Q.	There was also reference to the rules governing the préfecture of Kigali.  Do you remember that from two weeks ago? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	Were those rules, as they were written down, actually followed? 
A.	No, because some parts of the rules were not followed, that is, the rules as they were indicated in the statutes and regulations. 
Q.	Who is it that you understand was the person most responsible for drafting the MRND rules for multipartyism? 
A.	I told you that when the executive committee of the party was set up, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was a member; Edouard Karemera was the secretary general.  The secretary general of the party played an important role in drafting these statutes and regulations.  It is he who raised the awareness of the population to -- in regard to these statutes and regulations before they were signed. 
Q.	You have been referred on many, many occasions to the documents you prepared in your own handwriting and which you offered to the Prosecution on the 15th of December of 2004.
MR. MORLEY:
With the assistance of Mr. Issa's replacement -- come to me, please.  You could show this to 
Your Honours and then to my learned friends.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you recognise that document? 
A.	Yes.  I saw the document and I recognise it. 
Q.	Is that a document in your handwriting? 
A.	That is my handwriting, yes.  I was with*********.  I worked with *********to prepare this document.  He was in the same prison with me. 
Q.	Although it does not contain, as a formal witness statement, the usual declaration that its contents are true, to the best of your understanding, in writing that document, are the contents true? 
A.	Yes, because I am the one who prepared that document and everything contained therein comes from me. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I have an application that the document becomes an exhibit, not as to the truth of its content, but as to a demonstration insofar as it may be possible to show a consistency between the document and the testimony which was given.  The document has been referred to frequently and there have been points raised about inconsistencies which may be thought large or maybe thought relatively minor.  Well, my application is that the document goes into evidence so that it becomes part of the record of this man's testimony as Prosecution Exhibit -- and I look to Mr. Constant. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
From the records that I have here, that should be Exhibit P. 20.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Mr. President, Mr. Morley has a knack for creating interesting complex legal issues.  I think this is one of them.  It's our -- we object to the admission of the document because we don't believe that prior consistent statements are admissible per se.  An inconsistent statement such as those that were contained in the documents were put to the witness and the witness explained them, and so the evidence was the oral information of the inconsistency and the witness's explanation.  

It is our position that if they are to be - to the extent that there are consistent statements in this document that are -- go to rebut a claim of recent fabrication, that those consistent statements, likewise, could be put to the witness and he could react to them.  But the wholesale submission of prior consistent statements is impermissible under the rules and we would object. 
JUDGE SHORT: 
Which rules, Mr. Robinson?

MR. ROBINSON: 
I am referring to Rule 89, and I was just practically looking through some jurisprudence as this issue was raised and I haven't really located something yet, but typically, a prior consistent statement is not admissible unless it is used to rebut a claim of recent fabrication.  And so I am saying under Rule 89 that this is not admissible because it is a wholesale admission of prior consistent statements.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY: 
And, as Your Honours know, the point of putting through the document is because there was quite a lot of cross-examination on it, in an effort to demonstrate inconsistency.  So for context, the document should be available to Your Honours to review in order to be able to establish whether the points raised in cross-examination amount to very much at all. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I want to read here from the Appeals Chamber in the Ntakirutimana judgment.  "Prior consistent statements cannot be used to bolster a witness's credibility except to rebut the charge of recent --"
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the booth is having trouble following you.  Would you please slow down?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I am sorry.  "Prior consistent statements cannot be used to bolster a witness's credibility except to rebut a charge of recent fabrication of testimony.  The fact that a witness testifies in a manner consistent with an earlier statement does not establish that the witness was truthful on either occasion.  After all, an unlikely or untrustworthy story is not made more likely or more trustworthy simply by rote repetition.  Another reason for supporting this position is that if admissible and taken as probative, parties would invariably adduce numerous such statements in a manner that would be unnecessarily unwieldy to the trial."  And that is the Appeal Chamber's judgment of Ntakirutimana on the 13th of December 2004, at paragraph 147. 
MR. MORLEY: 
That is helpful, but it misses the point.  There has been extensive cross-examination on this document in order to demonstrate inconsistency.  So inconsistency being an issue, the document is reviewable by Their Honours, I respectfully submit, to establish what weight to attach to the argument of inconsistency.  So if there had never been the document raised in order to demonstrate inconsistency, or alternatively, if the document had only been raised once or twice, then perhaps my learned friend may have some force in what he says.  So the document is floated in and out and I believe the witnesses know frequently, and in those circumstances, it is precisely because inconsistency has been raised that the document is reviewable.  It is not being put in simply because it is consistent.  It is being put in, in order to weigh the arguments of inconsistency which have been articulated by Mr. Robinson.  He has, I respectfully submit, created this rod for his own back. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would submit that this is a 13-page document that contains many, many elements concerning this witness's testimony.  Only some of those elements were presented to the witness and it was done in the form of particular paragraphs and particular issues.  If there is some force to the argument that there is somehow a claim of recent fabrication to which these statements rebut, then those particular issues that have been put to this witness concerning this document can be explored by Mr. Morley, not by admitting the whole document, but putting those portions to the witness.  I think that is the correct legal position. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Gentlemen, we can't have you repeating your arguments over and over again. 
MR. MORLEY: 
The only additional point to make is, my learned friend makes the observation about recent fabrication.  It is quite clear from the way in which he has helpfully put his case that those areas of what he calls "inconsistency" demonstrates that the witness has been fabricating evidence.  So the issue of fabrication is live.  I respectfully submit, as I articulated it, that the document is reviewable not as to the truth of its contents.  Your Honours rely on what the witnesses said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, just wait a minute.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  I say no more. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we think that you had complicated the issue of admission by your initial comment about the consistency between the statement and the witness's testimony, because we agree with Mr. Robinson that these statements -- the prior consistent statement of a witness is not evidence, that the inconsistencies of a witness are -- is a tool for assisting us to assess the credibility and reliability of the witness's testimony. 

Now, what has been concerning us though is that we -- I had not even noticed that Mr. Robinson had not put in a statement during this cross-examination, and we are of the view that in determining whether there was an inconsistency or not, access to the statement would also be a useful tool for us.  So we are willing to admit it for that purpose. 
MR. MORLEY: 
It may be my language was clumsy, but that is precisely the purpose that I was offering it for.  It is in order to weigh the inconsistency.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, this is to help us to determine whether there is inconsistency.

MR. MORLEY:
Exactly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson had read sections of the testimony, but we feel that looking at the -having the document at our disposal would assist us in evaluating this. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes.  And Your Honour is quite right, material and the statement itself is not evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's not.
MR. MORLEY:
It is simply a tool for weighing whether there was important inconsistency. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So we will admit it for that purpose. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  Prosecution Exhibit 20, I think, from my learned friend, Mr. Constant.  

The bundle of papers that are there in the hands of Your Honour's assistant contains the handwritten Kinyarwanda material followed by the translation in English, followed by the translation in French, collectively stapled.  I would simply invite it is called Prosecution Exhibit 20. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. P. 20 admitted) 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, if I can take you to another thought.  We know from Defence Exhibit D. NZ62, a letter written by the préfet of Kigali, Mr. -- or, Colonel Renzaho, dated the 4th of March of 1992, that you were among a number of officials issued with a firearm.  You remember you gave evidence about receiving a firearm in 1992? 
A.	Yes, I remember that this letter was written in 1992. 
Q.	And why were you given a firearm? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Morley, he has answered that question. 
THE WITNESS:
I was given a firearm so that I could defend myself. 
(Pages 17 to 23 by Sithembiso Moyo)




1200H
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, if you are coming to another point, you could come to it more quickly, I think. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  There's only two questions to ask on this matter.  If I may ask the follow-up question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	And what were you defending yourself from? 
A.	I said that we had to defend ourselves against anyone who wanted to attack us in our homes.  
Q.	Turning to late 1992, there were some rallies which we've heard about.  There was the Ruhengeri rally, at which President Habyarimana spoke, and you heard that material on the radio.  Do you remember telling us that?  
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	During that rally, you recall telling us that there was reference to the Interahamwe.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I remember.  
Q.	There was then a rally on the 22nd of November 1992 in Kabaya, when Léon Mugesera spoke, and you remember telling us about hearing that material on the radio? 
A.	Yes, I remember saying that. 
Q.	You may remember in the questioning that was being put to you at around this time, it was being suggested that the Interahamwe were not being troublesome.  Do you remember that being put to you?  
A.	Yes, that is what was put to me, but I did not agree with the person who put that to me because I know that at that time the Interahamwe were attacking Tutsi. 
Q.	You'll remember also it was suggested to you that the contents of the Mugesera speech had not been widely broadcast and were not widely known.  Do you remember that being put to you? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'd like to interpose an objection here to the series of questions about what the witness remembers.  To me, it's irrelevant what the witness remembers about what was put to him, and many, many questions are now being -- the time is being taken up with asking the witness if he remembers something.  It seems to me that the correct way to ask on re-direct examination is to simply ask the question, without the preface of remembering, and I think it's suggestive and also it's taking up a lot of time. 
MR. MORLEY:
Respectfully, what's taking up the time are the interruptions.  I'm simply laying the witness -- orientating him to a point in time and a point in time in the cross-examination.  There's nothing wrong with it at all.  And now that I've done that, I know what I'm going to ask next.  It's taken approximately a minute.  With Your Honour's leave, I'll continue.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Ask your question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	There was a magazine called Isibo, which was offered to you as a Defence exhibit.  
MR. MORLEY:
And although I don't have the D. NZ number, Your Honours will recall that the date of this magazine was redacted.  

With your help, if you could please remind Their Honours of the magazine which has gone into evidence.  

Your Honour is invited to look at the date of that magazine because the date has been redacted -- I don't want to repeat it in open Court -- Your Honours remember why, namely, because this man is mentioned in the magazine.  And if Mr. Robinson might be reminded of the document, and no doubt he'll remind us what the D. NZ number is.  
MR. ROBINSON:
It's D. NZ58.  
MR. MORLEY:
And my other learned friends, please.  Now, with your assistance again, can you just bring that document back to Their Honours, front page of the magazine?  

And if Your Honours might just observe the drawing on the front of it and the reference at the bottom of the magazine to the Mugesera speech, and then I'll put the document in front of the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you have there the front page of the exhibit, D. NZ58.  There is a drawing on the front and there is reference to Mugesera toward the bottom of the page.  What does it say about Mugesera at the bottom of the page, please?  
A.	Reference is made to the repatriation of the Tutsi across Nyarabarongo river.  It must be said that Nyarabarongo was not a road.  What was meant was that they should be thrown into Nyarabarongo river so that they would be sent back to their home.  
Q.	That reference appears on the front page of that magazine; is that right? 
A.	Yes, reference is made to Mugesera's speech that he made in Kabaya.  It's like a title, but Mugesera's name is clearly obvious.  It is also apparent that these Tutsis were to be drowned in Nyarabarongo river.  So this is about the speech that Mugesera made in Kabaya.  This runs counter to what the Defence sought to prove when it said that Mugesera did not mean that these Tutsis should be repatriated to their home by drowning them.  
Q.	I'd like you to look at the drawing.  Now, when we look at the drawing, we see there's a bus, and in the bus there are lots of people.  And on the bus, hanging off it, are some other people.  The people hanging off the bus, what sort of people are they?  
A.	The people inside the bus and those who were hanging off it were Interahamwes. 
Q.	Looking at the figure hanging off the left side of the bus, lowest, can you see -- 
MR. MORLEY:
And it's a matter of observation, so I will lead the witness -- 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	-- that the figure is dressed in the MRND uniform, with the words, letters "MRND" in circles within the uniform?  
A.	Yes, I see the drawing. 
Q.	At the time that this front cover was drawn -- you can see the date at the top of the page.  Don't repeat the date.  But at the time, it's a matter of record, it's right, is it not, that the president of the MRND was President Habyarimana, and the general secretary was Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	There are two figures who are caricatures hanging off that bus.  All other faces are relatively blank.  Looking at those caricatures of the two figures on the face of the magazine, are you able to tell us who they are drawings of?  
A.	I would not say that such-and-such a person was the subject of caricature, but I think the artist wanted to make a caricature of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Well, looking at the Interahamwe for a moment, as they hang off the bus, are they carrying any weapons? 
A.	It is possible to see that they carry machetes, hatchets.  I see the people are hanging as if they were soldiers.  At the time, that is the posture they took when they went about.  They had weapons.  
Q.	Now, again with the assistance of the registry official, who is walking back, I'd like us to take the front page of that magazine, and I'll avoid the -- no, we're in open session.  I'll deal with it in a different way.  

All right.  You've told us about machetes and you've told us about hatchets.  What other sorts of weapons can you see there, please?  
A.	Apart from the MRND uniform, I see no other weapons in the drawing. 
Q.	But what is hanging from the belt of the person hanging from the bus?  
A.	I see a handgun on the belt of the person hanging from the bus. 
Q.	What is in the hand of the character who is drawn on the other side of the bus, apparently trying to get into the bus?  
A.	The person is also holding a handgun, like the other person who is hanging off the bus. 
Q.	What is in the hand of the Interahamwe on top of the bus, leaning over the bus, and trying to get in the window of the bus? 
A.	The person is holding a club.  That is the person who is holding the MRND banner. 
Q.	And as a matter of observation, the figure on the bottom right, is it right that in his hands there are what are called rice flails?  You may understand the word differently.  I have no idea how that's going to get translated, but two pieces of wood, separated by a chain.  
A.	Yes, they had that type of weapon whenever they attended party meetings. 
Q.	So on the front of this magazine, in the hands of the Interahamwe, we note the date, we observe firearms, rice flails, hatchets, machetes, clubs; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  That was the type of weapon we would see, essentially. 
MR. MORLEY:
Can I have the document back for a moment, please?
THE WITNESS:
That we see on the page, rather.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	There are words being said by the Interahamwe in little balloons.  I'd like you to look at those words and tell me what they are saying.  
MR. MORLEY:
With your assistance, sir.  Thank you.  Back to the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you see the two balloons, which represent things being said by the Interahamwe hanging off the bus?  
A.	I cannot really see the place you've pointed out to me.  Is it at the top or the bottom?  
Q.	It's the translation difficulty.  If you look at the figures hanging off the bus, do you see that they are supposed to be saying something?  Can you see that?  
A.	I see it says, "Let us descend."  I also see, "We are descending."  I also see a place where it says "Direction south."  
Q.	Well, "direction south" refers to the direction of the bus, but in terms of what the Interahamwe seem to be saying, it's, "Let us descend" and "We are descending."  Can you help us?  What do you think that's a reference to?  
A.	"Turamanutse" means, or refers to, statements made to the effect that the person was going to descend with the Interahamwe.  Now, "turamanutse" means, "We now descend.  Get ready to see us."  
Q.	And what is it that President Habyarimana said at Ruhengeri on the 15th of November of 1992 about what he would do with his Interahamwe? 
A.	He is referring to the speech when he said that he and his Interahamwe would descend.  So that was what was said by the journalist.  He was referring to that speech by the head of state.  
Q.	On the face of this magazine, then, we have the Interahamwe, armed to the teeth, hanging off a bus, descending, that being a reference back to the president's speech.  Is that your understanding?  
A.	Yes.  All this was a reference to the president -- President Habyarimana's speech, meaning that Habyarimana's speech was immediately put into action.  Because immediately after the speech, there was insecurity in Shyorongi.  
Q.	And what do you mean by "insecurity"?  What's that about?  
A.	When the Interahamwe came back from Ruhengeri, before they arrived in Kigali, they attacked Tutsis living in Shyorongi, and a number of these Tutsis had to flee their homes. 
MR. MORLEY:
Now, with the assistance of the registry gentleman, I'd like Their Honours to see the front page again.  I'm conscious of the fact we've been describing it verbally, and visually, having described it verbally, one can see how it all fits together.  

Your Honours will see there the Interahamwe, the different weapons which are drawn in their hands.  Your Honours are reminded to look at the date of this magazine.  What's said in the balloons by the Interahamwe is, "We are descending" or "Let us descend," a reference back to the Habyarimana speech.  

Now, if I could have the document again, please.  With your assistance, please.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Witness, with the assistance of the staff -- he is indicating the two faces which appear in the drawing.  Face number 1 is the face lower down the page.  Face number 2 is the face higher up the page.  I want you to look at those faces, and looking at the face number 1, which is the face lower down the page, do you see it?  Are you looking at it?  
A.	Yes, I see the person. 
Q.	Who is that?  
A.	I cannot really see who it is.  I just see the drawing.  If I were to venture a guess, I would just be guessing, literally, and I could be wrong.  
Q.	Look at face number 2.  Are you looking at face number 2?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, who is that?  
A.	I can also not tell who this is.  Sometimes when journalists caricature people or lampoon them, it's difficult to tell. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I think you're pushing the witness.  Is this re-examination?  
MR. MORLEY:
It is, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, he gave that answer more than once since 12 o'clock.  
MR. MORLEY:
He's given it once before, but I'm drawing his attention precisely to the area on the page in case he wasn't looking at the right spot. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this is re-examination, it's not cross-examination.  I think you are pushing him a bit. 
MR. MORLEY:
It's not cross-examination.  I haven't asked him a closed question with relation to the faces.  And it is re-examination on something which was put in evidence by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson.  So I respectfully submit it's perfectly proper.  It's not something that arose in evidence-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We didn't say that the enquiry was improper, but you are going over an issue which he has denied more than once already. 
MR. MORLEY:
Not more than once.  And I'm uneasy that, when I asked my question earlier, his attention was not focused on precisely the area that I wanted him to look at.  We now have his answers in relation to those two faces.  And I move on from the subject at this stage.  But I respectfully submit I am not cross-examining him.  It is proper re-examination.  

With Your Honour's leave, I'll move on to the next subject.  

Can we remove the document, please, from the witness?  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You will recall that there was an arrest warrant issued for Mugesera.  Do you remember seeing some documents about that during your cross-examination?  
A.	Yes, I remember I was shown that. 
Q.	And, for the record, the documents you were shown were D. NZ59 and D. NZ60, namely, a letter from the minister of justice, Mbonampeka, dated the 25th of November 1992, and then the arrest warrant, D. NZ60, dated the 6th of December of 1992.  You may remember seeing those documents.  Was Mugesera ever arrested, and what happened to the minister of justice?  
A.	Mugesera was never arrested.  The decision to arrest him was never implemented.  Besides, in the days that followed, the minister of justice decided to resign. 
Q.	And why did he resign, as you understood it, please?  
A.	He resigned because the MRND authorities and security forces were giving him problems.  You may recall that the minister of defence was an MRND member, and he even made a statement on radio, saying he was tendering his resignation because of this problem, that all -- or any decisions he sought to implement were rendered null. 
Q.	And was there a specific problem he had in relation to Mugesera's arrest?  
A.	As a matter of fact, Mugesera had just shown that he had a plan to harm Rwandans and harm Tutsis, in the speech he made at Kabaya.  
Q.	Was there any relationship between the failure to arrest Mugesera and the resignation of the minister for justice?  
A.	That was not the only problem.  If he was minister of justice and took a decision that was not implemented, I think that would be a source of frustration to him.  The fact that Mugesera was not arrested and imprisoned is one of the problems that led to his resignation, that and other actions of the Interahamwe that went unpunished. 
Q.	We know that the arrest warrant in relation to Mugesera was issued on the 6th of December of 1992.  You may remember being shown a Defence exhibit, D. NZ58, a handwritten note from within the executive bureau of the MRND, dated the 7th of December of 1992.  
MR. MORLEY:
With your assistance, if we could find it immediately, D. NZ58, please.  

Your Honours' tab 67.  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's D. NZ61.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm grateful to my learned friend.  I've written it down as 58.  Let's look at 61 first.  He's more often right than I am.  61.  Yes, for the third time, 61.  

Thank you, that is the correct document.  Show it to Their Honours.  Yes, that's right.  Show it to Their Honours and then to my learned friends.  And the point will just take a moment.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	We can see from the document that it is a note to the president, Habyarimana, from the political bureau of the MRND, in which at item 2, Léon Mugesera's case is discussed.  We can see that on the face of the document.  You agree with me?  
A.	I don't know if it is this note you are referring to.  Yes.  Yes, I see the note. 
Q.	If we turn to the last page, the top sentence refers to how the party must defend Mugesera, referring to "defending its member."  
A.	Yes, I see the text. 
MR. MORLEY:
I suspect, looking at Your Honour, that is a convenient moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is, yes.  We take the luncheon recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1232H) 
(Pages 24 to 30 by Karen Holm)



(Court resumed at 1425H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	In 1993 you gave testimony that you understood that around that time the Interahamwe began to have arms.  Do you remember telling us that during the course of your evidence? 
A.	Yes, I recall. 
Q.	And you may recall there were questions put to you by counsel for Ngirumpatse about Gitata (phonetic) ITATA and the report which decided to relieve him of the office of bourgmestre.  Do you remember those questions? 
A.	Yes, such questions were put to me. 
Q.	The report was exhibited -- 
MR. MORLEY:
And I'm looking to the registry, I thought it was D. NG10, it is the report of the 24th of June of 1993. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It is D. NG11. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, if you could take the document, turn to page 5, K number, K0503419, paragraph 7 and paragraph 8 is what we are going to look at.  Now, I understand that you are able to read and speak French; is that right? 
A.	I don't speak French.  I can neither speak nor read French. 
Q.	I just heard the answer "Nybiso", which I thought meant yes.  And I have no understanding of how such a long answer came out of translation -- 
A.	I did not express myself very well.  I thought you said you cannot either read nor speak French, so I did answer yes to the question which I thought was, "It is true, is it not, that you can neither read nor speak French?" 
Q.	No, the question was in the positive.  I am asking you, are you able to read French and speak French? 
A.	No, I can neither read nor speak French.  I cannot, therefore, understand, read or speak French at all thoroughly. 
Q.	Well, we will work with it in this way, I am going to read this in French, my poor schoolboy French, paragraph 7.  It will be translated as I read it.  Paragraph 7, page 5, reads, "The witnesses confirmed that the Interahamwe played a real police role in Murambi, and there was a lack of cooperation between the secteur conseiller and the legal system with regards to the offences committed by the Interahamwe."  
Turning to paragraph 8, it continues; "The distribution of weapons between Murambi -- in Murambi commune was in the context of civil defence and had given rise to controversy.  The commission noted that the anxieties in respect of that distribution of weapons, or due to the fact that a certain number of weapons were issued to members of the Interahamwe group who re -- had recently been recruited into the ranks of the communal police."

What does that tell you about the distribution of arms to the Interahamwe in the Murambi commune, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I object.  This witness -- there is no personal knowledge of this.  To simply ask him what this document tells him is of no probative value. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, the document has been put in front of him by my learned friend defending Ngirumpatse as part of what was a rather long examination of whether GITATA was or was not a bourgmestre at a rally.  And of interest, the Tribunal may feel, is referenced to the distribution of arms under the guise of the police to the Interahamwe.  The witness has given evidence about the distribution of arms in 1993.  And he has also given evidence of disturbances in Murambi.  I respectfully submit I can ask him in the context of this report, put in evidence by the Defence, very helpfully, that it helps with what his perception of events around June of 1993 was in the Murambi commune. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think that is a good job of lawyering by Mr. Morley to call your attention to this document.  I think it would have been better to do it during closing submissions since the witness has no knowledge of these events.  But - anyway, he has put it in front of you, you see the point -- points made.  I don't think there is anything added by asking the witness to comment on events of which he had no involvement or knowledge. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm not going to press the point, but it is of interest that the witness was asked an enormous amount about material about which he had no knowledge by the Defence.  I am seeking to get the witness to look at a document which supports his observations, and what was within his knowledge of Murambi, and my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, is uneasy and I understand why.  May I request of Your Honours as to whether I need to press this particular enquiry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know what your question would have been, but the point is if the document is already in evidence, it is already in evidence. 
MR. MORLEY:
And I'm now asking the witness to comment on it in the way that everyone else has been inviting the witness to comment on documents during cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you are in redirect. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, I am in redirect.  But if comment has been invited, then it seems to me I can respectfully invite Your Honours to allow me to invite comment.  But I see my learned friend at the back of the court is on her feet. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, I am on my feet.  Thank you, Mr. President.  When I tendered this document into evidence, I did so in a specific context.  And Mr. Morley, as usual, is trying to get the witness to say something other than what I said by using this document in a spirit of bad faith.  And he is doing this contrary to the reasons for which I tendered this document.  I just wish to add this to the correct objections of my colleague,   Mr. Robinson. 
MR. MORLEY:
Inevitably Mr. Morley is seeking to use the document in a way which is different from my learned friend.  It is an interesting document.  And I have not put it in evidence, oh dear; it may not be to her advantage. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would just like to recall for you a few days ago, or maybe a week ago, when I tried to ask the witness about the article of the Chicago Tribunal that was already in evidence.  And was put in evidence for one purpose, that being to establish his identity was well known and did not need protective measures.  And then Mr. Morley objected when I tried to use it for a different purpose, that being the content of his statement to the reporter.  So, I think that we have to be consistent here. 
MR. MORLEY:
Respectfully, nonsense.  The document has been put in as a report on the reasons why                  Gitata (phonetic) was removed from office, and when he was removed from office and there was reference to its contents.  The contents are live before the Tribunal.  And in those circumstances, my question is not inappropriate.  

A more interesting question for Your Honours is whether I really need to make any enquiry of the witness.  I can certainly do so, but Your Honours may feel that it is not necessary. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Morley, you asked for our opinion.  The thing is we don't actually think that the question was inadmissible; but we also don't think it is necessary. 
MR. MORLEY:
I thought you might think that.  I will move on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it gives me an opportunity to make a comment that a lot of time has been taken up in the trial by reading speeches to witnesses, and asking the witnesses to comment on the speeches.  And we have been really wondering whether that practice really advances the interest of either party.  

At the end of the day, we are going to be reading these speeches ourselves, and drawing our conclusion as to what the speeches mean.  And unless there is a particular reason for getting the witnesses to comment on the content of these speeches, we question whether it is a -- advances your interest in any way. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm grateful for that judicial indication.  And I propose to take action upon it, if Your Honour just allows me a moment. 

We have just saved, perhaps, an hour. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, with your leave, I will take half a minute, but I have got to say this; the reading, as        Mr. Morley suggests is problematic in that there are problems with understanding.  And he made an inaccurate quotation because he read "witnesses confirm" whereas the document, it said the documents -- or the "witnesses affirmed."  I think that when the Trial Chamber reads the transcript, it will correct that.  But since the transcript will be erroneous, then I wish to draw the Court's attention to this.  It is affirmed, not confirmed, because this is not quite the same thing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I have always known that my French pronunciation was lousy, so I take the point.  

Your Honours, I move on now from this document, and I turn to an aspect of something that Ngirumpatse said on the 16th of January of 1994. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, you will recall that at a point in time in your cross-examination you were asked to consider what was said by Ngirumpatse during a rally on the 16th of January of 1994.  Do you remember that rally? 
A.	Yes, I remember that rally.  And, in fact, it was the video cassette of that rally that was presented to me.  It was a political rally that was led by Mathieu Ngirumpatse at the Kigali regional stadium. 
Q.	During that rally, Ngirumpatse is on record as saying --  I'm referring to K0244825, which is page 7 of what we believe, or ought to be, Prosecution Exhibit 14.  There is no need to get it out; I'm simply going to read a sentence from it.  I quote Ngirumpatse:  "What can we say about people who went about telling the UN soldiers and the representative of the secretary general that the MRND is getting ready for combat?  That they are distributing weapons here and there; that we are carrying out military training every day and so forth.  One would have the impression we are no longer working.  These people will pay dearly for the rumours they are peddling." 

Now do you understand what I have read to you, and then I will ask you a question? 
A.	I don't know whether you are asking me to say something about the passage that you have just read, but I know that Mathieu Ngirumpatse said these words. 
Q.	He suggested in that speech that it was simply rumour that weapons were being distributed and that there was military training taking place.  Was it simply rumour or was it true that weapons were being distributed and military training taking place? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I would like to make an observation but not an objection.  I think this is a relevant question within the context of this examination.  But I recall for you that during the testimony -- and excuse me, if Witness UB could take his headphones off for the moment.  Thank you. 

During the testimony of Witness G who had -- was a member of the Interahamwe committee and had more direct involvement with the allegation of weapons, this exact same scenario was presented to Witness G by Mr. Morley and Mr. Rapp; they did it twice, actually.  And the point was that, "Yes, the MRND had had weapons prior to January of '94.  And, yes, Mr. Ngirumpatse was saying on January '94 that this was just rumours."  

So the point was made very clearly with another witness.  Now, I think that the Trial Chamber, if you are looking for ways to shorten these proceedings, that this is a good example.  And it adds to the example of the Ruhengeri meeting, which now each of the three witnesses who have testified during this trial have testified about the same speeches at the same meeting, and the Sindikubwabo speech, two of whom were not present and Witness G was present at all of these events.  So I question the utility of having multiple witnesses testify to make the same point.  So -- anyway, that is an observation from the Defence. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, if there ever was an example of the pot calling the kettle black, that is, perhaps, it.  My learned friend, in his cross-examination, brought up this particular passage which was brought up during Witness G's -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley -- 
MR. MORLEY:
-- examination. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, has this witness not already testified about this matter in his examination-in-chief, and even in cross-examination?  
MR. MORLEY:
Not in his examination-in-chief; in his cross-examination, yes.  This particular aspect was part of what was read out by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson; it having also been read out during the examination of the Witness G.  And my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, makes a good point, but it, perhaps, ought to be turned on himself.  Having raised the point with another witness, which he suggests is unnecessary for the Prosecution to do, if he has done so, then it may not be inappropriate for the Prosecution to elicit from the witness, as we heard from the other witness, that that section of that speech amounts to a lie by Ngirumpatse to the assembled masses. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But you have not answered my question.  My point is this, that whether in examination-in-chief or cross-examination, hasn't this witness answered the question as to whether this fact -- or this matter was rumour or fact?  
MR. MORLEY:
Not this matter, this witness, during this cross-examination, no.  It was a section of speech, it was a lot longer than that.  I simply read a sentence, which was read out by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, who went on to make different points.  I am simply trying to elicit the point that Ngirumpatse was lying.  That is not something that Mr. Robinson brought out in cross-examination, for obvious reasons, he didn't want to embarrass Mr. Ngirumpatse's position.  I do want to embarrass it and that is why I am trying to elicit it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And Judge Short, if I could assist in answering your question.  What Mr. Morley said is correct that the point we were discussing about this very same speech with this witness arose out of the direct examination in which Mr. Morley was trying to get the witness to say that Ngirumpatse had talked about the mistakes in the past that was made in relation to Tutsi.  And so this was included to the section that I read to the witness, but I asked him if there is anything in here about the Tutsi or about mistakes of the past.  So the exact point was not covered with this witness either on cross-examination or direct.  

But my point is that when you have multiple witnesses testifying to the same thing, at some point it is certainly cumulative.  And I think the Trial Chamber should exercise some discretion.  We are -- our cross-examination is dictated by the scope of the direct examination.  And if these matters are gone into with every witness, they will be gone into on cross-examination.  But it seems to me that you should exercise some control of the proceedings by -- when the OTP makes a point like this with one witness, they should not be repeating it. 
MR. MORLEY:
The scope of the cross-examination cannot reasonably be said to have been limited by the Prosecution evidence-in-chief.  Your Honours have heard ten days of cross-examination of this man.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we are going to be having a meeting after your redirect where these issues can be discussed.  I don't think we need to discuss it now.  If the Court is going to respond to your motion, which I have listed at 10:57 this morning, you are going to be in danger of the firing squad if you don't get a move on. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm pretty confident I will avoid the problem.  And I do want to get a move on.  And as Your Honours can see, we have now spent ten minutes arguing about this, when we could have had the answer a moment ago, which is fairly innocuous. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but Mr. Robinson said he wasn't objecting, he was just commenting, so I don't have to rule. 
MR. MORLEY:
No, Your Honour.  And I see Mr. Weyl wants to make an observation, as well. 
MR. WEYL: 
No, Mr. President, it is not an argument.  I just wish to raise a question to the effect that there is someone in the public gallery who is using a camera and is taking photographs.  I just wish to express my surprise at this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant -- Mr. Registrar. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I do not think it is enough to ask him to leave the public gallery.  I do not think that just anyone can come in and photograph a courtroom and leave with the photographs, without infringing on the rights of someone, of anyone, including the Accused, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, some control is, in fact, exercised by the registry.  And the registrar has recognised one of the persons as being a member of the ICTR staff.  He is now going to make further enquiries, so the matter can be dealt with at that level. 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you for that information, Mr. President. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, perhaps, if I can get back to the witness and I hope to knock this small point on the head.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, when Ngirumpatse suggested to the people that it was only a rumour that arms were being distributed and there was military training taking place of the Interahamwe, was he telling the truth? 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I think phrasing it that way is improper. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, one wonders why.  It is a statement; I am asking whether it was the truth. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Because it involves speculation on Mr. Ngirumpatse's state of knowledge, and of all of that.  And, also, I believe that the Trial Chamber does not encourage us to have one witness saying what another person has said is the truth or false.  I think I have encountered that problem myself earlier in this trial. 
MR. MORLEY:
The witness has given extensive testimony, and I don't want to have to go over it, of how Ngirumpatse was organising military training, and there was a distribution of arms taking place in 1993.  He is in a position to say if Ngirumpatse stood up in January 1994 and suggested that it was only a rumour, whether that was true or not.  My Learned friend, Mr. Robinson, knows that.  I'm surprised at how long this point has taken. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, why don't you just ask him whether it was a rumour or a fact?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Avoid saying whether he was telling -- whether it was a lie, whether Mr. Ngirumpatse was stating -- was lying or not. 
MR. MORLEY:
It is the lie I am after.  There are two stages to the point.  One is, were the weapons being distributed, was there military training. But the second stage to it is when Ngirumpatse says that the military training and the distribution of guns is only a rumour; the second stage is, when he says that, is that true or is he lying.  And it is the second stage that I am interested in getting to.  

The first stage, which Your Honours observes, could involve the witness going over all of the information that he had about the distribution of guns and the military training.  I tried to avoid that.  I am simply going straight to the heart of the issue, against the interest of Ngirumpatse that he was lying when he said what he said about (unintelligible).  So, it is the second stage that I am interested in. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  It is my understanding of the way the Chamber wishes us to operate is that instead of asking a witness whether something is true or not that another witness has said, or an Accused has said, that you ask were it a fact, and then the Chamber draws the conclusion as to whether or not what the -- what was said is true or not. 

MR. MORLEY:
No, that can be one circumstance.  But in this particular case, the witness knows, and gave evidence of the knowledge of Ngirumpatse.  And he is in a position to say, from his knowledge of what Ngirumpatse knew, that if Ngirumpatse said, "It is only rumour," that was a lie. It is a short point. 
(Pages 31 to 39 by Donna M. Lewis)

































1500H 
JUDGE SHORT:
Yeah, Mr. Morley, but I think the Bench is of the view that all you need to get from the witness is whether this was rumour or fact.  We should draw the inferences as to whether Ngirumpatse was lying or not. 
MR. MORLEY:
But the point will be made by the Defence that Ngirumpatse didn't know whether there was military training or firearms distribution.  This witness can tell Your Honours that he did know, and for him to say what he said was a lie. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we are not really with you.  This is an issue which is in the indictment.  You have to prove whether Mr. Ngirumpatse knew these facts or not or did it or not.  You -- you establish that by evidence.  And if Mr. Ngirumpatse makes a statement denying that that was so, then that's a matter which we will decide on, based on the totality of the evidence.  

Now, you have said that this witness has given testimony addressing the subject, and it will be up to us to draw the inferences at the -- when we are -- when we make the assessment.  But just to get the witness to use a pejorative word "lie" or "untruth" doesn't advance the case any further.  
MR. MORLEY:
But it's not a pejorative term.  It's a factual statement.  And the point is that, whilst it may be open to Your Honours to infer Mr. Ngirumpatse's state of mind from circumstances, this witness can take the matter one step further.  He can tell you that he knows he was lying and he knows that because of all he knew about Ngirumpatse and of what was going on.  

Matters don't have to be left simply as inferences.  There are occasions, such as this, when the witness can tell Your Honours what was in the mind of Ngirumpatse when he uttered those words because he, the witness, knew the man and knew what was in his mind. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, the Bench has ruled.  I think you should move on.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, turning to the witness -- 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Was it a rumour or was it a fact that weapons were being distributed and there was military training of the Interahamwe?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's microphone doesn't seem to be on.  

THE WITNESS:
As I said before, he said that these were rumours, but, in fact, this was a proven fact.  The Interahamwe had been trained and had received weapons.  I say that this speech was destined for the consumption of the international community.  But we knew that the Interahamwe had firearms in the secteurs.  In short, these words were not true because the Interahamwe in our secteur had been trained.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Who had been organising their training? 
A.	As I have already said, the Interahamwe had a separate organisation, ranging from the cellule to the higher echelons.  In the city of Kigali, the Interahamwe had an office at party headquarters, and it is from this office that they received instructions.  This means that they received instructions from the head office of the MRND party in respect of transport and other kinds of organisation. 
Q.	And spell it out.  Who was the head of the MRND party?  Name, please.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  This is so redundant that it's just -- it should be done in front of a jury. 
MR. MORLEY:
What's wrong with the witness saying the name?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, there's nothing actually wrong with it except that it is repetitious, and we are not a jury.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour's not a jury.  What's repetitious are the interventions.  We'd have got a lot further a lot earlier without them.  The witness is in a position to say who the head of the organisation was. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we know that, and we know exactly who -- he's said it so often already that we already know the answer.  But if it makes you feel better, you can ask him again. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Who organised the distribution of arms to the Interahamwe? 
A.	I think I did answer that question.  I said that it was party headquarters and the bureau, that is to say, the president, two vice-presidents, and the secretary-general.  It was the party leadership.  

And there was an employee at the headquarters who wasn't trusted with that task.  His name was Turatsinze, but he took his orders from the bureau.  In 1993, when we elected the members of the bureau, it was Mathieu who was elected president.  Before that, he was secretary-general of the party.  I think I did mention that.  I repeat now, it was the top leadership of the party that was -- directly undertook all that. 
Q.	That will do.  Thank you. 
Taking you now to another document put in evidence by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, D. NZ33 - 

MR. MORLEY:
With the assistance of the ever helpful registry staff, D. NZ33.

That's the one.  Thank you.  

If that might be placed in front of the witness. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, this document has been entered into evidence only in Kinyarwandan, and I want you to observe, please, it's a document dated the 23rd of April 1994, signed by Nzirorera and Karemera, and it's a communiqué from the MRND to the populace.  And on the first page, fourth paragraph, can you simply read what it is that Nzirorera and Karemera were saying to the Interahamwe.  Read that paragraph, please.  
A.	"MRND leadership thanks the leaders of the Interahamwe, as well as the members of the national committee of the Interahamwe, for having cooperated with the population -- with the -- with the public in assisting the Rwandan armed forces in order to repel the enemy, who are pursuing their aim of exterminating all Rwandans.  

"The RPF's criminal plans and terrorist acts must not discourage our youths.  They must persist in pursuing their objective, which is to restore peace and calm for the public as a whole.  They must unmask and denounce the enemy, wherever they are.  However, that should not be a pretext for attacking innocent individuals who have nothing to do with the war, who are not involved in the war, and this in order to restore order and peace throughout the national territory.  The top leadership of the MRND asks the Interahamwe to closely follow some Interahamwe who -- closely supervise some Interahamwe who are indulging in acts that --" 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	"-- are contrary to the Interahamwe regulations."  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Where are we now...(microphones overlapping) 
A.	I'm at paragraph number five.  I'd finished with paragraph number four. 
Q.	All right.  You've read paragraph number four, and you started reading paragraph number five; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I'd already begun reading paragraph five, but I'd finished paragraph four. 
Q.	Thank you.  That helps me as to where you were going.  

Now, what were the Interahamwe doing when they were being thanked by Nzirorera and Karemera on the 23rd of April?  What had they been doing? 
A.	In Kigali town, the Interahamwe had done nothing to restore security for Rwandans.  On the contrary, they were exterminating the Tutsi.  They were manning roadblocks everywhere, so they had done nothing to restore public order and security.  And, to my view, in my understanding, they were being thanked and congratulated for perpetrating the slaughter.  They had done nothing to restore public order and security in Kigali.  
Q.	On the 11th of April of 1994, did you make a call to Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, I made a telephone call to Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	It was at one point suggested you would not have been able to get through because the phone lines weren't working.  What do you say about that? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to have to object to that because that's not an accurate portrayal of the cross-examination.  The suggestion about the phone lines working within Kigali -- not working within Kigali was never made.  The point was made with respect to calls he said he made to -- or, telephone communications between Kigali and Butarama  (sic) -- Bugarama in Cyangugu préfecture.  So I think Mr. Morley's going to make an assertion as to what was put in cross-examination, and not to be accurate, because it's misleading in the way he's done it. 
MR. MORLEY:
As I recall it, it was put by my learned friend's learned friend.  Mr. Robinson recalls his own cross-examination.  I'm recalling the cross-examination of Ms. Hounkpatin.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	It's a short point:  Were the phones working on the 11th of April 1994 in Kigali?
A.	Yes, in Kigali town and, more particularly, in the area where I lived, the phones were functioning.
Q.	You told us of meeting a man called Munyakazi in Bugarama, who told you that he had received a telephone call from Ngirumpatse.  That was in May of 1994.  Were the telephones working or not between Kigali and Bugarama, as far as you knew? 
A.	I never called Bugarama when I was in Kigali.  However, I did state that, when I was in Cyangugu, I did call Bugarama.  I never tried to call, even, from Kigali to Gitarama.  What I can assert is that at one point I was in Cyangugu and could have called Bugarama.  So the telephone was working between those two places.  
Q.	On the 30th of April 1994, did you see Nzirorera at the préfet's office? 
A.	Yes, I saw him in person in Kigali, at the préfectoral offices of Kigali, towards the end of the month of April.  I said that he was in the company of Semanza, who was party president for 
	Kigali rural préfecture. 
Q.	I don't propose to go through all of what was said when you saw Nzirorera.  I move on to Gisenyi.  In June of 1994, did you see Ngirumpatse at the Hotel Meridien in Gisenyi, or not?  
A.	Yes, it's at the Hotel Meridien in Gisenyi. 
Q.	I don't propose to go through what it was that you discussed with Ngirumpatse.  We have that on record.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I see the time at this stage.  It's 3:20.  I would invite Your Honours to rise at this stage for the break, for reasons you may want to anticipate make sense, and then we can resume at the usual time.  And I'm hoping that I'll have some good news. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take our mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1521H to 1554H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
Last lap.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
About half an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, I'd like to talk to you about Renzaho.  You will recall that a large number of speeches that he made were shown to you during your cross-examination.  

Can -- 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	Were there ever any examples of people being arrested, taken to the préfet's office for having killed Tutsi, and, if so, what happened to those people? 
A.	The préfet did nothing when we handed over the killers to him, whereas he had the means to do so.  He did not intervene.  There was a detention centre at the préfecture office, that is, there were holding cells, and people who jeopardised the security of others could be detained there.  And when an offender was presented to him, he would free the offenders -- offender a few minutes later -- or, a few moments later.  

I gave you the example of the gentleman that we took to the préfecture office.  Instead of punishing him, he gave him even greater means to do what he was doing.  Instead of punishing him, he freed him. 
Q.	And what is it that that man had been doing? 
A.	He is a killer.  He killed people on the boundary between******************************.  Among other things, he decapitated a girl.  And when we caught him, we took him to the préfet, and the préfet said that he did not have anywhere to put -- or, to imprison such people.  

You must also note that Tutsi policemen had been sacked, and they went back to their respective homes.  Later on, these policemen were killed, of course. 
Q.	Was it true that Renzaho didn't have anywhere to put the man who had decapitated the girl? 
A.	I said that he had holding cells, which normally would have been used to keep offenders before they were taken to court.  So there was space set aside for that in the préfecture office.  However, he took no decision to ensure that such people could be detained, as was usually the case. 
Q.	You mentioned that he set him free and gave him greater means to continue doing what he was doing.  What do you mean by "he gave him greater means"?
A.	I say this because, when he came, he was armed, and he said to the préfet that he was fighting the Inyenzi, that he needed fuel for his vehicle.  And the préfet gave him a voucher for 40 litres of fuel.  At that time filling stations were under the control of the préfet.  And when he gave him that fuel voucher, I was present.  This enabled him to get 40 litres of fuel.  This person was carrying a firearm, and he also had grenades.  So, consequently, he gave him more means to continue doing what he did.  
Q.	And when was it that the decapitator was taken to the préfet and given more means?  Approximately when?  April, May, June, July?  
A.	It was in April, between the 15th and 20th of April.  
Q.	In the address by Renzaho on, we think, the 10th of April, you will recall, reading through that, there was reference to how roadblocks could not be set up during the day but could be set up during the night under the authority of the neighbourhood security committee.  Firstly, what was the neighbourhood security committee? 
A.	What he meant was that the members of the security committee, that is, the Interahamwe, put -- got together and formed that committee.  He said that roadblocks should only be put up at night, but from the information I received, roadblocks were in operation day and night.  And this continued up till the month of June when we leave -- left Kigali. 
Q.	Did he ever say roadblocks should be dismantled altogether so that people weren't intercepted and killed? 
A.	No, he never said that.  As I have demonstrated, in respect of his communiqués, these are documents that he wished to present to the international community subsequently for -- to defend himself.  He had the national -- the necessary means and power to have these roadblocks dismantled.  As préfet of Kigali, he had all the means at his disposal to do this. 
Q.	You will recall that you were taken to a speech on the radio he made on the 14th of April, and you will recall that, in reply to some of those things which your attention was drawn to, you made the observation he was speaking for the international community.  
On the 14th of April, we know, as a matter of record, he did say, "Our country needs to have a good image.  During this time, when the international community seems to have forgotten us, I think it is not good to continue to commit inexplicable actions because those acts make our government lose their credibility."  

What was he driving at, as you understood it, when he talked about the international community? 
A.	This is a speech for the international community.  The international community was intended to understand that he was taking care of security.  I remember that at one point he said that the Interahamwe should not go to the Milles Collines hotel, and they didn't, in fact, attack that hotel.  

And when we answered that such-and-such a message had not been heard, he said that it did not concern us.  There were communiqués on Radio Rwanda.  There were communiqués on RTLM, but all of this led to nothing because none of the messages thus broadcast were ever complied with.  He did this deliberately.  He was aware of it.  He was informed.  He could see that these people were being killed, but he did not -- nothing to stop the killing. 
Q.	He's also on record as saying on the 19th of April, "Always tell the people that the war we are fighting is not easy.  It is not a normal war.  Those we are fighting continue to operate in disguise." 

What did you understand he was driving at when he referred to fighting people who were in disguise? 
A.	It was his way of referring to the accomplices that were in the various secteurs and supporting the assailants.  When he said that people were hiding in the secteurs, he was referring to the Tutsi who were in the secteurs and who were referred to as accomplices of the Inkotanyi, who were fighting on the war front.  This was often the sort of speech that was heard.  This was the kind of language that was used to get everyone to understand who was the enemy and who was to be sought out.  
Q.	He's also on record on the 21st of April of 1994, urging the population, "We must fight the Inyenzi."  

What did the word "Inyenzi" mean on the 21st of April of 1994? 
A.	Inyenzi were the Tutsi.  These were not the soldiers who were on the war front.  These are the people who were to be fought in the various secteurs.  And I recall for your benefit that the Inkotanyi were not fighting in these secteurs.  Consequently, when the Inyenzi was used to refer to people in the secteurs, it meant that they were referring to the Tutsi.  It was said that if it -- if they said of a Tutsi that he was an Inyenzi, then it amounted to a death warrant.  So it was the Tutsi who were in the various cellules that were being referred to when the term "Inyenzi" was used.  
Q.	He's also on record on the 19th of May of 1994, urging those at the roadblocks to check everybody, be they civilians or soldiers.  "Everybody must be checked because, if we take information we have into account, the enemy continually disguises himself."  

What's the effect, as you recall it, of urging the population to stop civilians in circumstances where the enemy continually disguises himself? 
A.	This speech was made in May.  This confirms to you that the roadblocks were still up in the city of Kigali.  So he's asking the people who manned the roadblocks to monitor what was going on.  It means that in -- the Inyenzi were among them.  There are Inyenzi who had deserted the war front as well.  They were Tutsi who were members -- or, who were in the Rwandan army, who were killed.  And he said that these deserting soldiers should be sought out, and he referred to the Inyenzi soldiers who were to be killed.  

We must remember that most of the time the people who were responsible for these roadblocks were Interahamwe, and they were referred to at the time as the civil defence.  One couldn't go past a roadblock without showing one's identity cards, and these consisted of a document that indicated one's ethnic origin.  If a person had "Hutu" indicated on his identification card, a person could go through or go past the roadblocks without any difficulty.  
Q.	And if it said "Tutsi," what happened, where the Interahamwe are being urged that the enemy is in disguise? 
A.	A Tutsi who was arrested at a roadblock was killed. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, for the assistance of the Tribunal and my learned friends, we're -- we're giving some thought to putting in, at a later time, through a different witness, more Renzaho utterings.  They are not directly relevant, but they set the scene in the background.  And as there's been extensive cross-examination of this witness, it may be that we'll hear some more of these speeches.  But I don't propose to dwell on them any further.  I hope the point which arises from taking small sections of speeches, if you're defending, can be met by taking small sections of speeches, if you're prosecuting.  The point is obvious. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Finally, Mr. Witness -- and you'll be pleased to hear "finally" -- one short area.  

Which organisation slaughtered the most Tutsi, as you remember it, during April through to July?  
A.	The Interahamwe of the MRND killed the largest number of Tutsi all over the country, especially in Kigali préfecture.  They played a major role in massacring Tutsis in Kigali.  
Q.	Did the leadership of the MRND ever lose control of the Interahamwe between April and July of 1994, as you perceived it? 
A.	The leaders of the MRND were never -- never found themselves overwhelmed.  In -- if you consider the power they had over the Interahamwe, this is manifest by the -- through the communiqué by Nzirorera.  At no point did the Interahamwe go beyond the control of the MRND leaders.  This means that party officials had trained the Interahamwe and had taught them how to follow orders from party leaders, that is, the MRND party leaders. 
Q.	How could the leadership of the MRND have stopped the Interahamwe from slaughtering the bulk of those murdered among the Tutsis? 
A.	First, they were -- they should have spoken out against the killings perpetrated on the Tutsi.  All radio stations should have heard -- or, should have broadcast the MRND executive committee or management, condemning the killings.  And even the Interahamwe would have understood this message, and they would have understood clearly that they were against the killing.  

No such message was either -- ever broadcast.  I say that these people should have spoken out against the killings, while indicating clearly that Interahamwe should not get involved in killing Tutsi.  In none of their documents, including the communiqué by Nzirorera and Karemera, is it indicated that the Tutsi were being killed.  This didn't appear anywhere.  You heard things like, "You must restore peace," "You must restore security," but nothing was done to condemn the massacres in a clear and unequivocal manner.  

If the MRND had done that -- the MRND was the majority party in the country, if you compared it with the other political parties, and the ministry of the interior was in their hands.  The minister of the interior was also the vice-chairman of the MRND.  

Now, regarding the ministry of defence and the head of the gendarmerie, both were headed by members of the MRND.  These ministers -- ministries should have taken measures to guarantee the security of the people who were targeted by the killing.  Nothing was done to speak out or condemn these killings. 
Q.	Just as a point of clarity, it's a matter of record that the vice-president of the MRND, who became the minister of interior to whom you're referring, was Édouard Karemera; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  I say that Mr. Karemera, Édouard, was minister -- minister of the interior and communal development.  He was, at the same time, vice-president of the MRND party for the entire country. 
Q.	Are you aware of any example of any member of the Interahamwe being disciplined or expelled from the MRND or in any way punished or corrected for slaughtering Tutsis? 
A.	I have no example to give you of anyone -- of an Interahamwe who killed a Tutsi and was subsequently punished or expelled from that organisation.  This is because all that they did was with the support with the higher organs of the MRND.  Consequently, no one was punished in any way for killing Tutsi. 
Q.	And, finally, is it right that the three Defendants in this case were the highest organs of the MRND? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, objection, asked and answered 50 times.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Final question:  Is it right that the highest organs of the MRND are the three Defendants in this case? 

MR. ROBINSON:
I'd like a ruling on my objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, we will allow the question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Third time:  Is it right that the highest organs of the MRND are the three Defendants in this case? 
A.	The highest organ of the MRND was in the hands of these three people.  The chairman, or president, was Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse; Karemera, Édouard, vice-chairman, and he was also minister of the interior and communal development; Joseph Nzirorera was national secretary of the MRND.  Consequently, these three people were the senior officials of the MRND for the entire country.  
Q.	Witness UB, you may be very pleased to hear that that is, I anticipate, the last question you'll be asked.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
I trust Your Honour will not be requiring me to rise at dawn tomorrow?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we have something worse in store for you.  

Mr. Witness, this has come to the end of your testimony.  It's lasted a long time, much longer than I had anticipated, and we thank you for your presence at the Tribunal and for coming to give testimony.  

(Microphones overlapping) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President; thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, now you're excused, and you're -- you may leave.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I -- I don't mean to hold up the witness, but if we just take one second, there are two exhibits that I would like to offer, and they're basically prior inconsistent statements, or documents that were used with this witness concerning prior inconsistent statements.  And in light of your ruling with respect to the one document that Mr. Morley offered, I'd like to offer these two documents.  

I don't think they need to be shown to the witness, but in case there's a problem, I just want to do this while he's here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it necessary -- are the documents -- are they -- can you show the Prosecutor? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't actually need the witness for this. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I just want to make sure there's no problem, so if there was, I might need to put a question to the witness.  But I -- I don't think there is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. ROBINSON:
But the Prosecutor has them.  They're the statement of 28 November 1997 and the interview report of 26 through 29 April 2004.  And during my cross-examination, I read from both of these documents and put questions to the witness concerning inconsistencies.  I'd like to have them admitted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any objection?  
MR. MORLEY:
Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  No objection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Admitted.  

What are the exhibit numbers?  Where are the documents? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I have the documents here, and I'd like to state for the record that the witness statement of the 
28th of November 1997 in French should be D. NZ96A, and the English, D. NZ96B.  

And the interview report of 26 through 29 April 2004 should be D. NZ96 -- excuse me, 97A and 97B.  And, since they're unredacted, they should be under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you are finally free to leave.  You are now free to leave, and we thank you very much.
(Witness excused)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this brings us to the end of today's proceedings, and we formally adjourn the proceedings -- or, adjourn this part of the proceedings.  We would be grateful if the public would kindly leave, as the Court is no longer in session.  

Now, gentlemen, what we -- and -- and ladies, I was thinking that what we would do, we could now move completely out of our formal session, so there will no longer be any record kept, and have just a brief, informal discussion to prepare for our status conference, which should -- I would think it might be better to have it on Friday morning, if that would be acceptable to you.   

But if we stayed back just for half an hour -- we don't need the court reporters for this part of the session, but we'd be grateful if the interpreters will stay just to assist in communication, and it should not take very long. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour.  Yes, thank you.  
(Court adjourned at 1627H)
