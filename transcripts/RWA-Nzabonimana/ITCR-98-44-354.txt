MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 13th of May 2009, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Appearances.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The appearances are the same, Your Honour.  Good morning to everyone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

And for the Defence the same.  

Do we have contact with the destination of our video conference?  Can you hear me?  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
Yes, Mr. President.  Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  Who is present with you at your location this morning?  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  We have the witness, KXL, and the two representatives, one for Karemera and the other for Ngirumpatse.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose we can start the case, have the witness sworn.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As you are about to begin your testimony, the registrar will administer an oath for you to tell the truth, and she will do that now.  
(Declaration made by Witness KXL in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Witness, you will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel, and Ms. Diagne -- Maître Diagne will now begin to examine you on behalf of Mr. Édouard Karemera.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Your Honour.  

Good morning to all parties present here in Court.
WITNESS KXL,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness KXL.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	Witness, I would like you to take the identification form containing your particulars, which are confidential, and check if the information therein are correct.  I would like you to date it and sign it, please.
A.	Thank you.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
For the record, the witness has amended his last name, his date of birth, the cell from which he was born, the secteur, the commune and his current address.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Madam Registrar, I believe that on the new form which was given to him and which was disclosed to all parties here, those corrections have already been entered and my assistant cross-checked it.  Can that be confirmed. 

MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I could interrupt for one second, my understanding is that this is one of the witnesses whose protective measures were relinquished.  So perhaps Madam Diagne can confirm that, and if it's so, then we can simply take the information through his testimony.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. Webster is partly correct, considering the fact that as a matter of fact there was an order stating that Witness KXL could have his protective measures cancelled by the Chamber, lifted, and it was the intention to confirm this before the Court.  

Indeed, after the order of October 2008, he has suffered problems within his family in Rwanda.  That is why after discussions we decided not to confirm these protective measures.  In other words, he wants to keep those protective measures, and he is going to testify under the pseudonym KXL.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would seem to us then -- we would just want to be corrected if we are wrong -- that the protective order is still in force in relation to this witness.  Is that the position?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you.  You may proceed.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Your Honour.

Now we're back in connection whether he can -- can you confirm that Witness KXL has rectified the particulars and that they are the same with those that have been made -- provided to all the parties in this Chamber.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
The particulars are the same, but he changed his cell or added his cell to *************.  That is ***************.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Registrar, please do not reveal the identity of the witness.  All I would like to let you know, after what you have said, is that we all have taken into account that the form we have here in the courtroom has already been rectified.  Please also guard against providing confidential information regarding the witness.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
My apologies.  But he changed the cell and the commune and it will be reflected in the document that he has signed.  Thank you.  

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you.  

Your Honour, all I wanted to say is that the identification sheet that we have was completely modified and that is one which has been disclosed to the parties.  Can we carry on?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may.  You may proceed.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:  
Madam Defence Counsel, we are simply providing you information that in addition to the changes that your assistant had made, the witness made additional changes which you do not have because he just made it now.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you.  That is the sheet which is going to be entered.  Mr. President, I would like to apply for this sheet to be admitted under seal.  And in the past, documents have been admitted from The Hague.  I believe that this sheet will get to you subsequently.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, do we have a copy here?  

Okay.  It's admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. K119 admitted, under seal)
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. Issa, can we have the exhibit number?  Is it D. 419?
MR. MJUI:
The document is D. K119.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just note that the copy that we have in our courtroom has not been amended, and we will expect that we will discover the amendment in due course.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness KXL, could you state to the Chamber what was your occupation in April 1994.  
A.	I was ************. 
Q.	Thank you.  What exactly did you do as a **************? 
A.	I was in *********************************. 
Q.	What were you doing there?  That's what I mean.  I wasn't asking you where.  I was simply asking what.
A.	I was in charge ************************************************************************************************, transport.  We have ***************************************************.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, do you know Mr. Édouard Karemera? 
A.	I know him as an authority.  He was a minister.  He was parliamentarian.  He had been at the presidency.  He was one of the Kibuye authorities which we had.  Everyone was supposed to know him.  He was known to be a personality as an authority.  But I didn't have any personal relation with him, and I didn't get to discuss with him, but I know that he was an authority from our area. 
Q.	Witness, in April 1994 or during the events between April and July 1994, you went to your **********************.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Could you be more specific to the Chamber, please.  How many times? 
A.	In April, mid-April, but I can't be specific about the dates.  I was there in mid-April, mid-May and end of June 1994. 
Q.	My understanding, Witness, is that this happened during the events which grieved Rwanda.  
A.	That's it.  
Q.	And on occasions you went to your commune, could you describe to the Chamber what the situation was? 
A.	The situation was like everywhere else in the country.  They had killings.  It was a situation of civil war, as in the rest of the country in general. 
Q.	Witness KXL, did you notice the presence of Interahamwe in your commune? 
A.	No, I didn't see Interahamwe in **********************************.  When I was in Kigali I saw them, but in **************** I didn't see any Interahamwe. 
Q.	Witness, please avoid providing the name of your commune, although I imagine that you are not the only native soldier from that area.  In any case, avoid referring to the names of communes which are likely to reveal your identity.
A.	Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, could you instruct Defence and witness to observe a pause between question and answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreters have asked me to request that there be a pause between question and answer to facilitate the interpretation.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness KXL, every time I ask a question, please pause to ensure that I am done with the question.  I am also going to pause after your answer to be sure that you are finished with your answer so as to ease interpretation.
A.	Okay. 
Q.	Do you know the Bisesero region well? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Could you describe it geographically to the Chamber? 
A.	Bisesero is one of the secteurs in Gishyita commune, which is a neighbour to the Mubuga secteur, and you have mountains, hills.  There was also a cassiterite mine.  There was a road from Mubuga to Gisovu.  I don't know how to give any further description.  
Q.	Thank you.  Is it true that it is an abandoned mine as we speak and even at that time? 
A.	Currently I don't know if it is still active, but I believe that during the 1994 events there were no cassiterite extraction activities there.  Apparently cassiterite was exhausted. 
Q.	Witness, according to what you know, is it true that there were galleries that were used as weapons caches or hideouts for fighters? 
A.	With regard to that I'm not sure.  What I know is that you had trenches from which the minerals were extracted.  You still have those trenches, holes, which remain.  But I cannot tell if you had weapons caches or stocks of munitions.  I don't know that.  I wasn't a witness to that.  
Q.	Witness KXL, have you heard about one Biseruka?  Biseruka is number 2 on the spelling list, B-I-S-E-R-U-K-A.  Have you heard about that person? 
A.	Before I got into the army --- I know Biseruka was commander in Kibuye, but at that time I wasn't a ***********  I heard about him as Commander Biseruka, but I can't recall.  Maybe this was in the '80s.  
Q.	And were you aware that in the '80s he set up a firing range in Bisesero? 
A.	No, I am unaware of that.  Thank you. 
Q.	So with reference to Bisesero, that area, is there a road linking Gishyita to Gisovu?  
A.	Yes, there's a road from Gishyita to Gisovu.  From Mubuga there's also a road that passes to Bisesero.  
Q.	And Witness KXL, how would you describe that road to the Chamber with regard to the accessibility?  
A.	These were non -- these were earthen roads, and it was very small, very narrow and difficult.  But it could be used because some vehicles used it from Mubuga, from Gishyita to Gisovu.  It was a narrow road, like all the roads in our country, which were earth roads, but this was not a main road.  These were secondary roads. 
Q.	What about security?  How do you find those various roads? 
A.	I don't quite understand what you mean by security. 
Q.	Well, we know that, as you just said, those were roads linking Gishyita to Gisovu or Mubuga to Gisovu.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you sort of described the state of the roads to the Court.  What I would like to know is whether one felt safe on those roads.  In 1994 was there no danger in using those roads?  That is my question.
A.	In 1994, yes, after the president's death, it was not possible to use those roads because there were armed Tutsis in Bisesero.  Whenever there was a car passing by that road, the car would be fired at. 
Q.	Thank you.  How did you learn that there were those Tutsis in Bisesero? 
A.	While I was in Kigali I once heard over Radio Muhabura that actually Tutsis were being incited to go to Bisesero over Radio Muhabura, but the journalist who was broadcasting in Radio Muhabura said they had to go to Gisesero, meaning Bisesero, because he did not know the correct way of pronouncing the name.  And then he said that all the remaining Tutsis should not be afraid because the RPF would soon take over power.  That is how he was telling the survivors to go to that area.  Maybe that was the place they had provided for in terms of their protection.  But I do not know why they focused on Bisesero.  When I subsequently went ***********, I indeed noticed that there was fighting amongst members of the population.  There were Tutsis in the trenches uphill who would come down at night to shoot people, and the following day the population would gather to go and get those people out of those places.  I went there on three occasions, but I do not know how it was organised.  I only passed by that place. 
Q.	Thank you.  That's very clear.  During your trips, the three trips as you mentioned earlier on, did you hear that Mr. Édouard Karemera was in Bisesero on any of those occasions? 
A.	No, not via radio, not from members of the population, nor from any other channel of communication. 
Q.	Did anyone ever tell you that Mr. Édouard Karemera was in Bisesero? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Witness, please tell us, if you know, that is, whether there was an armed organisation in Bisesero where there were infiltrators there who actually organised the Tutsis, whom you told us would come downhill in the evening to terrorise members of the population?  Did you have some form of knowledge despite the very few occasions when you went to that area, the three times when you went to that area I mean? 
A.	I'm not very certain.  I was always in Kigali.  I was not aware of what was happening in the ***********in my absence.  But when I went there apparently there was a colleague, a lance corporal called Mutunda Soltaire, and at the time of the president's death he was in **********with his weapon, whereas weapons were being confiscated by UNAMIR.  All soldiers had to surrender their weapons.  And at the time of the president's death he was there.  He started firing on people.  And when he ran out of ammunition members of the population killed him.  And then subsequently, I'm not certain but I did hear that the authorities of the commune were looking for educated people, traders, inspectors, Tutsi retirees who had links with the RPF, and after the president's death some of those people sought refuge in the Bisesero trenches.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.
A.	Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Any other defence counsel wish to examine this witness?  

The answer being no, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. SENDZE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Honourable members of the Bench, Defence counsel and everyone in the courtroom.  
For the record, my name is Takeh Sendze.  I am a member of the New York State Bar in the USA, and I will be cross-examining this witness on behalf of the Prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
On behalf of the Chamber, we welcome you to this role.  
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

While the documents are being distributed I think I can proceed.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	I would like to put some very direct propositions to you, and I expect that your answers be brief.  Actually a yes or no answer would suffice in this case.  I propose to you that from 1983 to 1994 you lived with your family and worked in Kigali; is that correct? 
A.	I don't quite understand your question, sir.
Q.	From the year 1983 to 1994 you lived and worked in Kigali, Rwanda; correct? 
A.	Incorrect. 
Q.	You did work in Kigali in 1994, didn't you? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	When was the first time you went to Kigali in your lifetime from ************** 
A.	In 1989, it was. 
Q.	Now, I suggest to you that you left Kigali on the 5th of April 1994 and went to Byumba; correct? 
A.	For a short time, yes. 
Q.	How long were you in **************? 
A.	I said a short time. 
Q.	Could you please give the Court an approximation?  One month?  Two months?  
A.	I was posted to Byumba but it was during the war.  The soldiers were actually retreating, so I cannot give you a specific time frame.  
Q.	Okay.  You would agree with me that Byumba is located in the northeastern part of Rwanda, about 216 kilometres away from Kibuye, which is located in the southwestern part of Rwanda.  Would you agree? 
A.	We are in agreement. 
Q.	I am suggesting to you, Mr. Witness, that you only returned to Kigali in July of 1994, that is, from Byumba.  Do you agree? 
A.	I am afraid I don't quite understand your question. 
Q.	I am suggesting to you that you left Byumba and returned to Kigali in July of 1994.  Do you agree? 
A.	I'm not too sure, but during the war I would go and come.  I would go home, go back to the front, come back to Kigali.  It was during the war.  I really am at a loss as to why you are making propositions to me in this connection.  I do not know whether it is in connection with what we have to say concerning Karemera.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I suggest to you again that you left Kigali in July of 1994 and travelled to Gitarama, passing through -- or you travelled to Butare, rather, going through Gitarama.  Do you agree? 
A.	To be candid with you, your question is a bit vague.  I really do not know why you -- well, when the war broke out there was mayhem in the country.  People were making to and fro movement.  I really do not know why you are -- however, I don't quite understand what is the connection between your question and my evidence concerning Mr. Édouard Karemera. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, sorry.  Please just answer the questions and forget about the connections.  We will do the connections, okay?  Please give a yes or no answer.  If you don't know the answer, just say no, and that would be okay.  

	Did you travel to Butare from Kigali in July of 1994?  Yes or no.
A.	I believe so. 
Q.	And I suggest to you that you travelled from Kigali to Butare on foot, and this journey lasted one month, correct, or approximately one month? 
A.	I don't quite recall. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I suggest to you again that you only visited ********in December of 1996.  Do you agree? 
A.	You know, I would really like to know why you are seeking all those details from me. 
Q.	Witness, I have told you that it is not necessary for you to know why.  You have come to answer questions, so please direct your mind to the question and give the Court a straightforward answer.  Do you want me to repeat the question or you can answer from your recollection? 
A.	I currently reside ***************.  I was granted my status -- well, I do not see -- yes.  
Q.	So your answer is yes, you only visited *********** in December of 1996.
A.	No.  But I was there before. 
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Witness, I would like to remind you of the solemn oath you took this morning to tell the truth before this Trial Chamber.  
MR. SENDZE:
	And on that note I would ask Madam Registrar to please put before the witness the bundle of documents I provided.  
MS. MUZIGO-MORRISON:
The witness has got the bundle.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, do you recognise the bundle of documents before you? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. SENDZE:	
	And for the record these -- the bundle consists of immigration record documents for the witness, and he has acknowledged that he does recognise the documents.  I would like to draw the Court's attention to page 15 of that bundle.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Do you have the page, Witness?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, you just testified before this Court, Honourable Court, that you lived in Kigali from 1989 to 1994; correct?  You should look at the right-hand side of page 15.  There's a table at the top.  The second -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The second column consisting of dates.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	It's noted therein that from 1983 to 19 -- it says 1996, your address was Kigali.  And on page 16 on the left-hand side the indication is 1983 to 1994 you were in Kigali, Rwanda.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you agree with the information contained in this document? 
A.	This is information I provided to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in connection with my status being granted me.  Those are just dates I provided at random.  I did not even recall.  It was a long time ago.  But I do not even see how you will belabour this issue and focus on my documents which are used in support of my application for a status because it has nothing to do with my testimony in the defence of Mr. Karemera.  When you provide such information in connection with your status for a refugee you do not give details.
Q.	Witness, please, I have time limits to meet.  So just answer the question and spare the Court lengthy explanations, please.
MR. SENDZE:  
Now, I would like to draw the Court's attention to page 21 of the bundle, which is a portion of the witness's statement he gave to the immigration authorities on the 3rd of May 2002.  That is the French version.  For the English I direct the Court's attention to page 35 of the bundle -- sorry, page 36 of the bundle, English version.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I suggested to you earlier that you left Byumba and only returned to Kigali in July of 1994.  And you said you were not quite sure of the date.  Now, look at question number 3 on page 36 of the bundle for the English and page 21 for the French.  You were specifically asked, "When did you arrive in Kigali, that is, coming from Byumba?"  And you stated therein that you returned to Kigali in July of 1994.  Do you see that answer? 
A.	I do not think it is proper for you to insist on my documents I provided in support of my application for refugee status.  What I said and what I put in the document which I gave, I said it was accurate.  But you are belaboring this point on my application for refugee status.  I think it is out of place, honestly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this is the Judge speaking.  I suggest that you know that it's our role or function to ensure that the questions that are put to you are permitted by the rules which govern our proceedings.  And the questions that counsel are putting to you are permitted, and you should answer them.  They relate to your testimony in general, and your answers will assist us to decide whether we can believe your testimony or not.  So you are required to answer the questions being put to you now by counsel.  
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, if you stay on page 21 of the bundle for the French and 36 for the English, you would see that you were also asked if you had travelled to Butare.  And that would be -- I think that would be question number 7 on page 36.  You said you travelled to ******************************** and you had travelled to Butare through Gitarama and the journey lasted one month.  This means you would have arrived Butare in August of 1994.  Do you see the series of questions that -- of answers that bring out this information? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  And on page 22 of the French, page 22 of the bundle, and remaining on page 36 in the English version, you stated that you got to ******** in December of 1996; correct? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, with your leave, what we have on the page is December 1994.  So I wonder whether it is a translation error or whether it is my learned friend Mr. Sendze who has problems of sight, because the document which we have, the French version, on the document what we have is December 1994.  
MR. SENDZE:
Yes, I do have a sight problem.  I guess that explains the instrument on my face.  But I do acknowledge that it is a possible translation mistake.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	And be that as it may, December 1994 did you -- the document suggests that you only arrived ******** in December 1994 -- or '96, if you do agree with '96; correct?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President -- by the way, Mr. President, I am objecting to this line of questioning.  The document has been put to him.  He should make the proposition to him.  That is my first objection.  Objection number two is that here we are describing a date of arrival in a trip.  I do not see how it is contradictory to what he had said before because he said that he had gone to ********* on three occasions, so there is nothing to say about that.  Now he is just putting dates and insertions to the witness at random.  I believe that it is up to the Trial Chamber to refocus things here, and his statement should be put to him directly.  
MR. SENDZE:
I believe the Court has stated that my questions have stayed relevant, and I don't know if they have a change of opinion at this time.  If not, I beg to proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.  
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we have been able to trace your movements from April of 1994 to December of 1994.  And we have come to realise that none of these trips involved a trip to **********  You have testified before this Honourable Court that you visited ********* in mid-April, mid-May and end of June 1994.  I suggest to you that in light of the statement you made to the immigration authorities, your testimony before this Chamber is not accurate.  
A.	Can I give some answer?
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	Yes, I was there.  I did not go there to stay there.  I requested for leave of absence to go and see my family.  Then I would go back to the front.  And when I benefitted from some other furlough, I would go and see my family and then I would go back to the front.  

In 1994 I went home on three occasions.  Subsequently we left the country, and I experienced difficulties staying in RPF camps for some time.  And then I subsequently joined *********************.  That is how it was.  Then in December, yes, I was still in the country but in the RPF camps in hiding places.  Those are details which I provided to the office of the high commissioner for refugees.  Otherwise in April, May and June it was still possible for me to go and see my family.  I made to and fro trips.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness, for your answer.  Just one followup on that.  I believe your family lived with you in Kigali; correct? 
A.	Yes, my wife -- my wife.  Yes, my family ********************************************************************. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, thank you.  The Court has the information before them, and they would look at it and decide on what to do.  

You told this Honourable Court that you visited -- did you visit Bisesero at any time? 
A.	No, I didn't go to Bisesero.  I was -- I was passing to Mubuga.  I did not envision Mubuga and Bisesero are close.  I didn't go to Bisesero.  I said I passed through Mubuga.  I had gone to see my family.  I went to see my family, my parents.  
Q.	So you would not know whether or not Karemera was in Bisesero, would you? 
A.	I did know.  I didn't hear about it.
MR. SENDZE:
	I crave the Court's indulgence for a minute, please.
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, you also discussed briefly in your direct examination something about infiltrators in Kibuye; 
	is that correct? 
A.	I didn't concur that I witnessed infiltrators in Kibuye.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I thank you for contributing to the judicial process, and your testimony has been very helpful.  Excuse me.  

Your testimony has been very helpful, and I believe the Judges will make prudent use of it.  
MR. SENDZE:
And on that note, Mr. President, I have come to the end of my cross-examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry, I need to make an application for some exhibits to be admitted.  Should I do that now or should we excuse the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can do it now.  
MR. SENDZE:
Okay.  I would like to move into evidence the witness's statement of 3rd May 2002.  The French version starts from page 19 to page 26 of my bundle, and the English translation starts from page 33 to page 38 of my bundle.  

Mr. Issa, you would advise the Court of the exhibit number.  Thank you.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 349, A for French, B for English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 349A and P. 349B admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any re-examination?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Your Honour.  It is going to be brief.


RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness KXL, didn't you have to pass through Gitarama to go to Butare?  
A.	You do.  You must. 
Q.	That is why I didn't quite understand the Prosecutor's question.  In your view, Witness, could you state to the Chamber why the troops did not stay in Byumba in April 1994?  What was the situation? 
A.	After the president's death, the ministry in charge of the army had been under an embargo.  The RPF was still armed, and they had the privilege of carrying on fighting and to take up all the Rwandan armed forces' positions, and hence the RPF advanced without any form of obstacle.  
Q.	Is it correct to state that the RPF actually swept over your forces? 
A.	Pardon me?
Q.	I didn't hear you, Witness.
A.	I didn't quite understand your question.  
Q.	Is it correct to say that as a matter of fact the RPF army marched over you?  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	The Prosecutor does not seem to understand it, but at that time was it possible to have remained in Byumba? 
A.	It was practically impossible because it was right in the midst of war and one could not stay.  No, it was impossible. 
Q.	That is what the Prosecutor does not seem to understand.  Do you confirm to the Chamber that from leave -- with a leave of absence you were able to go three times to ***********? 
A.	That is the case with every soldier.  I wasn't the only one.  Anyone who wanted to ask for leave of absence could do that, and if they could be granted it then they were granted it.  I applied for leave of absence to go and visit my family.  I did that on three occasions before there was an exodus of the population towards Congo. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Your Honour, I have concluded my redirect examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  

Mr. Witness, that concludes your testimony before the Tribunal.  We would like to thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  But you are now excused.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
	I think that that concludes the work that we can do today, Ms. Diagne.

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
That's correct, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We will take our adjournment now.

Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps I was misunderstanding, Your Honour.  I thought we were going to have the Nzirorera witness, who is here physically.  He is not appearing by video link.  Unless it's been rescheduled.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  I suppose I should let Mr. Nimy speak, but we understood that it was not possible to make arrangements today.  
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Your Honour.  You said what I was going to tell Prosecution Counsel Webster.  The necessary measures to that effect were not possible, and the witness will appear when everything is in place for him to appear.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  So I assume that the next time we come together will be on Monday morning for Mr. Karemera?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
So can I accumulate the time that my colleague did not use and add that to my lengthy cross-examinations?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I thought, being this is his maiden voyage, you would have said congratulations. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That was implicit.  I delivered a private congratulations.  But I'm sure the Court was pleased with the brevity and the precision of his examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  We can take our adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1115H)
