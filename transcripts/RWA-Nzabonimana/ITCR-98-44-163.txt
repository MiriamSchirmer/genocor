MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg, and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, 9 September 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Appearances, please.  
MR. JALLOW:
If it please the Court, the Prosecutor appears in person at the request of the Court, and with me are (unintelligible). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Appearances for the Defence.  
MR. HOOPER: 
David Hooper, Andreas O'Shea, Svetlana Pouplard, who all extend their warm greetings to the Prosecutor.  

Can I just add that -- I am on the French channel, which is rather confusing me; sorry.  

Can I just add, I am sorry if I caused a delay this morning.  I got caught up in the detention facility and I left later than I wished.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much for that.  

Mr. Prosecutor, thank you very much for coming to court today.  The reason why we had asked you to come to give a report on this matter was that the -- we were confronted with a problem which seems to raise questions of diligence, and it is also connected, in our view, with fair trial issues and the rights of the Accused, as well as with the scheduling of our -- of our trial.  And we thought that, in all the circumstances, that your involvement may assist in an appropriate resolution to what seems to have been developing as a bit of a problem for the Court.  

I suppose that is a sufficient introductory remark, and I don't know if there is anything you wish to say at this stage.  
MR. JALLOW:
Thank you very much, My Lord.  

Let me say thank you to Mr. David Hooper for the words of welcome.  

I have been briefed about some of the difficulties which have been confronting the trial, particularly as regards the -- our inability so far to present our last two witnesses to the Court for testimony.  And I understand the issue of the scheduling -- all the three issues which have been raised by Your Lordship relate to these two witnesses.  I only wish to assure the Court that we are very mindful, particularly myself and the rest of the team, not to cause any delays in the progress of the trial, unnecessary delays in the course of the trial, to be -- to ensure that the trial respects the rights of all the parties; and above all, of course, that my side, the Prosecution side, carries out its tasks diligently and professionally.  We will be -- let me assure the Court we will cooperate and collaborate with it in making sure that the trial progresses smoothly.  

That having been said, I do understand we have had difficulties with these two witnesses in securing their cooperation to attend and testify.  And, since I came, I have been discussing the matter with the chief of Prosecutions who is currently away in Europe and has been in touch with one of the witnesses.  We have also been in touch with the authorities in Rwanda to see whether they could assist us to get the two witnesses to cooperate.  

The two are very crucial to our case.  They are crucial to our case because they depose to issues -- to matters which are in issue in the trial, and we believe their testimony would help the Court tremendously in resolving these issues, particularly regarding the presence and the actions of the Accused at the hospital in Butare during the period concerned.  

And, of course, it cannot be an open-ended thing.  At some stage, if we are unable to secure their cooperation and their presence in court, we may have to take the necessary steps to bring the side of our case to an end.  But I think in the interest -- in the interests of justice, particularly in times of enabling the Prosecution as well to present its case, its full case, I think we would still appeal to the Bench to give us some time, to give us some time to continue our efforts, both directly with the witnesses concerned and also with the Rwanda authorities, to see whether we can overcome the obstacles to their cooperation.  At this stage, My Lords, that's all I would like to add.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, the issue that has troubled us considerably -- the issue that has troubled us considerably is the inconsistency with the proposition that these witnesses are crucial and the fact that the Prosecutor has not spoken to them yet, because up to Wednesday, when we adjourned, they had not even communicated with them.  And we don't understand how there could be witnesses that are crucial and that -- even that hasn't taken place.  So it isn't to say that there is a -- we don't know what, what, what the Court will do, because the issue of the importance of the witness doesn't tally with what has actually transpired.  So that is one major -- that has bothered us enormously.  

We think that we have leaned over backwards, because we had made a scheduling order much earlier in the year -- I think it was in February or March, whenever -- and what had been arranged would have permitted the Defence to put on their case, you know, commencing the end of October, beginning of November, with a view to them closing their case before Christmas.  Now, you see -- so we have an overall case management issue which is affected by this.  

In regard to the fair trial issues, which are also bothering us enormously, we had to adjudicate on an application by this Accused for staying the proceedings because of undue delay.  He alleged that he has been in detention since 1996 and that his Article 20 fair trial rights have been infringed by the delay in prosecution.  And it's a matter which has given us great concern, because we are thinking that -- that the situation affects that one as well, and we -- in fact, we have the feeling that if the Prosecutor has not, in fact, has not -- in fact, is not in a position to say that, "We know that these witnesses will come, but we don't know when.  I mean, it's not even that position.  There is still a situation where the Prosecutor is saying, "We don't know if the witnesses will come."  And it doesn't seem to us to be fair to have an indefinite -- an indefinite continuance for that reason.  That's the -- what is bothering us.  I don't know if I put it clearly.
MR. JALLOW:
Yes, My Lord, I understand the concerns of the Bench, and I wouldn't subscribe at all to an indefinite continuance.  I think we need to be given a definite time period within which we shall have to come to the Court and indicate whether the witnesses are agreeable to coming or not.  If they are not agreeable, then necessary measures are taken to bring our side of the case to an end.  The question of time:  We can look at a reasonable length of time which will enable us to exhaust our efforts to get the witnesses to come.  I agree, of course, with Your Lordship, that for witnesses who are so important, we should have from the beginning, made contact and ascertained whether there will be any difficulties in obtaining their presence and then take the necessary steps early.  But there we are aware -- we are -- at the moment we have learned belatedly that they are reluctant to come.  We have engaged them in discussions at the moment.  And in order to ensure the right of the Accused to an early trial, which is in progress now, incidentally, the trial is in progress now, and also the rights of the Prosecution to present its case are also preserved, that the Court gives us a definite time frame, no matter how brief it is, for us to exhaust our efforts.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, we thought that we had done that last week.  What had happened was that when the Prosecution case was coming to an end, the position was raised, first, in an application for subpoena, which was subsequently withdrawn.  And at that time we were informed that there was a mission which would have resulted in contact with the prospective witnesses.  So there have been two delays based on that.  And they've not resulted in any -- anything yet.  You know, I am -- so when you say -- what do you mean by a short delay?  Because we had hoped -- we had expected that the Prosecution case would have been closed so that we could have commenced preparation for the last phase of the trial.  Now, what you are proposing means that the Defence can't put on their case in November.  If we grant the adjournment now, it means that the entire completion strategy would have to be jeopardised.  That's another issue which is -- 
MR. JALLOW:
I think, My Lord, -- sorry.  

We have -- I have written to the authorities in Rwanda, as I mentioned, this week, when I came in, and I expect by next week I should be able to have something conclusive from them and from the witness who is over there as to whether she will come or not;  in fact, whether the both of them will be available.  So that's the step we have taken now.  That means that we don't have to really adjourn to November.  The Defence could still start some time at the end of the month, or in October, early October, and continue with their case.  We are not asking for a very long period in order to determine whether our -- in order to make our last effort to get the witnesses to come.  I think, probably, the end of next Friday -- the end of next week we should be in a position to come back to the Court and either throw in the towel or present the witnesses for their testimony to be heard.  

I know, My Lord, as I said at the beginning, we all share a concern about the completion strategy that we should try to make sure we stick to it, to the deadline.  Also, myself, I have to go to the Security Council and report each time that we think we are on schedule.  But in a particular matter like this where there is a fair trial issue involved as well relating to giving the opportunity to the Prosecution to fully present their case, I think that should be the overriding issue in our minds.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, I -- forgive me if I suggest that we thought that the Prosecution did have a full opportunity to represent its case.  In fact, we have had -- now, all of the trial sessions were scheduled with the full agreement of the Prosecutor -- the Prosecution, and we have not taken any ruling to inhibit them calling any witness.  In fact, we think that we have already bent over backwards to try to allow extra efforts to be taken to overcome what seems to have been a difficulty that the Prosecution experienced.  
The completion strategy, I just threw that in.  The other thing that we have to be concerned about, really, is fair trial.  That also bothers us.   

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  I don't know if a further response to what has previously been said was submitted --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I will start again.  I don't know whether my saying more to what has been said on the previous occasion, which I know will be in Your Honours' minds, or, indeed, in the written motion or our reply, I should say, to the written subpoena, again, would be in Your Honours' minds.  First of all, anything I say now is in no way a criticism of Mr. Jallow, the Prosecutor, as I know full well that he is a very busy man; he has recently returned here from abroad.  And having the overview of so many and significant cases as he has, he cannot be expected to have all the details of, for example, this particular case at his fingertips.  And that's in no way a criticism at all.  But it does lead me to suggest that he inevitably comes here, as far as his arguments, perhaps, are concerned in rather borrowed clothes.  In fact, the Chamber, in our submission, has shown considerable assistance and latitude, which we all recognise, to both sides in the conduct of the case, and this has been amply demonstrated by its extension and re-extension of time for the Prosecution to provide its indication of its project in respect to these witnesses.  

And, yet, we are left here on this Friday morning, ten days after the case was expected to close, in total uncertainty.  And you, Mr. President, have already underscored how that uncertainty sits very unhappily with the argument of crucial witnesses.  

It's now been two months since this issue of witness reluctance was first in prospect.  There was no timely application by way of subpoena, which essentially accounted for its withdrawal, when it was submitted so late in the day.  And since then, which was Thursday or Friday of last week, we have had a week of what one supposed were acutely focused efforts on the part of the Prosecution.  We know that Mr. Morley has been in Europe and was attending to this problem in order to respond to this Chamber's reasonable demands, and we now know that, indeed, one even mightier than he, the head of Prosecutions no less, Mr. Rapp, has himself been in contact with this witness.  

And these aren't witnesses who have a holiday pre-booked, or witnesses who have some kind of medical condition, or some overriding difficulty that explains the absence of information, they are people we understand the Prosecution has access to or are in contact with, and they have said they don't want to come.  
And one of the borrowed clothes was the argument these are crucial witnesses, but that is an adjective that is not appropriate.  And if one looks and turns to the statements themselves of these two witnesses, one can see, in my submission, the word "crucial" is inappropriate.  We observe that both the new witnesses weren't, in fact, on the witness list till relatively recently, that is, they are additional to the Prosecution case that subsisted before.  One is a witness that speaks of seeking refuge at the university hospital, and there seeing a man who she identifies as the Accused,  and that that identification arises solely not from her own knowledge but from being told it by a man who is now dead.  So, a hearsay identification with an uncertain source, and that in a case where, in our submission, it's already been demonstrated that there was an absolute whirlpool of allegation and of naming that was not plainly always appropriate.  

The other witness, at the time ************************************************, as I recall, speaks of recognising a man she names as Rwamakuba, who she recognises, in part, from the time when he was at the hospital at the end of '93-'94, which runs counter, even to the Prosecution case, that he is a presence there.  It's never been alleged Rwamakuba had anything to do with that university hospital at all prior to the allegations concerning him and his presence there from April the 20th to the week or two after that date.  So, the word "crucial" is not appropriate.  

I know the Chamber has very much, as it has already expressed it this morning, the concerns and the deep, profound and justifiable concerns of the Accused's right to fair and speedy trial.  And the Defence, again, submit that we have reached a stage where we, the Defence, know it -- a certainty which is wholly lacking this morning -- and even this Chamber has had no reasonable response, despite the latitude that it's advanced.  It's left, in fact, wholly in the dark today.  And in all the circumstances, we invite the Chamber to tell the Prosecution that in all fairness, fairness has been done and enough is enough, and that if they don't have the witness and no indication of when or where that witness can testify, then they should close their case.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. JALLOW:
With the leave of the Court, if I may just respond to two issues which have been raised by my learned colleague.  I think the witnesses, when I say they are crucial, they are indeed crucial to the case for the Prosecution.  The -- one of the allegations against the Accused is that he was present at some time at the hospital in Butare and while he was there he was engaged in acts of killing and other acts -- other inhumane acts.  These two witnesses whom we propose to call are said to be, ************************, now.   They were both present at the hospital.  They both know the Accused person and they saw the Accused at the hospital at the time, as alleged, carrying out those acts which the Prosecution is trying to establish.  So the witnesses are crucial.  They are very -- of importance to the Court itself.  

As regards their absence from the court itself, there is an overriding difficulty.  They are not witnesses -- they are not reluctant to come because they have other commitments; they are not reluctant to come because they have booked for holidays to go elsewhere.  They are reluctant to come because of security concerns they have.  And these are very important issues for the Court itself.  We need to address the security concerns of these witnesses, try and overcome them in order to ensure that the witnesses are able to come to court, and have the Court resolve the issues that are before it.  

It's a very serious issue that's keeping them away, and that's why we have had to engage the government of Rwanda itself in the process to see how we can overcame -- overcome the protection issue which is -- which has arisen.  But, clearly, they are crucial to the case.  They have been called to testify on, directly on allegations which are contained in the indictment against the Accused person, and because of their personal knowledge of the Accused, they are in a position to help the Accused -- the Court one way or the other.  

As I said before, we are not asking for an open-ended adjournment.  We think that would not be fair to the Court.  We are continuing to make efforts -- the chief of Prosecution, as I said, was in Europe, is still in Europe and did talk to one of the witnesses.  We haven't resolved the issue yet, but I think we should be given a fixed time frame within which we should be -- we can exhaust our efforts, hopefully, with the result that the witnesses would be available to the Court here.  And I think by next week we should be in a position to come to that particular point.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  I am sorry, Mr. President, I rise to my feet very briefly.  I return to the point.  It's incorrect to say both these witnesses know Rwamakuba.  One witness, quite plainly, does not -- I am sorry.  

And the second matter is this:  It's suggested the reason why these witnesses aren't coming is for security reasons, but there hasn't been a jot of evidence that that is the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, it's not necessary for us to adjudicate issues of security at this time, but I think it's necessary to say that, as far as we are concerned, not one jot of evidence about security issues connected to these witnesses has been advanced to us.  These witnesses were on the list of witnesses to give testimony at the trial session which was supposed to have ended on the 15th of July this year, and we were told by the Prosecutor that there were issues of convenience which led to the non-attendance of one of those witnesses.  

Now, so we have had -- we have had -- and then, when we were preparing for this trial session, we also tried to get information about witnesses who were going to be testifying during this trial session so that I am -- we think it might be putting it too strongly to make that statement at this stage.  

Now, when the matter had arisen, we had decided to give reasonable time to the Prosecutor to try to address the problem that had been expressed to us.  And the reason why we had asked you to come, the real reason we had asked you to come, was our concern that up to Wednesday of last week we were told that contact had not been made with the witnesses.  So the reason for the witnesses' non-attendance could not be stated with accuracy because contact had not yet been made.  Now, so that was a matter of concern to us and it affected my comment to you about our perception as to how crucial they were if they had not been actually contacted by the Prosecution.  

Now, we have decided to give one last opportunity, but we think it has to take place early in the week of next week, because there are a number of other issues which are affected by this.  If the Prosecutor is not in a position to say that these witnesses are going to come to testify by Tuesday of next week, then there is no reason to assume that the witness will ever come.

1200H
MR. PRESIDENT (continued):
I mean, this is a -- I don't understand how -- I really don't understand why time would assist.  I don't know if there's a point I'm missing, but I really don't understand the way in which more time would add anything at all.   

And, in fact, what is happening now, is that everybody's arrangements -- their pre-arrangements are being -- are being affected.  And I don't understand the way in which there could be any positive gain by just granting time like this.  We thought that the Prosecutor should let us know by Tuesday of next week.  It has by Tuesday of next week.
MR. JALLOW:
As it pleases the Court.  

I'm -- I'm sorry if the Court has been receiving different reasons for the -- for the non-appearance of the witness, but the report I've had is that the witnesses are concerned about their own safety -- their own security, if they were to come here and testify for the Prosecution and then went on to -- to Rwanda.  So that is the explanation I've been receiving.   

The chief of Prosecutions did speak to one of them this week in Europe.  She doesn't live there, she's going back to Rwanda, and this was -- that's the report I have from the chief of Prosecutions that the witness expressed that particular concern about the security.  

The reason why we need time is because we, at this stage -- because it's a security issue, we have time to get -- to involve the authorities in Rwanda themselves, so that they could consider measures to take in order to deal with any sort of potential security problem.  That's why we need a little bit of time.  And if we are given up till Tuesday, we'll -- we'll be able to come back to the Court and -- and report back to the Court, one way or the other about the outcome of our -- our efforts.   

One would have wished for a little bit more time during the week, perhaps towards the end of the week, because there's a whole weekend intervening in between.  It leaves us effectively only with Monday.   
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Jallow,  Mr. Prosecutor --
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, what are the possible orders that could be made?  If -- if your application results in the need for the witnesses to attend, when will they attend?  How is that going to impact on other proceedings, which are being planned, which are being scheduled?  

You see, if this information is not known on Tuesday, there are a number of domino effects from this; 
I don't know if you understand what I'm saying.
MR. JALLOW:
I do follow, Your Honour.  You need to know on Tuesday in order to be able to plan early enough on the next course of action to take.  If the witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not only in relation to this case.
MR. JALLOW:
Yes, but to other cases.  I was just making the point that Tuesday also gives us really very limited time, given that if we're dealing with the Rwandan authorities -- today is Friday, the weekend is in between, effectively, we have, at best, today and only Monday to try and resolve this issue.  That's why I -- I thought I should draw this to the attention of the Court to give us a few more days during that week.   Certainly during the course of the week, we'll -- to try to bring the matter to a conclusion.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
There are two matters.  Of course, the Prosecution have their proffered explanation for the witness not being here.  The Defence might submit that an equally credible reason is that a witness -- or witnesses has a prick of conscience about coming here and saying certain things and that this is the real reason for the witness not coming here.  And we have a concern at the pressures that are being brought to bear on witnesses.  A witness, for example, presently in Europe, and returns to Rwanda and the assistance of the authorities of Rwanda is a concern for us.   

The second matter is the uncertainty of the position.  We, as a Defence team, have now changed our flights to Tuesday -- Tuesday night.  We will not be here after that and we are entitled to 28 days' notice of a hearing.  For our part, we have -- I think it's, quite, I hope, apparent, accommodated ourselves to the needs of this Chamber in August and again recently, and again in the last week or so.   

We are not in a Prosecution position of being here and based here, and we have other lives and other commitments.  If a witness could be got here by Monday or Tuesday of next week, well, maybe that would be one matter, but this uncertainty continues and it must be a real fear now that this Court won't be in a position to hear these witnesses for several weeks.  Even if on Tuesday they're told at some point in the future, unknown, they may be.  I could only, I hope, make our position -- I hope -- more clearer than that.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, after considering all aspects of this issue and, in particular, its impact on what we consider to be the interests of justice and a fair trial, we will grant one final adjournment on this matter until Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. at which we expect to get a report (inaudible).   
MR. JALLOW:
Very well, My Lord.  We will report back on Tuesday afternoon.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
2:30. 
MR. JALLOW:
Yes, I won't be here myself, but the Trial Chamber will make a report on the outcome.   Much obliged.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.   

Before we adjourn, there is an oral decision that we would like to deliver on the Prosecution's motion for investigation of violations of Trial Chamber order for protective measures for Prosecution witnesses.  

The Chamber recalls that on the 22nd of August 2005, it announced that it could not make a reasoned decision to request an investigation without evidence, and that any application to the Court concerning violations of its witness protection orders should be made by formal written motion, accompanied by statements from the complaining witnesses, or supported by evidence with notice to the Defence.   

Now, the motion that we have stated -- that, in the Prosecutor's view, signed statements from seven witnesses that accompanied his submissions provided reason to believe that Mr. Hooper may have disclosed information concerning the identity of protective wit -- Prosecution witnesses, or may have interfered with a potential Prosecution witness in violation of Rule 77, and the Trial Chamber's order on protective measures for Prosecution witnesses of 10th December 2004.   

The Prosecution motion also stated that the Defence disclosed the witness statement to the Prosecutor on 1st  September 2005, which, the Prosecutor contends, amounts to a breach of the Trial Chamber's decision on the Prosecutor's motion for protective measures for witnesses of 22nd September 2000.   

Furthermore, the Prosecutor claimed that on 16th and 26th December 2003, a representative from the Defence met with the protected witness without prior notification to the Prosecution as provided by the protective measures order of 22nd of September 2000.   

The Prosecutor also states that on this issue, he has reason to believe that the Defence has not listed the members of its team with the WVSS and requests the Trial Chamber's order of the WVSS to make such information available to the Prosecutor or to the Trial Chamber.   

The Prosecutor has clarified in his motion that he makes no presumption that Mr. Hooper maliciously violated the Trial Chamber's witness protection order of 10th December 2004, nor is it presumed that Mr. Hooper's deliberate disclosures of protected information were willful violations of the 
Trial Chamber's protective order.  The Prosecutor acknowledges that Defence counsel routinely undertake investigations of protected persons -- protected Prosecution witnesses in order to prepare for trial and notes the inherent difficulty in investigating the very persons that the Trial Chamber has enjoined from being identified to the public.  Nonetheless, careless, reckless or negligent disclosures of protected information may rise to the level of knowing and willful violations of Rule 77, depending on the circumstances.  Defence counsel, Mr. Hooper, already stated in open Court that the allegations were untrue. 

Now, this motion was filed as a confidential motion.  Although it started with a declaration in open court on the 22nd of August, and for that reason, I do not go into detail on our deliberations, but having reviewed and considered the submitted statements of the witnesses and other persons submitted by the Prosecution and compared them, as the case may be, with the testimonies given under oath before the Trial Chamber in the Rwamakuba case, bearing in mind the gravity of the allegations of misconduct or contempt on the Tribunal, and also bearing in mind the principle of the presumption of innocence, any allegations as mentioned must be handled with due care.   

The Trial Chamber has found the following:  With regard to the accounts by two persons, not witnesses in this case, the Trial Chamber finds no evidence to conclude that there was any breach of security.   The same applies to the account given by the witness, who is a relative of one of the just-mentioned persons -- in particular, having regard that this witness merely reports what her relative told her.   

One witness recalls a visit by Defence counsel dating back to 2003, which was not reported before as a breach of protective measures and which would seem to be part of normal investigative procedures for the Defence, rather than any breach of security.  That same witness also makes statements relating to 25th and 27th of July 2005, which have such a general character that no conclusion as to breaches of security can be deduced.   

The statement of another person relates to names and places, which cannot be deduced to have anything to do with the present case.  It lacks complete evidential value.  And, finally, the statement via the protective witness is too general and too vague to be taken as factual evidence of any breach of security.   

The Trial Chamber thus finds that there is no causal link between the facts or circumstances reported by those heard, and the behaviour of the Defence team, or any member thereof, to lead to the conclusion that there has been a breach of security as suggested by the Prosecutor.   

Neither do we find that there is any reasonable grounds to believe that misconduct or contempt as alleged has taken place.  The Trial therefore -- the Trial Chamber therefore considers that there is no reason for an order for any investigations and the Prosecution's requests are, thereby and therefore, dismissed.   

That's the end of the order.   
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Well, thank you, Mr. President, and I dare say you may prefer I say nothing, but there's just one matter that I'd like to - to say and put on public record, which merely deals with this.  

I was concerned to see that among the allegations there was an allegation or allegations relating to my meeting people in Sahere on Monday, the 25th of July.  I can confirm that I, together with my legal assistant, Svetlana Pouplard, travelled from Butare to Sahere.  We went in a United Nations vehicle, driven by a United Nations-appointed driver, together with an armed United Nations security man, called James.  I have his surname, but I won't utter it in open court.   

We drove to Sahere on what can easily be described best as a whistle-stop.  We drove along one road, turned right, up the hill, turned right again, and we came to a genocide memorial where I, 
Mrs. Pouplard, and James, the security man, got out of the vehicle, and I took a photograph or photographs of the names on the memorial.   We then got back in the vehicle and drove back to Butare.   

I am disappointed that the very simple step of going and speaking to those that we were with, the driver and security man, doesn't seem to have occurred to the Prosecution.  They have a record; they have logs, which they keep, and they have their own memories of what happened.  There was no meeting whatsoever anywhere in Sahere with anybody.   

I say nothing about the extraordinary account of events that's provided in respect of the hospital.  But, again, I'm disappointed that the Prosecution could launch such a motion without even turning to the source of what the witnesses were complaining about -- was a request made by us, which was never made, and that is the statement they took from the director of the hospital that contradicts, and is, in fact, a full and fair representation of what happened at the hospital.   
I want to put on record and say again, there's no truth in the allegations.  No one was seen at all in the hospital; nor was there a request to see anyone in the hospital.  There was one trip to Sahere; nobody was spoken to and we were out of the United Nations vehicle for no more than two or three minutes.   

Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We should take the adjournment now, until Tuesday, 2:30.
