MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  We wish all of you a happy New Year 2004.  This morning we are going to begin with a status conference.  I will ask the registry to read or mention the matter on the Court's list. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Madam President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge A. Vaz, presiding, Judge F.R. Arrey and Judge F. Lattanzi, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 19th January 2004, for a status conference in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, case number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank the registry.  We will now ask for counsel appearances.  We will begin with the Office of the Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honour.  Happy New Year to the entire Bench.  The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, as the senior trial attorney, assisted by trial attorney Ifeoma Ojemeni and Dior Fall.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 

Can the Defence counsel now present themselves?  Can the Defence counsel now introduce themselves?  In the list we have Ms. Dior Diagne for Karemera.  There was a change.
MS. DIAGNE:
Yes, there was a change.  I am Dior Diagne.  I think my colleagues have a problem with their headsets. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will ask the equipment technicians to kindly help us.  We cannot hear Ms. Diagne. 
MS. DIAGNE:
Madam President, can you hear me?  Can you hear me, Madam President? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I can hear you but not through the headsets.  I can hear you directly. 

While it appears that there is still a problem with the French channel, we will try to continue because we are able to hear what is being said in French, at least.  The technicians have promised that they would make things work.  Or otherwise we'll take a break. 
MS. DIAGNE:
Thank you, Madam President.  My name is Dior Diagne.  I am here representing Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Madam President, I just want to take this opportunity to introduce to you and your colleagues -- or rather to present to you our best wishes for the New Year.  Of course, these wishes go to all the staff here in the courtroom, the interpreters, as well as the technical staff.  Of course, I've not left out the Prosecution team.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Ms. Diagne. 

Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
For André Rwamakuba, David Hooper, Andreas O'Shea, and assisted by Ms. Senabou Benga.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Hooper. 

Mr. Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Good morning and greetings to the Court.  Madam President, as you know, my name is Charles Roach and I am representing Dr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and with me is my colleague, Frederic Weyl, and we are ready to proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Roach. 

Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning, Madam President, members of the Trial Chamber.  Peter Robinson appearing with Joseph Nzirorera.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Mr. Robinson.  We thank all the parties.  We would now ask the Prosecutor to tell us whether there are any pending problems, the status of the proceedings, the discussions between the parties and whether we could continue with the hearing of the witnesses and who are the witnesses who are going to be called. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  The parties convened on the 12th of December, right after the end of the first trial session, in an informal meeting, to go over outstanding issues of discovery.  I think we resolved a number of issues.  I think, and I would -- in terms of discovery, perhaps it would be more helpful if we heard from the Defence, because then they could outline their specific concerns and then the Prosecutor could address them item by item.  But in terms of our continuing the trial this morning, there is one item which I would like to bring to the attention of the Court and to the parties at this moment.  It concerns our next witness, GFA. 

Sometime last week, I had sent a memo to CMS and requested that it be directed to all of the parties, to indicate that we had scheduling problems.  By the terms of the submission that we made at the end of the first trial session, we had anticipated taking testimony from GAP as our first witness during the second session.  Unfortunately, GAP was listed as a witness in the Bizimungu trial that is ongoing before Trial Chamber II.  They had anticipated concluding the testimony of GAP during the first trial session and were unable to do so.  Consequently, they put over GAP's testimony for the beginning of their second trial session, which also commences today.  As a result of their scheduling problems, we also encounter scheduling problems because GAP will not be available to testify in this Trial Chamber today. 

The next witness on our list, the list that we had initially proposed, was GB -- GFF, excuse me.  We also have encountered some difficulties in bringing GFF before the Court to testify as the second witness.  As a result of those difficulties, what we propose is to start our testimony today with Witness GFA.  GFA is testifying on much of the same material that would have been covered by our first two witnesses.  These are all witnesses that will testify to events in Ruhengeri, and they are principally witnesses against Joseph Nzirorera.  I alerted Defence counsel at the first available opportunity of the change.  My wish is not to inconvenience them or to obtain a strategic advantage in shuffling the order of witnesses.  It was to deal with a situation over which I had no control, and I made every attempt to communicate that to Defence as early as possible.  Having said that, however, I would submit that even though this changing -- this change in the ordering of the witnesses is an inconvenience both to the Defence and the Prosecution, both parties should be able to deal with this reordering.  The issues that the witnesses would cover are basically the same.  Witnesses would all testify about events on the 7th of April in Mukingo and about the antecedents to those events and the consequences of those events.  So on the issue of notice, there is no surprise, and all of the parties were aware -- have received disclosure for all of these witnesses and would have anticipated taking testimony from GFA in another week to ten days anyway.  So that's the first issue, which is a formal issue. 

On a more practical note, the Prosecutor is a bit disadvantaged this morning in proceeding with GFA, even though we have changed the order of witnesses this morning.  I had worked on my outline of the direct examination over the weekend.  It was on a diskette.  I brought it into the office this morning and I am unable to open it on my computer.  I do have a reserve copy on a computer in my residence, which I can copy onto another diskette, but unfortunately I'm not in a position to proceed because I cannot open the document on which my outline for the direct examination is prepared.  So I would ask the Court's indulgence on this point, and if we could commence our examination of GFA either in the afternoon or tomorrow morning, I would be much obliged. 
We are ready to proceed with other items that we must address during the course of the status conference -- excuse me, one additional point with respect to GFA, my understanding was that disclosure was complete by the end of the second -- excuse me, by the end of the first trial session.  Yesterday, I made another search of our Zyfind data base, and I discovered one additional statement of GFA.  That statement is dated 2 December 2003.  That statement was recorded while we were on trial last year.  I was not aware that an additional statement had been taken.  The statement was taken to prepare this witness for his testimony in another trial.  I became aware of this for the first time yesterday at approximately 11 a.m.  I have copies of that statement which I can serve on the Defence and on the Court today.  In fact, the copies have already been reproduced but they were left in my office this morning.  So that would be the sixth statement to OTP investigators that this witness has made. 

In addition, among Mr. Robinson's requests in a letter that he addressed to the Court in -- excuse me, to the parties on the 5th of January, I believe, was a request for the transcripts of a Gacaca proceeding that took place in Rwanda back in 1999.  The Office of the Prosecutor has come into possession of those transcripts, but not through official means.  These were transcripts that were served on the parties and the Court by the Defence during the course of their cross-examination in another proceeding.  I believe it was in the context of the Bizimungu trial that is ongoing before Trial Chamber II.  When I received those transcripts, although they were in the possession of the Office of the Prosecutor upon receipt by the Prosecution counsel in the Bizimungu trial, we had no idea of where these documents came from and how they were obtained, and the authenticity of the documents had not been established.  Since that was the case, we were not prepared to serve those documents on the Defence as documents that were emanating from the Office of the Prosecutor at that time.  But over the weekend, I reviewed those transcripts with our witness GFA, and based on that conversation, I am now prepared to provide those transcripts to the Defence in this case, with the proviso that all parties understand that this is not a document that was obtained directly from the Rwandese authorities.  It was something that we obtained from the Defence in another case.  So those two documents may relate to the testimony of GFA and they will be made available to the parties during the course of this morning.  But once again, these are items which only came to my attention, or were only in a position -- we are only in a position to serve after yesterday because I learned of the additional statement yesterday morning, and my conversation with GAF in regard to these transcripts took place last night at approximately 8 p.m.

My understanding is that, in every other respect, disclosure has been completed for the second session witnesses. 

There is a lengthy correspondence that I've referred to before from Mr. Robinson.  I would prefer -- or suggest, rather, to the Court that we allow him to review his correspondence and tell us exactly what remains outstanding, and I will respond to each item.  There are also outstanding requests from the Karemera Defence team.  We have responded to those requests.  The response will be served on CMS during the course of this morning.  There are outstanding requests from the Ngirumpatse Defence team.  Those requests as well will be addressed in letters and memoranda that will be served on the parties later on this morning. 

One of them concerns a request for the restitution of property that was seized from Mr. Ngirumpatse.  We have already issued a memorandum to our evidence unit requesting that certain items be returned to the Accused. 

So those are the issues that come immediately to mind.  And beyond that, the Prosecutor is ready to proceed, and I would request that we hear from the Defence, and I will respond to any of their concerns item by item. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think what the Prosecutor just said has not been translated. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the Prosecutor repeat, says the French interpreter, because they do not remember what the Prosecutor said.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, can you please repeat what you said? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I don't know where I left off.  At what point should I begin?  Maybe I can just summarise the last two minutes of what I said, and that is:  Beyond the outstanding disclosure issue for Witness GFA, and a response to four letters that were directed to my office by Mr. Weyl from -- for the Ngirumpatse Defence team, I would submit that all outstanding issues have been addressed for the second trial session, but I would be pleased to respond to any of the observations of any of the Defence teams in regard to outstanding issues before we commence testimony in this trial. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  We will now turn to the Defence. 

Mr. Roach? 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you very much.  Madam President and Judges of the Tribunal, I should like to address you on a matter on which I speak on behalf of Dr. Ngirumpatse, but I have had some discussions with my other colleagues here, and what I say, although I don't speak for them, I think reflects the feelings that the entire Defence team believes is the proceeding that should be followed through from this point on. 
I will make my remarks in the form of a motion, because in that way, I could be clearer and I could also be of assistance in a more direct way.  The motion is for a mistrial, and the grounds for the motion is that the Appeals Chamber, in its decision of the 19th of December, has vacated the order upon which the indictment on which we were proceeding was made.  And the Appeals Chamber has clearly stated that the decision of the Trial Chamber with respect to the amendment of the indictment of October 8th is vacated, and by that we understand it is a nullity.  And this, in effect, puts us back to the position in which we were back in October of 2003, and the subsisting indictment is the unamended one which carries the 11 counts, and I say so because it appears that the order of the Appeals Chamber was not to amend or to alter the indictment on which we were proceeding, but it vacated that decision of the Trial Chamber in toto. 

Now, before going further, I might say it is not our wish, on behalf of Dr. Ngirumpatse, to prolong proceedings.  However, it appears that the logical conclusion of the decision of the Appeals Chamber is that the proceedings taken so far are a nullity and should be quashed, which would mean a new trial. 

Now, we note that the Appeals Chamber, in vacating the decision of the Trial Chamber, stated that the matter is remitted to the Trial Chamber for consideration of whether, in the light of the observations made in that decision, the amended indictment is otherwise in compliance with Rule 50.  It appears to us that before proceeding any further with any matters of any nature, we must address the indictment on which we are or will be dealing from this point forward.  If the indictment that we've been dealing with has been vacated, or the order for that indictment has been vacated, then it would appear that proceeding on that indictment would be quite useless because the Accused cannot be convicted on such an indictment, assuming the best case for the Prosecution on the substantive matters. 

Now, I had said at the commencement of these hearings that an indictment is a most important -- or the most important document in any trial.  It is more or less the rudder that steers the ship.  It tells us what direction we are going in, and it gives us some indication as to the relevancy of testimony and also a guide as to the probative nature of questions.  And without that rudder, we will not be able to direct ourselves accordingly.  And so the most recent decision that we received from this presently constituted panel and Tribunal of this Chamber, suggesting that matters be put over until the 23rd for discussion of the decision of the Appeals Chamber, we find that that decision has to be dealt with -- or that matter has to be dealt with as a threshold matter at this time rather than proceed and then deal with it at that time, on the 23rd.  The reason for that is, if we proceed now, it will fetter your discretion and constrict your ability to properly adjudicate on matters that would be raised at the later time because if you proceed with hearing of witnesses and taking of testimony, and then at the later stage we have an indictment which may or may not have a new count in it, a new charge, which it seems as though the Prosecutor believes that there is a new count, as the Appeals Chamber notes, then we would find ourselves in a position in which this Court will not be able to impartially deal with the motions that we will bring on the sufficiency or propriety otherwise of that new indictment. 

I am assuming, of course, that the Prosecution is persevering with its bid to file a fresh, a new, amended indictment. 

So if you would permit me, I should like to give you our views as to how the proceedings should flow from this point.  I would say that this Court must abide by the decision of the Appeals Chamber, and the Appeals Chamber has requested that this Court examine the impact any amendment or proposed amendment might have on the overall trial, and you must, in my submission, examine that impact before proceeding any further.  You should not examine or you ought not to examine that at a later point in the trial or in the middle or the end of the trial, but you have to do that, in my submission, respectfully, at this point. And so I would submit to you that what is required here is an order declaring a mistrial. 

Now, I have not discussed with my friends or the Prosecutor, to any extent, as to how we can salvage or make best use of testimony given so far, but in my opinion, that testimony can only be useful if there is some kind of consensual arrangement between Defence and the Prosecutor and also some kinds of assurances that such testimony would have no impact on the proceedings, so far as the new indictment is concerned, that would be supportive of any new charges that are laid.  So, therefore, it may be necessary for us, in a sensible way, to get together with the Prosecutor to see if we can do that, but I do not believe that the Court has the power to do anything more at this point than to declare a mistrial. 

Now, of course, as for my part, I am not seeking any adjournment or delay.  I would much prefer to stay here in Arusha, because I understand, where I come from, back in Canada, it's all frozen and it's much more commodious for me to stay here, for a personal reason.  But never mind that, the important reason is fairness and justice.  And fairness and justice requires adherence to procedure.  And that's what law is about, not just the substance of the matter.  But we have to, as lawyers, as legal workers, adhere to procedures, and the procedure at this time strongly dictates that a mistrial be declared. 

Now, following that, we would expect that the Prosecutor would renew his motion for an indictment, an amended indictment, which would bring the very motion that was adjudicated upon in October, bring that back, and allow us an opportunity to respond to that, and if there is a new count, there should be an arraignment.  The Prosecutor, in his submissions initially with respect to the amendment that he was seeking, did suggest that a new count was contemplated and did suggest also that an arraignment of the Accused on that count, or that new charge, be made.  The Appeals Chamber did note the Prosecutor's position, and it is up to the Prosecutor now to present this new indictment, and we will proceed on that indictment. 

So, to summarise what I have put to you, I would say that it would be grave and reviewable error to disregard or not to act on the Appeals Chamber's decision at the outset.  It is a threshold matter that must be done.  And we on the Defence should like to see some cooperation with the Court and with the Prosecutor to work this matter out.  Trials are never perfect, but we cannot, with such a grave matter as what indictment we are proceeding on, proceed in such a manner that indicates or gives the apprehension that this Court does not care about the implications of the Appeals Chamber's decision. 

In conclusion, I would say that all of us should like to work in a collaborative way to bring a conclusion to this case beyond some limitless time.  I, for one, should like to see that matters proceed with some degree of expeditiousness.  But we cannot help but say that the pressure on this Court to proceed with speed or with haste could affect the fairness and justice of the deliberations, and it has been obvious, because of not this Court's doing but because of the way the Tribunal operates and the work it has to do, that there is a pressure to finish matters without delay.  But we have a saying:  More haste, less speed.  And unless we do things in a regular manner, by putting the horse before the cart and by dealing with the indictment before we proceed, we will be acting speedily and hastily and we will not at all be in a position where we are ensured that we will not be here again to go over this very cumbersome and difficult business of bringing witnesses and Accused persons to Court.  Those are my submissions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Roach. 

Is there any other Defence counsel who would like to speak on this matter?  Counsel Hooper, you have the floor. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  On behalf of André Rwamakuba, the plain reading of the order of the Appeal Chamber has been to vacate the decision that this Court made on the 8th of December (sic), and the words they use vacating the decision are not in any way compromised, nor is there any indication that the vacation of the decision is as to part.  In vacating the decision of the 8th of October, perhaps unexpectedly, to some minds, the Appeal Chamber has presented this Trial Chamber and this trial with considerable difficulties. 

We support the argument that has been stated, briefly stated, by Mr. Roach, that it is arguable that because of the vacation of the October the 8th indictment, that there has been or there is a nullity of proceeding hitherto that needs to be addressed.  It's certainly an arguable, and a strong arguable, position. 

It's apparent to us, and we can understand the reasons, and indeed this Chamber expressed them in the last session that this Court has, as an imperative, an anxiety to move on with the case.  Here we are, we've all boarded the train for the second session, the Government I express is due to leave the station, was due to leave at nine o'clock and it's already nearly 10, and the guard has waved the flag, but there is an obstacle, I must say, ahead.  There is a tree across the track, and it's a significant one.  I suppose the reasons for pressing on are clearly convenience to witnesses and to the Court, but we submit that whatever the position is as to the argument that's been touched upon by Mr. Roach in respect of proceedings hitherto being a nullity, even if you were to accept, or even if it was to be accepted, that there was somewhere here an extant working indictment, and that indictment would not be the indictment of October the 8th but would be a preceding indictment, the indictment of November, say, 2001, with five more charges, and two more defendants, even if it was a tenable argument, there is still the issues of significant amendments to be decided, both as to whether, on one view, any amendment should take place, because it's going to rest with an application by the Prosecution, and on one reading, it's not mandatory in whole or part for such amendments in fact to be permitted, depending on one's interpretation of the decision of the Trial Chamber, there are significant amendments in the offing, potentially.  On one view -- and this may all be subject to argument -- on one view, it may be seen that these proposed amendments are almost a mandatory imperative; but in any event, these aren't some loose possibilities.  There is a compelling need for this Court to address the issue of the amendments that the Crown -- the Prosecution here are proposing. 

And I come to this point:  That it's clearly perceived by me, on behalf of André Rwamakuba, and looking at the document in respect of the Court's request for Defence counsel to present their views by the end of this week, that the Court may have it in mind to proceed this week calling witnesses before the issue of the indictment has been decided.  And we submit that that particular course would be -- would be wrong, because we are not dealing here with slight, cosmetic change.  We are dealing here with extensive amendment, if there is to be any amendment at all, and that's reflected in the language that was used by the Appeal Chamber in recognising that to be the position.

And the position in respect of amendment -- and I don't go into it in detail now, but I'm in a position to do so -- these extensive amendments require to be resolved because they are going to affect inevitably the nature of the questions put to witnesses to be called this week.  They affect the nature of the strategy by the Defence to the indictment, a sort of macro effect, if you like, and they affect the micro effect of each individual witness and how we approach each individual witness.  And that's not some theoretical proposition.  It's the reality.  We've identified 26 new charges against André Rwamakuba in this proposed amendment, and it's for that reason that we express deep concern at proceeding -- or the proposal that the matter proceed this week with the calling of further witnesses on the basis of an unidentified indictment, when such extensive changes are, on one view, imminent. 

So there is two significant matters:  the issue of nullity that's been raised by Mr. Roach and which we support and which has to be argued; and secondly, in the alternative, if there is to be an amendment of this indictment, and in our argument that must be, if it exists at all, the indictment of November 2001, then that is a matter that has to be addressed before we can go any further, on the significant principle that each Accused has the imperative right to know the charges that he faces, and on the practical observation that to call further witnesses, without knowing which indictment we are proceeding on, would be wrong.

Those are my submissions.  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Hooper. 

Yes, Counsel Robinson, you have the floor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I will be brief. 

First of all, I join in the motion made by Mr. Roach for a mistrial and for a new trial. 

Second, I make my own motion for suspension of the trial proceedings until the matter of which indictment and which charges my client is facing has been determined by this Trial Chamber.  We are not ready to proceed with any witnesses until that matter is clarified.  The reason for that, besides obvious reasons that an Accused has the right to know the charges against him, which are fundamental to the Statute of this Tribunal, are practical as well.  Our strategy, our questions, will be different depending on which indictment we are facing. 

For example, in the new indictment, Mr. Nzirorera is charged with responsibility for the acts of the interim government, what you heard referred to as the Abatabazi government, by Witness GBV.  No such allegation appears in the old indictments, and indeed I did not question Witness GBV about the Abatabazi government because, as it stood then, Mr. Nzirorera was not charged with responsibility for their actions. 

I give you a second example.  In the old indictment, it's charged that on the 7th of April, at seven o'clock in the morning, Mr. Nzirorera was in Kigali, meeting to help form a new government in the wake of the assassination of President Habyarimana.  In the new indictment, at that same time, on that same day, he's charged with being in Mukingo, meeting with people to incite the killing that occurred on the morning of the 7th of April.  If the new indictment is accepted, we will need time to file a notice of alibi, which we intend to do, after investigation and interviews of the witnesses who will provide that alibi.  And so you see how different the questions would be of these witnesses from Mukingo as we are dealing with the old indictment or the new indictment. 

A third example, rape.  In the old indictment, Mr. Nzirorera is charged with individual responsibility for rape, meaning that it must be proved that he ordered, planned, instigated or committed the crime of rape.  In the new indictment, we have the concept of joint criminal enterprise, in which Mr. Nzirorera can be found guilty of rape if he was part of an agreement to kill Tutsis and it was foreseeable to him that in the course of that conduct, people would be raped.  Witnesses will testify about rape in this -- the very next witness -- and it makes a big difference under which indictment we are proceeding. 

And my last example to you relates to the joint criminal enterprise and our relationship with our 
co-Accused.  Under the old indictment, it made little or no difference to Mr. Nzirorera's Defence whether Dr. Rwamakuba ordered killings of people in Butare at the hospital.  Under the new indictment, Mr. Nzirorera can be convicted based on Dr. Rwamakuba's actions, if in fact this joint criminal enterprise is found to exist and both are found to be members.  And so we have to take a completely different strategy with respect to witnesses for the co-Accused. 

And so my submission is that the trial must be suspended until the Trial Chamber makes the decision as directed by the Appeals Chamber for consideration of whether, in light of its observations, the amended indictment is otherwise in compliance with Rule 50, and if so, for entry of an order amending the current indictment.  We believe that that direction of the Appeals Chamber is mandatory and that that is -- the first job of the Trial Chamber is to follow the direction of the Appeals Chamber, not go on with the trial and take at its leisure the direction of the Appeals Chamber into consideration. 

Mr. Webster discussed the issues of disclosure and asked that I go through, item by item, the problems with the witnesses for the second session.  I'm happy to do that.  There are 82 items in my list.  Given the pace at which we go when we discuss this with Mr. O'Donnell, I think it would take about six hours to complete the discussion of those items.  It's my suggestion that, as to matters of disclosure, before we proceed with any witnesses in the second session, that we take those matters up with Mr. O'Donnell, rather than take the Trial Chamber's time, but if you would like to sit here for six hours and go over those items, I'm prepared to do that. 
I do want to let you know, though, with respect to Witness GFA, that under no circumstances will we be prepared to cross-examine this witness any time soon.  Not only was his -- the order of witnesses changed at a time when we were not -- I was in Kigali, I was not even prepared to begin my preparation of GFA, but the new disclosures, both ones I've requested and ones that Mr. Webster has revealed for the first time today, will undoubtedly require review, investigation and preparation before we would be in a position to question this witness. 

So, with those observations and with that motion, I thank you for your attention. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel Robinson. 

Counsel Diagne, would you like to speak on this matter as well? 
MS. DIAGNE:
Counsel Weyl is on his feet and would like to speak before me, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Weyl, you are co-counsel to Mr. Roach, and he has already spoken on this matter.  Do you have anything to add on this matter? 
MR. WEYL:
I would like to add something, but perhaps the Chamber should authorise me to say a few words with regard to what Mr. Webster said.  If the Tribunal allows me, I would like to reserve whatever additions I have to the response of Mr. Webster.  I would like to say that I have something to add, bearing in mind my peculiar sensibilities as a francophone and a civil lawyer.  Subject to the pronouncements of my co-counsel, my colleague Diagne, I am the only lawyer who is particularly curious -- and the matter is very curious -- how can one be a common lawyer -- what I mean is that the proceedings at the beginning of this trial are very perplexing, bearing in mind what Mr. Webster has said, and I must point out, and I would like to say this with regard to his interventions, that I am profoundly convinced that we cannot proceed today as if nothing happened on the 19th of December, as if nothing happened on the 14th of January.  

Mr. Webster, in his introductory statement, said he would proceed to question witnesses as if the Chamber hadn't taken any decision, as if the Appeals Chamber hadn't taken any decision, and as if he himself, on the 20th of October, did not consider that the matter of the indictment would have an impact on the trial, because at the time -- at the time, he wanted a postponement, which was motivated not by the decision of the Appeals Chamber but by his appeal.  I would like to say that today, if we act as if nothing had happened and we proceed to examine witnesses without reviewing the motions for adjournment, because the Defence was of the opinion that the Tribunal should work on firm foundation, I would find that very unrealistic.  I would like to say that the motions presented by my fellow Defence counsels, who have pointed out that we cannot proceed without determining that the trial is proceeding on a firm foundation, that it is currently urgent, extremely urgent, to wait for the Chamber's decision -- and I don't want to prejudge what that decision will be -- and we are being brought back to the 7th of October.  If we rely on the decision of the Appeals Chamber, we are going back to the decision of the 7th of October.  I don't know what the Chamber's decision will be, and we do not know what it will be because we've been asked to make proposals and make observations.  I believe we can resume the trial in a serene, composed and fair manner when, together, we will have discussed what is on the table and we will agree on the indictment of November 2001, the indictment of 8 October 2003, and the ultimate indictment will be based on the decision you will take after having heard our remarks, following the decision of the 14th of January.  

We would like to make our proposals by the 23rd of January, bearing in mind the deadline given to us.  I would like us to proceed not by naming the witnesses but by making the specifications that will be in line with the request of the Chamber, in line with the decision of the Appeals Chamber, and that will bear in mind our position of the indictment.  This, in my opinion, and in light of all the statements that have been made and the wishes expressed, we would like to make all these pronouncements to the Chamber in order to enable the Chamber to make its decision, and we pray the Chamber to take into account our analysis, and this analysis having been enlightened by the statements made and the decision of the Appeals Chamber.  It is urgent that we wait for the Chamber's decision before we proceed with these proceedings on clear foundation and not in this very unclear situation in which we find ourselves.  We have to defend a strategy not on the basis of an indictment but on three indictments, and we are defending our witnesses on three fronts, the front of November 2001, 8th October 2003, and on the basis which, even the Chamber is not quite clear on what it should be.

	1015H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Diagne. 
MS. DIAGNE:
I thank you, Madam President, for giving me the floor.  

Madam President, I cannot beg to subscribe to the arguments that my colleagues have advanced before you, they seem to me to be obvious.  Madam President, I am rather frustrated, nevertheless, to note that I cannot make more elaborations on this argument.  

Madam President, you know my new situation.  I was assigned to represent the interests of Mr. Karemera, and that was two or three days ago.  The decision was served on me this morning in this same courtroom, Madam President.  I must confess that two days ago I received copies of the decision in Senegal.  Nevertheless, I used these two days, Madam President, travelling so as to be able to appear before you this morning, so as to be able to be here and be next to my client to represent his interests.  So here I am, Madam President.  I apologise for the term I am going to use,  but I am completely naked before you, and, therefore, I have nothing, absolutely nothing; I have no document.  I hear people talking of a ruling or a decision that was delivered on the 15th of January.  I hear others talk of many decisions that were delivered, in the meantime the Appeals decision dated the 19th of December.  

Madam President, I will not behave as if I am arriving for the first time in this courtroom, because as you know, I was first of all a co-counsel -- a co-counsel of Mr. Robinson, my excellent colleague, for the interest -- or to represent Mr. Nzirorera.  But I was co-counsel, Madam President, and you know very well what that means.  I have never had the opportunity to actually go into the depth of things.  I was assigned specific duties.  We have some form of organisation for our work.  Nevertheless, I was able to study Mr. Nzirorera's case with the assistance of my learned colleague, but now I am dealing with Mr. Karemera's case, Madam President, and I have nothing.  I have nothing on this case.  I can't talk about anything regarding this case.  I cannot do anything about it.  

Since this morning, I have received some disclosures.  In fact, I am being over burdened here with many disclosures.  I would not even start reading them now because they may confuse me further.  So, Madam President, naturally, I would like to appeal to you, who is the head of this Trial Chamber, I would like to appeal to you to request that I respectfully seek an adjournment and a judgment of the hearing following my assignment as Defence counsel for Mr. Karemera.  This would enable us to -- or, rather, at the end of this status conference, we would seek an adjournment, the adjournment would enable me to organise myself together with my client.  We will do so very quickly, and then also, I will have to consult with my predecessor.  This is very important, for him to hand over the documents to me.  

It is also necessary for me to have a Defence team.  In fact, the Defence team is not actually in place because one of the legal assistants was not able to come here.  His work programme was cancelled because Mr. Karemera was in a situation where he had no counsel and no counsel could therefore supervise the work programme of the legal assistant, and the legal assistant's programme was simply cancelled.  

So, Madam President, in this respect as well, we are facing total disorganisation.  I think I cannot assume the responsibility of representing Mr. Karemera under these conditions.  I also believe that you would never allow me to start representing him now.  I believe that you can help me to organise myself to discharge the duties assigned to me so that Mr. Karemera could be normally defended and in the necessary -- with the necessary serenity.  

Madam President, I would not dwell on this because I believe it is clear.  It is clear that you would allow me, Madam President, to represent my client under the best conditions possible, and that is why I am requesting you once more -- I am reiterating once more that these proceedings be adjourned because all that my colleagues have said here, it seems to me very logical, but I cannot elaborate on that because I would be arguing on decisions that I am not aware of.  I thank you for your attention, Madam President, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Ms. Diagne.

Prosecutor, you have the floor to respond.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Much has been said by the Defence.  I must admit that on several of the points raised by Mr. Roach, in particular, I find myself in agreement with him on that, on the issue of how quickly we must proceed with this trial.  But in response to his co-counsel, Mr. Weyl, I must refer him to a document that the Court itself issued on the 13th of January, directing that in waiting for a decision that we'll issue on that the amendment -- that the indictment that is in place is that of the 21st of November 2001, as modified by the decision of 8th October 2003, and on the basis of other accusatory instruments.  

While all of the Defence counsel have mentioned the issue of nullity and confusion about what indictment is governing the trial, I do not agree with that proposition.  I think the Court was clear and the Court was alert or the decision of 13th of January was in conformity with the directions that were received from the Appeals Chamber, and that we all know what indictment is governing these proceedings at this moment.  So there is nothing.  There is no legal impediment to going forward with this trial.  

Having said that, however, there are practical considerations.  Our concern is on the issue of a judicial determination of new charges, which is ultimately the criteria that will govern whether an amendment is accepted, and whether each accused or those accused that are charged with new charges will have to make another court appearance or initial appearance.  

On the issue of how we are to proceed in the absence of determining the amendment, it is our position that the supplementary pre-trial brief that was filed on the 13th October of 2003, resolves that issue.  

So I heard very clearly Mr.  Robinson's arguments and he pointed out a number of issues that distinguish the amended indictment from the indictment that is currently in place.  From the perspective of the Prosecutor, those issues have been resolved by the supplementary pre-trial brief.  And it is our submission that that is what was being referred to in the Court's decision of the 13th or the Court's -- I believe, it is ordinance -- the order of the 13th of January 2004.  

We take the position that we can proceed on the basis of the indictment that is currently in place, which is the indictment of the 21st November 2001, as modified by the decision of 8th October and the supplementary pre-trial brief that was filed on the 13th of October 2003.  All of the additional allegations that Mr. Robinson itemised in part are included in that supplementary pre-trial brief.  So in terms of placing the Defence on notice of the case it must confront before this Tribunal and on the basis of the accusatory instruments in place, those issues have been resolved.  

Now, it is conceivable with respect to other accused that there may be allegations in the supplementary pre-trial brief that were not anticipated in the original indictment, and my perusal of those instruments would only lead to arguments along those lines by counsel or the Defence team for Joseph -- excuse me, for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  That has to do with the allegations that were made in regard to attacks in Bisesero and meetings that he attended in Cyangugu.  But we will not be dealing with those issues during the second trial session, and witnesses that are expected to testify next week and the following week have nothing to do -- have nothing to contribute with respect to those allegations.  And by my reading, it is those allegations and the supplementary pre-trial brief for which we have difficulty, and I don't concede an impossibility or difficulty, nothing other than the original indictment or the indictment that is in place as described or mentioned in the Court's decision of the 13th of January.  
I would like to return to the first portion of Mr. Roach's submission, and that has to do with this trial.  And on that issue, the Prosecutor firmly opposes any motion on this trial.  In fact, any motion from this trial is really a prosecutor's motion.  There is no way that the Defence has been disadvantaged or that this Tribunal or this Trial Chamber should be unsettled in regard to the testimony that was taken during the first trial session on the basis of the indictment of October 2003.  And the reason for that is that the amendment that was filed in response to the Court's decision of the 8th October is in every respect -- makes no difference with respect to any way.  The same indictment that we now have before us, which is the indictment of the 21st of November 2001, there had been no substantive textual changes to the allegations in that indictment.  That indictment and the notice that it provides the Defence had been enhanced by the supplementary pre-trial brief.  All of the testimony that we heard during the first trial session can be offered on the basis of that indictment of the 21st of November 2001.  It would only be the Prosecutor that would have the basis to claim unfairness or prejudice or disadvantage by returning to that indictment of 2001, and that is, because that indictment of 21st of November 2001 had 11 counts, whereas the indictment that was in place when we heard testimony during the first trial session, there were only seven counts.  But in every other respect, the textual allegations and the accusatory instrument that were guiding the Court were exactly the same.  

The reasonable basis for this trial at every stage of our proceedings including now, as I speak, there is an indictment that is in place that guides this Court and the parties, and the only party that would have the basis to claim prejudice or disadvantage is the Prosecutor.  

We can proceed.  This Court can proceed, but I would agree with the Defence counsel that we would all be better served by briefly delaying the taking of testimony so that we can resolve these issues, so that the testimony that will be forthcoming from the witnesses that are yet to testify will not give rise to a series of motions and responses on the issue of whether the charges or the allegations that they make from the witness box constitute new charges or not.  That is the fundamental issue that the Court must resolve first.  I do not recall that in the motion that was submitted to amend the indictment, that there was a concession by the Prosecutor that the allegations -- that the charges were new.  There were new allegations based on further investigations that gave rise to increased specificity and peculiarity and we took no position on whether those new allegations rose to the level of new charges.  

The distinction between the amended indictment and the supplementary pre-trial brief is where the issue of new charges is conceded in part by the Prosecutor, and that has to do with very specific allegations made against Mr. Ngirumpatse, based on witness statements that were taken, I believe, in October of 2003.  Those witness statements were received by the Office of the Prosecutor after the submission of the amended indictment.  

The issue that I am asking the Court to confront is the issue of delay.  When should we start again?  It is the position of the Prosecutor that the indictment itself does not have to be completely resolved before we start.  What needs to be resolved is that all the parties must have a meeting of the mind or at least an exchange of information, so that we can take a reasonable approach to have to move forward in this trial.  This issue of delay is the same issue that we confronted in November last year before the trial started, and I find it quite awkward.  

The Defence now claims that we have to delay and things must stop, and that is not the position they took in November 2003, when the Prosecutor requested that they delay the proceedings until the indictment was resolved.  At that time, I recall quite clearly that counsel for Nzirorera insisted that the trial commence, that that was also the position of the Rwamakuba Defence team and we find ourselves substantively in the same position.  

It is our contention, now that we can proceed without completely resolving the issue of the amendment, for we do need to meet and confront all the issues and devise a way of moving forward, we would urge this Court to consider the application of the Defence and my application to the extent that I join in requesting a slight delay before the taking of additional testimony.  But this delay or the period of delay should not be contingent of conclusively resolving the issue of the indictment.  We have an indictment that is in place.  If the indictment or the accusatory instruments as reflected in the Court's decision of the 13th of January this year -- we can proceed on that basis.  But it would be wise to confer amongst ourselves and the Court, as suggested by the Court on Friday the 23rd, before proceeding any further.  I believe that concludes my submission on those points.  

I would be happy to respond to any further inquiry from the Court with regard to this application and with regard to my response.  But simply to recapitulate, we oppose the motion for this trial but we do not oppose the application to delay the taking of additional testimony.  What we strongly caution is that any delay should not delay -- should not be based on a complete resolution of the indictment.  We need to meet to resolve the issues and to confer with each other.  But there is an accusatory instrument in place that can guide the taking of testimony for the duration of the second trial session.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor.  

Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
It is unfortunate that the decision that was made in January by this Tribunal was one that was totally ex proprio motu.  We, the Defence, did not have a chance or opportunity to make any submissions and the Court proceeded to make a decision or an order which is truly substantive in nature without the benefit of the Defence's input.  

For this matter or for any future matters, we would be most honoured and pleased if the customary judicial procedure be followed to seek the input of Defence counsel with respect to the making of decisions and orders that would affect the fundamental carriage of the trial.  

Now, I understand that my friend says in his -- my friend, Mr. Webster, says, and he puts the position that the order that was made by this Court of the -- I believe, it was the 13th of January, that that order effectively gives us the basis of the indictment on which we could proceed, and that seems to be a sort of joining of aspects of what was nullified, that is the order of October -- October 2003 with the original 2001 indictment.  Well, that is simply, with respect, not acceptable.  No part of the order that was made in October survives or can be used because that order was rejected in toto, and that is the position that I made before.  But I would just like to reiterate it and say that what we do need at this point before anything is done is a document that sets out what we have to meet -- that we the Defence have to meet.

Now, with respect to Dr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Webster tells us that just recently in October, I believe he said, there was new evidence or new information, new statements taken with which Dr. Ngirumpatse will be confronted, and, presumably, which sets out a new charge against him.  We are not, as counsel for Dr. Ngirumpatse, being put in a position to proceed without having that clearly defined in the new amendment.  If it so happens that there is no impact at all with respect to any of the changes and we could proceed, then why do we have to have an amended indictment?  

It stands to reason that if the amended indictment is substantive, I mean the proposed amended indictment is substantive, but then we should deal with it at this time.  If it's not, if it has no bearing and no input, we wonder why it is being brought forward at all.  So it is a position where my friend cannot have it both ways; that we proceed on the indictment of 2001 with the amendments that he says of that indictment or order that was made by the Court in October, those aspects of it.  I find this completely confusing and it is only a matter of expediency which does not conform to regularity of proceedings.  

We are before an international court, an international tribunal.  What we do will be examined for generations to come, and we cannot proceed in this slipshod way.  We have to have things done correctly.  And one would not expect in any criminal tribunal and at national level or international level, that we proceed without having before us a finalised charging -- a document charging and specifying exactly what are the offences to be met.  
Now, I must agree that the Defence except with respect to some new matters knew all along what the Prosecutor's plan was with respect to joint criminal enterprise and so on, even though that in itself is somewhat meekly as a basis.  We didn't know this, but the question isn't one of disclosure as we are talking right now; it is one of disclosure.  It is not one of prejudice either, and it is a mistake, in my respectful opinion, to say that the Defence cannot bring such a motion on this trial without showing prejudice.  Prejudice is not the issue here at all.  The issue is, is there a subsisting effective indictment on which we had been proceeding?  And the answer is no, because of the decision of the Appeals Chamber, and whether or not there is a prejudice, is not the issue. 

This is not a matter of substance only, but it is a matter of fundamental form, and the fundamental form is the essence of law.  Law is not the business of whether or not you know what charges you have to meet alone, it is what is on the indictment, what you are charged with and that helps to define what you have to meet, of course.  But this document, it cannot be treated so lightly as the Prosecutor seems to want to deal with it.  

Now with respect to Dr. Ngirumpatse in particular, my friend admits that only in October certain matters were or certain statements were brought and that might change the nature of the proceeding with respect to him.  Of course, we haven't heard that evidence as yet.  It is going to come in future, but we should at the earliest possible time know.  

The Court of Appeal -- the Appeals Chamber specified that it would be misconduct -- it would be an abuse of process and bad faith unless the Prosecutor shows that any new allegations of facts that are discovered are disclosed as soon as possible to the Defence.  And not only that, the Prosecutor must show due diligence in discovering those facts.

Now, Dr. Ngirumpatse has been in custody -- he has been arrested more than five years ago, and we are told that five years after the fact in October of last year, new evidence on new charges come to light.  We need an explanation for that.   And I would just like to quote the exact words of the Court of the Appeals Chamber.  The Court said that the record before them was silent as to whether the Prosecutor acted with diligence in securing the new evidence and in bringing the motion to the Trial Chamber's information that is solely within the Prosecution's knowledge.  So we would have an opportunity on the new indictment to challenge the Prosecutor as to whether or not he has acted with good faith, and when I say good faith, I want my friend Mr. Webster to understand.  What I mean is the institutional good faith and this is not personal, whether the system the Prosecution -- the Office of the Prosecutor has acted in such a manner that it could not have reasonably discovered this evidence before.  If not, then it could be that according to the Appeals Chamber, this Tribunal could disallow any such amendment.  So for this reason, we want to see what the new indictment is before we go ahead.  You cannot put us in a position of being in the ring with blindfolds on.  We want to know exactly, here is the document and here are the charges and this is what is going to determine the trial.  We want to know that.  Anything else would be a slipshod kind of procedure that is totally unworthy of a Tribunal of this hierarchy and in the courts of justice of the world.  

And so, I would just conclude by saying that we should like to have input, or we should have liked to have input to consider this decision that was made behind our backs in our absence, without our input in proceeding on a pastiche of two documents, one of which was rejected and there is a nullity.  We should like to have that opportunity and we should like to have that opportunity of having from the Prosecutor his indictment.  

I would urge you not to take another step without having the Prosecutor produce his indictment.  And if there is no such -- if there is a delay that is being requested, it should only be a delay, I suppose, Édouard Karemera may need a delay, may want to consider that.  Our position is, if there is any delay outside of that, it has to be for the Prosecutor to get his amended indictment in here and we can settle it.  Those are my submissions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Roach. 

Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  I would like to clarify something briefly, and it's in reference to Mr. Roach's submission.
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry.  I didn't know if you are taking objections, as it were, counsel by counsel, but I would like to respond, if this is the appropriate time for me to do so.  

I am in Mr. Webster's hands, really.  In other words, if Mr. Webster is making his final reply, then I would like the opportunity before he does so, to respond.
MR. WEBSTER:
This isn't necessarily a final reply.  It is a response directed to issues raised by Mr. Roach.  It is left with the Court whether I should respond now or wait until Mr. Hooper makes his observations.  But I have something to say directly to Mr. Roach in regard to his recent submission.
MR. HOOPER:
Please do so, I don't mean to intervene.
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry.
MR. HOOPER:
Please do so, subject to the President's opinion. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, you may speak.

Prosecutor, you may give a general answer after Mr. Hooper's or Defence counsel's comments. 

Mr. Hooper, please, you have the floor. 
MR. HOOPER:
In the 12th century in England, there was rebellion led by a man called Wat Tyler, and his first shout was: "Hang the lawyers".  Sometimes one can often get the -- perhaps the impression things would go also much better here if it wasn't for the lawyers, but sometimes I hope lawyers can help.  And I endorse Mr. Roach's phrase a moment ago, when he asked you not to take another step without the indictment issue being settled, for the reasons I gave earlier and I don't repeat.  

Mr. Webster mentioned a short time ago what he detected a surprising difference between the Defence reaction to his application for an adjournment back before the starting of the first session and our attitude today, and as you know, the boot in on the other foot.  As far as we are concerned, we are surprised that he isn't sharing a consistency here.  But there is an identifiable and considerable difference during the circumstances last year and the circumstances today.  

Last year before the first session started, we had a settled indictment.  The Accused knew the charges they faced and the nature of those charges, and could settle both their strategy and their questions accordingly.  We had no reason to think that the Trial Chamber was wrong in its decision not to permit those amendments.  

Indeed, I suspect that most of us thought it's highly unlikely in the extreme trial -- the Appeal Chamber would intervene, particularly after the trial had got under way, to the extent that it had to find that the Trial Chamber's decision was so unreasonable as to vacate it.  

In respect of -- the second point I would seek to make is this, in respect of vacating of the October indictment, if I can call it that, a proof that the Appeals Chamber considered that it was vacating the entire position, and that indictment is found at paragraph 25 of their decision, whether it is unnecessary to consider the position of the five counts that had been laid aside.  If they were dealing at all with the October indictment, they would have dealt with that and they haven't.  And there is a proof that they vacated it.  So, we need a settled indictment because the questions and strategy of the Defence are going to be determined by it, and that would be manifested immediately with the coming witnesses.  

As Mr. Roach has argued and we entirely endorse, and I would have thought it was very plain. 
Pre-trial briefs aren't charges, are not indictments.  And all the efforts of the Prosecution, and there have been strenuous efforts to what purpose?  A cosmetic change, certainly not.  Thank you, 
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I don't have much to say, to add to what has already been said by my colleagues, but I would like to respond to two points raised by Mr. Webster.  

With respect to effect of a supplementary pre-trial brief, we have argued about this and discussed this at length.  And you may recall that on the first day of the trial I submitted to you a motion with jurisprudence from the Appeals Chamber and the Trial Chamber of the ICTY, which said that: "The extended form of joint criminal liability cannot be brought into a case by a pre-trial brief, but must be by an indictment."  And I ask you to decide, are we now facing the charges of joint criminal enterprise as a result of a pre-trial brief or are we not?  And you chose not to decide that issue and I proceed as if we were not charged with joint criminal enterprise, and as a result, we have a different situation now that the Appeals Chamber has directed that a new indictment in fact be considered.  So that is my first point.  

My second point deals with the procedure of where do we go from here, and my question to 
Mr. Webster, which I would ask him to answer for the Trial Chamber when he responds, is whether or not the amended indictment that was signed on the 26th of July 2003 by Carla Del Ponte is now the document which he wishes to have the Trial Chamber consider or whether there have to be further changes before the Trial Chamber deliberates upon the amended indictment.  Once we know what is the amended indictment that we are being asked to consider, it is our suggestion that the next step is that you review the supporting materials or, first, that the Prosecutor submits supporting materials to you and that you review those supporting materials along with submissions of the parties as to propriety of amending the indictment in such a fashion and ultimately make a decision as a confirming body whether or not to confirm the amended indictment as presented by Mr. Webster.  That is what we believe needs to take place next.  And I won't belabour the point of the fact that we don't agree that any testimony should be taken while that process is going on.

And the last thing I would like to speak to is something that was not raised by Mr. Webster, and that is the problem of Mr. Karemera and his new lead counsel, my former co-counsel, Ms. Diagne. And I wish to simply inform the Trial Chamber that the division of labour that we undertook as a team in an effort to conserve resources and be as efficient as possible for the Tribunal, meant that Ms. Diagne did not have access to know -- was I intending to trouble her with any of the legal issues in the case or any of the motions, responses, replies and decisions that have been entered in the case up until now.  That was my responsibility.  Nor was she provided with any of the witness statements or the witnesses to come to this session, because she was not even expecting to attend the second session until much later, when some of the witnesses for Mr. Nzirorera, for whom she was responsible, were to come.  And I have never given her a single piece of paper dealing with any witnesses against 
Mr. Karemera, because we didn't believe that that was anything she needed to be concerned with.  And so, I want to make those facts known to this Trial Chamber when considering the course that we are to take.  Thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We thank you, Counsel.  

	Mr. O'Shea, do you want to add something?
MR. O'SHEA:
Not on the reply as such.  I would just like to add in relation to the problem of Maître Diagne.  Under the new -- I won't use the word "new"-- under the amended indictment, if it is to be accepted, the Prosecution case will be framed as a joint criminal enterprise.  It is therefore of great -- I should say, of greater concern to us, now that Maître Diagne must be well prepared for the Defence of Karemera.  If she is not, that will in fact, affect us.  And, therefore, I would invite the Tribunal to take very seriously, 
Mr. Karemera's rights in terms of Article 24(B).  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, you have the floor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I want to go back to the issue of the clarity of the status of the indictment and, once again, I renew my previous submission, that it is clear that the indictment that is in place is substantively and textually the indictment that was before the Court or that was in place, confirmed -- accepted rather, on the 21st of November 2001. 

The text of that indictment is the very same text that we have as a result of the Court's decision of the 8th of October 2003.  Every paragraph is the same; nothing has changed substantively.  The allegations are the same; it is the same indictment.  The Court's decision of the 8th of October 2003 took something away from that indictment.  It took away four counts.  That results in a disadvantage to the Prosecutor.  There is nothing that has changed from the perspective of the Defence in regard to the text that we have before the Court as an indictment.  It is the same text, the same allegations; nothing has changed.  The only difference is that the Prosecutor is disadvantaged because we cannot go forward on four counts.  

When we submitted an amended indictment and that amended indictment is dated the 26th, it was signed on the 26th of July 2003.  It was submitted in a motion in August of 2003.  That submission -- that amended indictment offered greater specificity and particularity to the charges that were already contained in the original indictment.  That amendment was rejected by this Trial Chamber.  As a consequence, the Prosecutor placed that additional specificity in a supplementary pre-trial brief.  That additional specificity was offered to the parties on the 13th of October 2003.  But by the time we got to October of 2003, we had yet additional information which supplements information that we had when we filed our amendment in August, and that additional information is what I was referring to in regard to Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  But that's an issue of whether a supplementary pre-trial brief can bring forward additional information.  It's not an issue of the indictment.  The indictment that the Court considered was an instrument that did not mention those additional allegations.  

So the issue that Mr. Roach was addressing may be an appropriate issue after the issue of the amendment itself, but it is not an issue that this Court needs to address in order to decide the issue of the amendment because that information came after the amendment, and that is the only distinction.  That is the only information that we are willing to concede actually introduces new charges, and that is the legal determination that has to be made by the Court.  

Where things stand right now, the issue is in the hands of the Court.  My submission, and I thankfully recognise the Court, is that the Court has asked us for our opinion on how it should proceed.  But the Appeals Chamber decision simply places the issue back in the hands of Trial Chamber III.  There is no requirement of additional submissions of any party including the Prosecutor.  The Court can decide right now, even before we leave this room to accept that indictment or not.  We do not need to make additional submissions.  I would prefer to do so because I would like to see included those new allegations against Mathieu Ngirumpatse in the amendment, but that is not required.  The Court can decide the issue of the amendment right now without consultation with any party.  

But going back to what Mr. Roach said, this is a matter of historical importance and things should be done in a manner that is clear and straightforward and on that point, I agree with him.  

The disadvantage that we have now, that we didn't have prior to the 27th of November, when we started trial, is that the trial has started.  We have witnesses in the safe house.  We are ready to proceed, and my concern is not so much the delay for the proceedings, it is the inconvenience to witnesses who have been put in a pipeline to come before this Trial Chamber.  

So while I agree that we do need to proceed cautiously and there should be some delay, that delay has to be defined.  We have to set the limits on the length of possible delay and that is why we are willing to proceed after meeting informally with the parties and after discussing this matter with the Trial Chamber.  I would request that the Trial Chamber wait at least until the 23rd of this month, it's Friday, to make its decision because that will give us an opportunity to meet and to discuss this issue with the Trial Chamber.  But it does not have to do so.  

The Trial Chamber can rule right now, and that's exactly what the Appeals Chamber has said in the last paragraph of its decision.  It does not suggest or anticipate that there would be additional motion practice on any party.  It simply states this: "the matter is remitted to the Trial Chamber for consideration of whether in light of the foregoing observations, the amended indictment is otherwise in compliance with Rule 50, and, if so, for the entry of an order amending the current indictment". 

We have made our submissions on the amended indictment.  The Defence -- each one of the Defence teams have already made their submissions on the issue of the amendment.  The Court can decide the issue by itself right now.  My submission is that it is not wise to go into another valley of extended motion practice on an amendment.  We would prefer, however, to discuss this and approach this issue in a reasonable manner.  

On that basis, I will conclude my remarks but I would urge the Court and the parties to look at the text of supplementary pre-trial brief.  

In the motion, in our response to Mr. Weyl's objection to that pre-trial brief, we clarified that there was a distinction between the supplementary pre-trial brief and the amended indictment and we specifically directed the Court and the parties to the new paragraphs that brought forth allegations against Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  That and the issue of joint criminal enterprise three are the only things that fundamentally distinguish the supplementary pre-trial brief from the original indictment of the 21st of November 2001.  And those are issues that we are willing to litigate on a point-by-point basis as witness testimony comes forward.  

So on that basis, I conclude my submission and I urge the Court to encourage the parties to resolve this issue or address this issue before we convene again to hear its decision on the matter.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
We shall take a break now and we shall resume the proceeding at 11:30.  Thank you.  So the hearing stands adjourned.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  

Considering the comments made by the parties, considering that the Prosecutor has made new observations concerning Witness GAF, the statements of GAF, which statements have not been disclosed either to the Defence or the Bench, considering that the Accused Karemera has changed counsel and that Miss Diagne was assigned to him two or three days ago to defend the Accused Karemera, the Trial Chamber decides that the Prosecutor should submit by 23 January 2004 the draft amendment of the indictment. 

The Defence should make its comments on the draft amended indictment by 26 January 2004.  

The Trial Chamber requests the parties to meet in the presence of Mr. O'Donnell in the course of this week, in order to harmonise their points of view. 

Consequently -- or, rather, accordingly, the Trial Chamber adjourns the proceedings until Wednesday, 28th January 2004 at 9 a.m.  The proceedings stand adjourned. 
	(Court adjourned at 1210H)
