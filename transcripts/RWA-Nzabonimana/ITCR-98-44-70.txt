MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Could the registry introduce the case coming before the Trial Chamber this morning, please.
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 15th of July 2003, for the continuation of the Prosecutor's closing arguments in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the Registrar.

May we have the appearance of the parties, starting with the Prosecution for the record please, this morning?
MS. OJEMENI:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial attorney.  I appear with Dorothée Marotine, case manager, and our legal assistant, Francis Kabwe, and Eric Husketh.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you, Learned Counsel.  May we also have the appearance of the Defence, please?
MR. HINDS: 
	Good morning, Your Honours.  Lennox Hinds representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor Bompaka, Ms. Juliette Chinaud and Emilien Dusabe who is the interpreter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.

Yes.  Professor Hinds, maybe you may have to change places if we are to see you.
MR. HINDS:
I made the comment --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
I made the comment yesterday.  In fact, I want to see you also.  Can you see her?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you can move there and Professor Bompaka, your colleague, moves, but, again, we won't see him as well.  So if you can move to that seat, we will certainly be able to see you and maybe you may also be able to see us.
MR. HINDS:
Is it possible to have those things removed?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Well, that's a difficult matter -- yes, please.  We see everybody else now.

Ms. Ojemeni, learned counsel for the Prosecution, will you please continue with your submissions?
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours, just to draw your attention to the paragraphs under the concise statement of facts in the indictment that I dealt with yesterday, but I didn't make references to them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Simply to say that, in addition to the three paragraphs I referred to yesterday in the indictment that I did adequately cover, paragraphs 5.4 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  Paragraph?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Five point four, 5.5 of the indictment.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, could we wait a minute until I get organised here?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
I am moving over and the Prosecutor is proceeding.
MS. OJEMENI: 
I am sorry; I didn't see you.
MR. HINDS:
I just want to make sure that I am on the same page.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Can you start again, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
Once more ,Your Honours, yesterday, I did refer to the paragraphs under page 8, titled, "Concise statement of facts, events in Ruhengeri préfecture", and I referred to 5.1, 5.2 -
MR. HINDS: 
Five point one.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Five point two, 5.3, and that was where I stopped, but I did cover in my submission 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9.  The other paragraphs, I need not refer to them, but the evidence is on record.

Your Honour, now -- like I said yesterday, I am now moving on to the alibi, the Defence case.  Your Honours, the Prosecutor submits that it has outlined all the atrocities committed by the Accused giving specific time, place and eyewitnesses' account of events of -- starting from 6th April to 14th April, and then on to July when the Accused left office and fled for -- from Rwanda.

The Defence contention is an alibi defence, essentially; that is, that the Accused was not present at the scenes of the crimes and was elsewhere at the times in question.

In pursuing their case, the Defence has sought to impugn the credibilities -- the credibility of Prosecution witnesses, but this cannot succeed.  Regarding this issue the following observations are pertinent.  The Defence has failed to show any motive -- Your Honour, I am sorry, I will take it again.

Regarding this issue, the following observations are pertinent.  One, the Defence alleges that all the Prosecution witnesses -- and I remind the Court that there were 12 of them, the thirteenth person was just an investigator from the Office of the Prosecutor, so I am dealing with twelve witnesses now.  According to the Defence, these 12 witnesses were lying when they testified to the Accused not only being present at the scene of the various crimes alleged, but participating and, in some cases, giving orders in furtherance of the crimes.  Your Honours, in this respect, you will recall the evidence given by the various people: GBB, GAO who had - GBB, who had the orders the Accused gave to the Interahamwes at the Byangabo market; GDO, who heard the Accused say to the Interahamwe, "Search for Tutsi women, rape them and kill them."  And I will stop there; the rest is on record.

To refresh the Court's mind, it is recalled that these 12 -- these were 12 different people, referring to the 12 -- I mean, witnesses now, that there are 12 different people of different occupations, different backgrounds, who had no link or relationship with one another.  Why should they team up to lie?  What is the motivation?  If someone is lying on oath, he must have a motive, and the Defence has failed to show any such motive, either common to all these Prosecution witnesses, or the motive for individual witness.
If, perhaps, the Accused were a highly-placed political or national figure, perhaps one could imagine powerful, political enemies who would have the interests and resources to organise all these 12 Prosecution witnesses to come and testify against him.  But guilty as he is in all the killings and atrocities committed in the communes of Mukingo, Nkuli, Kinigi, Kigombe of Ruhengeri, on 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 14th of April 1994, the fact remains that, at best, the Accused was a local figure, though important in his community, who I do not think will attract the kind of interest from powerful, political enemies who would have the resources and motivation to organise and finance such a scale of perjury

Furthermore, as regards the credibility of these Prosecution witnesses, Your Honour, attention is drawn to the fact that their testimony is most - is most cases, involved, not a mere sighting, but a detailed observation of the activities he was engaged in at the time, for example, making an inciting speech at Byangabo market, as testified, such as, "What are you waiting for to start work when others have finished work?  Go get dressed and start work", as testified by GAO and GBA; or "No Tutsis to survive at a roadblock"; distribution of weapons, as testified by GBV, GAO, GAB and GDD - thus, I am referring to distribution and procurement of weapons as well; or searching for Tutsi women to kill -- and rape - rape and kill, as testified by GDO; or searching for Tutsi survivors, as testified by GBH; or transporting Interahamwes, as testified by SEM, GBH, GBG, GBE, GDQ and GDF; and giving orders, which I have referred to earlier.

Your Honours, the following factors are important to this issue of the credibility of witnesses, of Prosecution witnesses.  Your Honour -- I crave your indulgence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
As regards alibi, the central point is that the Prosecution witnesses were not mistaken as to the identity of the Accused.  The identification of the Accused, both at the scenes of crime and in court, was positive.

At the crime scenes, Your Honours, the witnesses testified that it was daylight, it was during the day; and there was absolute daylight.  This means that the conditions were favourable for identification of the Accused as Juvénal Kajelijeli.

They testified that they have adequate time to observe him.  GBV, for instance, testified that he was about 50 metres away from where this discussion was going on.  Naturally, when somebody is giving an order you don't say it in a low voice.

GAO testified he was right in front of the Accused.

GDO testified that she had ample time.  She saw the Accused arrive first.  She was at elevation, saw the Accused, watched the Accused, saw the Accused again when the daughter was screaming, saw the Accused present when the daughter was being raped and she screamed.  Naturally, as a mother, she got up and saw what was happening.  She had ample time to observe him.

GDF also testified that she had ample time.  She was in her compound going to take food, well alert.

One thing common as well is that these -- GDO, GDF, they were wide alert, though GDO was in hiding, but she was pretty alert, and all these witnesses were alert.

GDQ, for instance, who saw him -- drove past his house, saw him very well.  The car was not in question.  All these witnesses testified the people saw him in the car.  GDQ, GDO, GDF, GBV, they all testified they knew the car, and it has since been established even by the Defence himself -- the Accused himself, that he was -- then he was riding a red Toyota car on which is written ESTB.  He was well identified by all these witnesses.  What's more, they knew him for a long time.

Your Honours, GBV had known the Accused since 1974.  They worked together at Busogo parish.  He was a gardener and the Accused was a carpenter.

GBE knew him right from 1970 and also testified to the fact that the Accused influenced his decision to leave MDR and actually issued him with a card of the MRND.  He knew him very well as his bourgmestre.

GDF also testified that she has known the Accused for a very long time, starting from when she was living with her aunt, and she used to go to the Accused's house on errands, and she also established that the aunt was not just a member of the commune, but was a friend and, as a matter of fact, the Accused's wife was -- is a godmother to the late child of the aunt.

GBG also testified that he knew the Accused as the bourgmestre and, as a matter of fact, also watched him when he came to -- identified him when he came to Munyamvano's house as the Accused, as Juvénal Kajelijeli.

SEM also testified that he knew the Accused well as a child.  And even the Accused has since corroborated that, that he knew the girl; he saw the girl once when she was a child.  And the -- SEM also testified as to how he met the Accused for the first time.  I need not go into that; it is in evidence.
GBH knew the Accused when he was born -- right from when he was born.  And we are talking of 50-something years ago.  He identified him and even spoke to him at the scene of the crime when he was searching for Rachel.  So he knew him, had ample time to see him.

GDO, I have already talked about.  GAO, of course, is a subordinate of the Accused.  GDD also testified, and yesterday I also dealt with GDD.

GAS who also testified also, though she was not at the scene of the crime, but she also identified the Accused in court.

Your Honours, as I have said earlier, all these Accused -- the eyewitnesses, the Prosecution witnesses were very much alert when they saw the Accused.

The Accused also was also well known and even a child knew him then, even the people in the school.  He testified to his being an executive secretary of the school.  So he was a well-known person; so there was no mistake as to identity.

The state of mind as well I've talked about.  Your Honours, as regards the issue of identity, it is not in doubt that all these witnesses identified him and there was no impediment whatsoever; nothing, no obstruction even for the people in hiding.  There was no obstruction whatsoever, and they took time to explain how they saw the Accused.

Now, Your Honours, the Prosecution submits that these details go to confirm that these people -- that is, the 12 witnesses, the eyewitnesses of the Prosecution who saw him at the scenes of crime -- actually did witness these events.

In this contest (sic), Your Honours, it perhaps necessary to comment on the point in Defence's closing brief, paragraph 5.  Sorry, Your Honour, it is not -- it's paragraph -- in a minute I will go - Your Honours, I sorry; I am still confused with this numbering -- the numbering of the pages.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are referring to the corrigendum brief?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes. Yes.  I am referring to paragraphs 105, 105.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 105.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, on the corrigendum.  And I will take my submission once again.  In this context, Your Honours, it is perhaps necessary to comment on the point in paragraph 105 of the Defence brief, where the Defence --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So that is page 17?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, page 17 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
-- where the Defence seeks to make capital out of the fact that the Prosecution did not call rebuttal witnesses.  I am surprised that my learned friend should be making this point since he was only too aware of the effort made by the Prosecution to call such witnesses, which efforts, unfortunately, were not allowed by the Court.

I draw your attention once more, Your Honours, to paragraph 5 of the Defence's closing brief at page 2.
MR. HINDS:
What page?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Page -- paragraph 5, page 2 of the closing brief filed by the Defence, and I would like to comment briefly on this point where the Defence -- in this paragraph, the Defence has sought to depict the Court as subject to external pressure, political pressure, particularly --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which paragraph, which paragraph is that? Oh, 5.  Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  Has Your Honour seen it?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Particularly from the Rwandan authorities.  This point is baseless because the Tribunal is governed by its own Statute and Rules of Procedure.  There is nothing whatsoever to indicate that the Judges of the Tribunal have not been discharging their responsibilities with due independence and impartiality.

Furthermore, Your Honours, my learned friend should know that this is a judicial court dealing with legal matters.  Any political issues he has or his client has should be raised in other more appropriate forums.

Turning now to substantive matters, the Defence case, in answer to the allegations against the Accused, is the defence of alibi, that he was not there where the crimes alleged were committed.  And to support this he paraded six so-called eyewitnesses, all of whom have purported to confirm the alibi.  Additionally, Your Honours, he paraded many others who took the stand to claim that they were present at the events and on the occasions in question, but they did not see the Accused.  In this regard, Your Honours will recall the evidence of RGM, MEM, LCF, TLA --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Slowly, Counsel; okay?
MS. OJEMENI:
RGM, M -- LCF, TLA, to mention a few -- MEM, to mention a few.  When we look at these alibi witnesses, we see that they are all people who have motive to lie on behalf of the Accused.

Your Honour, we refer to the first two, SMR and LMR, who are the wives, purported to be alibi witnesses, who barely saw their husband on the days in question.  They only saw their husbands, if they ever did, at home.  When he was out, they didn't know what else he was doing.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maybe, simply use the pseudonym and generalise.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honours, it is difficult.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, you can --
MS. OJEMENI:
I have to link up.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  You can draw the attention of the Trial Chamber by drawing on some generalised relations and you can see -- you can invite the Trial Chamber to see the actual details in the submissions, perhaps.
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay, Your Honour.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, in this case, we have no objection as to these witnesses.  We have no objection whatsoever.  That is from the side of the Defence as to these two witnesses.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, because in any case they were protected witnesses.  Okay.  In that case, you can go on.  Go on, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
We move on to his nephew, DMR2, DMR3 -

MR. PRESIDENT:
	Well, that one is --
MR. OJEMENI: 
That one is - do I use his nephew only?
MR. HINDS:
Counsel, I said as to those two witnesses, we have no objections.  All other witnesses are protected witnesses.  As to those two, we have no objection.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, we move on to his nephew and then we go on to JK312.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think what your colleague is saying that with regard to the other witnesses, who may also have some relations to -- or relations that may lead to possible identification, then use the pseudonym and you could say -- you can say they are generally related to the accused person without specifying, and then invite the Trial Chamber to go to see the actual relations, if at all, of that witness and the Accused.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, may I?  And just -- I am not going to get up to interrupt the Prosecutor's train of thoughts, but the transcript has all of that information in terms of the relationships et cetera.  So the Prosecutor can simply, say, use the pseudonyms and invite the Court to make the observation in terms of relationship.  There is no need to go any further as to -- besides the wives.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, go on, Counsel.  Make the point you wish to make and draw the attention of the Trial Chamber to whatever you want to have its attention drawn to, but bear that in mind, the question of identification of the -- of this other  protected witness.  Please go on.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, firstly, the Accused has many nephews.  As long as I don't mention the name of the Accused, would that be okay?  But I have since finished with this; so I am now moving on, but I do take the point the Court is making.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You can mention the pseudonym name, talk generally of the relations, and the particular aspect of that relationship can be found in the record.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, I move on to JK312.
MR. PRESIDENT:
J?
MS. OJEMENI:
JK312.

MR. PRESIDENT:
JK312, yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Who owed a debt of obligation to the Accused, and a fellow ideologist of the Accused.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Maybe before you come to this one, Counsel, you didn't give the pseudonym of the other person you were addressing before this one.
MS. OJEMENI:
DMR.
MR. PRESIDENT:
D?
MS. OJEMENI:
DMR.
MR. PRESIDENT:
DMR.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Go on.  You are addressing JK312.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, and I simply say that he owe (sic) a debt of obligation to the Accused and is a fellow ideologist of Hutu emancipation, as he has testified to this Court that he believed in that.  He is on the record.  Furthermore, JK312 testified to this Court that he had armed guards, but on this particular day of 7th April he suddenly realised that the armed guard was not enough and had to run to the Accused for assistance, and the Accused is not a soldier, neither had he ever been a soldier.

JK312 also testified that on that particular day he suddenly lost faith in the armed guards in front of his own house and, in the course of the fear, JK312 still found time, felt safe to go, to sneak out of his house and go to the Accused.  And to add credence to his story, when he was asked the question which had no relationship whatsoever with his identity, he mentioned that he could not respond in court in open session and sought for closed session.

Your Honours, this account of JK312 is really unbelievable.  It doesn't really make sense for somebody who was guarded, heavily guarded, as he said, by armed guards.  It is vague and evasive.  He was vague and evasive on most questions.  He admitted in evidence that he did not see any need to rely on the armed guards and that was why he had to go to the Accused to make arrangements for him.  If he had - if, indeed, he had armed guards and he made that arrangement, he should have been able to ask for reinforcement if he ever wanted.  There was simply no need to go to the Accused.  Even if he did -- let's assume that he did -- it still does not make sense how JK312 could have sneaked out of his house in the midst of all the commotions that he testified to, that he saw some boys running helter-skelter in front with machetes; he was able to sneak out to go to the Accused's house, as he testified, simply to further discuss what he had discussed on the phone, and then left his family in danger.  Your Honour, we submit that this is mere fabrication and should not be relied upon.  It should be discredited completely.

Your Honour, as for the other witnesses, the Tutsi, the other witnesses that the Defence paraded that I have referred to, who were equally there, who said -- testified that they were there when the -- and did not see the Accused at the sites, I will be making submissions on them later, but I am still on the issue of alibi.

It is worthy -- worth noting, Your Honours, that these alibi witnesses that I have referred to, there is not a single one who can be described as independent and lacking in motive to protect the Accused.  The Prosecution submits that these are unreliable witnesses whose testimony should be disregarded.

Your Honours, the Accused's alibi for the material days is that he was in various places elsewhere, on 7th.  He left the -- he was at home, received the visitors, including JK312, later on -- or before JK312 came, the sister came, on a morning when Rwanda was in a state of emergency, when Nkuli was boiling.  The sister left her house to the Accused's place simply to ask for school fees.  All the witnesses who came to testify on his behalf, including the Accused, testified to the fact that the schools were on Easter break, and one did not see the urgency for school fees on a day that the environment was so insecure.  Even if Hutus were not being killed, it doesn't make any sense.  It is not reasonable.  It doesn't make common sense for somebody to say that a sister left the house after the death of the president, to come to his house and ask for school fees.  Your Honours will recall that the Accused himself testified to the fact that he left the house only once, but on cross-examination he admitted that he saw the sister off.  So he crossed that gate twice.

Your Honours, according to the Accused, after receiving his visitors, he went to see the bourgmestre of Nkuli at about 9:00.  He came back to his house at 11:00 and relaxed.  He stayed with his family, while the second family could go to blazes, he didn't care, and he knew that Mukingo commune was on fire.  And we are talking about an important personality in Mukingo commune, a former bourgmestre.  He didn't care a hoot about his family.

If for any reason the Accused's life was in danger, as he claimed, and he made arrangement for another person to be guarded by the soldiers or to be ferried out of Nkuli commune to a safe place, why couldn't he guard himself up to Mukingo commune?  It doesn't make sense.  He could have made the same arrangement and then go and see his family and know what was going on, and go to see his subjects that he served so well that they decided, according to the Accused, to re-elect him.  Why didn't he do so?  It is all fabricated lies.
Then on the 8th the Accused left Nkuli.  He was at home, at peace.  Then at 12:30, he suddenly realised, "Oh, the coast is free, I could now go and see my second home".  And he left at 12:30, according to his testimony, and arrived at 12:45, but he felt there was need to go and see the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune because he didn't want to go to his house, and people would be scared or caused problems in the commune.  Did the Accused need to take permission from a bourgmestre to get to his house?  No, certainly not.  I can understand, "I went to the bourgmestre to find out what was happening in the commune", but not that, "I went to him because I didn't want him to feel that I was coming to alert the commune that the place was unsafe by taking my family".  That was -- that sounds unreasonable.  It doesn't make common sense at all.

Now, he went, saw the parents briefly, went to his house, now told the house, "Listen, my kids should be fetching water for these refugees; they shouldn't come out so that people will know that they are there".  Then the same wife who lived in their house, in the course of her testimony, stated, "Our kids did not know they were there".  It doesn't add up, Your Honours.

The Accused now left Rwinzovu and went to -- and went back to Nkuli and relaxed.  He didn't step out of his house; he went nowhere.  When people said they saw him somewhere, of course it wasn't him.  One can understand an Accused saying, "Oh, I went; I was around there, but I wasn't at the scene".  For instance, "On the 7th, I was there.  I was in Mukingo, but I wasn't where the crime scenes were".

Then one could say, yes, GDQ, who saw him drive past, saw him indeed, but he wasn't going to that crime site.  But for the Accused to say he never went to Mukingo on that particular day that people were being killed and he loved his subjects, he served his subjects very well, and they never -- it never occurred to him that this calls for time -- for duty.  If you are a responsible man, that was time for you to show how responsible you are.  He never went there.  He sat at home with his family.

Your Honours, on the 9th, according to the Accused, he never heard that the bourgmestre died, the previous day, after his visit; he never heard it.  He now heard it, and he prepared.  His life wasn't in danger anymore.  He took off and went to Mukingo commune.  He was there the whole day until after the burial.  What did he do?  He got back, sat down and watched video with his family.  Isn't that absurd?  Gee.

Your Honours, I refer you to page 73 of his testimony of 15th April.  The rest is history.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The transcript, eh?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, the transcript, Your Honour, on this particular issue of video.  And this was after the burial of his predecessor and his successor -- his successor and predecessor.  It was after the burial.  He didn't feel any pain about the loss, but he found time to watch a video with his family, just to add credence to his story.

Your Honour, on the 10th when he was supposed to be in Kinigi, of course, again, he was nowhere; he stayed home.  After visiting his brothers-in-law, the only place he went was to visit his brothers-in-law, who lost -- who died.  He went to visit the family with his wife and he was feeling so bad -- he felt so bad, he came back and watched video.  Page 73; again, he never left home.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of the transcripts, eh?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, of the transcripts.
MR. PRESIDENT:
English.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  Your Honour, let me correct myself, Your Honour; I think it was on the 10th he watched video --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MS. OJEMENI:
-- and never left home.  It was on the 10th that he watched video, and never left home.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So when you make reference to transcripts, since you are using English, you should complete, say, in English.
MS. OJEMENI:
In English, Your Honour.  Thank you, Your Honour.  In English. 15th April 2003.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
He never left.  Then he remembered all he did, the minutest details he did from that 8th up to 13th, then to the 14th.

On the 11th, which is not relevant but just for the purposes of my argument, Your Honours, he went to work.  He worked in his forest with his workers.  He supervised -- no, he went to supervise construction at Mukamira.  On the 12th, he was at a forest with his workers and returned home at 4:30.  He left home at 9:30 and was home till (sic) 4:30.

On the 13th, he want to Ruziga to inspect a new forest he had just bought.  All this while he never went to Mukingo, the nuns' house, the Busogo parish, Munyamvano house, to find out what actually happened.  He never did.  He just relied on what he was told.  He never did.

Then on the 14th, when he was supposed to be, again, at Mukingo, arranging how to send the reinforcement of the Interahamwes and arrange for weapons to go to Ruhengeri court of appeal and for the Interahamwes to go to the Ruhengeri court of appeal and join the other Interahamwes to eliminate the Tutsis taking refuge at the court of appeal, he then went to Kareba to inspect the forest he just bought.

Sorry, Your Honour, I think I am mixing up issues here because I have seen that on the 13th -- I am so sorry.  It was on the 13th he went to visit his in-law (sic) with his wife.  That was on the 13th and he came back at 4:00 p.m.  Then on the 14th was when he went to inspect the forest that he has just bought at Kareba, and he got back at 5:00 pm.  Here is a man who claimed that his life was in danger because of the RPF and he was walking around with no gun, as he testified; that he returned his gun.  He wasn't -- he wasn't walking with any armed guard, but he was free to enter the forest still from 9:30 till 4 p.m. with his workers, unarmed, yet his life was in danger.

Your Honours, on the 15th, he now heard about the killing on radio.  He never knew anything about it, and then he heard about other killings that occurred in Kigali and how the government moved their head office to Gitarama.

Your Honours, all these stories do not add up at all.  It doesn't make sense.

Your Honours, as regards the Accused's alibi itself, the Court will note that they are, in substance, the type that can be easily fabricated.  All the alibi deal with the Accused being at home, or his farm, or visiting his in-laws, or in very private places.  There is none that involves a public appearance that can be verified by a third -- by third parties, other than his relations, his friends.  One would have expected the Accused to have gone to hospital with a wife.  He would have gone to hospital on the day he said he was so tired he couldn't accompany the wife to hospital and he now allowed her to walk.

If RPF is against - or is after the Accused, his family will not be moving freely at all because if they can't find the Accused, they will find the family.  But here we heard testimonies as to how the family were just left unguarded.

Your Honour, there is no record -- or no third party to verify the story or to corroborate the Accused's alibi.  However, by contrast, the Prosecution witnesses are not talking about private meetings, but that the Accused's presence was in public places, was at public events, public places like Byangabo arket, roadblocks, Busogo parish, Rwankeli cellule, Munyemvano house; that is the public, because there were well over 100 and something people in there on the date in question, all of which are verifiable if they were all public places and, therefore, less likely to be lied about.

Your Honours, let's pause for a minute and examine the Accused's testimony.  He talked about the RPF allegation, his movements on these specific dates of 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 14th.  And in the light of the Prosecution's case, they do not stand common sense.  There -- it is incredible.  It is rather incredible.

It should further be noted that the Accused, whom the evidence of the Prosecution and Defence witnesses show to have been a very active person featuring regularly in political and communal activities of Mukingo commune, Nkuli commune, who indeed testified that he was the executive secretary of a popular school known as ESTB in Busogo secteur in Mukingo commune, and he testified that he had the sole prerogative to use that car simply because he was executive secretary and his job entailed his going to the school daily to supervise the school.

He was also their treasurer -- executive treasurer, rather, Your Honour.  He was the executive treasurer and his job involved going to the school daily to supervise the school.  All of a sudden, he fizzled out of activities on these sudden critical days in question.  He is nowhere to be seen.  According to him, Your Honours, is it not more probable than not that he was in fact in the public places where such import, Your Honour -- important events were taking place at the times alleged?

The same goes with his story about a gun, that he had no gun; he returned it, yet he could arrange for an army of soldiers to ferry JK312 out of Nkuli.  He could not make -- or avail himself of the same facility to move around or even go and inspect the family, to see the family so as to ascertain their condition.  He was walking around without a gun.

The allegation of being threatened by the RPF is just a mere facade, Your Honour.  There is no iota of truth in it.

Your Honour, even as regards the alibi, it seems a bit difficult to believe that such a person is now spending his time watching video with his family, or too tired not to leave home.  All this seems out of character and, if the Accused is to be believed, suggests that he had suddenly changed his nature and just for those critical days.

Your Honours, as we have just been discussing, the Accused has interposed a defence of alibi to the allegations against him.  It follows, therefore, that if, in fact, Your Honours believe any of the Prosecution witnesses who identified him at the scene of crime, you must believe the witness testimony that Joseph -- Juvénal Kajelijeli did do those things, to no other defence, and no other defence is admissible in such a case.  Yes, just a minute, Your Honours.  I am nearing the end, Your Honours.  So sorry, Your Honours.

Your Honours, it is important to recall that, in addition to such counts as genocide, extermination, or rape, murder as well, the Accused is standing trial for conspiracy, complicity to commit genocide, all of which can be committed without the Accused being at the scene of the killings or rape.  This means that the alibi defence of the Accused is not relevant to these counts.  As it so happens the Prosecution had adduced ample evidence to support these charges.

Your Honours, I will now turn to -- I have finished.  I have come to the end of my alibi, and I move on to other defences adduced by the Defence.  I will briefly touch on what I called yesterday as pass back defence yesterday, which I will elaborate with the order giving -- that RGM testified was given by a lieutenant on the 7th of April.  He merely -- because of the Prosecution's case that the Accused gave the order to kill the Tutsis.  The Defence now came up with a story: yes, there was an order indeed, but it wasn't the Accused who gave the order; it was the lieutenant.  That is now generally commonly known as the defence of pass -- pass back defence.

Your Honours, it wasn't only RGM who testified to that fact; MLCF, TLA also testified to the fact.  Your Honours, the next -- let's look at RGM's testimony briefly.  RGM is a confessed accomplice, and we have credible, independent evidence from the Prosecution witnesses contradicting his evidence that, Joseph - sorry, excuse me, that Juvénal Kajelijeli was not at the crime site on the 7th of April 1994.  This, his testimony in the light of the Prosecution witnesses does not hold any water.  It is not credible, and he has an interest to protect as an accomplice.  He definitely has to protect his leader.

We also -- likewise, RGM's testimony regarding Interahamwe.  When he was asked the question concerning the Accused's membership or role with Interahamwe, he simply said, "I did not know what role the Accused had to play with Interahamwe".  Of course, that sentence alone shows that he hid a lot within it, on the face of that sentence.  He was vague and evasive.  He had to hide the fact that the Accused who indeed was his leader, was not.

We take, for instance, the evidence again of MEM.  We know the position of MEM in Mukingo commune.  Since Your Honours said I shouldn't dwell on relationships, but I will simply put it at that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We know.  I think the record is clearly -- brings that out.
MS. OJEMENI:
Even when he was asked a simple question as to the location of the Accused's house or home in Rwinzovu cellule, he suddenly could not remember, but he remembered every other thing; he suddenly could not remember.  But he did say that the Accused was no longer an active member of the MRND when he was in office, but he went further to say that people who held offices kept their membership, but it was not active, even though we don't support that.  The Prosecution does not support that.  That is not the Prosecution's case, but at least he did say that the Accused was a member of MRND, but not an active member.  But the fact that MEM, such a highly-placed man, very close to the Accused, could not at that point tell the truth, simple truth, of the location of the Accused's house shows that MEM is a very unreliable witness.

I also draw the Court's attention to the Accused -- or Defence position that MEM was bourgmestre for seven days; it was just to cover up the seven days that the witnesses testified that the Accused was in charge immediately after the death of Harerimana, the bourgmestre, that he took charge of Mukingo commune as a de facto bourgmestre.  That was just to cover up.

And Your Honours will recall that when the Accused was arrested, the transcript that was read into record, which is now evidence of this Court, that the Accused testified to the fact that Semahane, Felicien, was the bourgmestre.  This shows the length that the Defence can go to make a score -- to make a point or to defend themselves -- to defend the Accused.  And it is in evidence, many witnesses testified, even the Defence, to the effect that Semahane was the bourgmestre immediately after, at least acted for a while.  But, really, the person in charge was the Accused, but the law provided for the assistant bourgmestre to step into the shoes of the bourgmestre in any lacuna.

The same goes for the story of trees.  Your Honours will recall P -- Exhibit P7, photo 24.  It is in evidence that the scene that appears on that photograph is not the entire Byangabo trading centre.  But each witness, Defence witness, tried to identify that tree as a tree where the bourgmestre -- MEM was when, according to them, the youths gathered there to demand that he allow them to go and revenge the death of Habyarimana.  It's all a rehearsed story; it is all rehearsed.  So all these witnesses will say - MEN, in particular, did say, when he looked at that picture, he said, "These places have changed.  Is that a store?", which, in effect, shows that he was not even sure, but he still came back and identified that tree.

MS. OJEMENI:
Likewise RGM -- RGM, in cross now denied, but initially he was adamant that at that tree, that's where he saw MEM.  The issue of the tree -- the evidence so far given by the Defence on that tree, Your Honours, the Prosecution submits that is unreliable.  It is all fabricated story.  It is a fabricated lie.  That is also in evidence that that was not the only tree standing in Byangabo.  

MLCF also testified to that fact.  Even on the face of the photograph, there are other trees, similar trees, but everybody - all pointed as -- from the Defence side go to that tree.  It is a fabricated lie, 
Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What exhibit are you referring to, Counsel?   
MS. OJEMENI:
It is a tree that appeared on photo 24 of exhibit -- of Prosecution Exhibit P7. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Go on, Counsel.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, the evidence that I wish to consider, again tendered by the Defence, is that of FMB.  The Prosecution urges the Trial Chamber to disregard this evidence on the grounds that, one, it's hearsay.  The witness admitted that he was not at the scene of the crime on the 10th.  His evidence was merely on roadblocks.  It was the same proposition that the Defence made in respect of Rukoma, when in cross the Defence challenged GDO about free movement on the movement of cars in Rukoma.  And according to them, it was an area also under RPF, the buffer zone.  And the Accused, because of the roadblocks, couldn't have also entered the area, although finally they did not proceed with this defence.  

But then as regards Kinigi, they produced FMB to disprove the fact that it was not easy for the Accused to move into Susa at the material time, particularly the 10th.  And Your Honours must have observed how the witness started giving an account of 7th, it was possible; of 8th, it was possible.  All of a sudden on the 10th it was no longer possible because of the signals he received.  Your Honours, we submit it is a fabricated lie.  When you compare the hearsay evidence and the direct evidence, 
Your Honours, of course direct evidence is more probative of the truth.  

GDF, also at least to a certain extent, did give evidence on the issue of roadblocks.  And like I said yesterday, FMB also admitted in evidence that it was possible to leave those routes where he had identified roadblocks, that one could also use another route to enter Kinigi.  So it is quite possible that somebody -- the Accused could have gone through, assuming, let's believe, that is assuming the Prosecution believes that it is quite possible, he did not pass through that road; there was another road.  But the Prosecution's case is this, which has been established, that the Accused did in fact go to Susa as testified by GDF.  

Your Honours, the next witness is the expert.  Your Honours, the Defence witness FXB was called as an expert.  This witness was neither a historian nor political analyst, but, rather, a self-described mere observer of the Rwandan national scene.  He never qualified as an expert before, see pages 2 and 5 of transcript of 8th April 2003.  His testimony was characterised by consistent bias and lack of scholarly foundation.

He incredibly testified that no group was dominating the other in 1994, nor was there such an ideology.  Other instances, Your Honours, transcript of 8th April 2003, pages 17 to 18 of the English transcripts -- Your Honours, I am referring to English transcripts, making reference to the English transcript as I don't speak French.  He said that there was no ideology which preached the domination of one group over the other since there was no dominant group, and the existing ideology at the time preached equality.  That's the ideology then preached, equality.  But when asked how he arrived at this conclusion, he said he used his observation and reading political party manifestos and a book by Latcher (phonetic) -- what -- an expert?  

On pages 22 to 23, he stated that RPF launched the 1990 attack.  Even Gihanga, the concept of monarchy had been put off indefinitely.  Yes, when asked why put off indefinitely, he stated: "I am totally unable to explain that to you."  

Likewise on page 24, his conclusion on the objective of the RPF was shown by the Prosecution to have no basis whatsoever as an expert.  I would also draw Your Honours attention to page 25 of the transcript of 8th April 2003.  On page 3 of his expert report, this reference was made to page 3 of his expert report which mentions earlier the killing of more than 100,000 by RPF.  The RPF played a role in the killing after 6th April.  He stated -- he merely -- when asked for the source of this figure of a 100,000 that he claimed was killed by RPF, he merely referred to James Gasana's testimony before the French parliamentary committee but doesn't quote a direct source, doesn't know where Gasana got his figure from; he stated so.  And also doesn't know how many Tutsis and how many Hutus were killed.  

On pages 27 to 29 of the same transcript, he said the Gahima myth -- the Gahanga myth -- sorry, the Gihanga myth was carefully prepared but doesn't give source or date of creation of the preparation; he did not.   

I also refer to pages 33 to 35 of the same transcript where he stated Tutsis thought Hutus were inferior.  "I wouldn't marry Hutus;" this was a result of domination, but never mentions Hutu military officers were allowed to marry Tutsi women prior to 1990.  And he says again that this was because there was no official source for this, even though he heard that it was stated.  Then he went on to say in the case of military officers, it was an isolated case in society.  Here is an expert testifying.  This witness obviously, Your Honour, is clearly a Habyarimana regime apologist.

On page 36, he went on to suggest that showing what happened only against Hutus by Tutsis is justified.  He even suggested that because he is of the opinion that you do not have to give the other side's story because there are others present there.  

On page 43, again he explains Kwihitura as Hutu crossing over to Tutsi to become accepted as member of Tutsi, even though Hutu.  But when asked whether Tutsi had to change their identity to be Hutu in order to escape being killed by Interahamwes or soldiers, he replied: "I am not aware of that.  I don't know those details".  

On pages 55 to 58, he analysed disparity in education of Hutus and Tutsis in the '80s, but does not do so in the '90s.  He has only limited to '80s, and then says he doesn't have the figures and would not -- "I was not in the same position to give testimony on the '90s".  And when asked about the source, he had no source.  He deliberately did not or chose not to discuss or examine 1990 to 1994, because that is the relevant part, and the testimony clearly shows what the position is, but this expert did not consider it necessary to analyse the position of -- or the disparity in education in the '90s, which would have at least given the Court -- which the Court would have benefited from in arriving at whatever determination or conclusion that it would be making at the end of the day, and this is an expert that the Court would have benefited from. 

Your Honours, I refer you once more to his account on page 69 to 70 where he says in 1990 there was attack on Ruhengeri, but gives no source as to that.  And then he says he doesn't really know.  He says he doesn't know really, that he only heard about the attack.

When asked about arrests, he couldn't give sources that he mentioned.  He couldn't give sources or the figures he used in his report.  He couldn't give the source.  Likewise, most times he would say he heard it from official media, when we all know what the media is capable of doing.  The account of issues on the media is not full proof of the issues or the events.  

As to other events occurring in Rwanda, he couldn't also substantiate them, and I refer Your Honours to page 12 of 9th April 2003, English transcript.  I refer also to page 75 of the same transcript, which relates to pages 19 to 20.  He gave a figure of people killed in inter-ethnic tensions in Rwanda.  Then when asked where he got these figures, he mentioned again James Gasana and his book.  The same goes for page 18; on the same issue, he said he concentrated his report as an extremist Tutsi publication but not as an extremist Hutu, and these are on the interrelation ethnic media.  

Your Honours, I have made my submissions and these are my reasons why his evidence -- FXB's evidence should be rejected in its entirety.  

Your Honour, I will now come to the handwriting expert.  Your Honour, I urge you to disregard his report on these grounds:  One, the Prosecution was denied the right to cross-examine him as to his expertise and the methodology adopted before arriving at the conclusion.  There is no evidence before Your Honours to determine the authorship of these documents, that is Exhibit A, D, F, Defence Exhibit A, D to F.  It is indeed -- it is true that GAO admitted in evidence that he met -- that those exhibits were -- or documents, more or less, were his, but here is a man who is illiterate.  He can't read nor write in his mother tongue, in his own language.  He was right there while he was still in the witness box that he suddenly realised that the thumbprints were not his.  This same witness had told the Court that his testimony was not written by him, that it was written by RGM.  We know the Rwandan culture, that the Rwandans are loyalists.  At that material time, the question of 1994, their bosses, especially the Interahamwe, which is like a secret, of course, they were well respected by their subordinates.  And it was for the same reason that he called on their leader who could write for solidarity, but unfortunately, little did he know that those documents will come before the Court.  But he did say -- he did admit the first three, A to C, but D to F, he realised that they were not his thumbprints.  And these experts -- the expert was not called for us to cross-examine him.  It could have been anybody.  It could have been anybody that would give that report.  We have seen an expert; FXB is an expert.  We have just seen one.  The Prosecution was denied that right to cross-examine this expert, to throw more light on who this so-called expert really is.  

Your Honour, GAO was an insider or, rather, is an insider of what happened in Mukingo commune as an Interahamwe.  He named all the functionaries that were eventually confirmed by the Defence in their evidence.  He mentioned a lot of things that eventually the Defence witnesses confirmed.  He talked about the bar which was later confirmed, Isimbi bar of the Accused, Juvénal Kajelijeli.  He talked about Isimbi being their headquarters, which even though denied by the Defence, is still there.  Many Prosecution witnesses have since confirmed, and it is not in doubt that Isimbi building is or was located in Byangabo trading centre.  He named the Accused.  He identified everything, also giving factors that should also be considered when Your Honours are judging some of these -- I mean, judging this case.  

Your Honour, you watched his demeanour in Court.  It will assist Your Honours to arrive to a fair conclusion on this issue of -- on the decision on this issue.  

We urge you to believe GAO, on the account of this exhibit that they are really not his.  What you have before you is hearsay which, under the Rules of this Tribunal, needs corroboration.  There is no corroboration on this same issue before Your Honours.  

Your Honours, I will quickly move to the -- yesterday I dealt with the allegation that ACM contradicted GBG in her testimony, and I said they must have seen the scenes from different locations of the building -- of the compound, rather, and as ample evidence given by ACM and GAS as to the compound, the description of the compound and the various buildings within the compound.  

And secondly, in their testimony they never at any point in time, referring to ACM and GBG, mentioned that they were coming out from the same house or that they were in the same compound or the same part of the compound.  And it is common knowledge that two people could see -- witness an event but will not give an exact account of that event.  It all depends on what the mind remembers.  And we are talking of an event that happened eight years down the line.  Human memories are not computers, they don't act as computers and they are bound to fail, but an event of that nature can never be forgotten by anybody who witnessed it.  You might not remember the minute details, but it can never be forgotten.  

We do know that sight and memory do fail human beings, but for this particular occasion, it was an event that nobody would forget, particularly young people, youths.  One thing is certain, and that is that the Accused was there on the 7th; he was at Munyemvano compound.  And the Defence allegations that ACM contradicts GBV or GBV contradicts ACM should be disregarded.  We submit that the evidence of these witnesses ACM and GBG are credible.  

Your Honours, one last thing which is the inconsistency raised by the Defence.  We have in our closing brief made submission on that, and I refer Your Honours to pages 61, 62 of the closing brief -- of our closing brief, particularly paragraphs 301 to 304. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
304. 
MS. OJEMENI:
That is the submission of the Prosecution in respect of the inconsistency in statements, and paragraphs 28 to 61 -- sorry, paragraphs 288.  I am referring to the closing brief, Your Honour, chapter 4 of the closing brief, paragraphs 288 to 308 in with respect of the defence as well as the Defence case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what do these paragraphs refers to?  On which issue? 
MS. OJEMENI:
That is the defence case.  In addition to my submission this morning, I am referring to -- drawing the Court's attention to the Defence case in our brief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, we have already dealt with the Accused.  Another defence that he put up, which is his membership, he defended that he was -- he denied the fact that he was a member of MRND.  I have since dealt with it yesterday.  And I have also dealt with the relationship between the Accused and Joseph Nzirorera, which he denied as well.  

And the last one is the sentencing, Your Honour, and our submission is represented in chapter 5 of our brief, paragraphs 309.
MR. PRESIDENT:
309, yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
To 317.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Three-one-seven. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, that marks the end of my submission. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Learned Counsel.  Thank you very much, Learned Counsel for the Prosecution.  And this marks the end of Prosecution's closing arguments.  

We will take a break for 25 minutes, that is, we'll resume at a quarter past 11.  We have something to do, a small thing to do during these few minutes, and when we come back we will hear the closing argument of the Defence.  So until a quarter past 11, these proceedings stand adjourned. 
	(Court recessed from 1050H to 1130H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  Sorry, we are a bit late, we had something, some of us, to address before coming back dealing with other issues.  

So we will start the oral submission of the Defence.  Professor Hinds, please. 

MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Just before we begin, I would like to make an application to the Chamber.  
First of all, I anticipate that I would be going until eleven o'clock tomorrow but not nonstop; that is, I will take a full day today as was set forth in the scheduling order.  But with respect to Appendix 3 submitted by the Prosecution, on our initial view of the document we do not see any new witnesses being introduced, and so therefore, we will not make any application with respect to exclusion of the document.  However, we are making an application that the Defence be allowed to submit a written response to it, because what the Prosecution has done with respect to each of the counts, they have added new witnesses since we filed our brief.  And our brief that we filed was in response to the brief that they filed.  They have now added new witnesses and taken off some witnesses with respect to each of the counts.  And I think in fairness, the Defence would like to comment in table form, just as they have with respect to Appendix 3.  And so we are making an application that we be allowed to submit our response in paper to this Court by Friday, the end of the day Friday.  We are still analysing each of the counts. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am rather surprised that my learned friend is making this application because in the first instance, he knows his case, and the Prosecution knows its case as well.  What we basically don't like, I told the Court yesterday, was just to assist the Court.  

May I draw Your Honours' attention to the Cyangugu case.  Both Prosecution and Defence filed their briefs same day.  We haven't done anything new.  What is in that record is in the transcript.  If my learned friend ever deemed it necessary to particularise or to use the entire transcript or draw the Court's attention to the entire transcript as regards his case, he could have done it.  He doesn't really need more time than he has been given.  If anything, he caused this delay in these proceedings -- or in fact, what I mean is I would have finished my submission yesterday.  Even if I intended to read into the record that particular document, I would have finished it yesterday.  

So, we oppose the Defence's application to be given time up to Friday to file additional documents.  They had ample time to address this issue in their response.  I was given a corrigendum yesterday, and I still responded to their case.  I do not see why my learned friend should ask for more time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Professor.  Thank you, Learned Counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the Prosecutor is suggesting that the transcript record speaks for itself, and so, therefore, there isn't any need for any submissions, but that is patently -- it doesn't make any sense.  
The Court is asking for assistance with respect to the issues, and that is why the Court has asked for each side to present a brief in addition to oral argument.  We could just simply stand up and say we refer the Court to the transcripts, but that would not particularly be helpful.  

The Prosecution now, with respect to Appendix 3, have set out in each of the counts particular witnesses that they say support their theory of their case.  They have done so in addition to their original brief that they filed and a corrigendum that they filed.  

Now, the Defence has a right to respond to that.  We responded to their brief.  They now have proceeded and they have added additional witnesses to make the point.  If they had done that even yesterday, we would have been entitled, with respect, to rebuttal with respect to that.  So the point is that if there is something new that is being added, the Court should have an opportunity to have both sides fully ventilate the issues so that the Court would have it before them.  It isn't a matter of holding back some information and preventing the other side from making a proper response.  What we are interested in here is a fair trial and justice. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned Counsel.

These are the views and the decision of the Trial Chamber:  One, we think the issues raised could be in the Appendix 3, could also be addressed in the oral submissions that the Defence is going to make touching on this issue, but if the Defence feels that they need to go further and file a document in response to a schedule Annex 3, they can do so, but that document must be done and be filed with the Trial Chamber by 11:30 in the morning.  That is, when the proceeding comes to an end, everything should be in, and thereafter, it will be for the Trial Chamber in terms -- everything that needs to be done in terms of Rule 87 must be done by the time we come out of -- we reach the end of these oral arguments.  And thereafter, of course, the Trial Chamber will retire for deliberation.

So if there is any document to be filed, to be prepared in furtherance of any argument that is going to be addressed on this particular aspect, then it must be done by or within the time frame of the submissions of the Defence, which according to Learned Counsel, has indicated will be done by 11:30 in the morning.  So preferably, the documents should be filed by nine, but at least before the submissions are ended of the Defence.  The document, as an illustration, should by then have been filed into the trial record of this Chamber.  Thank you.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  May I continue?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may continue. 
MR. HINDS:
May it please the Court, Judge Sekule, Judge Ramaroson, Judge Maqutu, Ms. Ojemeni, Mr. Kajelijeli, my colleagues at the Defence team.  Your Honours, it has been four years and five months since I travelled from New York to Arusha to represent and defend Mr. Kajelijeli.  It has been just over two years since we have been before this panel, hearing evidence and testimony in this case.  We have come a long way.  There have been 42 witnesses, thousands of pages of transcripts.  

At this stage of the proceedings, the Defence and the Prosecutor has filed with the Chamber our closing briefs.  Therefore, as far as the Defence is concerned, we are not going to take time to go over page by page of this brief, but we will highlight portions of the brief and the evidence that has been adduced at this trial.  

We have challenged every allegation made by the Prosecution in their case in-chief.  And so our defence is not only an alibi defence, we have challenged every witness, every allegation, and we contend the Prosecutor simply have not met their burden of proof.  

Yes, we have entered an alibi defence.  We entered an alibi defence because we felt that we should, and Mr. Kajelijeli wanted to explain where he was.  What he said in the year 2003, he said five years before, nothing different.  Nothing different.  The agents of the ICTR were in Cotonou, Benin and they said, "Where were you?"  It's all on tape, so there is no recent fabrication.  

If there is an allegation with respect to each one of you who is sitting here in this courtroom with respect to events that occurred at 1 a.m. this morning, who would you call as an alibi witness if you happen to have someone in bed with you?  It would be the person who is on the next pillow, whether or not that person happens to be someone you wanted to in fact identify.  You do not create the individuals, it is whoever was there.  So Mr. Kajelijeli in that context five years ago said to agents of the ICTR, which was recorded on tape and played into the record, what he said to you.

Your Honours are eminent jurists, and, therefore, I will not attempt to lecture you on the law.  We have set forth our legal arguments in our brief.  We have set forth our analysis with respect to criminal law and international humanitarian law, and the brief stands on its own feet, and we know Your Honours would seek reference to it as you deem fit.  But Your Honours, I would like you to permit me to make references to just two principles, which are basic principles and , I will not dwell on them very long, but I want to raise those issues in the context of the Prosecutor's oral submissions, and that is on the question of burden of proof.  

The burden is not on the Defence.  Mr. Kajelijeli has no burden in this Court.  The burden of proof is on the Prosecutor.  She has the burden to prove each and every element of the case beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.  It isn't what is more probable or not, or may be, or it's quite possible.  That is not the test.  The test is, do you prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt?  And that burden never shifts, it remains on the Prosecution's shoulders.  The Prosecution has a burden of proving Mr. Kajelijeli's guilt, so they say, beyond a reasonable doubt.  

Now what I am saying, Your Honours, you know very well is not evidence.  What the Prosecution has said in her oral is not evidence.  All we are doing is attempting to highlight, as we see it, the evidence so that the Court can make its findings.  The Court -- unlike a lay jury, this Court is taking copious notes, and I have been taking copious notes; the transcript records are there.  But what we both on the Defence side and the Prosecution side must adhere to is faithfulness, honesty to the record.  We cannot be careless in statements that we make.  And so, therefore, the Defence, before we get into our analysis of the evidence, we would like to briefly highlight examples of distortions, mischaracterisations, or perhaps just simple forgetfulness or carelessness on the Prosecutor's case by the proof that the Prosecutor said to you within the last 24 hours when she was on her feet.

MR. HINDS:
We raise this only, Your Honours, in the context that we need to be vigilant.  We need to be vigilant as we look at the evidence and not just simply accept the Prosecution's allegations.  We must review and look at the evidence carefully.

The Prosecutor said to you, and she cited Exhibit 32 and Exhibit 33, and she said, "We would like to show " - "we would bring to the attention of the Trial Chamber, that Exhibit 32 and Exhibit 33 shows that - the close linkage between Kajelijeli and Nzirorera.  And it shows that Kajelijeli maintained the same bank account with Nzirorera in Cotonou, Benin."

I listened to that; I said maybe it is true.  Last night I went to the transcript -- went to our document.  What does Exhibit 32 and Exhibit 33 show?  Exhibit 32 and Exhibit 33 shows two documents that in no way reflect that reality.  Those two documents are simply two documents that establish the fact that Kajelijeli had written a note indicating the names of his bank accounts.

Those who back -- 32 and 33 stands for and the Court has those documents in exhibits.  They have nothing to do with Nzirorera.  They don't even mention Nzirorera's name.  

Now, that may have been inadvertence; it may have been simply carelessness.  But then, again, the Prosecutor said, again dealing with the closeness of Nzirorera and Kajelijeli -- why that is important, that is for them to say -- but they pointed out that Witness GBV -- and they cited July 17th, the year 2000, at page 38, described Nzirorera as a minister.

We looked at July 17, year 2001, page 38, there is no testimony of GBV.  We said, well, maybe that is a mistake.  We again looked at another reference concerning Nzirorera -- concerning Kajelijeli and Nzirorera being seen quite often together.  Again, it was quoted as GBV, July 9th, 2001, page 68. The Witness never testified on the 9th either.  We said, okay, maybe that is mistake.  We then looked at another reference; GBH, July 17th, 2001, page 106:  "Kajelijeli and Nzirorera walked as one." Prosecutor said, "Even as husband and wife is close."  Again, we looked at that page, there was no such reference.  The Prosecutor made an allegation that RGM said he knifed Rukara.  We looked throughout the testimony; not a single statement to that effect.  RGM said Musafiri killed Lucien with a knife, and that is his testimony of November 18th, 2002, at line 23.

Why am I mentioning these things?  Neither I, as an officer of the Court, nor the Prosecutor can simply make statements, having people writing notes down, if they are not at least reasonably accurate, and perhaps even subject to interpretation based upon our view of the evidence.
It is not proper just to carelessly make statements and references that are not in the record.  There was a statement with respect to Kajelijeli when being asked about Tutsis on the technical committee.  Prosecutor claims that Kajelijeli couldn't think of anyone, but he came up with one name.  It is simply not true in the testimony, as is shown in April 23rd, 2001, pages 41 and 42.  And I am making these references because it is important as we stand here, what we say must have some credence.

Kajelijeli, out of a 10 person committee, in fact, indicated that there were two of them; two individuals, and he put their names there.  I don't have to take the time to read them, but I am giving you the reference in the transcript.

Allegation that MEM -- just most recent comment made, MEM could not remember where Kajelijeli lived.  Again, complete mischaracterisation of the record.  The Court now looks at MEM's testimony of November 25, 2002, page 74, lines 7 to 14, he gives the distance between Kajelijeli's house and the parish.  He is then asked a question on the same day, page 77 lines 28 to 29: "What cellule does he live in?"  He said, "I can't remember the cellule, but I know the secteur is Rwinzovu."
Again, if we are just to take the Prosecutor's characterisation, we are left with a distortion, mischarectarisation.

Now, concerning the election, as to whether or not Kajelijeli was elected,  I draw the Trial Chamber's attention to paragraph -- withdrawn.  I draw the Trial Chamber's attention to gaps -- GAP's  testimony.  GAP testified that he participated in the election of Kajelijeli.  It is in his testimony on December 4th, 2000, page 68, lines 1 through 8.  He pointed out when asked that Kajelijeli -- he confirmed that Kajelijeli was elected.  He said, "I participated."  He named the people who came in first, second and third.  The Prosecution knows that.  GAP is not our witness; he is their witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the reference, again, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
That is December, 4th --
MR. PRESIDENT:
December 4th.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
-- page 2001.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page?
PROFESSOR HINDS:
I am sorry, December 4th, 2001, page 68, lines 1 through 8 in the French version. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 68 -- French version, okay.  These are transcripts, I suppose?
MR. HINDS:
Those are transcripts, our records, Your Honour, that I am referring you to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Learned Counsel, you did give some references before this one.  Were they in English or French?
MR. HINDS:
Those were in English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, whenever you make any reference, please indicate.
MR. HINDS:
Let me also give you the English reference with respect to GAP, and in all of my references from here on, it will be in English, unless I say to the contrary.  All right.  Let me give you the English reference which is in respect of GAP:  December 4th, 2001, lines 3 through to 12.  All right?  And, page 64, let me just read it into the record, the answer of GAP:  "Counsel, let me tell you that at the time of the elections, it was Kajelijeli who came in the first place, followed by Emmanuel Gaba and Semahani.  But he is the person who was supervising the elections, being a member of the MRND, declared that Semahani should act in the interim, pending when the ministry of the interior have confirmed and alluded to him a week later confirming  Kajelijeli, who came first in the elections."  Now, that is at page 64 of the English version, and from lines 3 to 12.

Now, there was some allegations concerning Kajelijeli's education.  I would like to refer the Trial Chamber to our closing brief at paragraphs 121 and that going to 123.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are addressing the corrigendum closing brief?
MR. HINDS:
This is a corrigendum of the Defence, paragraphs 121 to 123, because what the Prosecutor has said in her oral arguments, in fact, is what she said in her brief, and the basic argument is that Kajelijeli, because he did not have higher education, that is, beyond the secondary school level, simply did not have the qualifications to be the bourgmestre.

Now, the Court is quite familiar with Kajelijeli's testimony, and Kajelijeli testified on April 14th, 2003, page 4, lines 19 to 28, and he talked about his education.  The Prosecution have not set forth any qualifications for bourgmestre, whether or not they were certain qualifications that Kajelijeli should have had that he didn't have.  But the record on the testimony in this case is that Kajelijeli laid out his accomplishments and what he did in his prior positions, and that was in April 16th, 2003, page 51, lines 3 to 19.  But, furthermore, Kajelijeli laid out his accomplishments while being bourgmestre, and that is set forth fully in the record.  So those are just some brief comments I am making, Your Honour, with respect to characterisation of the evidence.

Your Honours would recall what I said two years ago at my opening statement.  What I said then I repeat now, because it is as true now as it was then.  Why is Juvènal Kajelijeli sitting in the Defendant's box?  Why?  Kajelijeli was arrested simply because he was in the house of Nzirorera.  We never said that he wasn't there, that's where he was.  And the Prosecutor laid out their reasons for the arrest of Kajelijeli, and at that time they told both this Tribunal and they told the Benin authorities that they had information that Kajelijeli had committed crimes -- they had evidence that Kajelijeli had committed crimes.  So they arrested this man, put him in handcuffs, held him in Benin from June until August, on the pretence that they had evidence that he had committed crimes.  

I am not going to go into all of the arguments we made concerning the illegal arrest, but I raise it at this point, first, to deal with the question of context and motive that the Prosecutor asked for.  They held him, but what did they do between the time that -- June and August?  They had no witnesses.  They had no one who they knew at that time who said that Kajelijeli had committed any crimes.  So they went around looking for witnesses, and that hunt for witnesses went from 1998 to the year 2000.

There is a complete reverse process.  In most criminal cases there is some evidence that someone committed a crime.  Based upon that evidence, the person - there is an arrest warrant, and then the authorities go and they look for the person and they arrest them.  In this case, they arrested him and they then decided to search for evidence.  We raised that before this Tribunal.  The Prosecutor said , "No, the Defence is raising a false issue.  We had evidence -- we do have evidence, we know that this man committed crimes, and we have the evidence."

On my opening statement two years ago, I raised this same point.  I said, okay, we will see what witnesses they bring.

If you look at the witnesses, starting with GBV, GBV gave his statement when?  The record is clear, July 31st of 1998, that is when GBV was first interviewed.  When was Kajelijeli arrested?  June 5th of 1998.  So, he was the first witness.  They then went down the list, and then later on they decided that they needed to come up with rape charges.

You will note that Kajelijeli, in his initial indictment, the Chamber has looked at the record here -- there were no allegations of rape, but when Kajelijeli won a severance motion, they realise, "Look, we have a problem here.  After he was indicted, that is when they began to look -- that maybe we need witnesses for rape.  Not initially, not before, not even at the time of the confirmation of the indictment in August of 1998.  So when were all of these rape charges?  They began in 1999, most of them in the year 2000.

If the Prosecution has one iota of evidence to refute any of the things that I am saying, they will have an opportunity to rebut it.  I would sit down right now if they could come up with a single witness whom they say they have any credible evidence that they introduced to this Court, who gave any testimony prior to when Juvènal Kajelijeli was arrested.  Not one.  Everyone they interviewed confirms the Defence contention.  They arrested the man and then began looking for evidence.

The problem with the Prosecution, of course, is that as they interviewed witness after witness, no one was keeping track of times and time frames.  So, there were events that took place that were real, but they now want to stick Kajelijeli in it.  And the problem for the Prosecution is that they end up with prior statements which are inconsistent with their theory as it develops.  It does not harmonise.  That is their dilemma.  The Chamber must look scrupulously at the evidence.  It isn't just ipso facto, whatever the witness says, but the burden is on the Prosecution to deal with contradictions.  And contradictions are not dealt with by it is more probable that it is this, or more probable that it is that.  It is beyond a reasonable doubt.

Now, we have said that Kajelijeli was a target of the RPF.  Now, that is laid out in paragraphs 26, 27 of our brief.  Now, we see the testimony of JK312, September 16th, 2002, page 47, lines 5 and 8, and there was a protracted campaign of threats and intimidations.  Radio Muhabura was being used to target him, and we know that Kajelijeli had to flee for his life.  We see the testimonies of JK312, of September 16th, 2002, page 46, lines 18 to 30; page 47, same witness's testimony, line 1 to 17; and Kajelijeli's testimony of April 14th, 2003, page 73, lines 12 to 13; SMR 2, September 19th, 2002, page 72, lines 30; same witness, page 73, lines 1 and 2, and page 74, line 6 to 10.  It's in the record.  The man is targeted, and the targeting of Kajelijeli did not stop, it did not stop after he left Rwanda in July, it followed him to Cotonou, Benin, and it continued here in terms of intimidation of potential Defence witnesses, and the Court has a record of motions that we have filed in  this regard.

Now, Your Honour, I will now proceed to look at the Prosecution's case seriatim.  We maintain that the Prosecutor, simply, has not met her burden.  And we are looking at whether Kajelijeli was an influential member -- leader of the Interahamwe.  The Prosecutor now says to us in her oral presentation, "We never said that Kajelijeli was a leader or founder of the MRND; we said that he was a simple member."  That has never been the theory of their case.  We refer you to their pre-trial brief; we refer you even to their response.  And in terms of their brief, that is, the corrigendum, because in the corrigendum they talked about Kajelijeli as an influential member of the MRND.

The witnesses they called, they are witnesses that Kajelijeli was a leader of the MRND.  The problem with that is if the man was an influential member and a leader of the MRND, why is it that they are unable to find a single document to support their contention?  The officials in Kigali took control -- took control of the country of Rwanda in July of l994.  Kajelijeli was bourgmestre for only three weeks in 1994.  Couldn't they find any record, any document showing that Kajelijeli was a member of the MRND?  They were unable to produce anything.  Why?  Because it didn't exist.

They produced and relied upon Witnesses GBE, GBV, GDD and GAO.  All of these are detained witnesses.  GDD and GAO claim that Kajelijeli gave them membership cards.  These are naked statements, uncorroborated, of detained witnesses whose credibility is seriously impugned, and I will deal with that in a minute.  

They claim that he chaired meetings, and that he was someone who, in fact, according to them, retained real power.  GDD claims that Kajelijeli was a member of the préfectural committee.  GAO also made that assertion, but they failed to produce -- the Prosecutor has failed to produce any evidence to show that Kajelijeli was a member of any prèfectural committee or, in fact, any leadership role within the MRND from 1991 to the time that he left.  In fact, the Defence called someone who admits that he was a leader of the MRND who, in fact, admitted that he was on the préfectural committee, who, in fact, was one of the founding members of the new MRND.  He became national secretary of MRND in 1993.  That is Joseph Nzirorera.  

He testified and he, in fact, told you not only through his own testimony, but there was documentary evidence that was introduced.  And the Court is aware that the Defence submitted official documentation showing that if Juvènal Kajelijeli -- if Juvènal Kajelijeli was a member -- a leader of the MRND, he would have been -- he would have signed the new constitution.  There were a number of members who were listed, of individuals who, in fact, signed that constitution.

We refer you to Defendant's Exhibit 35.   Defendant's Exhibit 35, and at page 1,004, the official gazette was a document which listed not only the people who were leaders at the préfectural level, but also at the commune level.  Everyone who within that commune who was influential and had any role to play in the MRND, they were called upon at that moment to be one of the signatories.

Prosecution witnesses said that the members of the préfectural committee were published in the local gazette.

You recall that the Defence attempted to show Nzirorera this document.  We pointed out the document, the Prosecution blocked it.  They blocked it on the basis they said it was incomplete.  This was a newspaper publishing the names of the individuals.

Mr. Fleming then, later on, after he blocked it said, "Your Honours, we withdraw our objection."  The Court said, "You can't do this.  You have objected, the document is not in."  Nzirorera then was able to make comments without the benefit of the document being marked.  And he, in fact, listed the members of the people who were owned -- who were elected, who stood for election in 1992 for the préfectural committee.  Kajelijeli was not on there.

Now, why wasn't the Prosecutor able to adduce any proofs, establishing -- that is, documentary proofs, establishing Kajelijeli being a member, leader, or playing any role within the MRND other than the witnesses whom they called?  And the simple truth is, and the only logical explanation is that no documentary evidence existed to support those allegations.

Now, how do we deal then with that evidence that was adduced?  We have to look at who was making the statements, and what their credibility is.  Who are the people?  The Prosecutor relies, essentially, on detained Witnesses GAO, GDD, and they also rely on GBE.  None of these witnesses were able to corroborate anything that they said with any documentary proof.  We observe that the Prosecutor, in other cases, were able to show documents; in fact, even the same document that they blocked in this case, concerning election results, were introduced in other cases.  So what are they trying to hide from the Tribunal?  The truth.

Now, the next question is whether Kajelijeli was a founder or leader of the Interahamwe.  The Prosecutor, again, who are their witnesses?  They rely upon two detained witnesses who have a motive to fabricate, exaggerate and to lie.  They are GAO and GDD.  GDD -- GDD had a reputation in the community as a thief and a liar, and we draw the Court's attention to the testimony of his brother.  His brother came and testified, JK 27, on September 17th, 2002, pages 75, lines 26 to 30; page 79, lines 11 to 30; page  83, 13 to 16.

The Trial Chamber would recall the testimony of JK 27.  He says that his brother was a drunk, his brother was prone to exaggeration, lies, and he was a thief.  In fact, he stole from the family.  That is the testimony we heard from the witness box.  The Prosecution could have challenged that if it was untrue.  They never brought any evidence -- confronted this witness with anything to, in fact, suggest that his testimony was not true.  GAO -- GAO as the Court recalls, is the witness who came before the Chamber, and GAO first said that the statements that he made before the Rwandan authorities, that those statements when he looked at the fingerprints on the statements, et cetera, he acknowledged them, that they were his.  The statements were read to him, and he acknowledged them.  Then later on when it dawned upon him that what he was testifying to were inconsistent with those statements, he then began to say some were his and some were not.  The Prosecutor said, "Well, this is someone who is illiterate, he cannot read or write," but the Chamber looked at that -- was able to look at the demeanour of the witness.

But what is at issue here?  What is at issue?  At issue is the truth.  Not just on this side, but on that side.  Did the man make the statements or not?  Who did he make the statements to?  Did he speak to people in Kigali?  We are not talking about him making a statement on Mars.  He made a statement to people in Kigali.  Can you go over to Kigali and get a statement?  The Prosecutor's office, they have offices in Kigali.  If they believe that the statements that were shown to their witness was false, they could have come to the Court and said, "Your Honours, these are the real statements that this man confessed.  What the Defence have are forgeries.  These are the forgeries," et cetera.  They have the power, the authority, the resources to do that.  If they were not willing or able to do that, they could hire a -- as we did, a fingerprint expert, and their expert could have contradicted what the Defence's expert said.  But in this trial, we are talking about the truth, and we are talking about a man's life.  The Prosecutor, in her opening statement said, "It would be an injustice to convict an innocent man."  If that is true, what is her duty?  Her duty is to make sure that that does not happen, not to obfuscate, hide, distort, withhold information.

GAO made a confession.  If the confession that he made that the copies we have on the Defence are not true, then produce what they say is true.  If you cannot do that, then the objection that you are making lacks any basis.  It isn't that they do not have the resources.

Now, let's look at why there is this fear of the admissibility of the document.  Let's look at why.  GAO and the Prosecutor suggests that the Defence has come up with a new theory calling, "Pass the buck," and that theory is based upon the fact that someone else gave the order to attack, and it starts where?  At the same old place, Byangabo.

We look at the statement of GAO.  GAO, in his confession and that is Exhibit -- Defence Exhibit 8(C)-- and we ask the Court to look at it very carefully -- what is amazing about this statement?  First of all, the witness came here and he said, "Kajelijeli was at Byangabo at 6:30, he and 33 Interahamwe."  It reminds you the story of Judas and the 33 pieces of silver;  33, not 32 or 34, 33 Interahamwe who were there his testimony.  And it is Kajelijeli who said, "What are you waiting for?  The others have began their work.  Go and kill Tutsis."  Before the Rwandan authorities, the very words that he puts in Kajelijeli's mouth, he said a lieutenant told him that.  I mean, the most amazing and striking thing, not only does he say that -- he doesn't mention Kajelijeli at Byangabo, but he said, "The person who told me to do this was a lieutenant who drove up."  He comes here and says, "Kajelijeli told me."

What has happened?  This is the problem with the Prosecution's case; they have taken events that took place, witnesses who made statements about what occurred, and now they are trying to put Kajelijeli in the mix.  It is precisely the point that I made before.  They arrest him, then they try to get evidence to support the illegal arrest.  The problem for them is that it doesn't mesh.  The puzzle does not come together.  The parts don't fit, and no slight of hand is going to make it fit.  

Now, let's talk a bit about the allegations of the Interahamwe.
MR.  PRESIDENT:
Counsel, Exhibit 8(C), what is the date of that document?
MR. HINDS:
The statement made by the witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the one that you have just made reference to.
MR. HINDS:
That is his statement dated February 2, it is 1999, but the date on the statement itself, it says 1992, but obviously it was a mistake; it is February 2, 1999, and it is sealed, 8(C).  It was admitted into evidence on November 28 of 2001.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I am saying so because some of us have seen translated versions of those statements, but the dates are not -- we are not very clear, that is why I am raising this question.
MS. HINDS:
Yes, the statement, that is the confession.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
The confession is 8(C).  That confession, his initial statement was, "It is mine," then later on, he then says, "Part of it are forgery."
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We recall that evidence.  I just want to know the date.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.  Right.  Now, the Defence has submitted, Your Honour, that GAO's testimony is inherently -- inherently unreliable.  He has proven himself to come before this Trial Chamber and lie, and when you look at the confession, it is inconsistent in not only one regard, it is with respect to all of the things that he said here.  He said in the statement, that he was not a member of the MRND, which is true.  He said in the statement, "I am not a member of MRND," which is true.  That is also what he said to the representatives of the ICTR when they interviewed him.  He said, "I am not a member of the MRND."  And if you recall, when we cross-examined him on that question, he said the representatives of the ICTR were mistaken, they recorded his testimony falsely when they said that he was not a member of the MRND.

Well, if you look at his testimony and that of the alleged leader of the Interahamwe, RGM acknowledges he was a member -- he was a leader of the Interahamwe, even GAO said that was my leader."  RGM, when asked, "Was GAO an Interahamwe?"  He said he did not meet the age requirement, he was only 17 years old at the time, and you have to be 18.

Well, GAO when he confessed, said that, "I was not a member of the Youth Wing."  In his statement to the ICTR, he said, "I was not a member of the Youth Wing."  And, in fact, that is true.  He is not an Interahamwe, but he comes and he bolsters himself, he even told the Tribunal that he had military training back in 1991.  Now, we all know of child soldiers, right?  But he would have been 14 years old when he was shown the manipulation of -- he called Kalashnikovs, and so on.  So why is he saying this?  He is saying this to bolster himself, but he was 17 in 1994; he is 14 in l991.  He claims all of this time he was Interahamwe, but inconsistent with his confession.

I will address more of his distortions, lies and exaggerations as we go along.

Now, these are the witnesses whom the Prosecutor has called; GAO, GDD, are to establish that Kajelijeli was a leader of and founder of the Interahamwe.  Now, the Prosecution claims that Kajelijeli viewed the whole population, that is, the Tutsi population of Ruhengeri, as RPF accomplices, and has said this at paragraph 41 in their closing brief.  They said they had 11 Prosecution witnesses who affirmed the fact that as a result of the attacks of the RPF, that Kajelijeli viewed the entire population -- the Tutsi population, as RPF accomplices.   The Defence suggests that the Court should review carefully all of the witnesses' testimony, because it does not provide any basis for this conclusion.

There were four witnesses who were Tutsis who said that they owed their lives to Kajelijeli.  They came here to testify.  Three of those individuals -- I mean, two of those individuals, came from Rwanda; people from different backgrounds.  Some couldn't read or write, others were professionals, and they came here.  It is inconsistent, illogical and, in fact, contradictory, to say that Kajelijeli has this animus against Tutsis, and there are people who came here and said that they owed their lives, the lives of their family, to this man, that he intervened during the temporal jurisdiction of this Tribunal to save them.  And he did so at other times.

What would be the motivation of a woman, RHU 26, to come here?  She said she had a child on her back, and at the same time, the Prosecutor is claiming that Kajelijeli is looking in the ceiling of a house in Rwankeri with a Kalashnikov on his back searching for Tutsi survivors.  He has four Tutsis in his house,  If he wanted to kill Tutsis he would start there.  The problem with their case is that they came, made statements, not realising that people from Rwanda would be able to come here.

What is the motive for this woman to lie?  Why would she lie?  What is the relationship between her and Kajelijeli?  But she came and she also said, "Guess what;  when I got there, there were two other Tutsis who were hiding in the same house."  That witness came.  He said, "Yes, I was there."  They corraborated each other.

There was a woman, ZLA, you remember her.  She came and she testified, another Tutsi, and she talked about the role that Kajelijeli played in the events prior to l994 in saving her life.  And I will talk about her later on with respect to other matters.  But these are people who came here at risk for themselves.  They didn't come with the benefit of the Rwandan government.  They came in spite of threats.  There was RHU 21.  RHU 21, of course, is the Tutsi man and his wife who were there and who RHU 26 saw.  There's and JK 312, the Prosecutor talks about JK 312, and they talk about JK 312 because their case is built on a house of cards.  And they claim that certain things occurred at certain times.  And the problem for the Prosecution, of course, is that if there were any challenges with respect to that scenario, everything falls.

At the time that they say that Kajelijeli is urging individuals to go out and kill Tutsis at Byangabo,
JK312 says he was where?  He saw him in his pyjamas at his house.  You recall the testimony.  Now, challenging an alibi is not just simply reiterating the Prosecution's case.  Challenging the fabric of an alibi, in fact, means challenging the credibility of the witness, in fact showing what the witness said occurred, could not have occurred, that the witness was not, in fact, where he says he was.  That is the alibi witness, being contradicted by some other witness, going to the very heart of the witness's testimony.

The Prosecutor claims that JK 312 had or was owed an obligation -- he owed Kajelijeli some obligation, okay.  All right, what is the obligation?  Making a naked statement like that goes no place.  What is the obligation that was owed?  What were the circumstances?  What was it all about?  Nothing.  Making a statement like that and saying, "Well, I have challenged the credibility of this witness," Your Honours, doesn't take us very far.  

Was Kajelijeli a leader, founder, of the Interahamwe?  What is the proof?  We have the naked statements of two detained witnesses, whose credibility has been challenged, not by innuendos, but by documentary evidence, in the one case, by statements of another witness, a blood relative.  And what would be the motive of JK 27 to come here and to call his brother a liar?  What would be his motive?  You would think that his motive would be to help his brother.  But he said the brother is a thief, a drunk and a liar.  What is the best evidence?  The Defence called RGM, the leader of the Interahamwe.  That witness testified before this Chamber, and here is a witness who said, "I confessed that I killed someone.  I was the individual who killed someone."  It is not what somebody said occurred.  "How did you kill that individual?"  "I killed him with a metal pipe."  The Prosecutor tries to suggest that hitting someone in the head with a metal pipe is not a lethal weapon.  I would not want to be hit on the head with a pipe.  The fact is, that is a weapon, it will kill you as surely as being shot by a bullet.  The individual who did the killing, that is what he said; RGM.

But furthermore -- and you got to look at it very carefully at this -- when you look at GAO who was, in fact, also making statements around this respect, in his confession, he says, "I wasn't there.  I was told later on."  So what does GAO say when he testifies?  He said Rukara was killed with an axe.  What is the significance?  The significance is making things up.

GBV who, of course, talks about the same thing, but he doesn't mention any of that in his statement to the ICTR.  When he is asked, "How was Rukara killed?"  He said, "With a club with nails in it."  Again, making things up.  You can talk generally, but when you begin to deal with the specifics, that is when the problem begins, and that is where you have problems with credibility.

And when we challenge the credibility of the witnesses, we are not talking about what is more probable or not.  We are saying, look at the evidence critically and you will see that the Prosecution is not meeting their burden.

Now, with respect to the Interahamwe, RGM, who was a leader of the Interahamwe, he came here, and he said that he came -- he was threatened not to come here and testify in Kajelijeli's case.  He was told, "if you, in fact, come and you testify, that you face the death sentence, that you face more charges."  And what was RGM's response to this Trial Chamber?  He said, "I committed one crime by killing someone;  I will not commit another injustice by accusing someone falsely, that is, Kajelijeli."  And so someone puts his life on the line.  We are not talking about compensation.  The Prosecutor says that this RGM, his motive was that he wanted to protect his leader.

There are few people who will challenge the gallows, who will step in front of a bullet to protect someone.  They tell me that the members of the secret service are trained to do that.  But in the normal course of events, you do not have people who are risking their lives, who have been threatened and told, "If you come here -- " this is someone who is under a genocide charge in Rwanda.  "If you come to Arusha and testify, you are finished."  And he told you what his response was.  The Prosecution was not able to challenge him by showing that: (a), he wasn't in prison, he wasn't facing a death sentence, or any of these things were not true -- what he said.  So how do they challenge his credibility?  

They come here and make a vague statement such as, "Well, he has to testify because -- to protect his leader."  They have not shown any statements that he has made whic were inconsistent, where he, in fact, said one thing and changed it, or where he lied.  But this witness who was the leader of the Interahamwe in Busogo secteur said that Jean Damascene Nyoyita, he is the one who came to him in the early part of 1993, and asked him to  set up the Interahamwe.  "Was Kajelijeli involved?"  "No."  "Kajelijeli involved in any way?"  "No."

Your Honours, I am not asking you to believe what I am saying, standing on my feet, I am giving you my recollection of the evidence and I can give you page and line number, if you so wish, but it is no distortion, it is no mischaracterisation.  It is what the witness said.

Now, who was the best witness with respect to whether Kajelijeli formed the Interahamwe,  Whether he was a leader of the Interahamwe?  Of course, it would be the person who says, "I am the leader of the Interahamwe."  And then when you look at the witness, what is his motive?  What is the credibility of that witness?  And we say to you that his credibility has been untouched, his credibility has been unchallenged; his credibility has been untarnished.  As compared to whom?  GAO, who we know has lied, discredited himself,  And GDD, who we know to be a liar, a thief and a drunk.

Now, let's go to military training.  Military training:  Prosecution says that Kajelijeli was involved in training the Interahamwe in Mukingo and Nkuli.  Who do they rely on?  Detainees.  Now, this training was not done secretly, it was done in public.  Therefore, you would think that the public at large would know, would be able to corroborate this.  

Again, the problem with the Prosecution's case in their proof, it doesn't harmonise -- distortions.  Why?  Because they are relying primarily upon detainees who, in fact, have an incentive -- an incentive to lie.  They have come here with the blessings of the Rwandan authorities, and they are now talking about training that took place.

Your Honour, I would take about 15 minutes with training.  I don't know if you want me to go in, I 
can --
MR. PRESIDENT:
If it is convenient, we will stop here.
MR. HINDS:
-- I could stop here, you are right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you could pick it up when we resume this afternoon.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We adjourn this proceeding, and we will resume at 2:30 this afternoon;  2:30.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned.
(Court recessed at 1300H)

(Pages 28 to 41 by Regina Limula)




























	1435H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  We continue with the closing arguments of the Defence.  Professor Hinds, please, could you please proceed, Counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honours.  Before I broke, and we adjourned for lunch, I was going into the question dealing with military training --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- of the Interahamwe.  Before I get into that area I would like to just make some observations on a couple of points that I had touched on this morning.  And this goes to the issue of, I suppose, the Prosecution's theory of conspiracy which predates the temporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and in particular, the relationship of Kajelijeli with Nzirorera.  

	As the Chamber recalls, the Prosecutor made reference during this trial to a meeting that took place in November of 1992, where the then president of Rwanda had spoke, and that took place in the stadium in Ruhengeri.  

The Prosecutor through many of their witnesses and in particular, Witness GBV and GBE, alleged that Kajelijeli played a prominent role there and that Nzirorera was also there.  The Chamber recalls that testimony and in fact even in her oral submission, the Prosecutor raised that point.  

We -- we want to bring to the attention of the Tribunal, and we don't think that we are the only persons here who have a duty to seek  truth and justice.  I think all of us, as participants in the process, want to make sure, as the Prosecutor says, that an innocent person is not convicted.  The Prosecutor gets up and she says that, on this November 16th,1992 meeting, that Kajelijeli was there, Nzirorera was there, and that they were together.  The Prosecutor has in her possession, and I am just assuming that this information was not deliberately withheld, and although it's exculpatory,  that perhaps within the Prosecutor's Office, they don't know what one hand is doing with the other.  But we know that we have just learnt, and I just learnt this this morning, that the Prosecutor has a document identified as document K.  This is the ICTR Prosecutor's document number  K, as in Kigali,  A, as in apple 001055.  Now, what does that document say?  The document refers to Joseph Nzirorera's passport, showing that on that particular date in 1992, he was in Brussels, Belgium, and not in Ruhengeri or Kigombe, Rwanda, no.  

It is our submission that the Prosecutor has a duty to disclose this to the Trial Chamber, make a correction if they need, but not mislead, continue to mislead, and in fact stand up and say: "Nzirorera and Kajelijeli were there", when in fact they know that to be in the contrary.  

While I am on this point in terms of certain duties --
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the evidence that was adduced in court here, because that's not the matter that was adduced .
MR. HINDS:
That's precisely the point I am making.  It was not adduced in court and it was the duty for the Prosecutor to adduce exculpatory information.  Even if someone is facing the gas chambers, even if they are about to be shot, if new evidence is adduced that could show that there was an innocent person about to die, justice requires the executioner to stop, and for that evidence to be examined.  I didn't know about this evidence.  If I knew about it, I would have made an application.  It's not in evidence and that is precisely the point.  It should have  been.  That is the point I am making.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course, Nzirorera is not an accused here but we don't want to take -- we will certainly consider all the relevant information, but was there evidence, apart from that?  Was there any evidence that was led on this matter in the course of the trial?
MR. HINDS:
Yes.  I mean, I am not being very clear in my language.  Let me go back over.  The Prosecutor in her closing brief, she said that in terms of the linkage, that they are making a linkage between Nzirorera and Kajelijeli.  She said at a meeting which took place in November 16th, of 1992, there was a meeting in Ruhengeri.  The president was there; through her witnesses, the president was there, Kajelijeli was there, Nzirorera was there.  Nzirorera was playing a prominent role.  Kajelijeli was there.  We have said that A, Kajelijeli was at that meeting.  He was not playing any prominent role, that he did not take the stand and so on, but Nzirorera was not there.  

Now, in terms of the Prosecutor attempting to establish this link between Nzirorera and Kajelijeli, this was a public meeting, a meeting that was well publicised.  A meeting occurred -- I have just been informed it was not November 16th but November 15th, same year, 1992.  What I am saying, Your Honour, is that the Prosecutor should not continue to mislead the Trial Chamber in saying that Nzirorera was present when they have evidence to the contrary.  And this, I have just found this out because information was just given to me yesterday.  But it is not for me to have to be doing this type of detective work.  There's a duty to exclude -- to disclose exculpatory information.  This is under Rule 68, and that's the only point I am making at this particular point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Let me make another observation on this particular issue, and again it goes to the question of credibility.  The Prosecution is relying upon --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Anyway we will take note of that, and I will see whether it's a matter for exculpatory, because Nzirorera certainly is not an accused in this case.
MR. HINDS:
That is precisely the point we have been making all along, but it's not an issue when they are trying to link him to a conspiracy but it certainly becomes an issue when we are pointing out that they were withholding information concerning him.  We can't be talking about Nzirorera on one side and trying to exclude him on the other side.  

Let me move on from Mr. Nzirorera to another area.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We were talking about Rule 68.
MR. HINDS:
Rule 68, that is exculpatory information.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.
MR. HINDS:
	Which helps the Defence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Please go on.
MR. HINDS:
GDD.  GDD is someone whom the Prosecution has relied upon as a central person.  We have indicated his credibility has been seriously called into question based upon the testimony of a blood relative. 

Now, the Chamber recalls that we tried to recall that witness and before we were able to call him, he died.  The Chamber remembers that.  We, rather than proceeding to hold a motion before the Chamber, knowing that the witness had died, we withdrew the motion.  But what was this motion about?  We didn't just want to call GDD.  It is a continuing problem we have dealt with in this case, and that is trying to get to the truth, trying to get to what actually happened and what is the truth with respect to witnesses who testify.  We knew that the witnesses who were detainees and those who had confessed, during their confession, their testimony was considered to be probative and relevant, and the Trial Chamber so ruled with respect to motions that we made in this respect.  A ruling was made with respect to GDD and GAO.  The Prosecutor continually said that they were doing their best efforts to attempt to obtain prior statements, they were unable to get those statements. 

We have GDD as the witness, uncorroborated.  He talks about a meeting of April 6th, which is central to the government's case, the Prosecutor's case.  Now we --
MR. PRESIDENT:
April 6th, 1994?
MR. HINDS:
April 6th,1994, Your Honour.  We produced prior -- the prior confession to the Prosecutor's office as part of our motion.  In that confession, GDD, clearly lied when he took the witness stand, and all of the things that he talked about they know, that is the Prosecutor's Office, knows through the document that it is false.  

Now, we said we would like to recall the witness to confront him with his prior statement.  We were unable to do so because he died.  Therefore, we had to try to, on our own, authenticate the document.  The document we had was not an original but in terms of his signature were copy.  Prosecutor's Office said they have the original, they were able to ascertain whether or not the signature is valid or not and on that basis they had doubts about it, they objected to the document coming in.  But this is not a case of cat and mouse.  A man's life is at stake.  The Prosecutor got up and said; "We don't want to convict an innocent man".  If, they, in fact, believed that the document was a forgery, they have access to get the confession from Rwanda, but they knew that that document, in fact, damaged their case and, in fact, corroborated everything that we had said.  The witness in his statement before the Rwandan authorities which the Prosecutor have in her file, and are trying to prevent the Tribunal from having access to it, the witness, in fact, said that when he testified here that he was a youth leader, employed by the commune, in fact, he was fired.  His own words, not mine.  This is what he said; "I was no longer working for the commune in April of 1994, I was a simple farmer."  He came before us and said; he was a youth leader and so on.  He never said he was an Interahamwe or leader of an Interahamwe, none of that.  In fact, with respect to you, we recall him saying when he was summoned around 11 o'clock, he took his Kalashnikov, put it across his back and took four or five clips of bullets to go to the meeting.  In his confession he said he had no weapon.  They were assigned weapons and they had to turn it in the night before.  

Now, this information clearly establishes that this witness, who came before the Tribunal, testified to the contrary, was lying.  We believe that the Tribunal has the authority, if there's a question of doubt in evaluating the evidence, to exercise it's authority under 89D, take a look, as I said before.  There are people who may, in fact, be facing their executioner and if new information comes up that can show that this person is being wrongfully accused, we all have a duty to take a look at it.  We are saying the Prosecutor had the information.  We are not hiding it.  If, in fact, this man's confession from the Rwandan authorities is different than what we have, if it is in fact a forgery, so be it.  But if it is true -- if it is true, this Tribunal must look at it, because it raises fundamental questions with respect to fairness.

Having said that, let us take a look at the Prosecution's proofs that they, in fact, put in the record concerning training that took place, they say, of the Interahamwe.  Whom do they rely on?  Again GAO, GDD , GAP.  All of this training took place in public.  They said the training took place in front of the Mukingo office commune, outside of the commune buildings, that's according to GAP, GAO.  GDD says the training took place at the commune, again in that building compound, Nkuli, although he said some military training took place at the Mukalima camp.  Now, the reference to GDD in terms of what he said and what I have just said, is October 3rd, 2001, dealing with the transcript in English.  And as I said --
MR. PRESIDENT:
	October, October, sorry? 
MR. HINDS:
October 3rd, 2001, page 92, lines 10 to 13.  Same witness, same date.  Page 114, lines 8 to 12 and lines 19 to 21.  This is GDD, in terms of where he said that training took place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the English transcripts?
MR. HINDS:
All of this is English transcripts, Your Honour.  GAP talked about the training as I said before that took place, Mukingo office, outside of that and transcript reference to him is, November 28th, 2001, page 119, lines 10 to 24, page 118, lines 11 to 15 and then his testimony on December 3rd, 2001, page 56, lines 10 to 17, page 55, lines 11 to 17, page 56, lines 18 to 25.  Page 57, lines 1 to 4.  And also on December 4th, page 84, lines  9 to 17.  

If, in fact, the training took place as these witnesses are saying, that is training of the civilians in a public area, why weren't other members of the public called to testify?  It should be not difficult to have people who were in the community, the public.  Whom did they rely upon?  They relied upon these detainees who have been -- their credibility challenged to support this allegation.  There wasn't a single witness, aside from  GDD, who was called from Nkuli to corroborate his story about this training.  

Now, the Prosecution have other witnesses who were not detainees:  GBV, GBE, GBG.  All of them are from the area, so they say, but none of them saw any training even among my own witnesses.  These are not detainees.  

Our submission, Your Honour, is that if such training took place, more people would have seen it.  Now, the Prosecution did provide GBH.  GBH said -- now, he is a non-detainee that he saw training youths.  He saw them using wooden weapons, but when asked where would this training take place?  -- Not in front of the commune office.  He now has the training taking place some place else, in a football field.  Others say Kajelijeli was actively involved in the training.  We asked him, what was Kajelijeli doing?  Juvenal Kajelijeli was standing there, just like the rest of the population.  That is their proofs on Kajelijeli's participation in training.

Now, this testimony raises more questions in it than it provides answers. The Prosecution has not been able to lead any credible evidence to establish that Kajelijeli was involved in any military training.  GAO in his testimony said that the training took place from 1991 through l994.  He, in fact, was involved in the training from the time, of course, when he said 1991, when he was 14 years old.  I have already commented upon him just trying to puff himself up.  But when you look at the fabric of their testimony, what is GAP saying?  GAP claims that there were 600 Interahamwe comprising of youths, both from Mukingo and Nkuli, who were trained.  All of this, 600 people were being trained at the Mukingo commune office.  You're having all of those people being trained and nobody in the public seeing it in front of the commune office?  But when did this training take place?  GAP says the training took place after Kajelijeli took office, in 1994.  Now, we know what the testimony is.  Kajelijeli took office when?  The last three weeks,  the end of June, mid July.  The last three weeks of when he was in Rwanda.  That's when he took office.  If you look at GAP's testimony and I have given the reference with respect to that, we see that he is talking about this training, that is taking place with 600 people.  But even within the Prosecution's own case, when you look at the testimonies of GAO and GDD, it does not support that.  He talked about joint training between Interahamwe from Nkuli and Interahamwe from Mukingo.  If that took place why didn't GDD talk about it?  Each of the Prosecution witnesses made up their own stories about training.  That is the problem with the Prosecution's case.  Training, oh, yes, there was training, but everybody is talking about something different.  Everybody is talking about something different, because there is no harmony.  They have one witness talking about one thing, another witness talking about something  and then when we look at it, the fabric does not come together.  

We are requesting that this Trial Chamber look critically at the testimony of GDD, GAO, GAP, concerning this training.  But the Defence did not rest just pointing out contradictions.  Although we challenge the Prosecution's evidence with respect to their own contradictions and inconsistencies which raises questions as to credibility.  We called the witnesses who were from the community, who were there.  We called the people who, if they were involved in training of the Interahamwe, they would know.  But we didn't rely only on people who were clear leaders of the Interahamwe, RGM.  RGM testified here and he told you; "Yes, I was a leader of the Interahamwe, we didn't have any training".  He told you how the Interahamwe was formed.  
Now, MEM. MEM, we know what his title was.  He was a responsible person within the commune.  He was in that area, certainly in a position to know whether or not there would be training at the commune office in Mukingo or as they say in front of Isimbi because Isimbi as the Court recalls is in Byangabo.  

We draw your attention to Exhibits 33 and 26.  You recall 33 and 26.  Let me just quickly put them on the screen.  So as we --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exhibits twenty -- 
MR. HINDS:
Exhibits - Defence Exhibit 33.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thirty-three.
MR. HINDS:
	And Defence Exhibit 26.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Twenty-six.
MR. HINDS:
We have copies here, sir, with the Court's indulgence.  Let's start with 33.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Don't you have your own exhibit?
MR. HINDS:
Oh, yes, they do, but I was just facilitating him -- it's a copy.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have your own exhibits?

Yes, 33 and 26.
MR. HINDS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, that is Exhibit 33.  The witness who testified with respect to that document is TLA.  As the Court recalls, TLA resided in a -- right across from Isimbi.  The Court can see Isimbi is clearly marked as a block, reflecting a building, on what is there, Nkuli to Mukingo road.  Those arrows on both sides.  The witness indicated that he lived right across the street; she saw no training taking place there, during the period that the Prosecution claims training was taking place.  This is TLA.  
Okay, let's go to Exhibit 26.  TLA in that exhibit -- again this is a larger scale.  He identifies a few other things there but I am just focusing attention to the Chamber, reminding the Chamber.  This is Prosecution Exhibit 26.  This exhibit was in fact produced when, on 
cross-examination of that witness.  The witness was asked to draw a map or draw a diagram showing the location of the school that he was a principal of and the relationship of the commune office in relation to that school.  And as the Court recalls, the witness indicated he could see that very clearly from where the school is located, the location.  This witness testified that he did not see any training taking place. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I do not intend to interrupt my learned friend's broad thought but I hope he knows the consequences of what he is doing because I was stopped at some point.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We draw the attention of counsel, maybe --
MR. HINDS:
I take the point, but I don't want to emphasise it any more.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, in fact that is what -- we are coming back to that after your submissions.
MR. HINDS:
	Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Maybe in future when you want to deal with sealed exhibits -- 
MR. HINDS:
	Maybe we go into closed session.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	No, you can just draw our attention to it.
MR. HINDS:
I will draw your attention to it without  --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you can spell -- you use your draft that you have before you and if need be, the particular exhibit can be, you know, brought to the Trial Chamber for --
MR. HINDS:
For your in-camera.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, as we go along.
MR. HINDS:
	As we go along, okay.

MR. PRESIDENT:
	Without screening.
MR. HINDS:
	All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. We didn't want to raise this issue because we thought it would make things more difficult.
MR. HINDS:
I agree. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.
MR. HINDS:
I take note, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
	Now, with respect to  -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And of course, you are talking, Counsel, about training at Isimbi house or training --
MR. HINDS:
I am talking about two areas.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	No, no, no, with regard to these exhibits.
MR. HINDS:
The two areas.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HINDS: 
Defence Exhibit 33. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Dealt with Isimbi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.

MR. HINDS:
Prosecution's Exhibit 26.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Dealt with the commune.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which commune?
MR. HINDS:
Mukingo commune.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Because even though on the Prosecutor's Exhibit 26 you can see both the location of -- the witness's location in relation to Isimbi, and you can also see the witness's location with respect to the commune office.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You can go on, Counsel.  And registry, can you take back the copies for the Defence, please, and you can have your exhibits ready in case there may be any other reference that counsel wants or any counsel wants to specifically bring to the attention of the Trial Chamber.  Those that are sealed, I think we can view them here before us because I am sure the other counsel has those documents, herself, as well.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Now, let's move quickly to other two witnesses whom we called just on this issue of training.  These again are not detainees, these are individuals who are, in fact, people within the community, who were not necessarily people who were considered to be Interahamwe but individuals who are members of the population at large.  

RHQ31.  Now, who is RHQ 31?  RHQ31 was an employee of the commune.  He worked there, and if anyone would be able to tell us whether there was training, he would be able to do so.  Prosecutor was able to cross-examine him.  They weren't able to challenge whether or not he, in fact, worked at the commune office for the number of years that he said he worked there or whether he would be able to make those types of observations concerning training at the commune office.  They raised questions with him  to see whether or not he went to any area to see Isimbi house but he worked every day, at the commune office.  
RHQ23.  RHQ23 is a long-time resident of the community,  A long-time resident of that area.  He was president, former president of the elections committee of Mutubu district.  We heard his testimony and that testimony was recorded at September 25th, 2002, page 71, lines 18 to 23.  TLA as he testified, he testified on December 2nd, 2002,  page 44, lines 27 to 29, and page 48, lines 13 to 17.  

The Prosecution has simply not proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt,  A, that there was training, B, putting Kajelijeli in it.  Each of their witnesses has been challenged.  In addition the Defence has produced independent witnesses who challenge their assertions concerning training, whether that occurred.  

Now, the Prosecution has contended that Kajelijeli was present and participated in a number of attacks; that is, attacks against Tutsis that took place in Byangabo centre.  Then they said that those attacks took place in Rwankeli cellule, Busogo parish, in Nkuli, Munyemvano's compound.  And then in the compound of the parish itself, particularly the nuns convent.  They said that Kajelijeli was involved in attacks on April 10th and then subsequently on April 14th.  

Now, let's look at the quality of the proofs of the Prosecution, on the morning of April 7th, l994.  Now, I would like to ask the indulgence of the Court because what I am going to do, I am going to use some charts and I am going to ask our assistant Mr. Dusabe to project these on the screen, which kind of lays out - it's a the way of helping the Chamber to follow the testimony concerning each of these sites that we are talking about.  With the permission of the Court, can he go up to the overhead?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where?
MR. HINDS:
Can my assistant go to the overhead and put the documents as I want him to, for display to the Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
It would then be displayed on everyone's.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes. 
MR. HINDS:
Mr. Dusabe, go over.  Take a seat and so that you can go through this.  
The Prosecution relies essentially with respect to Byangabo, they rely on two witnesses. GAO and GDD.  There's another Prosecution witness, GBE.  Again, I am only making reference right now to what they said in their corrigendum of their closing briefs.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not very clear.
MR. HINDS:
They have the map.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So this is the -- this is -- what is this now?
MR. HINDS:
This is -- what we have here are -- we start with the Prosecutor's witnesses within their closing briefs, the allegation each witness made.  Then when we go over we are dealing with the internal contradictions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have this?
MR. HINDS:
No, you do not have this.  This is only just to help me in my presentation and to help you.  I don't need it but I thought it would help the Court.  But if it confuses you more than anything else, then I will withdraw, I will just make the presentation.  Because I don't want you to be confused.  This --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, the only thing.
MR. HINDS:
	This lays out  -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	No, the only problem is, Counsel, that we can use it but then if it goes into record, and it is not available at some stage that might cause confusion.
MR. HINDS:
No, I am not -- this is not in the record.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes. 
MR. HINDS:
	I am using my notes.  It is what is in the testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Okay.
MR. HINDS:
This is a --  this is -- I can submit it if the Court wants me to submit it as part of our brief but this is just simply to allow the Court to follow in a graphic form what I am saying.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	All right.

MR. HINDS:
	But it doesn't matter.  It is not a big issue that we should spend time on it.  If it is not helpful to the Court, we will withdraw it and I will just continue with my presentation.  What does the Court want?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think to avoid confusion as what can be made out of this document you better present  -- present your arguments.  If you want to make use of it formally then it must be part and parcel of the record because you can't use the document that ultimately will not be available at some stage but if you feel you can deal with all the issues that you have on that table by way of presentation, please do so. 
MR. HINDS:
Okay, what we will do, we will not make it as part of the presentation, but I will make a submission --
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes. 
MR. HINDS:
-- of it later on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.  The Prosecution relies on two witnesses in their closing brief.  They rely on GAO and GBV to establish that Kajelijeli was at Byangabo the morning of April 7th.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are addressing April 7th, now.  
MR. HINDS:
April 7th at Byangabo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
At Byangabo.
MR. HINDS:
That's the first place 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. HINDS: 
That they say Kajelijeli was, okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. HINDS: 
 	Where they say crimes were committed.  Our contention is, that yes, there were crimes committed there.  Kajelijeli wasn't there and in fact consistent of what we have said all along, they got witnesses to put him in there after the fact.  And they have not been able to challenge that at all.  If we look at all of the witness statements they have, all after his arrest, they weren't around.  The problem the Prosecutor has, of course, is that they got witnesses and they  couldn't harmonise the witness's testimony.  So we will take a look at them because you can have witnesses who come and say; "Yes, I saw him there", but then when you look at what they are saying it conflicts.  

We know for a fact that GAO made prior statements to the Rwandan authority and we know very well that when he did confess he said, "I wasn't there.  I found out later on."  And that of course is borne out when he was asked; how was this man killed?  He came up with the story that it was with an axe, a small axe.  GBV in his prior statement, and it's part of this record, he in fact, made a statement to representatives of the ICTR but in a statement he never mentioned seeing Rukara killed.  

But when he came to testify, he said; "Yes I saw him killed".  How was he killed?  He then said he was killed with a club with nails in it.  The truth being that Rukara, yes, he was killed, but with a pipe.  It isn't just a question of people being there and seeing different things.  That happens.  People do not have the same recollection, but when you look at the prior inconsistencies, when you look at the fact that GBV, when he first was interviewed, never said he saw this, and only talked about it at trial.  Now you begin to look at the fabric of these witnesses' statements.  

When you look at GAO and he said, "I was told about this, I learnt about this."  Not seeing it and coming here and saying; "Yes I was there and I saw it".  You see why we are dealing with this type of inconsistencies.  GBE was there, their witness, but in their closing brief they don't reference him.  Why not?  What GBE said; "I was there at Byangabo, the morning of April 7th.  I saw Rukara being killed but I didn't see Kajelijeli there.  Well, that wasn't helpful to them.  So they don't put GBE at Byangabo.  But GBE was there.  He was there.  He says, he saw the killing of Rukara but he didn't see Kajelijeli.  

Others, of their witnesses, say Kajelijeli was right  there.  How could he see Rukara being killed and not see Kajelijeli?  `But what is more interesting about GBE.  He corroborates other people.  He corroborates what MEM said.  He corroborates what RGM said.  He corroborates what MLNA said.  And that is with respect to the testimony of GBE which is July 9th 2001, page 78, lines 18 to 24.  This is a witness who is their witness and he talks about seeing MEM being present and doing what?  Trying to stop the youth from taking revenge.  And MEM himself being threatened to be killed.  Now this is their witness corroborating this fact.  

This same witness GBE said he saw RGM there, and he saw RGM killing Rukara.  And he saw the threats against MEM.  He does not use MEM.  He used the title of the person that we know within this Tribunal, what this person's title was in the context.  There was only one person holding that particular title.

	1530H
MR. HINDS: 
Now, GBV says -- GBV said that he was there, and the Court recalls he said he was 50 metres away from Kajelijeli.  He saw Kajelijeli there.  What time does he put him there?  Between eight o'clock and nine o'clock.  Okay, there could be some differences in time.  GAO, he says he saw Kajelijeli.  When was he there?  Six-thirty in the morning:  "I saw Kajelijeli there at 6:30."  We have two witnesses in the same place.  One witness seen Kajelijeli there at 6:30, another seen him at eight o'clock.  

The problem with the Prosecution's case is that they take witnesses who, both of them, put Kajelijeli in the mix, but are unable to synchronise what they said.  One witness said that GAO -- he said that Kajelijeli made a certain statement telling them to go out and kill Tutsis.  That precise statement, as I have indicated before, when he confessed, he attributed to somebody else.  Furthermore, he never said Kajelijeli was there.  GBV says he heard the statement, but Kajelijeli said, "Go and do what?"  "Put on your uniforms."  GAO, when confronted said, "We didn't have to go home and put any uniforms on, we had our uniforms" -- whatever that be.  

And he talked about 33 Interahamwe being addressed in front of Kajelijeli's bar.  GBV who when in his testimony said, "Yes, I know where Kajelijeli's bar is."  He never said he in fact saw anyone in front of Kajelijeli's bar or Kajelijeli addressing anyone in front of his bar.  

And that is the problem of the fabric of the Prosecution's witnesses when you look at it critically.  They say certain things, and in both of these witnesses, they made comments that are not consistent, contradictory and, in fact, not recorded in their prior statements that they made to the IC - the ICTR.  

Now, the witnesses that we called concerning what happened at Byangabo, the Court recalls that we called MEM.  MEM, even with GAO's confession -- he said that MEM was there and MEM was trying to stop the youth from committing crimes.  So they all confirm MEM was there and the role he was playing, trying to stop the killing that subsequently occurred.  Now, that witness came here before you.  That witness told you, "Yes, I was there, I tried to intervene."  And, in fact, that he himself had to flee for his life.  

RGM, we know who he was, he testified; he admitted to the crime that he committed.  He also confirmed what MEM said.  None of them said they saw Kajelijeli.  They didn't see -- they didn't see his van, didn't see his truck.  

Now, GBV, recall his testimony, GBV claimed that he saw Kajelijeli and Kajelijeli was in the commune vehicle; he was driving the commune vehicle that morning.  The Court would recall that GAP testified that that very morning he claimed that Kajelijeli came somewhere around eight o'clock to the commune office demanding that the bourgmestre supply him with communal police to do killings.  But interestingly what -- when asked, "Where was the bourgmestre, was he in the office?" where was the commune vehicle?  Parked outside?  Did it move that day?  No.  Yet we have Prosecution witnesses saying, GBV:  "Kajelijeli was driving a vehicle which was parked," according to their own witness, "elsewhere, and hadn't moved all day."  How could Kajelijeli be driving a vehicle which was parked at the commune office, according to their witness, GAP?  

But what is also interesting about GBV's testimony, and again the problem with just calling witnesses to put someone in a criminal scene and the witness's testimony just not jibing (sic).  GBV said he saw Kajelijeli at Byangabo and that there were Interahamwe in the vehicle, the vehicle was loaded with weapons, weapons were all on the floor of the vehicle as it left Byangabo after the killings and went off to Rwankeli.  That is not confirmed by any of the other witnesses.  What is confirmed is that, even through their own witness, GAO, is that Kajelijeli wasn't there, that there was a Lieutenant Mburuburengero, according to the record, who in fact made the statement that GAO attributes to -- now to Kajelijeli.  

And I draw your attention to MEM's testimony which was given.  He described how a military officer arrived on the scene and how he tried to stop that military officer.  RGM confirmed this in the testimony at November 18th, 2002, page 50, lines 23 to 30 and page 51.  Now, we have already indicated RGM's credibility in this respect.  

MEM in his November 25th 2001 testimony at page 32, lines 15 to 18, testified that he was successful -- he was unsuccessful in stopping the youth, and so the killings took place.  But the role played by MEM was confirmed by the Prosecution's witnesses, was confirmed by GBE, confirmed by GAO in his confession, the fact that he did not see Kajelijeli at Byangabo.  

Witness TLA, he lived right across from Kajelijeli's bar.  This is a witness -- and we draw the Chamber's attention to Defence Exhibit 26 and to Pros -- I am sorry, Defence Exhibit 33 and Prosecutor's Exhibit 26, if the Court would like to look at this.  I am offer -- I am now reminding you about this exhibit for a different purpose.  This is his house in relation to Kajelijeli's alleged bar.  And this is important in terms of the Byangabo events, because the Prosecution claims, according to GAO, that Kajelijeli addressed the Interahamwe from in front of his bar.  According to GAO, 33 Interahamwe were addressed and told to do something.  This witness was right there, lived there, was outside of his house.  The Court recalls his testimony, that is, the testimony of TLA.  But he also told us about what he observed.  He confirmed that with respect to the involvement of MEM and where MEM was.  And TLA indicated that at his testimony on December 2, 2002 at page 32, lines 28 to 30, and page 33 lines 1 to 6.  He said he didn't see Kajelijeli or his vehicle there all that day.  

Now, on December 2nd 2002, page 12, lines 1 to 11, page 11, lines 22 to 30, and as we say in Defence Exhibit 33, he shows the proximity between his house, where it was located, and across the street, Kajelijeli's alleged bar.  They say that Kajelijeli was there, according to GAO.  Witness did not see.  He does confirm MEM and MEM's frightened state when he saw him, and he did that in terms of seeing MEM between 8:30 and 8:45, and that is at his testimony in December 2, 2002 lines 20 to 30, and page 33, lines 1 to 6.  All of this is in the English.  

The final Defence witness that we called was Witness MLNA.  As you recall, MLNA was a student at ESTB, and he was at Byangabo.  None of the Prosecution witnesses whom we have called with respect to events said those events didn't take place; in fact, they pointed out in graphic detail for this Trial Chamber what occurred.  So that was not the issue here.  Our contention is that the Prosecution came up with a theory to put Kajelijeli in the mix, and that is the context in which we have to look at this evidence, not that certain acts did not take place, but whether the Prosecution witnesses, their own story, has coherency to make sense.  And even as they try to put Kajelijeli in the mix, they do so inconsistently, and contradictory.  

MLNA indicated he was there.  He testified that he got there, he walked around, group to group, transversing (sic) the area.  You recall his testimony.  That is March 31st 2003, page 19, 21 to 23; page 32, lines 28 to 30 and lines 36 to 37; page 33, lines 1 and 2; page 36, lines 1 and 4, 1 to 4, and lines 12 to 14; page 76, lines 10 to 22; page 37, lines 34 to 36.  Now, these are references with respect to this witness's testimony and what he said occurred.  

This has not been challenged in terms of (a) his credibility, in terms of what he saw, or whether or not he was in a position to see what he saw, or whether what he saw was inconsistent with what anyone else saw, or whether or not he had some motive to come here and tell anything but the truth.  He drew an exhibit concerning what he did that day.  That is Defence Exhibit 46, which is sealed.  The exhibit does not have -- does not disclose any confidential information that may reveal the identity of the witness, but unless the Court wants to look at it, I am not going to take the time to put it on the screen.  I make reference to Defence Exhibit 46, and I have given you the references of the witness's testimony so that you, if you so wish, can -- I am drawing your attention to this witness's testimony concerning Byangabo.  That witness did not see Kajelijeli there.  

So, we are not just relying on an alibi.  This is not an alibi case; this is a case where we are holding the Prosecution to their burden of proof, and that burden never shifts.  We have challenged every one of their witnesses.  We have pointed out the inconsistencies between their witnesses.  We have pointed out the motive for them targeting this man, and then we have produced witnesses who are unimpeachable concerning whether or not he was there.  

Now, they put Kajelijeli, starting at 6:30, at Byangabo and leaving around 8:30.  Those are their witnesses' testimony; leaving around 8:00, 8:30 from Rwankeli.  Where do they have Kajelijeli going?  Supposedly, he is going to Rwankeli.  Whom do they have now as their witnesses to establish this man in Rwankeli where killings took place?  

The Defence's position is not that killings did not take place at Rwankeli; that is not our position.  We have supplied witnesses who were there in Rwankeli, and we say, yes, that happened.  We have given the facts from the eyes of those witnesses.  Our position is that the taking of Kajelijeli by the neck and putting him there is -- that is what we challenge.  And then we say now, if you put him there, let's look at the quality of your witness and what they say.  Well, who do they have?  

They have GAO again, GAO.  Yes, GAO in his confession, he said, "Yes, I was in Rwankeli."  Doesn't say Kajelijeli is there.  He talks about killings that took place there.  Doesn't say Kajelijeli is there.  In fact, when asked he said, "I didn't see Kajelijeli there."  But what does he say?  He said, "I was there," and when he comes to testify he wants to put Kajelijeli in the mix.  But how does he put him in the mix?  He said, "I was there, and we went to this place where Tutsis had -- they had left their houses and went on a hill.  The hill was called Mount Busogo.  Tutsis went on that hill and they began to fight back with bows and arrows."  Now, this is GAO's testimony at July 23rd 2001, paragraph 25, lines 10 and 15.  Everything I am telling you is in the record.  GAO said that these Tutsis were fighting back.  So what does he do in terms of putting Kajelijeli in the mix?  He said, "I talked to RGM and I said to RGM, 'Can we get reinforcements of weapons?'"  GAO said, "RGM said, 'Well, let me talk to Kajelijeli'" and later on RGM said, "Well, Kajelijeli" -- 

Your Honour, I am informed that I said when I was referring to GAO's testimony at July 23rd 2001, my staff are telling me that I said paragraph 25 and it really is page 25, so I would like to make that correction to the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Noted.
MR. HINDS:
But what does GAO say?  GAO says that RGM subsequently came back and told him, "Don't worry, Kajelijeli has made arrangement with a Major Bizabarimana to supply us weapons from Mukamira."  Now they've got Kajelijeli in the mix.  What is the problem with this picture?  The problem is GBV.  GBV says Kajelijeli -- you look at his testimony, he said, "Kajelijeli left Byangabo and he had a truckload of weapons in the vehicle."  And that is GBV's testimony July 4th, 2001, pages 113, lines 4 to 13.  

Court will remember GBV.  He is saying there were all of these Interahamwe, they had weapons all in the car.  Why would Kajelijeli have to go to Mukamira or attack anyone, for that matter, if Kajelijeli had all of these weapons?  GBV, when he testified, and on cross-examination he was asked, "How could you be so sure?"  He said the truck, the commune vehicle -- and we know that there could be no commune vehicle Kajelijeli could be driving, even in their case, because the vehicle was parked.  He claims he saw it.  The commune vehicle - in the back of the vehicle were all of these weapons.  

He says Kajelijeli was at Rudatinya's house where the killings began.  You look at GAO's confession, he said "I went towards Rudatinya's house."  Never said he saw Kajelijeli.  The testimonies of GAO and GBV, those are the witnesses they have produced. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That confession will be what?  The confession is 8C?
MR. HINDS:
Eight C; confession of GAO is 8C.  Look at that confession.  The reason why they didn't want it in it is that it destroys this witness completely, and destroys other theories of their case.  The testimonies between GBV and GAO are inconsistent; you can't marry them together, you can't mesh them.  It's like water and oil. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we plan to take a break at four o'clock.  So you may see --
MR. HINDS:
I am just making one comment then I am going to another area.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay that is up to you.  
MR. HINDS: 
Defence admits that if you look at the proofs concerning Byangabo, it doesn't fit; if you look at the proofs concerning Rwankeli concerning the Prosecution's own witnesses that they have produced, there are internal inconsistencies, and therefore raises serious questions about their credibility.  I rest at this point.  We'll go into the Defence witnesses at Rwankeli next. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll stop here and take 15 minutes break, resume our work at a quarter past four.  

Until then these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1600H to 1630H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  
Learned Counsel, Professor Hinds, you can continue your submission.  You are still -- you have finished one aspect and are moving to a new point. 
MR. HINDS:
That's correct, Your Honour.  But, before we do so, it was just pointed out to me that a reference that I made to MEM's transcript was in fact a reference before we had corrigendum.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, okay. 
MR. HINDS:
So, I'll just make the correction.  It's MEM, November 25th 2001, page 42 instead of page 32. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 42. 
MR. HINDS:
Page 42, lines 50 to 80.  The only difference is the page number.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Go on, Counsel.
MR. HINDS: 
Your Honour, we are at Rwankeli and I wanted now to move to Defence witnesses who testified in the case.  I have gone through an analysis of the Prosecution's witnesses.  The Defence called two witnesses, RGM, who testified that, in fact, he left Byangabo and went to Rwankeli, and MLNE (sic), another witness who was in Byangabo.  

RGM admitted that he participated in the attacks there.  He pointed out that there were, in fact, Interahamwe at Busogo hill or Mount Busogo.  He indicated that he defended himself with bows and arrows.  However, he challenged and contradicted GEO by stating that soldiers arrived.  There was no need to go to reach for Kajelijeli, according to GEO, soldiers arrived, and the soldiers had weapons.  So it wasn't a question in -- as far as the Defence is concerned, concerning that massacres took place there, or killings took place there.  MLNA testified graphically with respect to what happened.  But these are people who were there and did not see Kajelijeli there.  They are not alibi witnesses.  Alibi witnesses are individuals who say Kajelijeli was here at this time.  None of these people knew where Kajelijeli was, nor did they make any claims with respect to where he was.  They certainly knew that he was not there at this particular scene, and that is what they testified to.  

MLNA talked about the destruction of the houses that he saw, and burnings, and so on, and the Court would recall at -- that is, his testimony on March 31st 2003, page 41, lines 33 to 36, page 43, lines 8 to 11, lines 13 to 19 -- he proceeded to testify concerning those events at same dates, page 44, lines 15 to 22.  He was there up until noon.  He did not see Kajelijeli.  
The Prosecution refers to MLNA, in terms of what he saw, in their closing brief.  He said even he saw those things happening.  They called him for what he saw, but when he said Kajelijeli wasn't there, they say you can't believe him.  You can believe some things, but you can't believe others.  

Let's proceed to Munyemvano's compound and the nuns' convent.  As you recall, Your Honours, the Prosecution relied again upon two witnesses to establish Kajelijeli at that particular scene.  They presented GBG and ACM.  These are the witnesses they put forward.  We say that when you look at the testimony of these two witnesses, they are fatally flawed.  They are so contradictory that no attempts by the Prosecutor to try to rehabilitate the testimony can do so.  

Let us first take a look at GBG.  GBG testified that around eight o'clock in the morning he saw Kajelijeli arrive; he ordered the Interahamwe to gather the inhabitants in the compound.  That is his testimony, GBG, July 12th, 2001, page 46, line 14 all the way to page 47, line 10.  Now, you recall this witness, who was a witness who said he was an eyewitness and he was hiding near a fence when he made these observations.  He testified that he saw Kajelijeli.  As the Prosecution says, his vision was not obscured in any way, there were no obstacles in his way, but he saw Kajelijeli walk up to Gateyiteyi and shoot him dead.  That's what GBG said, and that was when the general killings began at Munyemvano's compound.  It was a signal, and he said that on July 12th in the transcript, English, 2001, page 47, lines 8 to 9.  

According to this witness, after the killing of Gateyiteyi by Juvénal Kajelijeli everyone was scampering helter-skelter, running for their lives, and the Interahamwe were throwing hand grenades into the buildings, they were killing people; there was an overall massacre.  He said that all the members of his family were killed: his mother, his father, six siblings and that's at exhibit - that's at transcript, July 12th 2001, page 50, lines 6 to 9, and page 51, lines 15 to 16.  Now, this is what this witness said.  He was there, he was present, he saw all of these killings taking place.  He never saw any Tutsis being assembled.  He never saw them being marched in single file -- assembled and marched single file to the parish compound.  What he saw was all of the killings that were taking place -- taking place in Munyemvano's compound; that's what he said.  He said he saw Kajelijeli.  How was Kajelijeli dressed?  "Oh, he was in ordinary clothes."  No uniforms.  

Now, let's look at ACM.  ACM, this is the other witness the Prosecutor brings.  She said, "Yes I was there," but this witness, as you recall -- and we have marked her exhibits, marked the prior statements into the record -- she made two prior statements: the first one was on August 12th of 1998, and the second one was May 5th of 1999.  The problem with the Prosecutor's case, and I have said it, and I will continue to say it until I sit down, is that they got witnesses as they went along to try to put Kajelijeli in the mix.  But these witnesses could not be coordinated.  Different investigators went out and took statements, and the problem was that once the witnesses said something, it was recorded, they were stuck with it.  Then they had to try to figure out something else.  And every time they had a statement, they had problems with other statements.  And then the witness takes the stand and testifies inconsistent with that statement and then conflicting with other witnesses.  

Let's look at ACM.  ACM was contacted and her mission was to put Kajelijeli and Nzirorera in the mix .  So on August 12, what does she say:  She saw Kajelijeli and Nzirorera driving a truck - a car at Busogo.  Now, that's what she said.  And they were driving a rented car, rented by Nzirorera.  That is what that witness said.  That's a statement on August 12th.  It's marked, highlighted, as the Chamber instructed, with the procedures here.  

In that statement, when asked, "Well, how did you deduce that this vehicle was rented by Nzirorera?" -- in a statement she says, "I knew it was rented by Nzirorera because he was in Nkuli leading the killings there."  Now that is August of 1998.  Let's move fast forward.  There is another statement made in May 5, 1999 also marked, presented to different investigators, ICTR.  She says -- this is the first time that the survivors say there were shootings at Munyemvano's compound.  And incidentally, in her first statement she said that the killings all took place in Munyemvano's compound; the second statement, that was a statement of August 1998 -- in the second statement she now says a bus was used to transport the witness -- the victims.  Now, this is at Defence -- we make reference to Defence Exhibit 13B, which is that statement which is in the record.  She talked about a bus.  First statement, she has Nzirorera there.  Second statement, she is talking about a bus.  When confronted on cross-examination, she said, "I never said this," but when she testified, she talked about seeing people march from Munyemvano 's compound to the parish.  

In her second statement on May 5th, she again puts Nzirorera there, but now she says Nzirorera and Kajelijeli were at the scene in Busogo driving a car, Nzirorera's car.  Now, these are not just simple omissions, inconsistencies based upon memory, this goes to the very heart of the witness's testimony and in term -- in fact, putting someone there, based upon whatever the reason.  But we have to look at those statements; we have to analyse those statements.  Let's look at her testimony.  

During her testimony before the Chamber, we now have not just internal contradictions with this witness, she now contradicts directly GBG.  The Prosecutor suggests that they may have been looking at different angles.  Okay, let's look at different angles.  No matter what angle they were, they both saw Gateyiteyi, no matter what -- where they were.  She, of course, says Kajelijeli arrived at nine o'clock the first time, and a short time later between nine and ten o'clock he came a second time.  But these individuals now are putting Kajelijeli there at a certain time.  GBG says that he arrived around eight o'clock; she says he arrived twice, first at nine, then between nine and ten.  
GBG says all of the killings, burnings, massacres, took place in the compound.  He said there were only three survivors he knows of.  When ACM testified she talked about 24 people who survived.  Do you recall when ACM was confronted concerning the prior contradictions, she denied it completely.  Look at ACM's December 12th, 2001, page 96, line 17 testimony concerning the bus, concerning her saying that she saw Nzirorera and Kajelijeli in that location.  She denied it flatly.  She said the people at ICTR were mistaken, she never said that.  And that is again the same date, December 12th 2001, page 97, line 6 to 14.  

When she testified here, she talked about seeing killings at the parish.  In her prior statements she never said she saw that.  But what is irreconcilable in the contradiction between these two witnesses is that GBG says he saw Gateyiteyi being killed directly by Kajelijeli.  ACM says that she saw Gateyiteyi, her uncle, being shot by someone else, someone by the name of Ndayambaje; Felix Ndayambaje, N-D-A-Y-A-M-B-A-J-E.  That's what she said.  Now, how can you reconcile this?  How can you?  Both of their witnesses n the same place, both of them looking at the same person, both of them saying they seen him killed:  One witness talking about Kajelijeli killing him, the other witness said somebody else killed him.  Both of these witnesses at the same place, one witness said all of the killings took place there, another witness said four individuals were shot.  

As the Court recalls, she said there were three old women and one handicapped man, because the Chamber asked that specifically.  They said, "Look this is very serious, give us the specifics.  Who was killed where?"  The rest of the people she says marched on -- complete contradiction with respect to what occurred there.  But both of them, supposedly clear vision, unobstructed, they were able to in broad daylight see Kajelijeli there.  But what else they saw makes us believe that they weren't in the same place.  Why is this and how is this?  Again, it is a situation of finding witnesses, having them testify, taking statements and then realising they're conflicting with each other, they are conflicting with prior statements, because they are putting him in a mix.  

Now what is the motivation of these people?  We offer two thoughts on this question, an observation.  The testimony certainly reflects in this case that Munyemvano and Kajelijeli at some point in time, they were close.  That is what the testimony reveals.  Kajelijeli was the godfather of Gateyiteyi's son.  They were a close family within the same community.  Something went wrong; something went wrong within the fabric of the community.  At some point in time the three or four Munyemvano men, brothers, were arrested by the military as being accomplices and they disappeared, presumably killed.  Juvénal Kajelijeli was the bourgmestre during that time period.  That soured the relationship between Kajelijeli and the Munyemvanos.  An animus developed.  They blamed Kajelijeli because he was the bourgmestre.  He said, "I have nothing to do with it."  

But what evidence do we have to support Kajelijeli's contention?  We have Tutsis who came here.  These are people who were saved, people who said Kajelijeli, during that same time period when there were allegations that he was -- in fact, he targeted particular members of the Munyemvano clan.  These are people who said Kajelijeli had taken steps to save Tutsis, put them at the house of appeal, put gendarmes in order to protect them, put gendarmes over in the area of Munyemvano's compound to protect them.  That is the testimony of witnesses, both Hutus and Tutsis, who came here.  ZLA, a Tutsi woman, she talked about that.  The Court can certainly reveal the and review the testimony with respect to that.  

At the precise time that the Munyemvanos were upset with Kajelijeli in the position of bourgmestre, we have testimony that he was in fact protecting and saving Tutsis.  And so there was an animus to put him in the mix.

	1700H
MR HINDS: 
The problem is, when you put someone in the mix, and you are dealing with life and death of that person, we have to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt.  The testimony that we have, based upon the Prosecution's witness, do not meet the minimum requirement of the burden of proof that Kajelijeli was at Munyenvano's compound or at Busogo parish.  And in our submissions, we have elaborated more on this; I'm not going to take any more time.  

But let me move quickly to the Defence case, because we didn't just simply point out the contradictions in the Prosecution case, because at this point, you can -- you can't decide who to believe.  If you believe GBG, you can't believe ACM.  If you believe ACM, you can't believe GBG.  Who do you believe?  Who is telling the truth?  Who is mistaken?  They are irreconciliably conflicting.  The Defence called but five witnesses concerning events at the parish.  The Defence called RHU23, who was a neighbour to the Munyenvanos.  I am not going to go any further than that.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does it concern the parish or concern the Munyenvano?
MR HINDS: 
I'm now into the Munyenvanos' compound, because they are -- there are two theories being advanced by the Prosecution, and we are saying they are both equally flawed, and so I'm looking at each of them; first, with respect to Munyenvano.  

RHU23, if you recall, he testified in terms of his location, where he lived in relation to Munyenvano at 
-- in September 25th, 2002, page 20, lines 27 to 30, and page 27 -- I'm sorry, page 21, lines 1 to 9, and he indicated the distance.  He indicated he can -- he could have seen into the compound, and he told us that early that morning, he didn't see anyone at that compound.  They had already left.  That was his testimony.  

We also called RHU25, but I also want to make reference to RHU23.  You recall his testimony concerning him, his going to ISAE, and leaving there and travelling down to the maize factory.  And the fact that when he tried to get there because of the crowd and mob and so on, he couldn't get through to retrieve his radio, he turned back, passed Nkuli on his bicycle.  He made an observation of passing Kajelijeli's house, his vehicle -- see his vehicle parked in this compound from the road.  But he testified with respect to Munyenvano's compound, no activity there, no shootings, no lootings, no burnings, no killings; RHU25.

RHU25 was -- who is he?  He worked with Gateyiteyi in the same location, same facility.  Gateyiteyi was a nurse and he has worked in another capacity.  He said they left work together the morning of the 7th, and he saw Gateyiteyi, both of them were together, and at some point, there were shootings and they started to run.  He saw Gateyiteyi being shot, and interestingly, you check his testimony.  The person he said who shot Gateyiteyi and killed him is the same person who ACM said shot him.  He didn't see Kajelijeli there.  He didn't see any killings going on, but at some point in time, when he saw Gateyiteyi shot, he ran back to the parish and he said that he made observations that that's where the attackers were assembling and he saw the leaders of the attackers.  Kajelijeli wasn't there.  

The Defence also called RHU29, and the Court recalls he was a Gacaca judge in Rwanda.  Now, these are people coming from all walks of life: There are Tutsi coming; there are individuals who are peasants and farmers; there are people who are intellectuals, all different walks of life and the Court was able to not only see their demeanour, but they were asked "Why did you come here?", and they said, "Because we believe this man is innocent", and they did not come with the blessings of the Rwandan government.  Many of them were under threats and they testified about it.  Many were fearful.  

RHU29 talked about his relationship where he lived vis-a-vis the Munyenvano compound, and he could see the compound.  And he also verified that there were no individuals there.  Question: "Where were they?"  "They had all taken refuge to the nuns' convent early that morning, the night before, but they had all vacated Munyenvano's compound".  And there is testimony throughout the trial substantiating the fact that when the news of the president's death occurred, there was fear, anxiety.  That is true.  Defence does not challenge that.  In fact, our own witnesses, even our own expert witness talked about the cycle of attacks by the RPF, retaliation by the population, and that cycle went from 1990 up to 1994 when there was overall explosion.  Our contention, and we get to that perhaps tomorrow morning on the issue of genocide, is that we take a different view of the evidence than the Prosecution.  But as to RHU29, he testified October 7th, 2002, page 19, lines 29 to 30 and page 20, lines 1 to 3, with respect to his ability to see and what he saw.  

The Chamber also recalls there was a young seminary student who attended the parish church.  And he testified and, of course, the Chamber is familiar with the map that he drew, and he testified that he was present at the parish during the attack on the nuns' convent.  If you look at KAA's testimony, December 4, 2002, page 7, lines 16 to 30, page 8, lines 1 to 26, but he talked about what he saw.  He, in fact, saw the attackers coming up from Rwankeri.  Kajelijeli was not among them.  He followed them, and the question was asked, "But why did you remain?  Why did you go? Didn't you know what they are about to do?"  He said, "Yes, I had the impression that they were about no good, but I went, I wanted to see what is going to happen."  He could have lost his life, but he went and he told us what he saw from beginning to end, and he saw a young child, he says, who was about to be killed and he yelled out, and he himself become -- became frightened because he thought he could be killed.  
So the Defence presented witnesses who were on the scene not giving conflicting stories about what occurred, coherent stories of what they saw, consistent.  They, in fact, told this Trial Chamber what they saw.  Not all of them saw the same things and not all from the same angle.  They came into the location from the different places.  KA came in with the group who were attacking, he said he was in the middle, but he saw them coming, and he hid until they passed and then he followed.  

RHU23, RHU25, they were not there, but they saw what didn't occur at Munyenvano's, contradicted both ACM and GBG.  RHU29 was right there.  None of these people saw Kajelijeli, but they could talk to you about and did provide testimony on different things they saw that morning, each of them contradicting the Prosecution case.  

The final witness was called by the Defence, MLCF.  MLCF who owned, managed a pharmacy, had some experience in medicine of some sort, he lived just up the path from where the attack at the ESTB took place.  MLCF testified that he was there, and we refer the Court to his testimony in December 5th, 2002, page 34, lines 2 to 6, and then December 10th, 2002, page 24, lines 20 to 23.  He said if Kajelijeli was there, he would have seen him.  He, in fact, was cross-examined by the Prosecutor concerning his knowledge of certain areas.  He testified about what he knew and testified about what he did not know.  When cross-examined with respect to what he saw and the fact that he just looked in and did nothing, he said, "This was a war zone, my training in whatever I was doing, never prepared me for this type of situation.  What I saw, it was horrible.  I thought everyone was killed".  It didn't dawn upon him to climb through the windows or whatever, to search among those who were wounded or who were dead, to find out those who, in fact, might be -- have some breath of life in them.  He said, "I was not trained for this type of situation".  But he said, "This is what happened; this is what I did.  I didn't do anything.  I didn't offer to help; I didn't -- I just went home after I saw this, but Kajelijeli was not there".  

The Prosecution relies upon uncorroborated and conflicting statements concerning Busogo.  Now, there is an allegation that after this killing that Kajelijeli went and celebrated at ISAE. What is the proof?  They submit the same witness who has already -- his credibility has been challenged, testimony unbelievable, GAO, and he says, "Well, we went to ISAE and we had beers".  Guess what?  RHU23 testified concerning why that was impossible.  I don't want to go in anymore to this, but I refer the Trial Chamber to paragraph 295 of our closing brief on that question.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Two nine five?
MR HINDS: 
Paragraph 295 of the Defence corrigendum of that brief, of why it was impossible for any meeting to have taken place of celebration at the canteen within ISAE.  We challenge that as a complete fabrication.  Prosecutor made similar allegations concerning celebrations in Nkuli, and whom do they rely on?  Again, the uncorroborated testimony of GDD, another witness whose credibility is seriously challenged, nobody else to support these allegations.  We urge the Trial Chamber to look at these testimonies with great care and caution.  And we ask the Trial Chamber to submit the Prosecutor -- to submit the Prosecutor's proof to rigorous examination.  When that is done, we will see that the Prosecutor has not met her burden of proving Kajelijeli's presence at Byangabo, at Rwankeri, at Munyenvano's compound, at the parish.  Looking at witnesses alone, they have not met their burden.  Looking at witnesses produced by the Defence, showing what happened there, even with more clarity than the Prosecution themselves, because we are not saying that killings didn't take place, but our witnesses showed more clarity about what actually occurred, not just taking people and putting them some place, and then the testimonies conflicting and not making sense.  We say the Prosecution have not met their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is not what is more likely or not, or maybe yes or maybe no; they have to prove that Kajelijeli was there beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.  

Now, let us proceed to rape.  This is a rape that took place when?  Supposedly, according to the Prosecutor; on April 7th, 1994.  What time?  Well, that is where the Prosecution has some problems.  Their witness, GDO, who made a statement on March 8th, 2000 -- now the Court recalls these statements and we have made reference to this -- all of the questions to rape came after the indictment of Kajelijeli.  They then went and tried to find these witnesses.  That's the problem of going to find witnesses after the fact.  It's an allegation, then, you go and try to find the witnesses.  Well, this witness was interviewed after many of the other witnesses had already given statements.  What problem does that create?  Well, timing.  We are not challenging in most of these cases whether these people were victims of horrible crimes.  That has never been our position.  Some of them, we are saying the context in which they now are talking about it and putting Kajelijeli in it, it creates problems for the Prosecution in their proofs.  But many of these people have been victimised.  Many of these individuals have been traumatised, but we cannot, in sympathy for these individuals, convict someone who is not responsible.  

All right, let's look at GDO. GDO gave us -- gave a statement on March 8, 2000.  She said that Kajelijeli came in a red Toyota pick-up.  Everybody got the red Toyota pick-up, but the problem with GDO's statement is that she gave it to representatives of the ICTR, their investigators, and they wrote down faithfully what they were told.  She said that Kajelijeli came at 4 a.m. in the morning, and she made an observation -- she made an observation; from her house she saw where he parked the car close to the Nyiragihima market.  Now, we have marked her statement and that is Defendant's Exhibit 5 in terms of what she said.  When confronted and we asked her, "Ma'am, did you tell representatives of the ICTR that you saw Kajelijeli's car at 4 a.m?"  She said, "No, I never told them that".  We had the statement read to her because she could not read or write.  She said, "I never said that.  If they put it down, they had it wrong".  "Well, what time was it?"  "I am not sure, but it was early in the morning.  It was daylight, you could see and I saw him".  Okay.  The Prosecution in their closing brief, arbitrarily picks a number and says 7 a.m., but that is not the proof in this case.  They have the burden of establishing the time beyond a reasonable doubt.  It isn't for the Defence to help them; it isn't for the Court to help them out.  That's their burden of establishing when they say Kajelijeli was where they say he was, committing crimes.  So they have 4 a.m. on one statement, they have another statement of the witness and she says, "Early in the morning, daylight, I can see".  

Well, we know that the Prosecution have Kajelijeli at 6:30 in the morning inciting people to go forward and kill Tutsi at Byangabo, if you are to believe GAO.  So, we notice that Byangabo, if you believe in GAO, and they say they see him there up until eight, 8:30 and then he gets into his vehicle, according to GBB, and where does he go?  GBB says, "I see him right there at Rwankeri, and there was a killing and he was standing right there, or in his van.  He is directing the Interahamwe to go left and right", so they say - - they say he leaves Rwankeri and he goes to Munyenvano.  He arrived there at 9:00, according to one witness; eight, another witness.  He goes and he comes back very shortly, according to one witness.  He comes at 9:00, goes and comes back between 9:00 and 10:00.  Now, the Prosecution says, maybe, it's a possibility that he might have run off, he could have sneaked off and be involved in this rape and sneak back in.  What is the problem with that picture?  The problem is that witness says Kajelijeli.  If we are to believe GDO, "He comes, I see him getting out of his car.  I see him talking to Interahamwe, and I heard him say, "I want you to find Tutsi women and rape them".  They have to find some time that is convenient.  If it isn't 4 a.m. and if it is 4 a.m., how could she see what she said she saw?  If it isn't 4 a.m., is it 5?  If it isn't 5, is it 6?  Is it 7?  What time are we talking about?  And whatever time they put on it, they have the same problem, reconciling it, because they have a seamless web of a theory: Kajelijeli going from one killing site to the next.  The problem is GDO is right in the middle and that hasn't been accounted for.  

GDO says she witnessed the rape and killing of her handicapped daughter, Budugari, and we looked at her testimony on July 18th, 2001, page 42, lines 7 to 22.  During the cross-examination, the Trial Chamber would recall, we asked that if she knew KNWA, and that is at reference -- well, she acknowledge, rather, knowing him as a neighbour, but denied that she had any discussions with him in 1999.  The Defence called, subsequently, on our case, KNWA.  You recall that witness.  The witness testified that he was a neighbour of GDO, and he testified that he had discussions with her when he, in fact, went back to Rwanda from exile.  At that time, she never mentioned Kajelijeli.  She, in fact, never mentioned linking him to any of the killings.  She, in fact, indicated that she knew -- found out who, in fact, had killed her daughter.  And, according to KNWA, she, in fact, informed him that the witness told him -- told her that she learnt that Ngendahayo had done so.  This witness says that it was impossible for someone at GDO's house to see a car parked at either the church or in Nyiragihima Centre, and he did so at his testimony at November 28th, 2002, page 55, lines 14 and 15.  

Your Honour, I would like to finish up with this, if I can.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MR HINDS: 
Just take a few minutes to finish up with this.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, go on, Counsel.  Then we'll take a break -- we'll adjourn rather than take a break.
MR HINDS:  
Now, KNWA testified that he knew GDO's children, and he testified that he had met Budugari just a few days before the death of the president in April 1994, and he saw her in the vicinity of the Catholic Church.  Now, this was a witness who was seriously handicapped.  All of the witnesses testified with respect to the nature of her handicap.  This witness testified, of course, he was in the military; he was armed; he was injured while in military service, but at that time, he was home on leave.  And he testified that he knew GDO, and he, in fact, didn't know at that time where GDO specifically was, but he knew that GDO was not in the vicinity.  She was not in the area.  She previously some time before had, in fact, been - - had left the area and left the area with other children.  We had testimony that the handicapped child was educated, or had -- was in a boarding school just for handicapped children.  But at that particular time in April, this witness could not tell where the child was staying, what was the circumstance of her being in the area.  The Court will recall that testimony concerning the name of that particular centre was Gataragara -- Gatagara Handicapped Centre.  Let me just spell it, 
G-A-T-A-G-A-R-A.  That was a centre for handicapped children.

Your Honour, I think I can stop here.  I just have probably another 10 or 15 minutes in this area, but since I'm dealing with rapes and I will -- I have to deal with about three other areas, it doesn't make sense for me to hold the Trial Chamber and I have to come back tomorrow and deal with this same general subject.  So my suggestion, unless the Court wants to proceed differently, is that we stop at this point and I pick up, wrap up this area and then move to the next.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we would stop here and tomorrow we start -- you start addressing the question of Budugari, and that's where we start tomorrow.
MR HINDS: 
Yes.  Your Honour, I have just been pointed - it's just been pointed out to me that there is a problem in translation.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, in which language, French or - -?
MR HINDS: 
In French, I am told.  And the problem is the translator said "Byangabo" and not "Nyiragihima", where the car was stationed.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you mentioned Nyiragihima and, of course, the church.
MR HINDS: 
That is correct.  That is correct.  So, if -- if it comes out differently in the French, then I'm afraid that Judge Ramaroson is going to be completely out of kilter with the rest of us.  What is the Judge saying? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
She understands.
MR HINDS: 
All right, Your Honour, with that note, we would rest at this point.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  All right, we'll stop here and adjourn these proceedings till tomorrow morning at 9:00.  So until then, 9 o'clock in the morning, these proceedings stand adjourned.  
MR HINDS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.
