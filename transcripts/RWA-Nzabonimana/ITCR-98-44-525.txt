MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday the 16th of November 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours.  Chantal Hounkpatin, counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I am with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and my assistant, Marina Yetongnon, and my two investigators as well.  Frédéric Weyl, my co-counsel, will be with us in a moment in the course of the proceedings.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Ms. Hounkpatin, the status of the witness who is here now, this is a 92 bis witness who is here for cross-examination.  Has he waived his right to protection?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
That indeed is the case, Mr. President.  And I would request that you ask him for the confirmation.  But he has renounced the protection -- protective measures.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, madam.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says witness.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, if I may, I just want to advise the witness that he ought to have answered, "Good morning, Mr. President".  Later on you will be speaking to counsel.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber had made an order for your protection on security grounds.  One element of it was that your identity should be concealed from the public.  We have been informed that your situation has changed and that those provisions are no longer required, and that you are now willing to testify openly.  

What is the position, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, what I've come here to say is what I experienced and what I know.  I therefore feel free to speak in open session and to tell the truth openly and be seen by everybody.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Have you testified in any other cases before the Tribunal?  
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President, this is the first time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We revoke the protection order that we made in favour of this witness.  
THE WITNESS:
So I renounce the protective measures so that the whole world can see me telling the truth.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin to testify you must take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by Andrew Muhire in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you were required to attend the Court to be cross-examined on a written statement which you made.  But we will allow Ms. Hounkpatin just to introduce you to the Court, and then you will be cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, following what you have just said, I wish to indicate that statement 92 bis of Mr. Andrew Muhire was certified yesterday, and I would request that this document be taken note of because the Prosecutor will cross-examine on the basis of that in a moment.  That is the first thing I want to bring to the attention of the Court.  

Secondly, the identification sheet of the witness. 
ANDREW MUHIRE,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Muhire, you have a document before you entitled identification -- identification sheet.  You have your personal data on that document, your name, Muhire, André, date -- place of birth, name of your parents.  Please scan through the document very quickly and tell the Court if there are any corrections to be made.  Point out the corrections to be made in the margin, and then sign and date the document so we can admit it onto the records.  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	16th.  16th November.  
A.	It is fine.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Issa, can you collect that document.  

And I request that the document be admitted onto the record and marked.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We admit in evidence the witness's identification sheet, and we also admit in evidence the 92 bis statement that he has made.  
MR. MJUI:
The information sheet will be D. NG158, one-five-eight.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG158 admitted) 
MR. MJUI:
And the statement will be D. NG159, one-five-nine.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG159 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, before I give the floor to my learned colleague, I would like to give some advice to Mr. Muhire to guide his testimony.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Muhire, you will be cross-examined by counsel on the other side of the aisle.  First of all, you should listen to the question that is put to you.  Pause for a while before answering so that the interpreters can correctly interpret you.  Otherwise this will create an overlap and there will be a confusion.  In any event, don't be -- don't answer too hastily.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, you are now subject to cross-examination by the Prosecutor, and you will now have to respond to questions put by the Prosecutor.  
MS. WILSON: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Defence team, members of the public, everyone.  

This morning I have in fact distributed two documents, and I've asked Mr. Issa to pass it on to the Bench.  One is dated the 3rd of September 2001, and the other the 4th and 5th of September 2001.  Unfortunately, these are only available in English.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Good morning again, to you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	My name is Maria Wilson, and I am one of the Prosecutors in this team.  

Now, on the 9th of April 1994, you gave a statement to Mathieu Ngirumpatse's Defence team.  Correct?  
A.	I think on the 9th April 1994 I was in Rwanda and I could not have done that.  
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Issa, if you would assist in -- put -- providing the witness with the statement, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Wilson.  
MS. WILSON: 
Yes.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
It came across that you suggested the statement was made on the 9th of April 1994.  
MS. WILSON: 
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I'm much grateful to Mr. Witness (sic).  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	On the 9th April 2010 you made a statement to Mr. Ngirumpatse's Defence team, correct?  
A.	Correct.  
Q.	And you authorised that team to present that statement at this trial, correct?  
A.	That indeed is the case, madam.  That is correct.  
Q.	And as indicated by Defence counsel, you certify that statement as true and correct on the 15th of November 2010.  Yes?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Since you knew this statement was being used in defence of Ngirumpatse, you agree that you would have included in that statement all the information you had in your possession about Ngirumpatse.  Is that correct?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And this would include a full account of the circumstances under which you came to know Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Now -- so it is true that you came to know him, according to that statement, when he was your client and you -- at the abattoir in Rwanda where you were a director.  
A.	The first time that's where I saw him.  But I did not stop there.  I saw him, and saw him again, tens -- or, several times at various places.  And since he was a public figure, I was able to meet him at different levels and under different hats.  
Q.	But you agree that in the statement you merely referred to getting to know him whilst you were the director of that abattoir in Rwanda.  
A.	I indicated that the first time I knew him, but that did not prevent me that subsequently I continued to see him.  As you would imagine, as a Christian, I went to Mass from time to time, and he was running a famous choir.  Therefore I could not but see him.  But I could not ask to identify him on such occasions because I knew him.  Thank you.  
Q.	So are you saying that you would see him in church, but the only time you had the opportunity to interact with him was whilst you were a director of that abattoir?  
A.	No, madam.  What I'm telling you is that I met him several times.  I do not want to come back to the meaning of the word "meet".  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  And whatever that relationship was, you said that you never had cause to go to Mathieu Ngirumpatse's home.  That is true, is it not?  
A.	That's correct, madam.  
Q.	Now, let me move on.  You were in Nyamirambo throughout the conflict?  
A.	Which conflict?  Which conflict are you talking about?  There were several conflicts.  
Q.	Okay, okay, I will clarify.  Were you in Nyamirambo during the conflict in Rwanda between April and July of 1994?  
A.	Between April -- well, let's say that I left Nyamirambo in April -- April.  But the -- when the conflict broke out I was there.  
Q.	When did you eventually leave Rwanda? 
A.	Well, leaving Rwanda, I left Rwanda for the first time when I was a young person and I went to Italy to study.  Are you relating to the period June/July?  Are you referring to that period, the period you mentioned?  
Q.	Sorry, sorry, let me be more precise.  Between April and July, you said that in April -- sorry, you said that in April you were in Nyamirambo.  
A.	That's correct, Counsel.  
Q.	During the period of that conflict, did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	From April to July I was in Rwanda, Counsel.  
Q.	And after July, did you eventually leave Rwanda?  
A.	Of course, here I am in Tanzania.  I am no longer in Rwanda.  I have left Rwanda.  
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda after the conflict -- after July?  
A.	After the month of July, I continued hiding here and there.  And, in fact, I would say that it was several years later on that I was able to cross the border in order to go to Malawi.  I cannot know exactly; I do not remember the exact date because the years -- many years have elapsed.  What was important at that time was for me to hide myself and not to allow myself to be killed.  
Q.	Okay.  I know it's difficult to remember the precise date, but can you give us at least the month and the year when you crossed the border for Malawi?  
A.	I think that was about ten years ago.  If it is necessary for me to go and check the dates, I could do that.  But right now I am embarrassed; I cannot remember the date, the day, and the exact month.  I arrived in Malawi in November 2001.  That is what I do remember.  But how I left Rwanda, how I went here and there, how I hid in various places and what I did, in fact, that is a difficult mental exercise in view of the time that has elapsed, and also considering that the events in question cause us pain when we remember them.  
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  So, before arriving in Malawi in November 2001, you said you -- you were hiding here and there.  That's correct?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Let me take you back to Nyamirambo.  You said that you were there in April of 1994.  Was that the only month that you were in Nyamirambo?  
A.	I think it was the only month.  Why?  Because on the first occasion when I had the opportunity to leave Nyamirambo, I did so in a great hurry because I had also been a victim of the malpractices that occurred there.  I hurried out of it -- out of Nyamirambo immediately.  In one month, I left.  
Q.	And when you left, where did you go?  
A.	When I left Nyamirambo, I took the mount Kigali road.  I found myself in rivière, and thereafter I continued via Gitarama.  I passed via Kirinda and I arrived in my village on the same day.  
Q.	And whilst you were in Nyamirambo, you would have had the opportunity to see the roadblocks throughout the area -- that area.  Correct?  
A.	I would say that in Nyamirambo town, there were perhaps two or three roadblocks.  But there was something else there.  I saw places where people had assembled.  I saw those places.  If that is what you are referring to as roadblocks, I do not know.  
Q.	What were the two or three roadblocks you recall existing in Nyamirambo?  
A.	In Nyamirambo there was a roadblock, a real roadblock at the Muslim college.  It is -- it was -- that place is a little bit far in relation to my village.  But there was a roadblock there.  I am sure I saw it.  I remember it because I went to get a sick person from the hospital.  And I crossed that roadblock which was really a roadblock.  
Q.	And apart from that roadblock, you -- were there others?  You mentioned two or three.  
A.	The others were not roadblocks.  It may be necessary to describe to you what I am referring to.  At the time a certain event occurred -- 
Q.	Mr. -- Mr. Witness, let me ask you a question in relation to the roadblock that you spoke about.  The roadblock at Muslim college, was that roadblock manned by civilians?  
A.	I did not see any soldiers there when I passed.  That is what I can say, because a soldier is always dressed in uniform.  Otherwise I can assume that they were civilians.  I did not know exactly whether there were -- those people were there -- those people who were there were either soldiers or civilians.  I did not check them, because I was trembling as I was passing.  And I had a problem crossing.  During the day I was targeted by bombs.  
Q.	Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, it would be helpful if you simply answered the question.  Thank you so much.  

So, those -- that roadblock was manned by persons in civilian clothing, you said.  Did you observe if these people were armed with guns?  
A.	I repeat that I did not see neither guns nor any other weapon.  Partly because I was trembling, and also because I had to cross avoiding the daylight, and also as not to be lynched by people at the roadblock.  In fact, I passed at dusk when it was getting dark.  I could not identify people or any weapons, if at all they had them.  But they did not show me any weapons.  
Q.	And if you did not see any weapons, why did you fear being lynched at the roadblock?  
A.	Because a lot was said about those people, and there was every reason to be afraid.  If you heard that someone had died there and you did not fear or become afraid, then you would not be a normal person. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, you're saying that you heard about people who had died there -- is that what you're saying -- and that's what created fear for you.  
A.	That's indeed what I said, Counsel.  I was afraid of going there because all those who came from there said that the roadblock was terrible, that there was a terrible roadblock there in Nyamirambo.  So there was every reason to fear, especially when you heard bullets flying from everywhere and bombs exploding from one hill to another in Kigali.  
Q.	And those people who you heard died at those roadblocks, what created the fear was, they didn't just die, they were killed.  That's what you heard, wasn't it?  
A.	I do not know how the manoeuvres were done at the roadblock.  Were people killed there?  That is possible.  But I did not see any dead body at the roadblock.  Or were the people taken somewhere else to be killed?  I do not know.  But it was said that the roadblock was terrible, the roadblock at the Muslim college.  
Q.	And you heard that people died or were killed there.  Do you know how -- did you hear from others how they were killed?  If you didn't see it yourself, did you hear from others?  
A.	Counsel, I was never a witness of the killings at the roadblocks.  But I can testify about other killings.  
Q.	But my question was -- I am aware that you were not a witness.  But did you hear from others of persons being killed at the roadblock?  And, if so, by what means?  
A.	It was quite difficult to find someone who would come and tell you that such-and-such a person was killed by this-or-that person under various -- different conditions.  Perhaps we will agree if you can change the scene so that I can talk about the events which I personally experienced or witnessed.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, we might come back to that.  But was it difficult -- was it -- wasn't it difficult to pass through those roadblocks because the people -- persons who manned it, they were checking identification cards of individuals?  
A.	Yes and no.  The people manning the roadblock, they wanted to know the reason why the people crossing the roadblocks were travelling.  Do not forget that there was a curfew, and that strange killings had occurred.  And under those circumstances you could be presumed as someone who's going to kill.  So you had to say where you were coming from and where you were going to.  And whenever it was possible they would verify your identity.  That is what happened to me.  
Q.	And by verifying a person's identity, you mean checking to see what ethnic group you belonged to.  Do you agree?  
A.	I don't think so, because at the time I went to the hospital to pick up someone who had been wounded, I was accompanied by a woman whom -- who was clearly Tutsi, and that was written on her IDD (sic) card.  Nevertheless, she was not threatened for that.  She was not molested at all for being Tutsi.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, apart from that roadblock, were you aware that there were roadblocks in Gitega and ONATRACOM?  The first one is G-I-T-E-J -- G-A, Gitega.  
A.	Probably it is pronounced Gitega. 
Q.	Yes, thank you for your assistance.  Did you hear of a roadblock on that -- in that area?  
A.	I heard about it, Counsel.  I also heard about the roadblock at Nyabugogo.  I heard about that roadblock.  But, to be candid, I do not know anything.  I never wanted to go close to those roadblocks, so I do not have any information that could be relied upon.  
Q.	So, over the period you were in Rwanda, how many roadblocks did you see during that conflict period?  
A.	I saw the roadblock that I talked to you about, the Nyamirambo roadblock; I saw another roadblock behind mount Kigali when I were returning home; I saw yet another roadblock at Runda; there was another roadblock at Nyabarongo, near my home.  That is about 10 kilometres from my home.  And that is all I saw as roadblocks.  
Q.	And those roadblocks that you saw, they were manned by civilians; do you agree?  Civilians and other persons.  But do you agree that civilians manned those roadblocks?  
A.	All the roadblocks that I saw were manned by people who were not in any uniform whatsoever.  
Q.	And -- 
A.	Therefore, it can be assumed that they were civilians.  
Q.	Yes.  And you saw so many roadblocks.  You agree that you must have seen those civilians -- some of those civilians armed at those roadblocks that you mentioned.  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And they were armed with guns or traditional weapons? 
A.	All sorts of weapons, Counsel.  
Q.	And you agree that these civilians who were armed with all these sorts of weapons used these weapons to kill civilians?  
A.	I am not sure of that, because behind mount Kigali, when I arrived there at the river, it was a soldier, a colonel who was being dragged in the mud.  His rank was visible.  Now you are telling me that civilians were maltreated and killed, but the person -- the first person I saw was a soldier, armed, who was accompanied by an escort of more than five people who were also disarmed. 
Q.	Thank you.  If I can go back to your answer when you said that these people were armed with all sorts of weapons, can you tell me if that included guns?  
A.	I said all sorts of weapons.  Perhaps not cannons, but guns, yes, I saw.  I saw guns. 
Q.	Okay.  Do you mind assisting me in describing the other types of weapons?  You saw it, so it would be helpful.  Besides the guns.  
A.	Apart from guns -- well, I looked at guns more because I was afraid.  But I would say that there were machetes, clubs, particularly machetes and clubs because these are weapons people had in their homes.  
Q.	And these civilians were what you referred to as Interahamwe; do you agree?  These civilians who you saw at those roadblocks.  
A.	I would like to enlighten the Court perhaps as regards not who I was but who the Interahamwe were.  Because there were three phases of the Interahamwe.  Which Interahamwe are you referring to?  The Interahamwes before the war, after the war, or the Interahamwe of the 1960s?  The word "Interahamwe" evolved from 1960 and right up to today.  We can distinguish three periods of the Interahamwe.  Which Interahamwes are you referring to?  
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  I would like you to tell me if the persons you saw, the civilians at the roadblocks during the conflict, that's between April and July, if they were in fact Interahamwe za MRND?  
A.	If you want to bring the MRND and Interahamwe closer, then you are talking about the period prior to the death of Habyarimana.  Whereas, after the death of President Habyarimana, the Interahamwe took on a different meaning.  And if you would allow me to shed more light on this, I would do so, so that we know exactly who the Interahamwes were.  And I am asking, therefore, for leave for me to shed light on this. 
Q.	I would like to first ask you if the group of persons you saw at the roadblocks, if they included the Interahamwe za MRND?  There could have been other people as well, but whether it included the Interahamwe za MRND?  
A.	Interahamwe za MRND had a uniform.  They had their zebra-like uniform.  At the time I went from mount Kigali and I met people who were at the roadblock, nothing could indicate to me what their identity was.  Nothing could suggest that they were Interahamwe za MRND.  Interahamwe za MRND knew how to dance, but I did not see anyone dance except dancing to perhaps disturb people.  

Interahamwe -- the Interahamwe who made themselves known are perhaps those who came to assassinate me in Nyamirambo, even though they may not at all have been Interahamwe.  Therefore, I could not -- at the time I was so afraid, I could not go and ask anyone, "Are you Interahamwe or not?"  

How would I have been able to recognise somebody just by looking at them?  Be careful.  Amongst them you had people of all hues, people of all ranks, people of all backgrounds.  You had workers, you had labourers, perhaps you had old people, young people, and so on.  You also had bandits, I would imagine.  Therefore, you could not know who they were.  Therefore, trying to find out closely who they were would not have given me the opportunity to survive.  

Therefore, who was able -- who told you that there were Interahamwe -- or, whoever told you that he identified the Interahamwe would be a big liar.

1015H 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, so what you are saying is that you're not in a position to identify the persons who were at the roadblock; correct? 
A.	Counsel, I confirm that it was impossible to identify them unless you had known them before. 
Q.	And -- and did you know any members of the Interahamwe before -- before the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, I am telling you that, personally, I saw the Interahamwe dancing.  Amongst them you had people, all well known, like Kajuga, Robert.  He did not know me but I could see him because he was someone well known.  

However, I did not personally know even one Interahamwe in person.  I knew that those people, after the army, they came to get food supplies in my place and on such occasions they have been in civilian clothes, they never said that they were Interahamwe.  And I have been told that other members of other parties came.  I could not, beforehand, say that this or that person is Interahamwe.  The only surprising occasion was when I saw people coming to tell me that they were coming to kill me and that they said they were Interahamwe. 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So if you're not able to identify them, Interahamwes, because they were not wearing uniforms, then you can't deny that the Interahamwe could have been present at those roadblocks? 
A.	Oh, certainly I cannot deny that because I did not verify -- I had no means of verifying.  There was even no reason for me to dwell on that, on checking who was Interahamwe or not. 
Q.	And according to your statement you were not affiliated to any political party.  Is that not true? 
A.	That is the case, madam, correct. 
Q.	And as a person who was not affiliated to any political party, you could not have identified even who was an Interahamwe before the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	If I were to tell you that I knew the word Interahamwe in '61,'62 I would have heard it from the MRND, and also after the assassination of the president.  And you are telling me that I would have not have known what it meant.  For somebody who is an intellectual, who meets a lot of people coming for supplies, civilian soldiers, and to tell you that I never knew about the Interahamwe or I did not know about their existence, that would be wrong.  That would be wrong if I were to tell that the Interahamwe did not exist or never existed. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, what is your ethnicity? 
A.	Well, my ethnic group is Hutu. 
Q.	And you will at least agree with me that during the conflict between 6th of April and July 1994, Tutsis were -- was -- they were the group that was mainly targeted during that conflict.  
A.	Do you want me to give you a concise description so that you get to know what happened?  Do you allow me to do that?  
Q.	I am simply asking you whether you agree that the majority of persons who were targeted, they were, in fact, Tutsis. 
A.	Madam, at the beginning of the conflict, this is -- this was not the case.  The first people to be killed were Hutus.  Subsequently, if you were to tell me it was extended to the Tutsi, that is true, Tutsis and Hutus together.  Now, to know the percentage you have to be there to count -- to -- to take a headcount.  But in the beginning it was the Hutus and I can give you the names. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am not asking you at the beginning.  I'm looking at the whole period between April and July of 1994.  Most of the victims were, in fact, Tutsis.  Do you agree? 
A.	I'm not at all convinced, Counsel.  There were killings of Hutus, Tutsi -- Tutsis, all of them together.  And among the killers, there were Hutus and killers (sic) as well everywhere in Kigali town, and even along the way to my place.  At the end of the conflict the number of people who died, it's difficult to know whether they were mainly Hutus or Tutsi.  The one who tell you -- I don't know what -- the one who tell the truth -- the truth, I don't know where he will get it.  Everywhere there were Hutus and
	Tutsis -- everywhere there were Hutus dying, there were Tutsis among the killers, everywhere there were Tutsis dying, there were Hutus among the killers.  

	So it was not possible for a normal person who did not direct these killings to know the number of people -- the maximum number of people who were killed. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You must have been aware of the killings of Tutsis that took place in the -- in Saint André's College.  Are you not? 
A.	This is a -- a story that I heard much later.  I did not get to know this when I was in Nyamirambo because, the first week, there was electricity and telephone --
Q.	Thank you for that answer.  And apart from those killings you would have heard of other killings of Tutsis in the area that you were in.  Nyari -- yes?  Nyamirambo.  
A.	Yes, the first killings took place in front of my house.  And it was a Tutsi family, but there were more than five Hutu young men in the group.  That is, those who were killed. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, you are certain that you had no affiliation whatsoever with any political party? 
A.	I confirm that I never possessed a party membership card.  I never tried to be appointed as a secretary or any other position in any political party.  I was a trader, and a brewer, and I brewed for everybody. 
Q.	Why did you feel the need to be in hiding for so long?  You said until 2001. 
A.	Let me tell you why.  The day after the death of the president it was said that everyone should remain indoors.  That is, behind closed doors.  But I was surprised that on the second day a group came to me and was referring to each of us "Interahamwe".  My entire family was brought out and everyone was sitting there.  Someone, possibly the highest ranking among them, if they had ranks, said:  "Lie down so that I can -- so that I can shoot you."  So I told him to look me in the eyes, and if you can kill me looking at me, then do so.  He looked at me and he fired a shot; one by my left ear and the other one by my right ear and he -- he called on his friends to leave.  

	And since that day, madam, I got scared of everybody and nobody, and I could not at all go out because I was frightened by the fact that this man who tried -- threatened to kill me, I used to -- I see him in my imagination.  And later on I realised that he was a Hutu and that we were part of the military congress of 1969. 
Q.	Okay.  Okay, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But why continue to hide after July of 1994?  Some seven years after you continued to be in hiding.  
A.	I went into hiding, and that's just a way of putting it, because in the interim the administration had killed my younger brother, whereas my sister had been killed earlier by people referred to as Interahamwe.  So it was not a joke to go and show myself. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...the last bit of the evidence.  Your sister was?  What were you saying about your sister?  She was killed?  
A.	My brother (sic) was killed by people calling themselves Interahamwes before the arrival of the RPF.  But after the arrival of the RPF my younger brother was also killed by the RPF.  So I said to myself that this was not the time to show myself in public.  To go and show myself in areas where I was known for people to say this person is so-and-so. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know someone by the name of Rwamigabo?  R-W-A-M-I-G-A-B-O.  
A.	Neither during my schooling days, nor during my -- the period -- that period of my trading activities, or during the war, before the war, or after the war did I meet anyone with that name.  I never saw anyone bearing the name Rwamigabo. 
Q.	His first name was A-S-S-U-M-A-N-I, Assumani.  Does that name ring a bell? 
A.	Assumani, I can't recall any such name.  Selemani, yes, but Assumani, no.  
Q.	And the person's nickname is Kipembe?  K-I-P-E-M-B-E. 
A.	Kipembe.  
Q.	Yes.  Do you know anyone by that name? 
A.	Never heard any such name, or nickname, Kipembe.  Neither at the abattoir, where we used nicknames a lot, nor in the industry that I direct, I never had any Kipembe. 
Q.	This person was a businessman and he sold charcoal and he did that at the marketplace in the area where you live, Nyamirambo.  You still don't know him? 
A.	On the one hand, I did not use charcoal.  Secondly, I didn't go to the market, so I wouldn't go to the market and meet somebody called Kipembe, because I would have had to go and buy charcoal at least once.  I was connected to a three-phase electricity, and until I left there was never a disconnection. 
Q.	Thank you.  The reason why I'm asking you this is because such a person gave a statement to the OTP, and in discussing roadblocks they stated that you were involved in the setting up of roadblocks.  What do you have to say about that? 
A.	My answer is that this person, this man is saying what he wants to say.  He wants to change the order of things, refer to the earth as heaven and heaven as the earth.  Between him and myself there was the regional stadium and a long distance.  We did not belong to the same village.  We did not have the same situation.  I could not go all the way -- he could not climb all the way to my place or me go down to his place.  How would he have know that I erected a roadblock if he did not come to my area?  

When you say a neighbourhood -- when you say Nyamirambo, it's quite big.  But I was in the Rwezamenio cellule and he was in the Nyamirambo -- Nyamirambo cellule and I never set foot there.  And none of the inhabitants of that place ever came to our place, so how did he know?  He told you that he came to Nyamirambo, or, Rwezamenio cellule, and that he saw me at the roadblocks?  
Q.	Mr. Witness, he lived in Nyakabanda secteur.  But we have your response. 

Do you know someone by the name of Patrice Ufitese?  And the surname is spelt U-F-I-T-E-S-E. 
A.	I have searched through my mind, and even if I should eliminate Patrice, I never knew anyone bearing the name Ufitese, never.  I never heard anyone called Ufitese.  This is the first time I'm hearing this as being a name of a person. 
MS. WILSON:  
Mr. President, I observe that the time is a time we usually take a break.  I'm almost at the end. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Do you want to complete?  You have about four or five minutes left. 
MS. WILSON:
Okay.  Great.  Thank you. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, this person has a nickname, Lumumba.  L-U-M-U-M-B-A.  
A.	I do not know -- I do not know any Lumumba.  Even at the time I used to go to the Congo I never met someone called Lumumba, or who had the nickname Lumumba.  Perhaps -- well, these may be people who existed, but we were not in -- evolving (sic) in the same sphere of activities.  But Ufitese was never one of my workers at the abattoir.  Among my workers at Nyamirambo, or my clients, I never met someone by that name. 
Q.	This person also knew Callixte Mbarushimana.  Do you know such a person? 
A.	Callixte Mbarushimana?  
Q.	In any event, at page 3 of this witness's statement, in relation to roadblocks, they indicated that there were three roadblocks established in Nyamirambo.  And they stated that one was outside Mbarushimana's house and another was outside your house.  And they refer to you in brackets as "another Interahamwe leader".  Do you have any comment to make to that statement? 
A.	What this witness said perhaps was a dream, because in front of my house there was no roadblock.  In front of me there was Bamwanga.  In front of my house there was another person.  Behind my house there was someone who had died, he was a veterinary officer.  So where I lived it was impossible to set up a roadblock simply because there was no road that led to somewhere else.  The road that was there was at the level of the baobab tree.  So if he's going to claim there was a roadblock, even though one had to cross four or five houses to get to my place and that this was on the major road, I think that person is making a mistake. 
Q.	Thank you.  Last question:  You said that you were in hiding until 2001.  Were you ever accused or investigated for genocide-related crimes of 1994? 
A.	When you are identified -- when you are being investigated, you are gone.  Perhaps if an investigation was done it was perhaps during my absence.  Or even before, if people targeted me.  But in any case, I was never targeted or informed that there was an investigation against me concerning genocide.  I never heard about the fact that I was being investigated. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MS. WILSON:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  These are all my questions for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We'll take a mid-morning recess.  

And, Ms. Hounkpatin, did you have any redirect?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes.  Mr. President, I would have one or two questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We'll take the mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1042H to 1122H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, you may conduct the redirect of this witness. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Muhire, during the cross-examination, the Prosecutor asked you a question about the Interahamwe.  You wanted to explain the meaning of the term Interahamwe prior to the death of
	President Habyarimana and after the death of President Habyarimana.  

Can you now explain to the Chamber -- you did not have the opportunity then -- you didn't have the opportunity to -- to say what you wanted to say then.  Can you now tell the Chamber what the word "Interahamwe" meant prior to the death of President Habyarimana. 
A.	Thank you.  Prior to the death of the president, Interahamwe was a word taken over after independence.  That is to say between 1960 -- from '60 -- 1961, '62, where the winning -- the victorious party that considered itself democratic was in -- it was supported by the Interahamwe.  They meant, by that, people who have opted for the same political vision, the same political work.  When -- up until then when we hear that word, which was taken over by the young people who were there in uniform to dance during political events as cheerleaders, well we laughed it off but we thought that it was -- it was good.  This was -- these -- they were young people, most of them between 18, 19, 25.  People who -- young people who were well dressed, well -- well organised and they used to come to my place to buy drinks for their colleagues during ceremonies.  I saw them and I was impressed by their rendition.  So before the death of President Habyarimana that was the situation. 
Q.	Now, the follow up to my question is:  After the death of President Habyarimana, the term "Interahamwe", what did you want to say about the term "Interahamwe"? 
A.	After the death of President Habyarimana, the word appeared to me as somebody who wanted to kill me, because these people calling themselves Interahamwe came, themselves, carrying Kalashnikovs, wearing military -- old military uniforms, and they were telling us that they were Interahamwe.  And I said this was not possible.  Well, they did not kill me then and I had -- still had some time.  So I said that they -- those who called themselves Interahamwe, in most of the cases did not even have a third of them being real Interahamwe.  

	Some time later another group came, when they came to kill the then prime minister of Rwanda who was called Makuza, Bernard.  We were surprised to hear that the Interahamwe want to kill Makuza, Bernard -- they wanted to kill Makuza Bernard, except that the local population went -- intervened to protect Bernard.  

I myself went to see the Interahamwe.  There was a young man, well built, and two young men, and then there -- there were babies, people I would call babies, that is, about 12 year old.  And I said I have seen Interahamwe who were young, well built and now they are calling these people Interahamwe.  

Now, to be able to save Bernard, people suggested that they should bring them together, the attackers and the victim and I --give them a drink.  Fortunately, he was saved.  Now, after they gave them something to drink they started interviewing them.  We were very surprised to hear them say -- and this by the one who was leading the Interahamwe who was saying that:  "I am a native of Kibuye, how come you don't know me?  Kibuye, which commune?"  And he told us that he is from the Kibuye commune.  And there we looked at each other, took -- and we understood that that person -- person was not from Kibuye at all and that his Kinyarwanda was not real Kinyarwanda.  

So we were wondering who were these people calling themselves Interahamwe.  I told you that I went through the roadblock behind Mount Kigali.  The people I found there did not look like those I saw who came to me to buy drinks for their Interahamwe friends.  There were children among them, 12/14 years, and there were old people of 60 years and above.  There were a few young persons.  And the brutality that they were exhibiting made me understood that they were calling themselves Interahamwe, but they were not Interahamwe.  All these young persons who left the city and went to the rural environments were calling themselves Interahamwe. 

They saw all the roadblocks in the -- the cities and they erected roadblocks in their villages.  And these roadblocks were dangerous.  They were killing, or stealing, to eliminate, or, for reasons of pre-existing conflicts.  And that is why the country went through a serious problem, because that started in 
Kigali town.  And let me say that the Interahamwe killed targeted persons.  I have given you two examples.  Let me give you one more definitive one.  There was a man in Gikondo who had a son who worked in the presidency and who had another who was an Interahamwe.  That man was unfortunate that, after the death of the president, two days after the death, that is exactly the day they visited me, he was visited by the ten Interahamwe and his wife was eliminated, his children were eliminated, and he himself was gunned down. 

Now, in a family that you have an Interahamwe, the other Interahamwe who come to kill in a family that you have somebody working in the president's office, you have some -- you have Interahamwe who come to eliminate, that is where we understood that there was an invisible hand in the background that was sending these people called Interahamwes who were not Interahamwes, they were to carry out targeted killings.  And these targeted killings included Hutus, Tutsis, north, south.  And the idea was to get the north and the south to fight.  But that did not take place.  But what, rather, took place is all the young people who came back joined the Interahamwe bandwagon.  There were the bandits, the street people, there were also the mayibobo -- mayibobo, the children -- these are children who walk about the streets.  So when they go to the hills it is to steal, to settle their conflicts, previous conflicts. 

Unfortunately, there were a lot of Tutsis who were involved, just as there were many Hutus.  It is difficult today to know who was controlling them.  But it is a stronger, invisible hand than the one you normally see. 

The armed persons were the Rwandan armed forces, the RPF army, but we did not believe that there was another group with weapons.  So that is the Interahamwe that I saw after the death of 
President Habyarimana. 

Why did this happen?  Because -- 
Q.	Mr. Muhire, I know that you can give us -- you can speak extensively about this crisis that you lived through.  I think the Chamber has understood the nuance or the clarification that you wanted to make about this time.  So I would like to thank you for your assistance to the Tribunal. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
I am done, Mr. President. 

At the same time, Mr. President, I would like to make a request for him to be able to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I mean, I wish to apply for you to grant the authorisation for him to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin. 

Mr. Witness, your testimony is now concluded before the Tribunal.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You are now excused and you're free to go.  Now, the registrar will make arrangements to grant the request made by counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused) 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, what's the status of this witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, this witness has also sought to testify in his own name as an unprotected witness.  I would like you to seek confirmation from him for the purposes of the records. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The Chamber previously understood that it was necessary to make a protective order for security reasons in your favour.  But we have now been advised that the situation is no longer -- warrants that and that you're willing to testify openly so that your identity can be revealed to the public.  What is your position?  
THE WITNESS:
I confirm that I do not have any problem testifying in open session. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Have you given evidence before in the Tribunal -- in any other case in this Tribunal?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  This is the first time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We make the order rescinding the protective order that we've made in favour of this witness. 

Mr. Witness, before you testify you have to give an oath to tell -- take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by Donatien Nshimyumuremyi in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Now, Mr. Witness, you have been brought here to be cross-examined on a written statement that you made.  With regard -- 
THE WITNESS:
That's correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  But as a preliminary we'll ask the counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse to just put your official details on the record of the Court. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
DONATIEN NSHIMYUMUREMYI, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, the registry staff is going to give you a document which shows your civil status.  Since I do not want to mispronounce your name, your first name is Donatien, I will try to also mention your name, but you will, please, after me, pronounce it correctly and spell it.  
A.	It is Nshimyumuremyi. 
Q.	Can you please spell it.  
A.	Yes.  N-S-H-I-M-Y-U-M-U-R-E-M-Y-I. 
Q.	I would like you to look at the document before you, there is some information on it.  If there are any corrections to be made on the information, indicate so.  If not, mention the date of today on the document, today is 16 November 2010.  Thereafter, sign it so that the document can be tendered into evidence.  
A.	I have done that. 
Q.	Thank you.  

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would now request you to have this document admitted as a Defence exhibit.  I think its number should D. NG160.  I stand to be corrected by the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted in evidence. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG160 admitted) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Whilst Mr. Issa is showing the document to the various parties, Mr. Donatien has given his statement under 92.  That statement was certified yesterday, and it is on the basis of that document that counsel for the Prosecution will cross-examine the witness.  

I'll request the Court to admit this document as well.  It is numbered -- or, it will be numbered as D. NG161.  Once more, I stand to be corrected by the registry regarding the number of that document. 
MR. MJUI:  
The number is correct.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG161 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you will now be cross-examined by the Prosecutor and you'll have to respond to his questions.

1145H
MR. SENDZE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Honourable Judges.  Good morning, everybody.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	And good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	I have a few questions for -- of -- to ask of you in relation to the statement that has just been admitted.  Can you confirm whether or not you were in Rwanda in April of 1994.  
A.	No.  I was not in Rwanda in April 1994.  I confirm that. 
Q.	And you were not in Rwanda throughout the period of the genocide; correct? 
A.	No.  That's correct.  I was not in Rwanda during that period. 
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda in 1992 to go to university in Belgium. 
Q.	In your statement you stated that you know Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who led a choir that sung at your sister's wedding.  Now, except for your public knowledge of Mr. Ngirumpatse, do you have any personal knowledge of him? 
A.	I knew him in particular because he was a family friend.  We did not have personal relations because I am not of his age.  But I was in contact with his children.  We were friends.  And moreover, we still remain friends. 
Q.	So you never really had any conversations with Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	As far as I know, a lengthy discussion, no.  But it -- it's possible that we talked to one another.  However, I would say that I was not of his age.  I, therefore, cannot claim that I had a discussion with him.  

Nevertheless, I -- it is possible that I was present when, for example, he paid us a family visit when he may have been in the sitting room talking.  That is not to be ruled out.  But to say that a -- I had a one-to-one discussion with him, I think that may not be correct. 
Q.	It is true to also say that you never heard him make a speech over the radio; correct? 
A.	I'm sorry.  Can you please repeat your question, Counsel. 
Q.	I want you to confirm that at no time did you hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse make a speech over the radio.
A.	In fact, all this dates back to more than 18 years.  I even mentioned this in my statement, namely, that I heard him speak, as we heard all politicians speak.  To tell you exactly what I heard him speak, I am not able to do that.  But I heard him speak.
Q.	Now, in your -- in your statement at paragraph 6 on the last two lines you stated that from 1992 it became clear that power was shifting from the hands of President Habyarimana into the hands of political parties.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	And to your knowledge, this continued up until 1994? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	We are, therefore, in agreement that as early as 1992 it was the political party leaders that influenced and made up policy decisions on behalf of the government.  Could we say that? 
A.	Leaders of political parties right up to 1992?  
Q.	No.  I'm -- we have agreed that as early as 1992 power was -- power shifted from the hands of President Habyarimana to political parties.  So I want you to confirm that it was the case that political parties were in a position to influence government policies at the time.  
A.	Yes.  From the moment you had several political parties, it was obvious that various parties had access to power and that power no longer was concentrated in the hands of President Habyarimana.  

In any case, I say this -- or as an adolescent at the time referred to -- the war broke out in 1990.  I was 17 years old when the war broke out.  When I left the country, I was 19 years old.  And I continued observing the political situation from outside the country.  I did so until 1994 and beyond.  In fact, this -- to give you or tell you how old I was at the time.  

So I'm giving you my testimony as a young man who was observing political life, not as somebody experiencing political matters.  But I had the necessary intellectual ability to have my own idea of politics.  Therefore, it is clear that when multi-parties or several parties came into being, political power was shared amongst various parties.  And as a matter of fact, until 1994 you did not just have one party that led the country.  You had several parties that shared power.  In any case, that is my point of view. 
Q.	And you agree that in that coalition it was the MRND party that held most of the ministerial portfolio? 
A.	Yes.  If my memory serves me right, that must have been the case.  The MRND had most of the ministerial portfolios but not necessarily the most important portfolios.  I believe they were shared amongst various opposition political parties. 
Q.	It, therefore, follows that the leaders of the MRND party would be considered influential policy makers in Rwanda from as early as 1992 up to 1994.  
A.	I think that they participated in their own manner in the political life of the country.  That is clear.  Everyone participated.  All political parties participated in the political life of the country. 
Q.	But being the majority, their position will overshadow the position of the other opposition parties within the government.  
A.	I think they had their word to say, just like in any other country where there are various political parties each party has something to say.  So they too had their say.  

In my view, as time went on, I had the impression that power was no longer concentrated in one party or in the hands of Habyarimana.  Power was shared.  
Since one had the impression that -- well, this is my impression that -- one had the impression that there was a lack of harmony.  As you know, it was a matter of public knowledge that opposition parties reached secret agreements with the RPF in Brussels even though the RPF was a belligerent from a military point of view.  

I am, therefore, saying that it became a confused state.  This -- that -- this is my point of view.  It's worth what it's worth, but it is my point of view. 
Q.	Your father, Mr. Félicien Kabuga, owned a commercial building in Muhima; is that true? 
A.	He's still the owner of that property. 
Q.	We have information on the record in this trial that the MRND party had an office in that building.  Can you confirm that information? 
A.	Indeed I heard that there was a time when the MRND rented those premises.  I think the MRND had the right to rent, just like any other party that may have wanted to rent those premises.  To my knowledge, I do not remember any political party that wanted to rent my father's property and which was denied the right to rent the said property. 
Q.	Did you also hear that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse had an office in that building? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  That is possible.  But that information is not available to me. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Witness, can you hold on a little bit. 

Mr. President, I have the impression that the questions asked by my learned colleague are outside the scope of Rule 92 bis.  And perhaps it may be necessary for him to review his cross-examination.  

One of the questions asked the witness was -- or, rather...(no interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We heard the question put to the witness. 
MR. SENDZE:
The -- the question I asked the witness was founded on Rule 90(G) of the rules, which allows the Prosecutor to explore other matters that relate to his case with the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We agree that that's permitted by Rule 90(G).  And, in fact, it's the practice that we have been adopting throughout the trial on both sides.  

The witness may answer the question. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I am not calling into question your decision.  But what I wanted to add earlier on is that counsel for the Prosecution expressly requested that some statements -- written statements be withdrawn, statements concerning this point.  Yet he's raising such matters in cross-examination.  That is what I don't understand.  He's asking questions on matters that were withdrawn from the witness's statement. 
MR. SENDZE:
Is the Chamber willing to hear any submission from me in that regard, or does the Chamber's decision stand?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. SENDZE:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm not certain exactly -- I'm not certain exactly what counsel was referring to. 
MR. SENDZE:
Okay.  Now, I want to -- in response to learned counsel, I want to state that there is a difference in the requirement for the admission of a statement under Rule 92 bis and the manner in which cross-examination is carried out in regard to the statement.  92 bis does not permit the admission of a statement that goes to the acts and conducts of the Accused as pleaded in the indictment.  But it does not preclude the Prosecutor from cross-examining the witness on the acts and conducts of the Accused.  

So, again, we submit that this line of questioning is permissible. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I was revisiting article (G) (sic), and my understanding of (G)(i) is that those matters have to relate to the witness's statement.  (G)(i) says that -- have to relate to the witness's statement.  

And from what Counsel Hounkpatin is saying, that has been redacted.  So -- and this -- upon the request of the Prosecutor -- and that this portion was redacted following the request of the Prosecutor.  I don't see how the Prosecutor can rely on that to go outside the confines of the statement of the witness.  
MR. SENDZE:
Rule 90(G)(ii) is the relevant portion of the rule. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  We have decided to allow the question to be asked.  We are satisfied that it is permitted under Rule 90(G), as submitted by counsel.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Witness, could we have your answer again.  I was -- I was asking if you could confirm whether or not you heard information to the effect that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had an office within the Kabuga building, as it is commonly referred to.  
A.	Unfortunately, I have to tell you that that information is not within my knowledge.  If I had any, I would have given it to you.  I do not -- I do not have that information. 
Q.	Thank you.  Have you recently been in contact with your father? 
A.	Counsel, I prefer not to comment on this issue.  
Q.	Thank you very much for answering my questions.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I have nothing further of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Any redec -- any redirect questions?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
No, Mr. President, none.  

However, obviously, we intend to apply for him to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, that concludes your testimony before the Tribunal.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us in our work.  You are now excused and you are free to go. 

The registrar will make arrangements to grant the request made by coun -- by counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honours...(no interpretation) 
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, the witness who is coming in now, what's the status of the witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you.  And I'm sorry.  

This witness as well will testify under his own name.  He has renounced the protective measures. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, we -- we noticed that the full address of the witness is stated on his information sheet.  Was that intended, or was it an error?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Une erreur.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well -- well, maybe you can address it as -- when you begin his (inaudible).

Mr. -- good morning --
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, everyone.  Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  The Trial Chamber had previously made an order for your protection on security reasons.  We have since been advised that -- that that order is no longer necessary and that you wish to give your testimony as an unprotected witness.  Could you advise us of the position, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I confirm that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Have you testified in -- in any other case in the Tribunal?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  This is my first time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  In these circumstances we can revoke the protection order that we had made in your favour and you will now testify as an unprotected witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, to correct the error in the identification sheet, I will request Mr. Issa to take my copy, which has been redacted, and to give this to the witness.  The witness will add the -- the city and the country in his own handwriting so that the document to be admitted into evidence would tally.  I will then request each person who has received this document to do the same. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank -- thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin. 

In the meantime, I would ask the registrar to administer the oath to the witness so that he can undertake to tell the truth as he gives his testimony.
(Declaration made by Jupiter Kayonga in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:

Thank you, Mr. President. 
JUPITER KAYONGA, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Jupiter Kayonga -- anticipated on the exercise we had to carry out.  The registrar -- the registry has given you a document entitled identification sheet.  Please confirm if your name is indeed Kayonga and your first name Jupiter.  
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	Can you spell your surname.  
A.	Kayonga is K-A-Y-O-N-G-A. 
Q.	Please go through the remaining personal data.  I have crossed out those that I should cross out.  Now, write the city and country, date it November -- 16th November 2010 and sign the document so that it can be admitted into evidence.  
A.	I will do that.  It is done. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
The registry will take that document.  

And, Mr. President, I will request that that document be admitted among -- G161 (sic), unless Mr. Issa thinks otherwise. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG162 admitted) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Kayonga, before we begin, let me walk you through the ground rules that will enable us to take your testimony with -- without difficulty.  You speak French, just as I do, and you may have realised that there's an interpretation of your statements as well as mine.  You, therefore, need to pause at the end of my question to enable the full -- full interpretation of my question into French before you start answering a question.  This will avoid overlaps, and it will also enable the stenographers that you see next to the Judges to correctly record your testimony.  

Further, I would like to request you to check the -- the pace at which you speak.  Do not speak too fast so that your statement can be recorded.  Do we agree on these ground rules?  
A.	We are in agreement.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  Are you able to tell the Court your age in 1994?  
A.	In 1994 I was nine years old. 
Q.	And what's your age today? 
A.	Today I am 26 years old. 
Q.	What is your occupation? 
A.	I'm a steward. 
Q.	In which year did you leave Rwanda?  No.  Sorry.  Let me rephrase the question.  Where were -- where were you born? 
A.	I was born in Nyarugenge, Kigali in Rwanda. 
Q.	Had you lived in Rwanda all the time? 
A.	Yes, I lived in Rwanda all the time. 
Q.	And do you still live in Rwanda today? 
A.	No.  Today I do not live in Rwanda any longer.  I leave -- I left Rwanda in 1994. 
Q.	I've just realised that I am the one speaking too fast.  I've spoken about rules that I'm not respecting myself.  So let's do it properly.  

You left Rwanda in 1994.  Do you recall the exact month?  
A.	No.  I have no recollection of the month in which I left Rwanda.  That was a long time ago.  It's no longer clear in my mind.  Thank you. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court, what is the relationship between you and Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Can you repeat the question, Counsel. 
Q.	Yes.  My question was as follows:  That you tell the Court the relationship between you and Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Mr. Ngirumpatse is my uncle.  He is the husband of my -- my mother's elder sister. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Whose name we did not get. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	What is the name of your mother? 
A.	My mother's name is Monica (sic) Gayi (sic).  Thank you. 
Q.	And are you able to tell the Court under what circumstances you came to know Ngirumpatse? 
A.	As a child we used to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse when -- whenever we went to his house.  My parents, every now and then, would travel outside the country and they would take us to him.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse taught me to play the piano when I was young.  My school was not far and Madam Murakaze (sic) came to fetch us and took us to his house, and that was the link that we had with Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	To the best of your recollection, please tell the Chamber the frequency of this relationship.  Is it -- so was it on the base of -- a visit per month or one per week or several visits with -- in the course of 
	one day?  Please tell the Court about that so that we understand the nature of the relationship.  
A.	It was probably -- the frequency was probably one visit every two weeks.  And if the family did not travel, we did not see.  

But whenever my father and mother travelled, we could remain with them for weeks.  So I would say that -- probably one visit every two weeks.  Thank you. 
Q.	Are you able to tell the Chamber if, while you were visiting the Ngirumpatses -- whether there were other members of the family that you knew and whom you could mention to the Chamber? 
A.	During our visits at the Ngirumpatses, obviously, there was their daughter, Delphine Ngirumpatse.  There was also Claude Ngirumpatse and Juanita Ngirumpatse.  And once there was Aline -- Aline --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Or a name we didn't hear clearly.
THE WITNESS:
-- on one occasion. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Can we then take it that the family links, since he was your uncle, were very close ties? 
A.	Yes.  Indeed these were very close ties, as I told you a while ago.  I told you that when my 
	younger brother, Earvin, was born, there was the practice in Rwanda where a first name is given to the child, and the Ngirumpatses were present in our house.  So the links were very close. 
Q.	You had previously stated that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was giving you piano lessons.  To the best of your recollection, are you able to tell the Court how this was the -- in what context this took place?  Was it professional, or were you just a child and he had you bang away on the compu -- on the piano?  Please tell the Court under what circumstances this took place.  
A.	It so happened that Mr. Ngirumpatse had a piano in his house.  So when I got there, as a child I was very curious.  

Once -- for the -- on the first occasion it was just to play on the piano and get to know the notes.  And then later on he was giving -- giving me lessons, real lessons.  So I had some -- I got to know some concepts or some notions of music -- of piano playing.  
Q.	Your parents -- I mean your father and mother -- did they have any ties with the Ngirumpatse family?  And please describe what kind of ties these were.  Did they use to visit each other besides what you have just described?  I want to know the kind of ties that existed between your father and mother and the Ngirumpatse couple.  
A.	As a child and from my observation -- observations during the visits to the Ngirumpatse family, their relationships with my father was -- with my family was that my mother lived with them when she was younger.  They took her on a trip once.  So my mother had travel on -- regarding my father, he admired my father (sic) a lot.  

My -- Ngirumpatse had travelled extensively.  He knew a lot about life.  He spoke very -- many languages, such that my parents would take us to the Ngirumpatses to benefit from that culture.  

My parents had other reasons.  But they also took us there for -- to learn from them.  That is what I observed as a child during those visits.  And that is my answer.  Thank you. 
Q.	Back then did you get to know if Mr. Ngirumpatse was engaged in political activities? 
A.	No, not to my knowledge.  I just knew that he was a diplomat.  That was all.  Thank you. 
Q.	And did you know back then if your father was engaged in political activities? 
A.	Not to my knowledge.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Kayonga, what is your ethnic group? 
A.	I had no notions of ethnicity at that time.  Thank you. 
Q.	And -- and today what would be your answer if I were to put the same question to you? 
A.	Up until today I do not know the truth about ethnicity.  As a result of what I hear, what I see on TV, my research, I hear that Tutsis are tall people.  Well, I hear that Tutsis are like this.  Hutus are like that.  I don't know where I belong in all that.  Thank you. 
Q.	Were you told that you were a Tutsi? 
A.	It does happen that I'm referred to as such.  But these are Rwandans -- Rwandans that I meet.  I was a child then, and I did not know.  But today I'm searching.  But sometimes I'm told I'm Tutsi.  And I don't know if that is the truth or not. 
Q.	Let us now focus our attention on the 6th of April 1994.  Where were you? 
A.	6th of April 1994 we were at home in our house. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I see that it is time for the lunch break, and I'm wondering if you wish to so order.  And then we can continue in the afternoon on this issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We take the luncheon adjournment now.
(Court recessed at 1231H) 
(Pages 21 to 31 by Tanya West)































	(Court resumed at 1405H)
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  

Good afternoon, everybody.  

Before continuing with my questions with Mr. Kayonga, I would like to make a correction which has been brought to my attention, announced by Mr. Issa, regarding the document I had admitted on the marital status.  I had said it was 161, whereas it should be D. NG162.  So I'd like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to this correction which was brought to my attention in turn by Mr. Issa. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Noted and the corrections are directed.  Thank you.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Kayonga.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, you've not given me leave to start.  Maybe I should wait for your leave.  Right now I'm waiting for your permission to officially re-commence my examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Permission is granted, Ms. Hounkpatin.  And thanks for asking for it.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, whenever I have to be I am always polite.  Thank you.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Mr. Kayonga, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon.  
Q.	When we went for lunch break we were talking about the 6th of April.  I had asked you where were you.  Could you please repeat your answer in respect of where were you on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	On the 6th of April 1994 we were at home.  
Q.	Who was with you at your home? 
A.	At home there was myself, my younger sister, my father and the home help. 
Q.	What happened on that day?  To the best of your recollection, do you remember whether there was an important event and if so, could you please tell the Trial Chamber about it? 
A.	On the 6th of April 1994 we were at home with my youngest sister in our room, and in the afternoon -- in the afternoon, someone came to tell my father that soldiers were looking for him.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I wanted to make it clear to the witness that I'm talking about the 6th of April.  

THE WITNESS: 
On the 6th of April 1994 -- let me repeat, on the 6th of April 1994, what I saw and what I remember growing up was the day when the president of Rwanda was assassinated, but this is something I learned later when I had grown up.  Thank you.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Should I then understand that on the 6th of April 1994, given your age at that time, you were not really aware of that event?  It was only later that you actually learned about the event that had occurred on that day.  
A.	Yes, because at my age I was not aware of such events.  It was only later when I was growing up and when I carried out my own research that I understood the importance of the events that occurred at that time.  Thank you. 
Q.	You said that you were at home with your sister, your father and a house help.  Where was your mother? 
A.	My mother was with my younger brother at Ngirumpatse's house.  They had gone there on the previous day and they had stayed there.  And we remained at home with my father and our house help.  Thank you. 
Q.	On the following day, to the best of your recollection, can you tell the Trial Chamber what happened on the 7th of April? 
A.	On the following day, that is, the 7th of April 1994 -- actually, I had made a mistake initially regarding the date.  Together with my younger sister we were in our room facing the entrance.  Some neighbours came and warned my father by telling him that there were people who were looking for him and that those people would come later to the house.  So, we remained at home.  When the events unfolded some people came to our home.  We were in our room.  They somehow ransacked our rooms and then went to the living room.  They were hurling abuses, they hit my father.  And we -- they called us to the living room.  My sister was crying.  We went to the living room.  And we saw that our father was bleeding from the head.  He had been wounded on the head.  They were hitting my father and asking him whether he had money and where was my mother, and my father told them that my -- our mother was not there, she was somewhere else.  And they threatened us.  And they murdered my father in front of my sister and I. 
Q.	Mr. Kayonga, to the best of your recollection how long, approximately, did that incident last? 
A.	It lasted -- well, at my age, I was not time conscious.  I don't remember.  But it lasted a long time.  To me it seemed to be an eternity, but I really don't remember how long it lasted.  Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber what happened after that; what did you do?  Did you remain at home?  Did you flee?  Can you give the Chamber an account of what happened? 
A.	After that event, we did not stay for a long time at home because after they killed -- they had killed my father.  My sister, the house help and myself fled.  My sister was crying.  Those people had threatened us, so we fled to the next door house.  There was a gap between the hedge separating the two houses.  We went over to the neighbouring house and hid there for some time.  I do not know the specific time.  Maybe we were there for one day, one or two nights.  And neighbours came and got some clothes at home.  So we remained at our neighbour's place hiding.  Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	When did you see your mother again?  And can you tell the Court under what circumstances did you see your mother again? 
A.	After my father was murdered we went into hiding at the neighbour's house, maybe for one or two nights.  After our belongings were taken from the house we left where we were hiding and went to relatively -- relative safety because there were shells falling around.  But we did not go very far because we were stopped, and some people told that they were looking for us and that is when I saw my mother and Erwin and Rose.  
Q.	So when you met your mother and Rose, where did your mother take you to? 
A.	After being met by Rose and my mother we were taken to Eden Garden where it was safer because where we were was near our house and there was shooting.  So we went to Eden Garden.  
Q.	Do you remember at what time of the day did you arrive at Eden Garden; was it in the morning, in the afternoon or in the evening? 
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, I don't remember what time of the day we arrived there.  
Q.	And when you got to Eden Garden, were there people there?  And did you know the people who were there? 
A.	When I got to Eden Garden there was Delphine whom I recognised, there was Léonidas, a family member whom I came to know later, and it seems that from what I remember those people were there.  But I'm not sure about the others.  Those are the ones that I remember.  Thank you.  
Q.	Did Rose and your mother leave and did you remain alone with those people?  Or, what happened subsequently? 
A.	From what I remember knowing when I was growing up, I remember that I had stayed there only with my mother.  She was consoling us.  My father was -- my sister was crying.  So, I know that we remained there with my mother and Delphine and Léonidas.  Thank you. 
Q.	When your mother came with Rose to get you, was she alone or was there another member of your family together with her? 
A.	My younger brother Erwin was there together with aunt Rose.  Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Once again, I'm going to have to task your memory.  For how long did you remain with those adults at Eden Garden?  And under what condition did you live at Eden Garden? 
A.	In view of the previous events, what I remember is that we were hidden because near Eden Garden there was shooting.  But the shooting was less intense as was previously.  With regard to your question, how long -- how many days we were there for, I cannot answer that because we were hiding in a cupboard.  And we were hiding in the lower shelf and I did not see daylight for quite some time.  So I do not have a notion of time regarding to knowing whether it was daytime or night-time.  I don't have the chronology of the time during which we stayed there.  But I know that we stayed there for some days but I do not remember the number of days we were there.  We were hiding there in order to protect ourselves because outside there was shelling and then there was the possibility that people would enter into Eden Garden.  So, we were there hiding.  Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	When did you leave Eden Garden and under what circumstances did you leave Eden Garden? 
A.	As I told you earlier on, I don't have the chronology regarding the dates but I remember that when we left there was myself, Erwin, my mother, Cynthia, Delphine, Léonidas as well as Rose, as well as Mr. Ngirumpatse.

They came to get us.  There was a Pajero motor vehicle.  There were quite a few of us at the entrance.  We were there and so we were taken away.  Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	You said that you left with Mr. Ngirumpatse, and Rose, your mother, your younger brother, as well as the other people who were with you at Eden Garden.  So, about how many people were there?  Can you make a calculation and tell us whether people who got into the vehicle and sat comfortably? 
A.	There was Mr. Ngirumpatse and his wife, their daughter, Delphine, Mr. Léonidas, that makes it four, Mr. Franck Adansi, that is five.  Then there was me my sister, my younger brother and my mother, so that makes it nine in total.  

You've asked me whether we were comfortable in the car.  No, because that was we were at war -- there was war around.  The thing is that all of us managed to get into the car, because that car could accommodate that number of people.  
Q.	Can you describe to the Trial Chamber the vehicle on which you boarded, that is, the Pajero?  Can you describe it?  Please, describe it. 
A.	I remember the vehicle very well because at school I remember that my aunt Rose came to get us to take to our home.  It was bluish -- a dark greyish motor vehicle.  It is a car I had already seen, so when I saw it at Eden Garden I remembered it very well.  Thank you.  
Q.	Was that the only time that you got into that car or were you transported in that vehicle on other occasion together with your aunt? 
A.	Apart from the events at Eden Garden, as I've already said, once my aunt came to get me with my younger sister at school and on weekends we would have a ride in town.  Thank you.  
Q.	During your departure do you remember who was driving the vehicle? 
A.	When we were leaving I don't remember clearly what happened.  That's it. 
Q.	Was Mr. Ngirumpatse driving the motor vehicle or was someone else driving it?  Try to concentrate on the event as to determine who could have been driving that vehicle on that day.  But if you don't remember it's not serious, but try to focus on that event and regarding who was driving the car.  
A.	From my recollection there are things I can remember.  The only thing I can remember is that we were in a hurry when we left the hotel.  I don't want to make a mistake.  So what I'm saying is I don't remember who was driving the car. 
Q.	In your answer you talked about a hotel.  Were you leaving from a hotel or were you leaving Eden Garden?  Or, is Eden Garden a hotel? 
A.	From what I remember when I was a child, Eden Garden was a bar.  Once we'd gone to that bar.  But I remember that opposite Eden Garden there was a hotel, hotel Isimbi.  So maybe I made a mistake in that regard, so I'm sorry about that. 
Q.	Can you tell the Trial Chamber, where did you go to in that car?  Can you describe the road you took and where you got to, to the best of your recollection? 
A.	When we left Eden Garden, I did not know where we were going to.  We were not -- we were not -- I was not told where we were going to.  However, on our way I saw some corpses, after leaving.  My mother tried to hide -- prevent my sister from seeing the dead bodies.  And later, I learnt that we had gone to my father's older sister who refused to take us in but I don't know why.  

So, my memory is hazy in respect of what happened there.  But I remember that later we went to Rose's older sister.  Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	How long did you stay in your aunt's house, that is, the house of Rose's elder sister? 
A.	We stayed there -- well, I do not remember the exact dates -- or, rather, the precise number of days.  But we stayed there for some time because it was quiet there.  It was not like in Kigali.  So, because it was quiet there we stayed there for quite some time.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Kayonga, I know the events we're talking about are painful events.  I'm going to, nevertheless, ask you a question about them.  Did you ever discuss the events in your family? 
A.	We didn't discuss them.  We didn't discuss the events.  Even it is -- even today, it is today that I can give some more details.  But we never talked about them.  We talked about them rather vaguely, but not in great detail.  Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I've finished the direct examination of this witness.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Kayonga.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Sow, do you have any questions of the witness?  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have only one question that I would like to ask.  
MR. SOW: 
It will depend on his answer.  There is a passage which I did not clearly understand.  
BY MR. SOW: 
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Kayonga.  I am Mr. Sow, counsel for Mr. Karemera.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, during the events of the 6th to the 7th of April 1994, did you have the opportunity of going to Mr. Ngirumpatse's house? 
A.	During the events of 6th to the 7th of April we did not go to Mr. Ngirumpatse's house. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, you now have to be available to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor and you have to respond to questions.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MS. WILSON: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Your Honours, Defence counsel. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. WILSON: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  

My name is Maria Wilson and I'm one of the Prosecutors in this matter.  I have a few questions to ask you in relation to the evidence you have just given.

Now, do you currently live with Rose Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Can you please kindly repeat the question; I didn't clearly follow the translation. 
Q.	Do you currently live with Rose Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No, I do not live with Rose.  I live in Dubai, as I said at the beginning of my testimony.  Thank you.
Q.	Did you live with Rose for any period of time after you left Rwanda in April 1994? 
A.	Indeed, I lived with Rose briefly when I just arrived in France.  But that lasted three weeks -- about three weeks.  Thank you.  
Q.	Your sister continues to -- presently lives with Rose; is that not true? 
A.	My sister used to live with my aunt -- ma soeur -- avec -- sorry.  

My sister used to live with my aunt.  She lived with her for some time.  But now she is rather living independently nearby.  Thank you.  
Q.	In any event, after your father was killed, you spent a lot of time in contact with Rose Ngirumpatse; is that not true? 
A.	We did not spend much time with Rose because we saw her when she came to fetch us following the death of my father.  She picked us up together with her mother.  We saw her when we were in the vehicle going to her sister's place.  Thereafter -- well, we did not live with Rose for a long time after that period.  We lived with her just at the time I arrived in France, as I've already testified. 
Q.	How would you describe -- from the evidence that you've given, you had a pretty good relationship with Mathieu and Rose; would you not say so? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you because when we were young, when we were in Rwanda, we used to go to their house, so we considered them as our second father or second mother.  Yes, you are right, Counsel.  Thank you.  
Q.	And the Accused was arrested in 1998.  Did you have -- did you see the Accused between the date you left Rwanda and 1998 when he was arrested? 
A.	To the best of my recollection, I saw Mr. Ngirumpatse when we were at Eden Garden.  But, later on, when we went to Rose's sister I don't remember having seen him during that or after that period. 
Q.	What was the name of Rose's sister at whose home you stayed? 
A.	She was called Martha, if my memory serves me right.

1545H 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	In any event, you agree that Mathieu and his wife -- you said they were like mother and father to you.  So you -- you accept that you have a lot to be grateful for in relation to Mathieu and Rose? 
A.	Counsel, I do not agree with you that I owe them anything.  Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Rose, they definitely helped us, but my testimony here today is just to shed light on the truth concerning Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I have not at all come here to thank him by giving evidence in his favour.  No, that is out of the question.  Thank you.  
Q.	You agree that it's extremely difficult for you, some 16 years after an event, to recall great details when you were only nine years old at the time? 
A.	Counsel, some events in life, when we grow up, are not forgotten.  For example, the death of one's father, especially in a period of war and especially when your father was killed in your presence.  Such things will remain present in your mind until the end of your life.  There are also some chronological events, which may be somewhere in -- which may be forgotten, but somewhere in my mind.  However, there are events which occurred and it is as -- well, if you had a camera and you put the camera in my head you'll be able to see those events.  I see those events as I talk to you, so I cannot forget such events. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, I agree with you.  The very dramatic events you will recall, but other small details you're not expected to recall them after such a long period.  So we agree.  

Now, after going through the traumatic events of your father's death, are you able to -- and you said you recall those in great detail -- are you able to recall who were the persons who in fact killed your father?  Can you give us a description of them?  Were they in civilian clothing? 
A.	Yes, those people were wearing a military uniform.  What I mean by that is a khaki uniform, but at that time I did not know whether they were people of the army, some militia.  I do not know exactly who they were.  Thank you.  
Q.	And you mentioned that a couple of days after the event you were met by your mother, Rose, your younger brother.  Where did they -- how did they -- and from there, you -- you were taken, if I'm not mistaken, to Eden Garden.  Am I correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And how -- how did you get from where you were met to Eden Garden?  Did you walk or was it via 
car -- a car? 
A.	From where we were received, right up to Eden Garden, it's not a great distance.  We went in a vehicle, but I do not remember the details of the vehicle.  In any case, I cannot describe the vehicle.  Thank you.  
Q.	You anticipated my question because I wanted to know what kind of vehicle you were taken in, but you're not able to give us that answer.  Correct? 
A.	I gave the description of the vehicle in my translation.  We went in a vehicle to Eden Garden because it's not nearby, it's quite far away.  
Q.	You probably didn't -- my question was probably not translated.  What kind of vehicle was it that took you from where you were met to Eden Garden? 
A.	Counsel, I do not have a description of the type of vehicle that took us in -- to Eden Garden, but I know that we went in a vehicle.  
Q.	Okay.  You don't have a description of that vehicle.  But was it a vehicle that was owned by Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Counsel, as I just told you -- I'll give you some detail.  I know the vehicle that Mr. Ngirumpatse had -- his three vehicles.  Now I've just told you that I do not know the type of vehicle that took us to Eden Garden.  Well, I -- not that I don't know the type of vehicle, but I do not remember it.  Therefore, I cannot tell you what type of vehicle it was or whether it belonged to Mathieu Ngirumpatse or somebody else.  So I do not remember that piece of information.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I understand your difficulty in recalling.  Now you said Mathieu Ngirumpatse had owned three vehicles.  What were those three vehicles that he owned?  What types of vehicles were they, 
if you recall? 
A.	There was a Pajero.  As I had said earlier on, it came to fetch us from the school.  Then there was a black Mercedes which Mr. Ngirumpatse went to work with.  Then there was also another Mercedes, champagne kind of colour.  Those are the vehicles I remember belonging to the Ngirumpatse family.  Thank you.  
Q.	And I do not know if you'll be able to recall this, but can you recall when you first became aware that you were going to give evidence in this matter? 
A.	Counsel, if I understood you clearly, you want to know my feelings.  Is that what you want to know?  Please, can you clarify your question.  
Q.	No.  That was not a correct translation.  I wanted to know -- the -- the question is, when did you first become aware that you were going to give evidence in this matter? 
A.	The first time was a long time ago.  It was quite a long time ago, but as a result of my work I could not come.  That was the reason.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I don't expect a precise date, but if you can give me an idea of the year, at least, or the month, that would be useful.  
A.	I am sorry, I remember neither the date nor the month.  All I know is that it was quite a long time ago.  Perhaps at least three years ago, but I neither remember the date nor the month.  Thank you.  
Q.	Okay.  And in the same way the Pajero was used whilst you were a child -- you were picked up in it, you're aware that the black Mercedes was also used quite frequently by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Those are things which I remember from my childhood.  Now, if you want the date, I do not remember the date.  As I had already told you, these were things that were told to me but were not confirmed.  Secondly, I told you that I -- 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President, we didn't get the witness's last part of the answer.  And if he could slow down, please.  Mr. President, we didn't get the last part of his answer.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the interpreter didn't get your answer, but I also think that there was a difficulty with the question in the way you responded that the question needed to be translated again.  What I was asking you was whether you were as familiar with the black Mercedes as you were with the Pajero? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I knew the Pajero as well as I did the Mercedes.  
Q.	And if I go with your estimation of when you became aware that you'd be giving evidence, you said about three years ago you -- you first became aware that you'd be giving evidence in this matter, approximately. 
A.	That was discussed, but I did not have any confirmation.  I had been given notice that I was going to testify, but the date was not yet confirmed and that was because of my work.  Thank you.  
Q.	Why is it that you were able to recall the type of vehicle that was used to transport you from Eden Garden and not the type of vehicle that picked you up when you were leaving -- when you were met by your mother for the first time after the death of your father? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Well, I'm going to answer the question.  I do not remember the type of vehicle because, one, these are events which happened after the death of my father.  I was in charge of my younger sister.  I had just lost my father.  I had no one else at that time.  From an emotional standpoint, I think if you were under that situation you would behave like I did.  

Now, as we were moving, I had other emotional matters to deal with.  And as a result of that -- well, if somebody comes to fetch you and asks you to get into a vehicle, that did not strike me.  Everyone would go through that experience in their own way.  Perhaps I went through that experience in a different manner.  If you were the one, perhaps you would have experienced the events differently.  
I do not remember the date nor the vehicle because such information at that time did not strike me.  

I think I've been quite direct in answering your question.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  So after spending a couple of nights hidden in -- was -- was it 
a -- a cupboard, I think, at Eden Garden, hearing gunshots, I would take it that you would also have been traumatised from that experience, especially after your father had just been killed.  Do you agree? 
A.	Yes, that part of the events also struck me because I was not used to hiding in a cupboard.  And if you are with your sister in a cupboard, you do not know whether they were going to kill the people next to you.  You -- you have -- you also remember that your father has been killed in your presence, so what is going to happen next when you come out of the cupboard?  Maybe by the time you come out of the cupboard, everyone would have died.  So those are the events that struck me.  We were anxious.  Those events struck me because I was not used to being in a cupboard.  
Furthermore, there was -- there were also strong feelings I had which make me remember those events.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Before coming to give evidence here today, did you have a discussion about the Pajero vehicle with anyone?  Whether your sister, or the Defence, did you have a discussion about that vehicle with anyone before you came to give evidence today? 
A.	For the time available to me, I did not have -- I couldn't discuss with anyone.  
Q.	Did you speak with your sister after she testified or before she testified in this matter? 
A.	Counsel, as I had said, I live in Dubai, so I did not have any opportunity of talking with my sister before; and furthermore, I came at night, so I have not had time to talk with my sister about anything, including the Pajero.  
Q.	Do you know what became of that dark Mercedes-Benz which Ngirumpatse owned after the 6th of April? 
A.	No, I do not know what became of the vehicle because we fled from Eden Garden.  I do not at all know what happened to the Mercedes.  
Q.	And did you get the impression that Ngirumpatse was aware of the difficult circumstances which existed at Eden Garden when you and the others were there for those couple of nights? 
A.	You're asking me whether -- at -- at 9 years old, I was not thinking like an adult, so at that time, I did not think about that.  
Q.	And you said you saw many corpses.  Whereabouts did you see these corpses, if you can recall? 
A.	On the road, but I do not know specifically at what point, but along the road.  
Q.	And what date did you eventually -- you probably gave it in -- in your evidence already -- but what date did you eventually leave Rwanda? 
A.	I do remember the exact date, and I have not given a specific date in my testimony in respect of the specific time of my leaving Rwanda.  Thank you.  
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, Your Honours, these are my questions for this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Is there any redirect? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no questions for re-exam.  I just want to apply, as usual, to the Trial Chamber to allow Mr. Kayonga to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Witness, your testimony has ended.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Trial Chamber's work.  You're now excused and free to go.  The registrar will make arrangements for the request of counsel to be granted.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Thank you, Counsel, from both sides.  Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
	(Witness entered courtroom)
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I have an application.  Logically, in the chronology of the appearances of the witnesses, it was PTR who was supposed to appear following Mr. Kayonga before this Trial Chamber.  However, PTR left Europe 24 hours ago, so he must have arrived -- he must have arrived here when Mr. Kayonga was testifying.  It's, therefore, not possible to ask him to commence testifying immediately.  However, I had anticipated this possibility in view of the long journey.  

So I had anticipated that we could call Witness PR (sic); however, looking at the time, I'm tempted to make a motion, given the fact that it's now 15 -- six past three.  So if we take this witness, we're not going to see him on Thursday, since we'll be resuming on Thursday, because Witness PTR should testify and leave Arusha on Friday to return to his country of residence, and, therefore, he has to take his flight at 3 o'clock in the morning.  

So my application is as follows, and I hope you'll grant it.  We request you to allow us not to commence the testimony of this witness now and not to prevent him being called subsequently, because should we start now, we'll have hardly 25 minutes of evidence and this will postpone his testimony into Friday.  

So this is my application and I hope that you'll grant it.  I don't know what the Prosecutor's position is regarding this matter.  I don't know whether the Prosecutor agrees with my application or is against my request.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I notice that the witness is already in the box and usually the first 15-to-20 minutes of any witness's testimony, particularly when there are protective measures involved, takes around 
15 or 20 minutes of introductory questions, so can't we at least get that done?  And by the time we finish that, we probably will arrive at 3:30.  And then we can commence this witness's substantive testimony at the next available opportunity, whether that's on Thursday or Friday.  But he's here now and we're here, can't we just get the preliminaries accomplished? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I think we agree that it's reasonable.  

Ms. Hounkpatin, is this witness -- what's his status? 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could interject, Your Honour.  There -- there are certain things I'd like to discuss on the record with respect to this witness, but it should be done in closed session.  So maybe the most practicable approach would be to go into closed session, and then Ms. Hounkpatin and I can express ourselves freely and the witness can do likewise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will go into closed session now.
