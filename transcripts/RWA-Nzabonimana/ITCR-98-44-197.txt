MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, would you open the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 10th of November 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case number ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.

Good morning, Madam Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're going to ask you to take an oath to tell the truth, and after that you will give your evidence by responding to the questions put to you by the lawyers who are responsible for doing that in this trial.

The registrar will now give you the oath.
(Declaration made by Witness 3/1 in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will first be questioned by Mr. Hooper, who is the lawyer representing the Accused André Rwamakuba.  
WITNESS 3/1
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	And as you know, you're a protected witness, so you come under the direct protection of this Court, which will ensure that nothing that may identify you is made public.  So you can rest assured that all that you say effectively stays within these four walls.  

Now, I know -- this is nothing to do with you, Madam Witness -- a moment ago there was a little problem with the -- there's a further problem which we'll address, but there was a problem with the translation in English.  Is that now coming through? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
This is the English booth.  Can you hear? 
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly I can hear you, Mr. Frank, thank you; no problem.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you, Madam Witness, I know you were a little nervous about having to use earphones and a microphone.  If you have any difficulty, you let us know straight away.  All right?
A.	Fine. 
Q.	Now, while I hope the other problem is being resolved, can I just pass up to you a document which we all have and which I hope you've seen.  But perhaps I haven't shown it to you, so if I haven't, that's my fault, I'm sorry.  It's a document which is a document that lists your personal details.  And as you indeed provided me with these details, they have been put on a document and that means that we can just look at the document together, and we can agree them.  And if Mr. Issa can just stand by you there, and we'll go down them.  

It's in English.  Have you had the chance of looking at this document?  It describes -- it gives your name.  You can see that there, can't you?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And it then talks about your family.  And then you can see a date of birth there.  If that can be pointed out, just put a finger on it, Mr. Issa.  Is that right?
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	And it gives your nationality?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And after that it gives -- it has the word "ethnic" in English.  It's very similar to your own language, "ethnic origin", and it gives your ethic origin, whether you're a Hutu or Tutsi, and you can see what's written there.  Then it has your religion and then your activity or occupation.  And then it has an address and, in fact, both addresses are the same.  One is your address in 1994, at the time of the genocide, and the other one is your address today, and it then indicates that you only speak Kinyarwanda.  

And then, as this won't be an identifying feature, I think I can say it, that you're not a member of any political group or party.  And I think that's right then, to today.  And then it says -- you can read it -- it says in Kinyarwanda "Ndemeza", et cetera, "ko ibyo".  "I confirm that the above details are correct."  And if you are willing to sign that document as correct, then we've dealt with your personal details.

So if you could be provided with a pen and if you're satisfied that that document correctly describes you in its way, then please sign it and we will exhibit that.  So, in due course, we'll exhibit that.  In the meantime, can I move to the evidence?  

How long have you lived at your present address, Madam Witness, approximately?
A.	I have been living there since 1989, and now we are in 2005. 
Q.	And looking at your list of personal details, I draw, obviously, particular attention to the secteur where you live, and I do so, because as we know -- well, I won't say any more.  Right, so you've lived there all that time.

Now, I understand, or I hope, that my next question will not in any way identify you.  But is it right that in fact you came from another secteur originally, and would you be happy in naming the secteur that you came from -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- or would you rather write that down?  I'll give you the option.
A.	I'd prefer to write it down. 
Q.	All right.  Then let's give you a piece of paper and you can write down the place where you grew up.

Now, we can see the name you've written -- very nicely, if I may say so -- on that piece of paper.  And may I ask you this: during the genocide, and I'm sorry to go into this but I'm only going to touch on it very briefly, did you lose family yourself in the genocide?
A.	Yes, many of my family died. 
Q.	And I can nominate those relatives by a leading question, if there's no objection to that.

Is it right that in the genocide you lost, amongst others, three brothers and your aunt and her children, your cousins; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And your brothers, may I ask, and indeed perhaps just dealing with your brothers, where were they killed?  Again, you don't have to name the place out loud.
A.	One of my brothers was killed in Kabuye, another at Musha.  The wife and children of my brother killed in Musha were thrown in to Lake Muhazi. 
Q.	And I know that if you're asked you have other quite gruelling stories that you could tell this Court.  But it's apparent that you yourself have suffered, and I'll move from there to ask you this: have you ever, before coming here, been out of Rwanda?
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you ever given evidence before any court before?
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, there's one question that I need to ask you, which will be in closed session, and it is one -- essentially one question as to precisely where you live in your secteur.  There's no way we can deal with that other than in closed session and, of course, I hope that these will be all the questions that I have to ask you in that way. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have to go into closed session now.  For the benefit of the members of the public present, it seems that it will take approximately five minutes before we resume in open session.  We're going into closed session now.

MR. HOOPER:
Yes. Sorry about that.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, come back to the question.  After 6th of April, just tell us in your own words what happened.  Let me put it like this: did you notice any change in things after that?
A.	After the death of Habyarimana, the people changed.  They were afraid.  They were wondering what had happened.  They were anxious, and we could see fires all around our hill, and later we saw refugees coming to our area.  That's what I can tell you about the death of the President.  I don't know whether you want me to tell you everything that happened subsequently. 
Q.	Well, I'm just going to ask you particular questions about particular things, but if you want to say anything else, you say it.  But let me ask you this: was there ever any killing in your secteur, and --
A.	Yes, there were killings in our Gikomero secteur. 
Q.	Can you help us as to the day or date when you first learnt of any killing in your secteur?
A.	That was on the 12th of April. 
Q.	Just to make quite sure, was there any killing in that area before the 12th in that secteur?
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, on the 12th, in relation to the events that you're going to tell us about, where were you?
A.	On the 12th, when the killings began at that location, I was in a potato field close to where the massacres took place. 
Q.	Was that potato field part of the property of your house where you lived, or was it at another place?
A.	No, it wasn't near my house.  The field was at a different location. 
Q.	Right.  Now, we know that there's a school there.  And we can talk about the school now.  How far was the field where you were working on the potatoes, how far was that from the school?
A.	It was close by.  Even if I'm unable to give the distance in metres, but the field was so close to the school that I was able to see the school. 
Q.	Right.  Madam Witness, I'm going to just ask you now to tell us what you yourself saw or heard of those events on the 12th.  Now, you've mentioned that there was a massacre.  Can I ask you this: where was the massacre?
A.	At the school itself, at the chapel. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us, first of all, with a massacre there's obviously victims.  As far as you know, who were those victims, where did they come from, and when?
A.	I think that those people had come there on Sunday, and they were killed on that day -- I think it was a Tuesday -- and they came from Mbandazi and from Rubungo.  They had come to take refuge at that location. 
Q.	Had you, in the time that they had been there, learnt of what ethnic origin these people were?  Were they Hutu or Tutsi; were they a mixed group, or what?
A.	They were Tutsi, from what I learned.  I heard that a vehicle came from Rubungo, and amongst the refugees there were Hutus and Tutsis.  And when that vehicle arrived, the Hutus were asked to step to one side and the Tutsis to the other.  So the Hutus climbed -- went -- climbed aboard the vehicle and went away.  This happened on the evening of the 11th.  The following day, that is, the 12th, people came on board the vehicle and shot at the refugees.  But, prior to that, they also shot at an old man who used to live near the school. 
Q.	All right.  Let's just go back on that.  Now, over the years since then it may be that you've discussed this with other people.  It may be that you've attended, for example, Gacaca hearings.  We're going to come to that in a moment, which means that perhaps sometimes you may be telling us things that you heard from other people rather than saw yourself.  

So, at the moment, let's just try and go through the events at the school in terms of what you yourself witnessed.  You've got to put us, as it were, in your shoes for a moment or two, and just, I'm afraid, in a way, live it again for us.  First of all, did you see the --
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
A.	I witnessed what happened on the 12th.  I was in a sweet potato field nearby.  I saw people who were fleeing and I saw bullets that were flying about nearby and refugees passed by the field where I was.  That is what I saw.  So I myself took flight after seeing all of the above. 
Q.	So people fleeing came to where you were and, presumably, carried past you.  You joined with them.  And where did you go?
A.	We went away running and we got to woodland, or to a small forest that belonged to GBK and, when I got there, I realised that I wasn't with my children and that even my husband had gone to the other side.  And when I arrived on the road and when I remembered that I had left behind my children, I went back home. 
Q.	From what you witnessed yourself, how long did the massacre take or last at the school?
A.	The vehicle arrived and then the attackers began to shoot.  And they left almost immediately thereafter and they left behind corpses at the school. 
Q.	Did you know any of the victims?
A.	Yes, there were some members of my family who found their death there at the school, and those family members had come from Mbandazi. That is M-B-A-N-D-A-Z-I.  
Q.	After the killings at the school that day, are you aware of any further killings of Tutsis in your secteur?
A.	No, no other massacre took place in our secteur, since soon after that first massacre the Tutsis of my secteur fled away immediately thereafter. 
Q.	Now, you mentioned that this group that came and committed this massacre at the school -- you said that, first of all, they killed somebody else in Gikomero before continuing to the school.  Who was that person?
A.	It was an old man.  Indeed, he was the husband of my maternal aunt.  By the way, he was Hutu; that person wasn't Tutsi. 
Q.	Given the relationship you've just mentioned, can I invite you then to write the name down rather than speak it, and perhaps you could use the same piece of paper you used a moment ago to indicate the secteur where you grew up.

Can you tell us his first name?  I don't think that that would necessarily identify you.  Does he have a first name that you know, or would you rather write that down as well?
A.	He was called *********** (phonetic). 
Q.	Do you know how many people were murdered at the school?
A.	No.  There were very many victims, and the people had come from all over.  I therefore would not be in a position to give you the number of victims. 
Q.	In the days or weeks following that massacre, where did you stay?
A.	I remained in our locality.  I never went away. 
Q.	And your husband, is he Hutu?  Don't name him.
A.	Yes, he's Hutu. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about a man called André Rwamakuba.  Now, prior to April the 6th 1994, had you ever heard of a man called André Rwamakuba?
A.	No, I never heard of him prior to that date. 
Q.	After the 6th of April, did you ever hear the name André Rwamakuba?
A.	I have never heard -- or I have never heard of that name, either. 
Q.	In your area, do you attend Gacaca hearings?
A.	Yes, I take part at the meetings. 
Q.	Have you ever heard of that man André Rwamakuba being accused by anyone of playing any part in the events in Gikomero commune and, in particular, in your secteur?
A.	No.  So far, nobody has mentioned his name. 
Q.	Have you ever heard anyone say, in the 11 years since then, not in Gacaca but in any conversations that you've had since then about what happened, that André Rwamakuba came to that secteur?  Have you ever heard anyone say that?
A.	I have never heard anything of the sort. 
Q.	Now, we know that André Rwamakuba was sworn in as a Minister in the government on the 9th of April 1994.  So, from then on, he would have been a Minister in the government.  Did you ever hear of a Minister coming up to Gikomero commune during the genocide, during these events?
A.	I never heard anyone say things like that. 
Q.	If a Minister or André Rwamakuba had come to your secteur to play a part in the genocide, do you think that is something that could have happened but possibly you just didn't hear about it, or what?
A.	I wouldn't have failed to know in the event that he came to our secteur. 
Q.	Now, you wrote down on a piece of paper -- well, let me ask you this, a different question, in fact.  Not very far away from Gikomero secteur, of course, is another secteur called Kayanga, and in Kayanga there is a health centre.  Have you ever heard of any killings that took place at the health centre and, if you have, can you tell the Judges here what it is, if anything, that you have learnt about that?
A.	I heard that there were patients at that hospital, which patients were killed at the same Kayanga dispensary. 
Q.	Have you heard anything about who it was who was responsible for that?
A.	I heard people say that the person responsible for that massacre was a communal brigadier as well as the communal policeman. 
Q.	Again, in respect of those killings, did you ever hear of a Minister, a man called André Rwamakuba, being in any way involved?
A.	I never heard anything of the sort. 
Q.	I'm sorry, Madam Witness.  I'm trying to find a piece of paper so that I can write a name on it, because I appreciate that it is a name that should be written rather than spoken.  Can I pass you up this piece of paper?  Looking at that name there, is that a name you recognise?  Again, don't speak it out loud, please, but do you recognise the name of that person?
A.	Yes, I know this person. 
Q.	And I really just want to ask you one question in respect to that person, and it is this: do you know what kind of reputation she has for truthfulness?  Can you help us as to that?
A.	I do not know if other people can have confidence or trust this person, but, personally, I wouldn't trust that person.
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all my questions.  Now, before in fact I sit down, I notice the time.  And I was asked yesterday whether I should have a second witness here.  The poor lady had been coming here for the last three days, so I said no, because I understand that she can be got here.

Now, Ms. Fall is in the best position to help, obviously, in respect to this.  Given that there's two and a quarter hours available, does Ms. Fall think the Witness and Victims Support should be prevailed upon to bring the next witness and, if so, can Witness and Victims Support at, I'm afraid, relatively short notice but I understand there is some degree of anticipation, bring the witness here this morning, the next witness?  They will know who that is.  She's the witness who has been here otherwise every day.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I've been advised by the registrar that the witness is actually here at the moment.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, you see, Witness and Victims Support have, frankly, as I said, the other day excelled themselves as far as we're concerned, and here is just yet another example of it.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.

Madam Witness, you said you have not given evidence in a court before, but under the rules of our court proceedings you have to answer questions from the lawyers on both sides.  So now you have to answer questions put to you by the lawyer representing the Prosecution.  I think that will be Ms. Fall.  And you have to answer her questions.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
   Yes, I understand, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Ms. Fall?
MS. FALL:
I'm obliged, Mr. President.  I would like to say that insofar as this witness is concerned, my learned colleague Mr. Niane will be the one who will be cross-examining her.
THE PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. NIANE: 
	Good morning, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Madam Witness, good morning.
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	My name is Niane, and I'm supposed to be cross-examining you on behalf of the Office of the Prosecutor.  For starters, I wish to ask you this question:  for how long have you been here in Arusha?
A.	I've been here for a week. 
Q.	How many times have you had to meet the Defence Counsel?
A.	Are you referring to my stay here in Arusha?
Q.	Well, before your stay here.
A.	Prior to my arrival here in Arusha, I think I met him only once. 
Q.	And during your stay here in Arusha, how many times have you met him?
A.	I've met him only once as well. 
Q.	When was the last time you met him?
A.	I don't think I can recall the exact date or the exact day.  I cannot remember on what day I met with him during this week. 
Q.	The last time you met with him, how long did your conversation last?
A.	Our discussion did not last for long. 
Q.	When you say it lasted for a very short time, what do you mean by that?
A.	We met for about an hour. 
Q.	Thank you.  Have you already had to give a statement to the Defence counsel?
A.	No. 
Q.	You mean you have never given a statement to the counsel?
A.	Yes, he put questions to me and I answered him, and he wrote that down. 
Q.	Did you sign the statement when he finished putting questions to you?
A.	Yes.
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President --
MR. HOOPER:
I have no signed statement.  My method of working was to ask the witness questions, to make notes in a counsel's notebook and then, at a later time, normally in England, to draft a statement with the hope at one time of re-presenting it, having it translated, and having it signed.  But very rarely did that ever happen.  As far as I can recall, that did not happen with this witness.

The other matter, which I think it's appropriate for me to say at this stage, is that, aside from meeting this witness on the one occasion last week at the safe house for whatever time it was -- it must have been an hour, perhaps longer, on Friday I think, or maybe Saturday -- Friday or Saturday -- in addition, each morning when she's been brought here, I have gone along to see her in the morning.  So I make that plain.
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I realise that Counsel Hooper is giving testimony in the place of the witness.
BY MR. NIANE:  
Q.	Now, I will put the question, and the question is directed to the witness.  Did you say that you signed your statement whereas Counsel Hooper is alleging that you didn't sign it?
A.	Well, it has been a very long time, and there are things that one can forget.
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, at this stage we would like to go into closed session, because I have certain questions that may relate to the personal particulars of the witness that I would like to put to her.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have any idea how long that will last?

MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I would like to be very brief, but you may understand that the length of the closed session may also depend on the kind of answers that the witness will be giving.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand.  We're not asking you to be tied down, but I would just like to advise the public the approximate duration of the period in closed session.
MR. NIANE:
Well, it is 10 minutes past 10 o'clock.  I don't think I'll go beyond the time for a brief recess.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you think you will be as long as 20 minutes?
MR. NIANE:
I think so, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we go back into closed session where you'll be free to speak freely.  We're going into closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 13 to 18] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 6 to 12 by Maureen Dunn)




















(Court resumed at 1101H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now resume.  Mr. Niane will continue his questions in open session.  
MR. NIANE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, before continuing the cross-examination, I should like to tender this list as an exhibit and place -- and wish to have it placed under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  Number, Mr. Registrar, please?  
MR. NIANE:
I think it's P. 73, perhaps.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, P. 73.  

The Registrar has reminded me that we did not -- that we did not complete the exhibits from the former witness.  Now, I think that there's a danger of getting out of sequence with the exhibit numbers so I think I would prefer not to admit this at this stage, so that we could have a proper chronological sequence of exhibit numbers.  So we do not admit this now, and we will try to address it at the close of this witness's testimony; we will put in the testimony for both -- the exhibits for both witnesses.  Are we ready for the exhibits of yesterday?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, we are.  We can deal with that later this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suggest we just deal with it at the close of this witness's testimony, and we can put in the exhibits from both witnesses together. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, indeed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Niane.  
MR. NIANE:
I would comply with the Bench's ruling, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Madam Witness, in your testimony you mentioned that your husband was arrested.  
A.	Yes, he was arrested and detained. 
Q.	Can you please tell the Chamber why he was arrested? 
A.	At the time people were arrested any old how, just after the people came back and people were very angry, and that's how he was arrested and imprisoned, but he was subsequently released. 
Q.	For how long was he imprisoned? 
A.	Seven years. 
Q.	But for what reason had he been arrested? 
A.	He was incorrectly accused of having killed someone, but subsequently that person's child -- the person he was accused of killing, that person's child said that it wasn't him that had done it, and therefore he was released.  
Q.	Was that accusation in the context of the genocide? 
A.	It was said that he had taken part in the genocide, but it was realised that he had done nothing and he was therefore released. 
Q.	Was he tried? 
A.	He was tried under the Gacaca proceedings.  They were underway in the prisons. 
Q.	Thank you.  In your testimony you also spoke of someone called Nkuranga? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter missed the forename.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Is his name Pasteur because that was his name or because he was a shepherd?  "Pasteur" means shepherd.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
But the witness answers:  No, his name was Pasteur.
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	What is his full -- his name? 
A.	His name was Charles Nkuranga. 
Q.	So he was a pastor -- a priest.  In which church? 
A.	He was a pastor, a padre, in the Protestant church. 
Q.	Where? 
A.	At the place where the killings took place. 
Q.	And from whence did he come? 
A.	He came from Gasagara, G-A-S-A-G-A-R-A. 
Q.	Do you know where Charles is now? 
A.	He is dead. 
Q.	Do you know whether he was in any trouble during the genocide, under any threat during the genocide? 
A.	I know that his wife was threatened. 
Q.	He himself was never under threat? 
A.	I don't know.  I don't know whether they were looking for him or not. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now let us come to the events, beginning with the massacres.  We'll begin with the massacres.  You spoke of the 12th of April as the date on which the massacre at the school took place.  Can you give us much more specific detail on the massacre? 
A.	Do you want me to speak of the way in which those massacres unfolded?  
Q.	Precisely.  
A.	I know that that vehicle -- when the Interahamwe arrived and they shot the people, some died; others fled, and there were people at Nkuranga's place, and some of them were killed, as the others were, whereas others managed to flee.  That is what I know.  I know that the Interahamwe went to Nkuranga's place to seek out the people that were there. 
Q.	Well, let us proceed point by point, stage by stage.  You mentioned the arrival of a vehicle.  At what time did the vehicle arrive? 
A.	The vehicle arrived at about 1:30 p.m. or 2 p.m. 
Q.	Where were you exactly when the vehicle arrived? 
A.	I was very near, in a sweet potato field.  I had gone to get some sweet potatoes. 
Q.	From where you were, could you see the vehicle arrive? 
A.	No, I could not see the vehicle, but I heard the noise it made. 
Q.	How far away were you? 
A.	It was about 500 or 600 metres, but I must tell you I don't really know how to measure distances.  
Q.	So you did not see the vehicle arrive.  You heard it arrive, and how do you know that there were Interahamwe aboard the vehicle? 
A.	Because they started shooting. 
Q.	You could hear gunshot -- you could hear firing, gunshots, and you say it was Interahamwe.  Why? 
A.	I heard gunshots and immediately afterwards, the people who were there came to where I was.  They were fleeing, and they told me it was Interahamwe who were firing, and I also fled.  
Q.	So you did not witness the scene? 
A.	I could not see the vehicle because of the classrooms, but the people came running towards me and I started running with them. 
Q.	Now, I don't mean the vehicle, I mean the massacre -- massacres.  
A.	I did not witness the massacre; I merely heard the firing and I saw the people running.  And then, later, when I went to see my aunt, whose husband had also been killed, I saw the corpses. 
Q.	Yet, Madam Witness, a while back in your testimony you did say, in answer to counsel for the Defence, that you saw the massacre take place at the school, and you even specified at the chapel.  
A.	No, I did not say that.  
Q.	Well, we shall see in the transcript.  When the Interahamwe arrived at the chapel at the school, was the reverend there?
A.	I wasn't there, so I don't know if he was there or not. 
Q.	Do you have an idea as to the number of victims? 
A.	I think that they were more than 50.  I was present when they dug up the corpses, but I did not stay to the end to know exactly how many corpses were exhumed, but I think there were more than 50. 
Q.	You mentioned exhumation.  When did that exhumation take place? 
A.	I do not remember, but I know the corpses were exhumed and re-buried in a more dignified way; re-interred in a more dignified way.  
Q.	You say that during the massacre you were in a sweet potato field? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What were you doing in a potato field? 
A.	I was with my husband.  He had come to pick the sweet potato leaves, plant leaves, for the cattle, and that's when the people came running from the school towards us. 
Q.	You also say that the victims were refugees who had come from Rubungo? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So my question is the following:  Were any local inhabitants killed in the massacre? 
A.	The local inhabitants who were killed were killed elsewhere.  They weren't killed at that school, except for the old man I mentioned. 
Q.	So, when you were aware of the massacre, when you heard, you fled? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In which direction did you flee? 
A.	I followed those people, but I did not go very far.  Subsequently, I went home.  And my husband had gone in another direction.  I went home to check my children, to see my children. 
Q.	And what did you do after that? 
A.	I stayed at home. 
Q.	So you say you stayed at home with your children? 
A.	Yes, with my children and my husband. 
Q.	Yet you just said that, in fleeing, your husband went elsewhere and you returned home to see your children.  
A.	I went one way, he went another, and then we met back in the home.  When we got home, we met up again. 
Q.	Were you only with your children when you were fleeing? 
A.	No.  My children were at home.  I was in the field; the children were at home and I went home to join the children. 
Q.	And yet, in your testimony, you said two of your children's friends -- whose name I will not mention -- had fled with you and your husband.  
A.	Those children stayed with us at home until the end of the war. 
Q.	But when you fled, you fled with whom? 
A.	I didn't go far.  I didn't seek refuge elsewhere.  I left the sweet potato field without even taking the sweet potatoes because I was running, and when I'd gone a little distance, I turned on my heels and went home again.  And then we all stayed at home. 
Q.	Now, we'll speak of André Rwamakuba.  You say that you were not politically active? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	Did you follow political activities in your country and in your region? 
A.	No.  I was not interested in politics. 
Q.	And you never heard of any political parties? 
A.	I heard political parties being spoken of, but I never joined any political party. 
Q.	What political parties did you hear mentioned? 
A.	Well, there was the MRND, the MDR, and other political parties that existed at the time. 
Q.	And in your region, were there any branches of any political parties? 
A.	Yes, there were people who had joined those various political parties, but one sees that those people were not very active in our area. 
Q.	Do you know the local leaders of those political parties? 
A.	No, I know no one.  I am speaking of party members because I saw young people and people said they belonged to this party or that, but otherwise, I never knew their local leaders. 
Q.	Were there any political party meetings in your area? 
A.	Yes.  Once I heard mention of a meeting held in our area, but as I didn't attend the meeting, I don't know who had organised it, nor who attended it. 
Q.	At what -- when was that meeting held? 
A.	It was a long time ago.  I do not remember.  I was not interested in politics and I cannot therefore remember when. 
Q.	Yes, I know it was long ago, but what I want is the year, approximately, the year, not the exact date.  
A.	I don't know.  I can't recall.  I can't give you the year, either. 
Q.	Well, can you tell me whether it was before or after the genocide? 
A.	The meeting was held before the genocide. 
Q.	About how long?  One year?  Two years?  Three years?  Six months?  Three months?  
A.	I would be lying if I took the risk of giving you any precise date. 
Q.	Did you ever listen to the radio in those days? 
A.	You mean before the genocide?  
Q.	I mean before the genocide and during the genocide.  
A.	No.  I did not own a radio set.  
Q.	During the massacre at the school -- let us return to the massacre at the school -- did you not hear that a Minister was present during the massacre? 
A.	I never heard any such thing. 
Q.	You never heard of a person called Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda? 
A.	No.  He never came to the location. 
Q.	No, that was not the purport of my question.  My question is if you ever heard about him.  
A.	I never heard of him. 
Q.	And yet Mr. Kamuhanda was a Minister in your locality? 
A.	Yes, I know he's a native of my area. 
Q.	So you heard -- you have heard of him? 
A.	Are you referring to the 1994 period?  
Q.	Of 1993, 1994.  
A.	I never heard people talking about him during that period. 
Q.	When did you hear about him? 
A.	I never heard people talking about him. 
Q.	But, Madam Witness, you have just said that you have heard about him and that he hailed from your area.  
A.	I know that he's a native of my area, but I did not know where he used to live, because since I got married and came to live in that locality, I never saw him come, all the more so as where I live is not very close to his home, or residence. 
Q.	Did you know what was his occupation? 
A.	No, I know nothing of it.  I heard that he was a Minister. 
Q.	Do you know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	No. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt my friend.  Just as we leave this topic, can I, in fact, have it clarified by the Prosecution, perhaps with this witness, that Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, as my understanding of it, was not made a Minister until the 26th of May or about that time?  
MR. NIANE:
I merely want to say that, well, I asked the question concerning Kamuhanda.  I didn't want to know whether he was a Minister or not.  I merely wanted the witness to tell me whether she knew Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda.  Now I'm going to proceed.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Do you know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	No, I do not know him. 
Q.	Have you ever heard about him? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You never heard people talk about him? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, I have a problem here.  How come you want to testify for a person that you don't know and of whom you've never heard? 
A.	Well, people came to interview me, to question me, and to find out if that person came to Gikomero.  I cannot say that I saw him if I never saw him, and I can't confirm things about him where I don't know anything about him. 
Q.	The problem is that you don't even know him.  How, therefore, can you say that he never came to Gikomero? 
A.	I am saying this because the people -- well, I know the people who came to Gikomero. 
Q.	Do you know all those who came to Gikomero? 
A.	I know that only the Interahamwe came to Gikomero.  If he had come to Gikomero, I am certain that someone would have told me that he saw Rwamakuba. 
Q.	When was the first time you heard about Rwamakuba, André? 
A.	I heard people mention his name while witnesses were being looked for in -- within the context of this trial. 
Q.	And who was looking for witnesses? 
A.	It was a white man who was accompanied by a black man who spoke Kinyarwanda, but I'm not aware whether that person was Rwandan or not. 
Q.	And they asked you if you knew Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, they put that question to me, and I said I didn't know him. 
Q.	Does this mean that you didn't know him? 
A.	No, I did not know Rwamakuba. 
Q.	And if I were to tell you that that gentleman is Rwamakuba, would you believe me? 
A.	Well, since I do not know Rwamakuba, what do you expect me to say?  
Q.	Well, so if you were to see him tomorrow, you wouldn't recognise him?  
A.	No, I wouldn't recognise him. 
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I think I'm done with this witness.  

Madam Witness, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. 

Madam Witness, the rules of our proceedings require that you have to answer a few more questions from the -- from Mr. Hooper.  Do you understand that?  Did you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Mr. Hooper.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness, and only a few questions.  You mentioned a lady called **********, and I just want to ask you a little about that lady.  You described her as an old lady.  Can you tell us anything about her health, please?  How is she, do you know? 
A.	That old lady is a very sickly person. 
Q.	I had, in fact, hoped to bring that lady here.  From what you know of her, do you think she's fit enough to travel here to Arusha, or not? 
A.	Since the journey is not a very long one, I think it's possible for her to come here to Arusha. 
Q.	Can I ask you about Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda?  Now, he's nothing to do, essentially, with this case at all and I have no interest in that man, but you've told us how you knew he was a native of the area.  You've told us how you didn't know him because you had moved to your area -- his area -- after you were married only, and you hadn't seen him.  From all you know and from the Gacaca hearings in your area, has his name ever been mentioned as being present at the school at the time of the massacres? 
A.	No, nobody has ever mentioned his name at the Gacaca hearings in our locality. 
Q.	Now, two years ago he was convicted of being, in fact, at that school and of participating, indeed leading the killing at the massacres.  Are you aware of that?  Do you know he has been convicted here of that? 
A.	Yes, I heard of that. 
Q.	Do you know or have you ever talked about this with anyone else in your area?  Do you know what the local reaction was to his conviction here? 
A.	Kamuhanda's conviction came as a surprise to everyone because people were saying that nobody saw him at Gikomero. 
Q.	And with your history and having lost family at that school, would you in any way seek to protect anyone who played any part in the genocide at Gikomero? 
A.	That would be impossible.  I cannot protect anybody whosoever who might have perpetrated genocide.  Otherwise, if it were possible for me to know all those who committed the massacres, I would want to give them exemplary punishment if I had the possibility of doing so.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Thank you very much for your patience in waiting several days and in conducting yourself before the Judges.  I have no other questions for you, unless there's any questions from Mr. President or the Judges.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Madam Witness, this brings your testimony before us to an end.  We would like to thank you for coming to participate in these proceedings and giving evidence.  You are now excused and you are free to go.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. HOOPER:
Before we call the next witness, perhaps we can tidy up the exhibits as, Mr. President, you suggested we might.  And in respect of Witness 9/20, the position is, of course, that there were some witness -- some exhibits that will go in as Prosecution witnesses and some as Defence, which is a -- it may be better, or it may have been better, just to have one list altogether and not two lists per witness, but there we are.  I'm quite happy to adopt that suggestion in future, that we should -- that all witnesses become "D" numbers, as it were, just so they're easily accessible and recognised as pertaining to a particular witness.  But rather than introduce any novel system, I'd ask on behalf of the Defence, having discussed it with the registrar, that the photographs of Ndatemwa that were shown to the witness in re-examination; that is normal photographs rather than photocopies of photographs, be exhibited as D. 153A and B, and those are in the possession of the registry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  Mr. Registrar, that number's all right?
MR. FRY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. 153A and D. 153B admitted)
MR. HOOPER:
The document related to Édouard Turatsinze be exhibited as D. 154, and the list of names shown by the Defence to the witness be -- and that is the document without pseudonyms as we know, be D. 155.  And those are all the exhibits. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that have to be under seal or not?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, quite right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 154 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 155 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER:
And I assume in saying all this that the document that was the identification document signed by the witness, that that's already been exhibited.  Mr. Fry, I think it has, has it not?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, for Witness 920.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  So those are the three exhibits or groups of exhibits that we submit.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, just for Witness 920. 
 
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President.  Insofar as Witness 920 is concerned, we would like to tender as exhibit the document containing the statement of 920 which was disclosed to us by Defence and which bears the number 159.  I think that will be P. 63 (sic) for the Prosecution. 
MR. HOOPER:
In respect of that, I think the nomenclature here is important.  It should not be described as a statement.  It is, in fact, counsel's note.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
And unsigned.  In fact, legal assistant's note and unsigned.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. P. 73 admitted) 
MS. FALL:
Still concerning Witness 920, the second document we should like to tender as Prosecution exhibit will be the list of persons who were here described and that would be reference No. P. 74.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was -- does that require to be under seal?  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 74, under seal)  
MS. FALL:
We still have a document concerning Witness 31; that is the list of names that was submitted this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I'll just take the Defence exhibits for 31 first and then we move on to yours.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper, Witness 31.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  In respect of this witness, there was, of course, the identification document which has been exhibited already. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think it was. 

MR. HOOPER:
In that case, can we -- that would be No. D. 156. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 156 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER:
There was then a piece of paper on which was written the secteur in which the witness had been brought up before her marriage and moving to her present secteur, and on the same document she wrote the name of the man who was first killed, the Hutu man who was killed that she described in her evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  The number is?  
MR. HOOPER:
D. 157.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. 157 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER:
I won't exhibit unless, Mr. President, you feel it's necessary, the piece of paper on which I wrote a name.  Can I just say that that name was the name of Witness GIN?  No dispute with that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't need to have it exhibited.  
MR. HOOPER:
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  So in respect of Witness 31, we only have a document that we would like to tender as an exhibit and that is the list of names that we gave her, and we wish to produce it and tender it as Exhibit P. 75, and we wish it to be placed under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 75 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that concludes the admission of exhibits up to now for the first two witnesses.  
Could you call your next witness now, please?  Could you bring the next witness in?
  
MR. HOOPER:
Witness 311, please.  And I notice the curtains being drawn.  Can I go straight into closed session with this witness?  I'm not entirely sure whether it's necessary --  well, perhaps the oath needs to be taken, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the oath in open session -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and then move into closed session. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming to give testimony in this trial.  The first thing that will happen is that the registrar would ask you to take an oath to tell the truth, and then after that you will give your evidence by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers assigned to that function in the trial. 
(Declaration made by Witness 3/11 in Kinyarwanda) 
WITNESS 3/11, 
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:  
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	We've met before, and in doing that I was able to take some personal details from you.  And there's now going to be a piece of paper handed up to you, nearly all of it in English, and what I'll do, in fact, is ask to go into closed session at this point and afterwards, when we come into open session, I'll invite you to sign the document as correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long is your closed session expected to last?  
MR. HOOPER:
Ten minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Madam Witness, as a protected witness, the Court takes steps to protect your identity and prevent it from being revealed.  Now, counsel has certain questions which may reveal your identity and we are going to move into a closed session during the period.  And we are about to go into the closed session -- for the benefit of the members of the public, we are going to be in closed session for a period of approximately 10 minutes while sensitive information is being elicited from this witness.  So we go into closed session now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 32 to 34] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 19 to 31 by Karen Holm)






















1215H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  Now, Madam Witness, as we now call you, can I just very quickly go back to the document we were looking at, and if you're satisfied it's correct and been corrected, as it has, can you please sign it at the bottom, just below the words "Ndemeza ko ibyo"?  

Thank you very much.  And those personal details you affirm are correct; is that right?  Those details are correct?  
A.	Yes, the information given is correct.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Madam Witness, by the 6th of April 1994, when President Habyarimana was killed, how long had you been living where you live? 
A.	I had been living there for 18 years. 
Q.	And when did you first learn of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	We heard it -- we heard about it the next day, over the radio. 
Q.	Now, prior to the president's death, had there been -- had you noticed if there had been any difficulties in your area between Hutus and Tutsis? 
A.	No, there was no problem between the Hutu and the Tutsi. 
Q.	What did you notice after the death of the president in your area? 
A.	After the death of the president on the 7th, we were ordered to stay home.  We could not leave our houses.  On the 8th we saw refugees coming from Rutungo and Kabuga and Remera, which is now in Rubungo district.  They came on the 8th, 9th, until the 10th.  On the 11th things were quiet and on the 12th, between 1:30 and 2 p.m., two vehicles arrived. 
Q.	All right, Madam Witness.  Sorry to interrupt you; it's just so that people can catch up with your evidence.  And you've told us how things were developing.  I want to ask you about these refugees, first of all.  When did you first notice refugees coming to your area? 
A.	They began coming on the 8th. 
Q.	And you said that they came from Commune Rubungo and again, if we look at our green sketch map, we can see the approximate position of Rubungo commune, which lies to the south, to the Kigali side, that is, of Gikomero commune.  Now, let me ask you about those refugees.  First of all, did you see these refugees yourself? 
A.	I saw the refugees because they were very near to my home.  I was in their company. 
Q.	And these refugees, were they Tutsis or Hutus, or what?  
A.	The refugees were Tutsi, but there were also some Hutu; for example, Hutu ladies married to Tutsi gentlemen. 
Q.	Did they have any property or goods with them, or not? 
A.	Yes, they'd come with their cattle, goats and other personal effects. 
Q.	Now, aside from people coming from that side of Gikomero, did you -- were there any other people you noticed, any other strangers at all? 
A.	No foreigners came there. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That could have been either "foreigners" or "strangers". 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, these people, where did they go; where did they stay, that you could see?  
A.	You mean when they left the place where they had sought refuge?  They did not leave; they stayed there until the 12th. 
Q.	All right, yes.  Sorry, it was the way I -- 
A.	Until the 12th, when they were killed. 
Q.	Very well.  I'll come to the 12th in a moment.  Sorry, it was my fault.  I asked the question badly.  When these people came, and we'll call them refugees -- displaced people -- they came up from Rubungo, and when they got to Gikomero sect -- when they got to that area, where did they go when they arrived?  When they arrived where you live, where did they go; where did they stay? 
A.	When they arrived in Gikomero, they stayed there until the 12th, and after the massacres, the survivors went to live elsewhere.  Otherwise the refugees stayed in Gikomero until the 12th. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And where in Gikomero did they stay? 
A.	They stayed at the school, at the parish **********. 
Q.	Now, you've told us how they started to arrive on the 8th, and they were there until the killings on the 12th.  And between the 8th and the 12th, where did those people, for example, sleep at night; do you know?  
A.	They spent the nights in the classrooms and in the Protestant church. 
Q.	Now, the people there, how were they made up?  Were they young or old?  Were there children?  Old people?  What was the position?  
A.	There were children and women, old people, youths.  There was all types, all categories of people. 
Q.	And during those days, did you have any contact with them, direct contact with them? 
A.	It could happen that I would speak with refugees.  We'd go and see them because among them were teachers that we knew that taught our children.  We went to see them, to speak with them, especially the teachers who taught at the school which our children attended. 
Q.	How did these people -- how were those people fed, if they were fed at all?  How did they eat? 
A.	The people brought food for sale there and the refugees bought the food to eat. 
Q.	Do you know, did they have water there?
A.	There was a water tank at the school and they could draw water there, especially as it was the rainy season. 
Q.	Did they get any other assistance at all from any authority or administrative authority? 
A.	No authority came to that place.

MR. HOOPER:
I think that may be an opportune, an appropriate moment to stop, as we come to the events of the 12th.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  We will take the recess now.  

Madam Witness, we are going to have to take our adjournment now until tomorrow morning.  Our case is only sitting in the morning session.  Now, during this adjournment, as any other adjournment while you are a witness here, you are still a witness and you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody at all.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
And, Mr. President, can I make it plain to the witness that as she's given evidence, I cannot speak to her, either, and so if I come to the safe house, If she should see me at the safe house and if I ignore her, it's not out of rudeness; it's because I mustn't talk to you now that you're in the witness box.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now we can now take the adjournment.  
(Court adjourned at 1230H)
