P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings this morning. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, 
Monday, the 11th of July 2005, for the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Rwamakuba, 
Case Number ICTR-98-44C-T. 

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Appearances, please.  I take it that the appearances are the same as before on both sides? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, as has become customary on Monday morning, I inquire again about your client's non-attendance? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 

Can I ask the Witness to remove her headphones just for a moment.  I don't know if she's got -- no, she hasn't got them on; I can't see.  Yes, thank you. 

Yes, Mr. President, I saw Dr. Rwamakuba on -- on Friday, and took, as it were, particular pains, particularly as I hadn't seen him for a while to convey the then several invitations that this Court -- you, Mr. President -- had extended to him.  And, in all truth, he was very moved by -- by that concern, genuinely moved.  And he wanted me to make it plain that it's not out of any disrespect to you or your fellow Judges that he doesn't attend.  

And I think I've expressed his motive before, but he wants me to make it plain that he asserts that there's been a manipulation of evidence in his case and that he associates the Prosecution with that manipulation.  And he maintains that his presence here -- this is his reason he wishes me to convey to the Tribunal.  His -- his presence -- his presence here could be seen, he feels, to endorse in some way that process when it doesn't merit it.  And so his absence is a purposeful one in that sense and, I repeat, in no way is an indication of a disrespect that he feels for this Bench -- this Court.  And he wants me to make that plain. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, in the circumstances, we still want to make it clear that he is still welcome to come to Court.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we would prefer it if he does. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, as I say, he was, in fact, very very moved by -- by the repeated request.  I think you know what I mean by that.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, we've been informed that there's been some necessary changes with the order in which you are to call your testimony.  What is the position? 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Indeed, we had been advised on the 6th, in the morning, that the Witness ALW who we're expecting here refused to come to Arusha to testify.  So we took all the necessary steps and we talked about it with the Chamber's coordinator, and we came up with provisional solution -- that is, GIO who is a difficult witness that could not be called because it was impossible since Mr. Morley had -- who had to question a witness had to go to Kigali.  So we took all the necessary measures to ensure that those two witnesses be present this morning in the court. 

Unfortunately, this morning at about 7 a.m., I was advised that ALW could no longer appear because her young child, with whom she came, was sick and had to be hospitalised following a malaria attack. So we took the necessary steps to warn the -- or to advise the Defence counsel and the coordinator of the Chamber to tell them that it -- it wasn't ALW that would be appearing, but HF instead. 

I also asked VVSS(sic) and the authorities thereafter to -- if measures were going to be taken, given the fact that ALW would not be present today.  With effect from last week, we get information to the effect that we may have ALW or HF and, therefore, we prepared ourselves as a consequence or accordingly. And as far as we are concerned, we are ready to deal with Witness HF. 

We had even looked into the possibility of seeing whether the witness, Alison Des Forges, could appear, but unfortunately because of her own commitments, she would be available only on the 13th -- that is, on Wednesday.  So that is the situation in which we find ourselves, Mr. President, but you can rest assured that we did everything to ensure that there is no interruption. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor, for that report. 

Mr. Hooper, are you going to be ready to proceed with your cross-examination today? 
MR. HOOPER:
Possibly later today.  As you know, we -- when we rose on Wednesday, we anticipated ALW and ALX to be witnesses.  And then we were told on Thursday that ALX had refused to come and was refusing to come -- in fact, was believed to be here, but when they looked for her, they found she wasn't here at all and hadn't, in fact, budged from Rwanda and was refusing to come as a witness. 

So we addressed that problem and we were told that Witness GIO was going to take her place and we went to considerable lengths on Thursday.  Ms. Pouplard, I know, was up till midnight doing necessary typing for me.  We were then told on Friday that it was no longer to be GIO, but it was to be HF, and I'm afraid our close-knit team over the weekend descended into squabbles and grumpiness and some misdirected bad temperedness on my part at those who didn't really deserve it, but all because we were, rather, living from hand to mouth trying to do translations of documents that we had -- and weren't too sure of -- from Kinyarwanda and into French, and then into English, distracting Mr. O'Shea from his task later this week and -- and so forth.  And it was only at 8:40 this morning that we were told that the expected witness who, we thought, could be dealt with today comfortably, in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination, followed by the present witness in-chief, giving me the opportunity to pull together and finally fine tune, as it were, and adjust cross-examination with documents that are still being prepared, that -- that opportunity would arise because I had this evening to do it. 

Now, I don't know how long this witness is going to take.  And I'm unclear as to the position of ALW.  I understand that she has a sick baby -- a malarial baby who's presently in hospital.  I don't know the extent to which that will prevent her -- if the baby is being comforted and cared for -- to come here and give her evidence in an undistracted manner. 

I don't know if that's been explored or even if she were to give part of her evidence today in an undistracted manner, but it -- it sort of pushes me slightly to -- to the point where part of me says, well, to do a cross-examination properly you need time to fully review the documents that are available and to adjust accordingly -- to ask that her (sic) cross-examination of the present witness takes place tomorrow.  But it may be, if we finish her evidence-in-chief at an earlier time this morning, that several hours intervening between morning and afternoon might -- might allow me to -- to be properly equipped for that task. 

So in earlier discussions I had suggested it would be more comfortable for me to take the cross-examination tomorrow, but I know the pressure this Court is under and if we finish earlier this morning, giving me sufficient time, say three hours, to get paperwork and my cross-examination together, I can deal with this witness perhaps this afternoon; she might even then run into tomorrow.  

We understood last week that Alison Des Forges was not going to be here until Tuesday, and so it was with some surprise when one of our team bumped into her on Thursday.  I'm sure -- she says she has these other commitments, that she's -- she's not -- not available.  But as far as I know, she's not giving evidence in any other case.  And it's a shame that, at least as far as as her evidence-in-chief is concerned, that cannot be accommodated today.  After all, she's presumably spent many, many weeks in preparation for that and -- and we're led to understand that it's really a run through of the expert report, in any event. 

I don't know whether that is something the Prosecution could revisit as a possible answer to the problems that arise today to keep us or to keep you, the Chamber, fully occupied.  So those rather jumbled thoughts are the Defence's position, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, just two questions really.  The anticipated duration of your examination-in-chief of this witness; and secondly, is there any likelihood that ALW will be available today or tomorrow? 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  As far as ALW is concerned, I must confess sincerely that I'm not in a position to answer that question.  But as I said a while ago, the WVSS official is here and I can provide the Chamber with all the necessary information.  I think she (sic) can take the floor to say that -- what the situation is. 

Now, concerning Witness HF, Mr. President, you will note that in our usual practice we never take more than three hours to deal with the witness and I think this witness has had to appear several times before this Chamber.  So as far as I'm concerned, I think that within two and a half hours or three hours, I would have been done with HF. 

Now, concerning Madam Alison Des Forges, as I said a while ago, when we learnt that we had problems with GIO -- because we had authorised Mr. Iain Morley to go to Kigali on mission, it is because the Defence had stated formally that as far as GIO was concerned they could not be sure to take that witness on within one day.  And that is why we couldn't put her on the schedule and which is why we'd rather thought of programming or scheduling ALX or ALW that could be dealt with within one day.  

So the situation is complicated.  We asked Madam Des Forges, who is there, if it was impossible (sic) for her to start her testimony.  But she said, unfortunately, it's part of her goodwill, she had other commitments and it was impossible for her to begin before the 13th.  And that is the reason wherefore we did not insist.  But we pulled all the stops to ensure that HF's evidence is heard today, and it's only this morning that we got information to the effect that ALW could not appear as we had planned last -- last week.  Those are the two possibilities that we had planned for -- for this week and that is why, during this weekend, we tried to see how HF could appear this morning. 

Mr. President, if you will -- if you will grant us leave, I think the WVSS official can clarify the matter further. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, I would appreciate that. 
MR. DIOP: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  My name is Diop.  I am an officer in WVSS.  

Madam Fall has just told you our witness was admitted in hospital with her baby, who is suffering from malaria, so we're doing everything to convince her to leave her child in care, if possible, but she refused.  So that is our dilemma; we are doing all we can to make her come. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Please continue your efforts. 

In the meantime, though, if the Prosecution -- Ms. Fall, I think what we should do is we should start with your witness now and see how far we get before the lunch break. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would also like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to one thing because if we begin questioning HF, we should be done with it before tomorrow, which is why we are going to have a break that will last three weeks.  And if the witness -- her -- we haven't completed the testimony of that witness, they can't remain here in Arusha, because the WSS -- WVSS told us it would be impossible for her to come here -- to stay here.  

So after her testimony, she will be forced -- she will have to go back to Rwanda and it's not something that is desirable.  I think you, yourself, have had to say that you wouldn't want a witness to begin giving testimony and then continue with it later.  So if we begin with HF's testimony, we should have all the assurances that we're going to be done with her testimony by tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I understood that that was what Mr. Hooper had said, but that he just needed some time between -- to prepare for his cross-examination.

So we are proceeding with this witness on the basis that her testimony will be completed and that's the only, really, basis upon which we can operate.  Because I certainly would think it would be most undesirable to have a three-week break or four-week break between the testimony of any -- any witness, particularly a witness of fact.  So at this stage, I would ask the registrar to administer the oath to the witness. 

Madam Witness, can you hear me? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are going to commence giving testimony in this trial.  The registrar will give you an oath to tell the truth.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, there's a problem -- a technical problem.  We cannot hear the Kinyarwanda booth and, therefore, cannot interpret what the witness is saying, since she has to be interpreted into -- from Kinyarwanda, into French and into English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, there's a technical (inaudible).
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, sir. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Is that the English booth?  Yes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Now, I want to get relay from Kinyarwanda.  I can hear.  Yeah, it's okay now.  You're most welcome. 
 (Declaration made by Witness HF in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall, you may proceed. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS HF,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness. 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm going to begin your examination-in-chief and since you're a protected witness, I'm going to give you a document that has your particulars and you'll try to ascertain as to whether the information concerning your particulars are correct.
MS. FALL:
And I'll request the registrar official to assist us in this. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, is it possible for you to identify the information that is found on that document? 
A.	I realise that I have my names on the document.  I can also note that the document indicates my age, my nationality and my ethnic group. 
Q.	Can you see on that document, what is your occupation today?  
MS. FALL:
May the registry assist her, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you.  Yes, indeed, I have seen the -- where mention is made of my occupation today. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	What about your occupation in April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I have also seen it. 
Q.	Can you tell us if the information concerning your place of birth, your current address, and your address in 1994 are correct? 
A.	Yes, the information is correct. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like to request, if possible, that you write down the date and your signature on that document. 
A.	Today is the 11th of May 2005. 
Q.	Now, let's carry on -- 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like that this document be entered as a Prosecution exhibit and that it be under seal.  I think that it should be entered under the reference number P. 54. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, P. 54, under seal -- admitted, under seal as P. 54. 
(Exhibit P. 54 admitted, under seal)
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, have you already had to give evidence before this Court? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Would you be in a position to tell us during what period you did so? 
A.	I appeared as a witness before this Tribunal in December 2003. 
Q.	Can you tell us what trial you came to testify in? 
A.	I testified in the Rwamakuba case. 
Q.	Are you in a position to tell us what is the first name of the Rwamakuba in question? 
A.	André. 
Q.	Have you had to appear before a national court already? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you recall the time? 
A.	I cannot remember the time or the period at which I gave evidence before the national court. 
Q.	Can you tell us in which case you testified? 
A.	I testified in the case between the Prosecutor and Dr. Gatera.  I also gave evidence before Gacaca court and I also gave evidence in the case, the Prosecution against Ruhangirwa. 
Q.	Have you already had opportunity of meeting the investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal? 
A.	Yes, I have already met them. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many times you've met them today? 
A.	I have met them four times. 
Q.	Can you tell us what was the matter -- what you discussed when you met them? 
A.	Those investigators came to ask me to come and testify. 
Q.	They asked you to testify against who? 
A.	First, it was against Kanyabashi, Joseph; and for the second occasion, during the second occasion I met a certain Booh-Booh; and the third time, I had to testify against André Rwamakuba; and I think the fourth time, the investigators also wanted me to testify against André Rwamakuba.  That is as far as the four times that I met the investigators are concerned. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you some clarification concerning the two times you talked to investigators concerning Rwamakuba. Can you remember the period at which you met those investigators?  Do you have dates that you can give us? 
A.	For the first time, that was in 1997, and the second time -- that is, concerning Rwamakuba, that was in 2001 that I met the investigators. 
Q.	During those two periods and for each meeting with the investigators, did you have to give a statement? 
A.	Yes, they took down my statement. 
Q.	Did you sign the declaration -- the statement? 
A.	Yes, I signed those statements. 
Q.	Before signing the statements were they read out to you? 
A.	Yes, the statements were read out to me before I appended my signature to the document bearing my statement. 
Q.	And did you have any opportunity of making any changes to the statement? 
A.	As regards the 1997 statement, I did not provide very much information.  But as regards the 2001 statement, that was very much more detailed. 
Q.	You're telling us that the 2001 statement was much more detailed, and why was that? 
A.	In 1997, we had just come out of the war; we didn't have the heart to speak of those events.  But I did note that I had to cooperate with the Tribunal in respect of the events of 1994 and therefore provided more ample information subsequently. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness. I will come back later to your testimony before the national courts.  I should like to ask you now where you were in mid-April 1994.
A.	On Habyarimana's death on the 6th, I was at home in my home commune, and towards 
	the 10th of April -- the 18th of April, the 18th, not the 10th, I went to the university teaching hospital to help my elder sister who was sick -- to help take care of my elder sister who was sick. 
Q.	You've told us that you went to the hospital to assist your elder sister who was sick on the 18th of April.  Can you now tell us what your sister was suffering from? 
A.	My elder sister had come to give birth at that hospital. 
Q.	Did she, in fact, give birth? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us where the child and your elder sister are now? 
A.	They were killed. 
Q.	Can you tell us please, Witness, how long you stayed at the university teaching hospital? 
A.	I arrived there on the 18th and I left that place on the 29th. 
Q.	Are you sure of those dates?  You are being very specific? 
A.	Yes, I'm sure of those dates. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what you saw at the university teaching hospital while you were there? 
A.	I witnessed horrible massacres. 
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber under what circumstances those massacres took place? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you specify when those massacres took place? 
A.	There were massacres on the 20th. 
Q.	Could you specify under what circumstances the massacres of the 20th took place? 
A.	There were massacres, in particular, at the university teaching hospital where I was.  They began killing people. There were doctors and other hospital employees and soldiers from the ESO, and Interahamwe who came from outside to kill people at the hospital. 
Q.	Madam Witness, have you heard of a person named André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I have heard of André Rwamakuba spoken of and I heard him personally speaking. 
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances you heard André Rwamakuba spoken of? 
A.	If I told you what I personally saw concerning André Rwamakuba, I would begin by mentioning the hatchet he had on his belt, and I saw him enter the maternity ward and oblige the patients to get up, and they were taken away in a pickup. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Counsel -- Counsel's microphone is not on.  I cannot hear.

Counsel is saying, "Can you speak slowly and proceed by stages so that everyone can take notes."
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So you saw him and he was with a hatchet.  Please speak slowly and take things in stages. 
A.	I saw him; he had a hatchet tied around the waist. 
Q.	At what time did you see him in relation to your arrival at the hospital? 
A.	If I take as a point of reference the day I arrived at the hospital, I saw him after three days -- three days after my arrival. 
Q.	You arrived on the 18th.  So if we calculate we get the 21st.  So you saw him arrive with that hatchet.  Where were you, more specifically? 
A.	When I saw him, I was in the corridor somewhere, just a bit back from where he was. 
Q.	And that corridor was where in the hospital? 
A.	It was the corridor between the operating theatre and the maternity ward. 
Q.	And what did you see from there, Madam Witness? 
A.	I could see from there -- I could see André Rwamakuba entering the maternity ward. 
Q.	And did you see him do anything? 
A.	I saw him force the Tutsi patients -- the Tutsi ladies, who were patients, get out of bed and they were taken to a pickup truck, and he was in the company of Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	Madam Witness, was André Rwamakuba in the sole company of Dr. Gatera? 
A.	There were also hospital employees, Interahamwe, and soldiers as well as 
	Dr. Twagirayezu, Emmanuel. 
Q.	You have spoken of Interahamwe, who were the Interahamwe? 
A.	They were Hutu who had banded together and -- to add the common purpose of killing the Tutsi. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us whether the people accompanying André Rwamakuba were armed or not? 
A.	Those persons were armed. 
Q.	Can you tell us what sort of weapons they carried? 
A.	Some people had hatchets, but particularly, Gatera and Rwamakuba.  Others had clubs or big sticks. 
Q.	You say those people selected patients to be taken to the vehicle.  Did you see any one actually selecting a patient? 
A.	Yes, I saw them. 
Q.	Who were those people? 
A.	It was André Rwamakuba, Dr. Gatera, and people who had a list of Tutsi who were to be taken out of their hospital beds to be killed, and that person was Juliette. 
Q.	Do you know who this Juliette was? 
A.	It was a lady who was a Red Cross nurse.  She was a nurse who was in the employment of the 
	Red Cross. 
Q.	You have told us that she had a list of people -- of names of people to be killed.  Do you know what -- to which ethnic group those people belonged? 
A.	They belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group. 
Q.	You said they were taken to a vehicle, can you describe the vehicle? 
A.	It was a red pickup. 
Q.	From where you were, can you tell us if you saw the pickup? 
A.	Yes, I could see -- yes, I could see the pickup. 
Q.	Can you specify where the pickup was? 
A.	It was parked -- it was parked near the maternity ward. 
Q.	Witness, once those people were taken to the pickup, do you know where they were subsequently taken? 
A.	They were taken to a pit near the back of the maternity ward.  But we didn't know there was a pit there; we only learnt of -- it's only after the war that we came to know that there was a pit there. 
Q.	Madam Witness, after these first events that you have described that took place three days after your arrival at the hospital, did you have further opportunity to see André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, I saw him again.  He was going towards the operating theatre or the -- or the surgical ward, sorry, the surgical ward where people were treated. 
Q.	Did you know André Rwamakuba before that time? 
A.	No, I did not know him.  It was one of the hospital employees who informed me as to his identity and spoke to me -- spoke to me of him at that time. 
Q.	I won't ask you to give me the name, but would you be able to write down the name of the person who informed you of André Rwamakuba's identity? 
A.	There is no problem. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, could the witness be handed a sheet of paper in order to provide the name of that person? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 

MR. HOOPER:
I can read the first name, but I can't read the second. I'm wondering if the witness could perhaps spell it again in bigger letters for me.  Thank you. 
MS. FALL:
We will ask her to write a bit more legibly.  Yes, I see what she's written.  Perhaps we could ask her to make an effort.
(Pages 1 to 12 by Jean Baigent)































1030H
MS. FALL: 
I should like to invite the Defence to make an effort to understand what the witness has written down so that we do not lose too much time.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I have but I don't understand it.  But I can take it up with her later.  It's all right, thank you.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you.  I think we will indeed be in a position to see that person later on.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us what that person told you when she intimated to you that the person's identity was André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Given the bad conduct of that person at the hospital, I felt the urge to know him. 
Q.	So what did the person tell you, who informed -- the person who had informed you, what other information did she give you on André Rwamakuba, the person who had informed you as to his name?  
A.	I put the question to her and she answered that his name was André Rwamakuba and that he had been an intern at the university teaching hospital and had finished his training at the University of Butare, at the faculty of medicine. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry.  I've been trying to get your attention before that -- sorry.  It -- this person is being interpreted into as a "she".  Is that, in fact, correct?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It may be because "person" is feminine in French, "une personne".  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, the person whose name you wrote on the paper, is it a lady or a gentleman? 
A.	A gentleman, a man. 
MS. FALL: 
Counsel -- Learned Counsel, are you satisfied?  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, apart from that man, has anyone else spoken -- did anyone else speak to you of André Rwamakuba? 
A.	It is that man who spoke to me of him. 
Q.	And no other person spoke to you of André Rwamakuba subsequently? 
A.	After that there was a lady who was with me and whose name I will try not to mention because of her security, but this is a lady who was with me in that same hospital because she had come to seek refuge at the hospital. 
Q.	Madam Witness, would you be in a position to write down the name of that lady on the same sheet of paper on which you wrote the name of your first informer?  And would it be possible to write a figure, for instance, before the first name you can write 1, and the -- write 2 before the second name and put in brackets "information".  
MS. FALL:
Please can you hand over the document to her.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is murmuring to the registry official that she does not understand.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I am going to repeat.  Has she put down a figure in front of each name?  Did she write down a figure in front of each name?
A.	That's been done, so there is no problem. 
Q.	I think it is the fact of putting down something in brackets that she's just -- she is not understanding.  I think I will make do with what she has done already.  
A.	Fine.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry to take up time, would it be possible for the witness to print the second name so that we can read it?  I can't read it, I'm afraid.  I say the second name, the second part of the new name.  Thank you.  
MS. FALL: 
We are going to ask the witness if she can do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, do you understand what is being asked?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, are we coming to a convenient time to take the break?  It's 10:45. 
MS. FALL: 
Yes, Mr. President, I was going to request whether we can take the break now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take a short break for about 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1045H to 1111H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can now resume.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, before we took the break, you said that it's a man who gave you information concerning André Rwamakuba, and that a woman -- then you said it's a woman who gave you information telling you that the person who was at the university teaching hospital was
	André Rwamakuba; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Madam Witness, so after the first event you talked to us about, to the effect that you saw 
	André Rwamakuba accompanied by the people that you mentioned in the presence of choosing people, did you have the opportunity of seeing André Rwamakuba again? 
A.	When we finished -- before the -- we went on break, I said that I saw them enter the surgery unit, the surgery room. 
MS. FALL: 
I'm sorry, I haven't heard the interpretation.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness was telling you before the break that that she saw André Rwamakuba enter the surgery room.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Can she tell us the time at which she saw him enter the surgery operations room? 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm afraid -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- 
THE WITNESS: 
I do not quite know the date.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry.  The question that was just put was, when did she see him enter the surgery operations room, which is a leading question, if it was, in fact, the question.  But the evidence before the break was that this witness saw A.R. again going towards the surgical ward.  So I'm wondering if we can just see where we are on this -- on this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, what the witness had said -- I have now got my real-time again.  So the witness had said, "When we finished before we went on break, I said that I saw them enter the surgery unit, the surgery room."  Ms. Fall said, "I'm sorry I haven't heard the interpretation," and the interpreter repeated:  "The witness was telling you before the break that André Rwamakuba entered the surgery room."  So it is a follow up to that.  
MR. HOOPER: 
All right, thank you very much.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President, for that clarification.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So Madam Witness, you did indeed say that you saw André Rwamakuba enter the surgery room.  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	When you saw him entering that room, was he alone? 
A.	He was not alone. 
Q.	Can you tell us, who were those with him? 
A.	He was accompanied by Dr. Gatera and the other Interahamwe who had come from outside the hospital, soldiers from ESO, as well as other employees of the hospital.  Also with him was a certain Emmanuel Twagirayezu.

1115H 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, where were you at that time? 
A.	I was somewhere in the corridor. 
Q.	Madam Witness, a while ago, you told us what was your ethnic group when you were reading your identification papers.  How could you move about so freely within the hospital? 
A.	Can you please repeat your question?  
Q.	I was asking you how you could so freely move about in the hospital whereas -- well, given your ethnicity, which is Tutsi? 
A.	We tried to avoid being seen by those people.  At the beginning, I started by hiding myself but, subsequently, I was given a document that enabled me to move about.  The document testified that I was taking care of a patient, I was a patient attendant.  I was able to move about to see those people with my own eyes. 
Q.	So, when you saw them in the surgery room, what did you observe? 
A.	I saw them enter the surgical room and I saw André Rwamakuba give a blow using a hoe at somebody, and then the person -- he brought other persons and gave them to Interahamwe who put him in a van.
Q.	We will go back to those two incidents.  The first time you saw him hit a person with what instrument, can you specify the instrument? 
A.	He used an axe. 
Q.	Can you tell us where that person was? 
A.	That person was lying on a bed in the surgical room. 
Q.	Did you know that person in person?  Did you know him personally? 
A.	No, I did not know that person's name. 
Q.	You state that you saw Rwamakuba hit that person.  Can you tell us the specific spot at which he hit the person? 
A.	He gave him a blow on the head. 
Q.	You are, therefore, saying that he hit him with an axe on the head?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then what happened? 
A.	Later, he woke up somebody who was sleeping on the bed, he stepped on his neck, brought him out and gave him to Interahamwe who put him in a van.  And while André Rwamakuba was doing that, he was in the company of a Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	Madam Witness, when those persons were taken away, did you know whether they were dead or not? 
A.	Those persons were dead. 
Q.	How could you be sure about that? 
A.	I saw them, when you see a person who is dead you cannot fail to know it. 
Q.	You tell us that you are an eyewitness to those events.  Can you tell us the distance that separated you, that is from where you were and the spot at which those events took place? 
A.	The distance wasn't long.  I was not very far from those people. 
Q.	When you say not far, are you in a position to tell us a distance, even if it is only an estimated distance, an approximate distance?
A.	To give an estimate, I would say two metres separated me from where those events were taking place. 
Q.	When you say two metres, can you estimate the distance separating you from Rwamakuba, for instance, if you take the position at which you are sitting, can you tell us, looking at this room where would have been Rwamakuba and the people with him? 
A.	Let's suppose that I am standing here where I am sitting and those persons would have been behind the Defence counsel.  
Q.	And from where you were, you could see exactly what was happening? 
A.	I could see what was happening very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, for the record, what distance would you say she pointed out?  
MS. FALL: 
The distance would cover a little more than two metres, if I were to make an estimate.  I wonder if the registry could help us to estimate a distance for purposes of the transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, the problem is we don't have a plan for this courtroom.  But on an earlier occasion that distance was estimated at about 10 metres, wasn't it?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I believe that on another occasion where it was said that it was about 10 metres was when the witness was saying that the distance that would run from where I am to the place -- to the spot just behind the Defence counsel.  So it was said that the distance would cover about 10 metres.  Now given that there is a shorter distance between where she is and the Defence counsel is, I think that would be less than ten metres. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you have an agreement on the --  
MR. HOOPER: 
I think the earlier distance was 20 metres between myself and Ms. Fall, and we don't get very much closer.  It was about 20 metres.  But from where I am to the witness is, very approximately, I would think, 10 metres.  But the witness was indicating an uncertain point behind me.  I would invite Ms. Fall to see if there is, perhaps, a specific point in relation to this courtroom which the witness recalls being the distance between her and what she witnessed.  Otherwise, I'm happy to accept ten metres, but it is a bit farther than that, I'm not sure how much farther. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like that we try to check in the transcript the distance that      Counsel Hooper has just mentioned.  We never talked about 20 metres.  And I would like to insist that we check that distance in the transcript.  It is an approximate distance -- or estimate that the witness has given and that is why, personally, if we have not measured the distance, I would not be able to give the distance.  

What is certain is that the last time the estimate that was given was a little more than ten metres.  And there is a very short distance that is separating the two distances.  So it would be better to try to have clearer indications.  But, indeed, I think the distance would be longer than the two metres that the witness mentioned, but I would like to say that that is a very approximate estimate of the distance that I was given -- or made by the witness. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I think the witness wants to contribute something.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I only gave you an estimated distance.  I just made an estimate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you are not being criticised at this stage.  It is usual, you see, if someone is reading your evidence and you say from where I am to a particular point, it doesn't help anybody who is reading.  So I was only trying to assist in making what you said more understandable.  So it wasn't criticising you.

Yes, Ms. Fall, continue.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, you did tell us that those two persons were taken away in the van.  Do you know exactly where they were taken to? 
A.	We learned subsequently that they were taken to a place below the maternity.  However, we do not know the grave that was after the maternity.  After the war we saw that grave -- that tomb. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us which was the ethnic group of those persons that were killed by    André Rwamakuba? 
A.	They belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group. 
Q.	Besides the two events that you have just talked to us about, did you see Dr. André Rwamakuba again or did you see any other things concerning him? 
A.	I saw him again when he went to where the Gikomero and Gitarama refugees were.  There were haphazard shelters where they were staying.  And I saw him select people to be taken away on vehicles. 
Q.	And where, exactly, were those refugees in the makeshift shelters? 
A.	The refugees were staying in front of the pediatric ward. 
Q.	Can you tell us more specifically what you saw André Rwamakuba do at that place? 
A.	You are referring to those makeshift shelters?  
Q.	Did you see him do anything at that place? 
A.	He took refugees away.  He was with other Interahamwe, they took refugees away on a pick up.  And at that time he was in the company of Interahamwe. 
Q.	Can you tell us when that was? 
A.	When I saw him where those makeshift shelters were, it was in the afternoon. 
Q.	Do you remember the date? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Madam Witness, did you hear of any meetings that took place at the hospital? 
A.	Meetings were held at the faculty of medicine, at the medical faculty. 
Q.	You say that there were meetings, can you tell us how many meetings there were, if you know? 
A.	I do not know how many meetings were held. 
Q.	Do you know if André Rwamakuba was present or not at those meetings? 
A.	Yes, he took part in those meetings. 
Q.	Can you tell us if other people, apart from André Rwamakuba, attended those meetings?  And if so, can you give us their names? 
A.	There was André Rwamakuba, Dr. Gatera, Emmanuel Twagirayezu and other hospital employees, other hospital staff, as well as the Interahamwe and the soldiers from the ESO, the non-commissioned officers school, École des sous-officiers? 
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know -- did you hear what was the purpose of those meetings? 
A.	The meetings were to prepare the killings that took place at the hospital. 
Q.	Madam, that information you have just provided us, how did you know it?  How did you know the purpose was to prepare the killings? 
A.	We were witnesses and we heard of the events and that is how I can say that the meetings were held to prepare the killings. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you state that the people -- you have stated that the people accompanying 
	André Rwamakuba -- some of the people accompanying him were armed; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	You have described the type of weapons.  There were clubs bludgeons, hatchets; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Can you tell us how those people had received those weapons? 
A.	As to the circumstances under which they received the weapons, I don't know, but I can tell you that the hatchets were given by André Rwamakuba.  Otherwise, I don't know how they obtained -- the attackers obtained the clubs.  But the hatchets were handed out by André Rwamakuba and Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	How do you know that the hatchets were handed out by Dr. Gatera and André Rwamakuba? 
A.	We heard people saying so. 
Q.	Did you personally see André Rwamakuba hand out those weapons or machetes? 
A.	No, I did not personally see him distributing -- issuing those weapons? 
Q.	Witness HF, do you know of any victims who were at Butare teaching hospital and who were killed there? 
A.	I know my big sister, my elder brother, and another nurse who was killed there.  Those are the victims whose names I know. 
Q.	Regarding your eldest sister, was that the one who had given birth? 
A.	Yes, indeed, it was her. 
Q.	And as regards your elder brother, at what time -- at which moment was he at Butare teaching hospital? 
A.	He arrived there injured, wounded, after being attacked by Interahamwe. 
Q.	Do you know where exactly he was attacked by the Interahamwe -- assaulted by the Interahamwe? 
A.	My brother was wounded on the head.  He had a head wound from the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Was it at the hospital that he was assaulted? 
A.	No, it was not at a hospital.  He arrived wounded at the hospital seeking treatment. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you have told us that you stayed for a certain time at the hospital.  And then, unless I am mistaken, it was from the 18th to the 29th of April; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	During that time you saw André Rwamakuba under the circumstances you have described to us; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	After the 29th of April, can you tell us where you went? 
A.	I left the hospital and went to the préfectural offices where there were other refugees. 
Q.	After arriving at the préfectural offices, did you see André Rwamakuba again? 
A.	No, I did not see him again. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I should like to come back, I told you I would do so at the beginning of my cross-examination.  Have you testified before the Rwandan courts in respect of Dr. Gatera; and in that testimony, did you mention André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I do not think I mentioned that name. 
Q.	In what context did you testify against Dr. Gatera in Rwanda -- in respect of what events, more specifically? 
A.	I was testifying against him regarding the killing at the university, at the hospital that he had done everything he could for the killings to occur.  And I testified against him in respect of the meetings held in the faculty of medicine. 
Q.	Madam Witness, in your testimony this morning you have often mentioned André Rwamakuba as being in the company of Dr. Gatera.  Did you, at one time or another, mention André Rwamakuba in respect of the accusations leveled against Dr. Gatera in view of his involvement in the events concerned at the hospital? 
A.	You have to testify against the person present.  You can not testify against someone who is absent.  And I thought the time would come when I could make a statement against that person. 
Q.	Madam Witness, this might be my last question for the time being.  Are you in a position to estimate the number of victims there were at Butare hospital? 
A.	There were many victims. 
Q.	Are you in a position to tell us the ethnicity of the victims? 
A.	They were Tutsi. 
Q.	Are you in a position to say that all of the victims were Tutsi? 
A.	They were Tutsi. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness? 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for the time being. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I have a handful of questions I can put at this stage.  As I understand it at present, we are not going to reach ALW at all, realistically, as I understand it, at least not with the confidence that she will be completed, perhaps, in one day, once we start this witness.  That is, if I get time, for example, now to prepare myself for this witness.  So if I am right in that, in that view point, then I would prefer to cross-examine this witness tomorrow.  And in doing that, as I understand it, I won't be costing the Court any time, lost time, as I understand it.  If I start her later today, I doubt that, realistically, we are going to start and complete the witness with the sick baby tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you give an indication as to the anticipated duration of your examination?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, for example, if, I were to start tomorrow at 9 o'clock, I would -- and if this witness is well enough tomorrow, then I would hope to complete her evidence tomorrow.   

MR. PRESIDENT:
But in time for re-examination?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I mean judging by the amount of the examination that tended to be the case in this case, from previous experience; I would have thought that I would have finished the witness by quarter to 5:00.  That would leave Ms. Fall with --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see the options that we have are that we can let you start now and go up to 12:30.  If that will guarantee that we complete the witness tomorrow; or if you can guarantee now that you will complete the witness tomorrow, we can take the adjournment now?  That is what we are considering. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I don't mind starting now, getting one or two things out of the way.  But I don't have my tick list with me, for example, today.  But I suppose if need be I can go into closed session with respect to that and deal with it by names.  I can certainly take up time usefully until half past 12. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, that is not the point of you taking up time.   Our object is to guarantee completion tomorrow.  If it is not necessary to start now, we won't start now.  But if you can give us the undertaking that you will complete tomorrow, we will take the adjournment now.  Our objective is to assure that the testimony is completed by tomorrow and not just to take up time. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I appreciate that.  My understanding and, indeed, in order to better guarantee my position, I would prefer to use the next half hour now asking some questions.  And then I can guarantee, as I say, to finish by the time I have indicated tomorrow. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think here, again, I shouldn't want the Prosecution to consistently depend on the Defence.  Of course, the Defence must undertake its cross-examination and we must undertake re-examination in chief.  So I don't think the Defence can say we will finish tomorrow by 4:45 p.m. so that I can redirect.  I cannot guarantee that my re-examination won't take more than an hour.  So, in order to accommodate everybody, I should like to invite Counsel Hooper to finish in enough time to let us undertake redirect under the best conditions.  

I don't think we can today accept being told that they will have finished by 4:45 p.m., because I cannot guarantee how long redirect will take because it depends on the cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you see, I was just about to ask you what allocation you think should be made for redirect. 
MS. FALL: 
I think for this witness, it might last more than an hour.  Let's say an hour and a half so that I should feel at ease. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, examination-in-chief has taken two hours, if not less.  So if my friend is now suggesting her re-examination, looking ahead, realistically, and knowing, as she does, as it were, my position, it is going to take an hour and a half, then I suggest that she has another go at examination-in-chief. 
MS. FALL: 
I did not understand Counsel Hooper.  I don't think he should tell me what to do.  He should take care of his cross-examination, and I will take care of the examination-in-chief and the redirect. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I don't really want to transform the courtroom into a fencing arena.  So, I think we will just let     Mr. Hooper start with his cross-examination. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning to you, sir. 
Q.	I would like to start, if I may, with just a brief review of the times you have been met before and the times and opportunities you have had to make statements before.  And you indicated this morning some of those occasions.  In fact, I quite accept, of course, you won't remember the dates.  But as I go through the statements and nominate them, I'm sure you will be willing to accept from me the accuracy of the dates that I give.  And if I am wrong, Madam Prosecutor will correct me, I am sure.

Now, the first time you gave a statement, and in due course I will move to have all of these statements exhibited, the first time that you gave a statement is our HF2, page HF2,which is dated the 11th of September 1997, when you were seen by an Almahamoud Sidibe and an Agnus Rabemananjara, that is R-A-B-E-M-A-N-A-N-J-A-R-A, Rabemananjara, together with an interpreter, Jean-Marie Vianney Gatabazi, that was the 11th of September 1997.  Do you remember that occasion, Madam?  
A.	I can confirm the year.  As regards the other specifics regarding the dates, I cannot confirm, but I do remember that it was in 1997. 
Q.	Yes.  I have touched on the dates, and I realise you won't have those dates in your head after all of these years.  As I give you dates, I'm sure you can happily accept that they are correct dates that I am giving you.  And if I am wrong, Madam Prosecutor, Ms. Fall, will be interceding in your interest.  So will you accept that that is the correct date that I have given you? 
A.	What I confirm is that I met them in 1997. 
Q.	Now, in that statement you talk about André Rwamakuba, who I represent, and Dr. Gatera.  And those of us who have this statement can quickly run our eyes over that and see the extent of it.  Now, I was unclear what you were saying about this statement.  

First of all, can I ask you this, what was it that brought these investigators to speak to you about         Dr. Rwamakuba?  Can you help me as to that?  
A.	I saw them when they came to see me. 
Q.	Is that your answer, "I saw them when they came to see me"?  My question was, do you have any idea what brought them to you? 
A.	Sorry, I don't understand your question.  Could you repeat it, please? 
Q.	Certainly.  On the 11th of September 1997, investigators from this Tribunal came to see you at your place of work and questioned you and got information from you about André Rwamakuba.  Do you know why it was they came to see you, or did they just come out of the blue, come from no where to see you? 
A.	I saw them coming to see me as a survivor from the university teaching hospital. 
Q.	Well, yes, did they come and say, look we want to speak to you about André Rwamakuba, or had you told somebody else that you did have some information about André Rwamakuba?  Can you recall which it was? 
A.	I don't understand your question. 
Q.	Do you know why they came to speak to you about André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I have answered to you as follows; they came and asked me questions as a survivor of the university teaching hospital, I just saw them come. 
Q.	Before that interview, had you discussed André Rwamakuba with anybody else at your place of work? 
A.	At my place of work, I had not discussed it, but I had discussed the issue with people who were with me during the genocide.  And I'm referring, specifically, to a lady, whose name I don't want to mention, I mentioned that name on the sheet of paper after the second person.  That is the lady with whom I discussed about André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Yes, I was unclear about the name of that person on the piece of paper you wrote.  I can see the first name very clearly.  Don't say it out loud, if you don't want to, and perhaps you shouldn't any way.  But may I ask you this, to your knowledge is that lady also a witness in this case? 
A.	I know nothing about that. 
Q.	If you would give me one moment, please.

Let me hand you up a piece of paper.  I hope you have more success with my writing than, perhaps, I have had with yours.  I know handwriting is difficult, personal handwriting differs very much.  See if you can make out the name I have written there together with a nickname and let me know if that is the person.  Is that the person, don't say the name out loud?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	All right, **************************.  And you know that person well, don't you? 
A.	I know that person very well, but I'm not aware whether the person is a witness in this case. 
Q.	And you work at the same place, don't you? 
A.	No, she does not work with me. 
Q.	Well, do you work in the same institution? 
A.	*******************************************************************************, but this is a very big institution, and each person minds his or her own business or takes care of what concerns him or her. 
Q.	How many employees are there at the institution; do you know? 
A.	Listen, we cannot start counting the number of people working in an institution.  No, I haven't counted them. 
Q.	***********************? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  I go to my office to work and I don't ***********************************************************. 
Q.	All right.  Well, perhaps we can go into a bit more detail in closed session.  Let me just go on with the process that we had entered into which is a review of your statement.  So, we have the first statement 19 -- September 1997.  Now, that was only, what, four years -- not even four years, three and a half years from the terrible events that you have related in the statement; that is correct, isn't it?

I'm sorry, was there an answer to that, please?  
A.	You say three years from what date?  I didn't quite understand you. 
Q.	It was just under four years from the date of the genocide, wasn't it?  So it was very close to those events when events would have been fresher in your memory; would you agree? 
A.	Can you ask your question again, I will be ready to answer it. 
Q.	Are you trying to answer my questions or not? 
A.	I will answer your questions, sir that is why I am here. 
Q.	In this statement you say, "I saw André Rwamakuba in Butare university hospital for the first time on the 20th of April 1994."  From what you have said today, that is correct, is it? 
A.	No, what you are saying is not correct. 
Q.	In which way is it not correct? 
A.	I really don't understand your question. 
Q.	I'm reading part of your statement, Madam, one line, "I saw André Rwamakuba in Butare university hospital for the first time on the 20th of April 1994." Is that correct or incorrect? 
A.	Before you mentioned the 28th. 
Q.	Let me read your statement or this part of it to you again, please listen to it carefully.  "I saw           André Rwamakuba in Butare university hospital for the first time on the 20th of April 1994." Is that correct or incorrect? 
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	And in what aspect is it not correct? 
A.	I have something to say in respect to that statement.  I don't have much to say on the statement.  I'm here to talk to you about my statement of 2001. 
Q.	Can you answer the question, please?  In what way is your statement stating that you saw             André Rwamakuba for the first time on the 20th of April at the hospital, incorrect? 
A.	As concerns the statement that you are using to put questions to me, it is obvious that I did not give enough explanations in that statement.  And I am here to talk about my statement of 2001.  And I'm ready to answer your questions in respect of that statement of 2001. 
Q.	Can you please tell us in what way is the bit of your statement that I have just read out incorrect.  Is there an answer please, it is a pretty simple question? 
A.	If this has to do with a question concerning the statement of 1997, I will not give an answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Microphone is not on, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Although questions are being put to you by the lawyers, first by the prosecuting lawyer and now by the lawyer for the Accused person, you are actually giving your evidence to the Court.  As the judges, we have to decide what are the true facts in this case.  And some of these questions are aimed at helping us to decide how reliable your evidence is.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you have to answer the question, we will decide whether the questions are lawful or not.  This is a perfectly legitimate question to ask, and you must answer it? 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I would like in respect of the questions that are being asked to invite the Chamber to look at the manner of questioning of Counsel Hooper, because by creating some confusion in the mind of the witness, this may make it difficult for her to answer.  I stood up to make the objection, because when referring to the statement of 1997, Counsel Hooper could -- I would (unintelligible) this in the transcript because Counsel Hooper said we can talk about the first meeting with André Rwamakuba.  I don't know if the translation or the interpretation was unfaithful.  So I stood to raise this objection because he referred later to the statement of 24th September.  And the witness said this was not correct.  I think that when you are referring to a statement by the witness, you should give the exact date; otherwise, this will create confusion in the mind of the witness.  So, I would like to invite counsel for the Defence to refer exactly to what the witness said in her statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You want to say something?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I notice your microphone is on, that is why I defer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you wish, you can proceed.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, after all of these years, and given your circumstances, no one is going to hold you necessarily to a particular date, all right.  Let me put it like this, in this, the first statement, you describe going to the hospital to take refuge.  And there is no mention at all of your sister, who was about to have a baby.  And the only reference to your reasons for going is that you seek refuge at the hospital.  Why didn't you mention your sister, who was killed in the hospital, you tell us?  Why don't you mention her in this, the first statement?  
A.	You started by saying something that was not correct by saying that I went to seek refuge at the hospital.  I did not go to the hospital to seek refuge.  I went there to assist my elder sister who was not well.  And I have also talked about my elder sister by saying that she had died, and that she was killed at the maternity of the hospital. 
Q.	But you see, there is no mention of your sister in this first statement, why is that? 
A.	I have always talked about her. 
Q.	And this statement, you told us earlier today, it was read over to you and you were given the opportunity to correct it, and you signed its contents as being correct; are you saying that you did mention your sister but for some reason it has been left out of the statement; is that what you are saying? 
A.	Mr. President, I would like to request that the Defence counsel should not insist on my statement of 1997.  It is written in my statement that I didn't give enough explanations in my statement.  And at the end of the war it was difficult for us to express ourselves because of the genocide.  I am here to talk about my statement of 2001 which contains more explanations.  In my first statement, I did not give many details because I was still suffering on account of the members of my family that had been killed during the genocide. 
Q	Well, let me move to another point.  Obviously, just over three years after the genocide any investigator would be interested to know from you a description of the man that you are talking about.  And I suggest you were asked to provide a description here because in your statement there appears these lines.  Now, listen carefully, please, this is your statement, your words, "It is most likely that I may no longer recognise André Rwamakuba because he often tried to camouflage, and because our situation at that time was not normal." Am I correct in saying that you couldn't give a description?  And, secondly, that that was your reason, or reasons for not giving a description? 
A.	I don't understand your question. 
Q.	Were you asked to provide a description of André Rwamakuba, yes or no? 
A.	I don't quite recall whether such a question was put to me. 
Q.	Do you remember stating these words, "It is most likely that I may no longer recognize 
	André Rwamakuba because he often tried to camouflage, and because our situation at the time was not normal."  Is that correct?  A, did you say it; B, is it correct? 
A.	He never hid himself.  And by saying that I could not identify him is because I did not know him before.  It was during the genocide that I saw him, and that is why I said that could I not easily identify him.  But given that as time went by -- as time goes by, you remember certain details.  Even if you invited him into this courtroom, I would be able to point him out to you. 
Q.	You never, ever seen him, have you? 
A.	Are you talking about the period of the genocide?  I saw him during the genocide. 
Q.	Can you describe him to us, please, as you saw him then? 
A.	André Rwamakuba, I saw him.  This is a man of average height, who has a nose like the nose of the Hutus.  He has broad lips, with big cheeks.  That is what I saw, If I had to describe Rwamakuba.  Are you saying that I did not know that person, but when you see a person once, twice or thrice, you can identify him?  But it is normal that as time goes by, the face of people -- the faces of people change.  Even I myself I don't have the physical features that I had two or three years ago. 
Q.	Well, we all know that.  Have you been just talking about this description with somebody else?  This man with the Hutu nose and medium height, with big chicks -- big cheeks and thick lips; have you been talking about that with somebody else? 
A.	Well, I saw him personally.  I did not discuss it with anybody whatsoever.  I gave you his description.  I have described his portrait to you as far as what I knew and what is concerned. 
Q.	Nowhere in this first statement -- or any statement, do you mention that he was a minister in the government; is that because you didn't know that? 
A.	I did not know. 
Q.	And what do you mean when you say in this statement, "He used to camouflage."  What do you mean by that? 
A.	You can camouflage yourself in different ways.  What kind of camouflage are you talking about?  
Q.	The question is for you to answer, Madam.  What kind of camouflage were you talking about in this statement? 
A.	The camouflage you are talking about, I don't quite understand you.  You are saying that he tried to conceal himself.  I really am not understanding you. 
Q.	Let me make it as plain as I can.  In your statement, you say, "I may no longer recognise him because he often tried to camouflage." Question, what do you mean? 
A.	Are you talking about the statement of 1997?  
Q.	What did you mean? 
A.	One can camouflage himself in different ways.  You can conceal your face, you can hide yourself physically, but as concerns André Rwamakuba, he never hid himself.  He did everything in public. 
Q.	Then why do you say it about him in your statement? 
A.	I will come back to that statement to say that it is written in that statement that I did not provide enough explanation. 
Q.	Well, this aspect is written very clearly.  Let me just go a few lines earlier.  In the same statement, talking of André Rwamakuba you say this, please listen carefully, I'm going to ask you what you mean by it.  "He often disguised by wearing banana leaves on his regular clothes." What does -- we know what it means.  Is that true? 
A.	I told you that I have come here to this courtroom to tell the truth.  I cannot say -- talk about things that did not happen.  And I do not agree with you when you read the statement of 1997. 
Q.	That is not an answer to the question.  Did you say to the investigators that André Rwamakuba disguised himself by wearing banana leaves; yes or no? 
A.	When I left Arusha in 2003, I did not talk about that problem of banana leaves.  He never wore those banana leaves, and I didn't talk about that. 
Q.	Then why is it in your statement, signed by you? 
A.	Can you please repeat that question, Counsel?  
Q.	Then why is it in the statement signed by you, if it never happened? 
A.	Talking about that statement, I told you that I am not going to give you many explanations, because at the end of that statement it was written that I had not given enough explanations.  And it's in the statement of 2001 that I gave enough explanations that can assist this Trial Chamber.  I will, therefore, like to invite you Counsel to put this statement aside and talk about the statement of 2001. 
Q.	No, Madam Witness, it goes like this:  I ask questions and you do your level best to help me and the Chamber by answering them as best you can.  Now, I'm going to ask this question again:  In your statement you say, "André Rwamakuba often disguised by wearing banana leaves on his regular clothes." Did you say that or not? 
A.	He never used to wear banana leaves.  I explained during an interview -- I explained this during the interview in 2003. 
Q.	No, you never explained that at all.  You may have explained -- you may have changed your story.  I'm asking you why this was in your first statement.  And I take it that you are not going to give me an answer; is that right? 
A.	I will not answer that question, because we are not talking here about that statement of 1997. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I see the time, I can go on, I have other questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is the duty of the judges here to control the questions that can be asked in proceedings of this nature.  So, we have to decide whether the questions are proper or improper.  If we decide a question is improper, we will stop the lawyer from asking it.  If we decide the question is proper, you are obliged to answer it.  You can not decide what questions to answer and what questions not to answer.  That is the role of the Judges to decide whether the questions are lawful or unlawful.  Do you understand me? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Well, having heard his honour, the Judge, are you now going to answer the question about why it was in your first statement you dressed André Rwamakuba up in banana leaves.  Why was that?  
A.	I will give the same explanation that I gave during -- in my statement in 2003, that same question was put to me, and then I gave explanations.  I said there must have been some misunderstanding of my words.  I never said that he was wearing banana leaves.  That is what I explained at the time. 
Q.	You see, it appears twice in that first statement, that "He often disguised by wearing banana leaves." And then as we have already seen, you say, "You may no longer recognise because he often tried to camouflage."  And I understand from what you say, that you didn't say either of those things, that they are both untrue and you have no explanation why they are in that statement; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  That information is rather correct. 
Q.	Now, in terms of dates, if I can just come back to that.  You told us this morning, if my note is correct, that you went to the teaching hospital to look after your eldest sister, who was sick, having given birth, and that was on the 18th of April; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You then said, "I stayed at the hospital from the 19th to the 29th."  But I take it that you mean you stayed at the hospital from the 18th to the 29th; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when you gave those dates, you were asked, "Are you sure?"  You said, "Yes, I am sure of those dates."  Now, in your first statement you said that you stayed there from the 17th or 18th of April, which fits in with what you are saying today, to the 25th of April.  Was it -- is the 25th rather than four days later, the 29th?  Which one do you think it was, bearing in mind that you made this statement only three years afterwards when dates were probably a lot clearer in your mind? 
A.	As regards the 25th, that is a mistake I made.  After some time, I touted up the number of days I had spent there which is when I realised that it was the 29th.  So, the mention that I made of the date of the 25th was a mistake on my part? 
Q.	Now, five years later you make a second statement.  This is the statement you prefer, you like.  And it starts in this way:  "In 1994, from about the 18th of April to about the 25th of April, I was at the university hospital."  Are you sure it wasn't between those dates that you stayed there? 
A.	I stayed there from the 18th, 19th, and I repeat that the 25th was a mistake because we did not have the heart to remember dates.  It is only afterwards that one can make an estimate of the dates. 
Q.	Well, when was it that you first realised that it wasn't the 25th that you remained at the hospital until, but the 29th? 
A.	It was a long time afterwards, a long time after I had given my statement. 
Q.	Now, we step over the statement you made on the 27th of June `01, which concerns -- and we will read it, concerns an investigator, or someone called Boo-Boo, nothing to do with this case, it has to do with the Kanyabashi case, one page.  And you say nothing about events concerning us.  

And we move then to your statement of the 12th of March 2003, which you haven't told us about yet.  Let me just read you the opening part of that statement -- well, let me go to our page HF32 at the top in the English.  And it reads in this way:  "I cannot tell you the exact date that I arrived at the hospital, but I left there on the 25th of April." So all of these years you have been very consistent with it being the 17th or 18th that you arrived and the 25th, always, that you leave.  So why have you recently changed those dates?  
A.	The investigators who came to see us questioned us, and asked us to give approximate dates, and leaving us the lee way to remember exact dates later.  So we were asked to give an indication of approximate dates and that is why we gave approximate dates.  The investigators told us to try and determine the period of time when the events took place. 
Q.	Well, you have given pretty precise dates, previously.  Now, this statement of 2003 starts in this way:  I have already met with investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on three occasions, and have given statement on the 1994 events as I witnessed them in Butare and Kabakobwa."  Now, which previous statement did you mention Kabakobwa? 
A.	You have mentioned the Kanyabashi trial.  Kanyabashi was accused, but I never came to testify against him.  I was questioned about that but was never called to testify in that trial.  
Q.	Yes, I appreciate Kanyabashi is central to Kabakobwa.  But you state in your statement, you see, that you have provided a statement about Kabakobwa,  a previous statement.  I don't have any such statement.  So, when did you provide this previous statement about Kabakobwa? 
A.	I met several investigators on several occasions.  And I cannot specify as regards that particular testimony you are referring to. 
Q.	But you do remember making such a statement before March of 2003; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I think I did give a statement on the events at Kabakobwa, but please don't ask for the specific date on which I made that statement. 
Q.	No, I won't ask you, but I will ask the Prosecution to produce it, if it exists.  Let me come back to this statement then, and I'm interested here in Kabakobwa and what happened there.  Now, we can see, and I don't need to read it all, what you say in your statement of 12th of March 2003.  And I'm going to summarise it in this way:  You talk briefly of events is at the hospital.  And then you say that you left the hospital on the 25th of April, and this is at the top of our page HF32, in the English, just over a page in the French.  You say how you took refuge at the prefecture office, and that you stayed there for three days.  

Just pausing there, did you stay at the préfecture office for three days; is that correct?  I see you raising your finger, can you answer the question?  It merits just a yes or no.  Did you stay at the préfecture office for three days after leaving the hospital. 
A.	Yes, I stayed there -- I stayed three days at the préfectural offices. 
Q.	Which would take us either to the 28th, if you left the hospital on the 25th, or to the 1st of May if you left the hospital on the 28th of April.  So, those are the two possible dates.  

Now, you then go on and you describe how the bourgmestre of Ngoma Kanyabashi, 
Minister Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, N-Y-I-R-A-M-A-S-U-H-U-K-O, and Shalom, her son, S-H-A-L-O-M, took you -- or ordered you, or were part of your being taken to Kabakobwa, K-A-B-A-K-O-B-W-A, in Ngoma commune by buses.  "There were several thousands of us refugees."  That is correct so far, isn't it?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I have a problem, Mr. President.  I note that we are in the Kanyabashi case.  I should be put questions for the hospital.  And if questions arise with respect to Kanyabashi, then I should be called again to testify on that topic. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, I tried to explain to you earlier that it is a legal question as to whether a question is proper or not proper.  There are certain rules which govern the way these proceedings are conducted.  And it is the job of the Judges to make certain that the rules are followed properly.  So, we will decide whether a question is correct or not.  

The lawyers are entitled to ask you questions concerning previous statements that you have made.  That is normal in proceedings of this nature.  And the answers that you give to these questions will help the Judges to decide whether we can believe your evidence or not.  

So the questions are important, and your answers are important.  So you have to answer. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And so, if can you remember what I referred to, how you travelled from the hospital to the préfecture office; how you had been taken by bus to Kabakobwa, where there were several thousands of refugees there with you; and that Nyiramasuhuko, Kanyabashi, Shalom, her son, had all participated in this so far.  Is this true?
A.	I did not quite understand when you speak of the transport of refugees. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, I notice the time.  I'm having -- and I'm probably not the only one, a deepening anxiety about my committee.  I'm wondering in the circumstances whether having made up generously by way of the lunch break, that everyone has lost the last half hour of, but if we were to reconvene this afternoon, whether; A, that would it be an inconvenience; and B, if we were to reconvene to, say, an hour, I would go a little bit further, perhaps, even longer with these witnesses answers, it may take me longer than I thought.  And I can cover more ground, perhaps, this afternoon, if we were to sit for part of the afternoon.  That is a suggestion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Hooper, we have went beyond our scheduled stopping time with the expectation of not sitting this afternoon. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, so our preference would be to start tomorrow morning, unless you now have fear that you can not complete.  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, I think I can complete.  Perhaps, I could just conclude with just this one point and, hopefully, that will be done and dusted.  And that will be of assistance, I will not have to pick this up again tomorrow.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, you recall what his Honour, the Judge, said some moments ago about your assisting this Chamber in your answers, not me, you are helping the Judges by your answers, right?  Now, did you go to Kabakobwa; yes or no? 
A.	I did go there. 
Q.	I'm going to read parts of your statement, and I'm going to ask if you agree with them, yes or no?  "We were escorted by Kanyabashi and other officials up to Kabakobwa valley.  We arrived there between 10 and 11 a.m.; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, that information is correct. 
Q.	All right.  The following -- "There were no facilities to take care of the refugees, but the valley was surrounded by soldiers."  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, there were soldiers who had come to kill the refugees.  And it was Kanyabashi who had called them, assisted by the other people you mentioned, including the Nyiramasuhuko. 
Q.	Yeah, if you would just answer the questions yes or no at the present, we can get through this more quickly, please.  "The following morning, the officials returned to find out what was happening.  I recognised Kanyabashi, Nyiramasuhuko and her son, Shalom.  They only discussed with the soldiers and they left about 30 minutes later."  Is that correct, yes or no?  
A.	I did not quite understand your question on this specific point. 
Q.	You are saying that having got to Kabakobwa, the next day those three people came, spoke to the soldiers and then left again; is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not correct. 
Q.	In what particular is it incorrect? 
A.	What I know is that Kanyabashi brought people to shoot at the refugees in Kabakobwa. 
Q.	All right.  Let me carry on with your statement:  "Between 1 and 2 p.m., the same people, officials, returned with soldiers, civilians and Interahamwe who surrounded us."  And then it carries on:  "At one point, I saw Kanyabashi make some sign with his hands, and that was when the attack started." Is that correct.  And is that something that you witnessed? 
A.	Yes, yes, that is correct.  I witnessed it. 
Q.	"The soldiers started to shoot us and threw a grenade at us, others used traditional weapons.  I was hit by grenade shrapnel in the head, not by a bullet fired by Kanyabashi, as stated by (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  I still have scars of the head injury."  Forgetting your injuries for a moment, is it right that the soldiers started to shoot at you and throw grenades, and others with traditional weapons finished off wounded refugees and those trying to flee; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that took place.  That did take place. 
Q.	"I managed to flee to Kibaye," K-I-B-A-Y-E, Kibaye.  And you eventually sought refuge in the house of an old woman.  And you, subsequently, fled to Burundi.  Is all of that correct? 
A.	That is how the events unfolded. 
Q.	And so you were together with several thousand refugees at the killing site of Kabakobwa when Kanyabashi, with a movement of his hand, started the attack on all of those people; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  It is he who gave the orders to the attackers. 
Q.	And, indeed, the massacre at Kabakobwa is a well-known massacres and features in two cases here, in particular, in the case known as the Butare case, where Pauline Niramasuhuko, Kanyabashi and Shalom are on trial.  Would it surprise you, Madam, to learn that the agreed date of that massacre is the 22nd of April?  Would that surprise you? 
A.	I don't know anything about it.  When the refugees left, others came to that place.  I am speaking of the events I witnessed.  There were always refugees there.  The first wave of refugees, they were killed.  Then more refugees arrived, et cetera, et cetera.  
Q.	Was that why you didn't want to talk about Kanyabashi and the evidence you provided in that case, because you couldn't be at Kabakobwa, I suggest, and at Butare hospital.  You are lying about one or both of them; isn't that right? 
A.	All of those events took place. 
Q.	And that is on your oath, is it? 
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	Well, thank you, Madam Witness.  We can return to the hospital again tomorrow.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we close, there was the mention of a name. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who had given -- was mentioned in the statement, who had given information about a bullet wound. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Oh, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think probably in view of what transpired earlier, that name should be put under seal. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, indeed, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar. 
MR. FRY:
So noted, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are going to take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning at 8:45.  During this, or any other adjournment, while you are giving evidence, you remain a witness in the trial and you are not to discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Your Honour, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now do you wish to say something?  
THE WITNESS:
What I wanted to say is regarding the lady whose name is to remain confidential, in fact, what is not -- what is true is that I was hit by a bullet.  Here, it is written that what she said was wrong; but, in fact, I was hit by a bullet.  And I still have a scar on my head. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Thank you, very much.

We will take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning at quarter to 9:00.
(Court adjourned at 1312H)
