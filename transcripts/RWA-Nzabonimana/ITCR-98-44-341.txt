P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 16th of July 2008, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al., case number ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registry.  

The appearances are the same.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Your testimony will continue.  The Prosecutor will continue his cross-examination.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Yesterday, you were looking at a document, and the document had an author.  Can the document be put back in front of you, please.

The name of the author is Nkurunziza, N-K-U-R-U-N-Z-I-Z-A, and the document appears to be dated, in handwriting, the 25th of May 1994.

This individual, does he know who you are?
A.	Yes.  This person knows me.  However, his description of me in his document is not correct.  He states that I was permanent secretary of the MRND in Kibuye until the date he states.  That is to say that he didn't know me well because he describes my duties at that time, but at the time of writing the report, I had different duties as I stated to you when I began my testimony. 
Q.	Well, that's neither here nor there really.  This individual knows you, and on the 25th of May 1994, he is describing you as a person principally involved in the massacres in Kibuye.  He wields no authority.  He's not the bourgmestre yet under an RPF government.  He's simply a Tutsi survivor.

Now, you suggest, do you, that there is no truth in this document whatsoever.  Would that be right?
A.	I haven't had the time to read the content of this report in order to comment about its veracity, but I would like to state that on the date of which this report is dated, nobody could have said that they had survived a massacre.  As a matter of fact, he used sophisticated machines to type the report, but in Kibuye only préfecture authorities had such machines.  So did he come to have this written in the préfecture, or since he is Tutsi and since the Tutsis were on the run and he was hidden, was he in hiding when he wrote this report, or was he in hiding when he wrote that report -- this report?  
Q.	Is that the best you can do, to suggest that because it's a typewritten report it can't be true?  It's dated the 25th of May 1994.  It seems to have been faxed from Belgium on the 17th of June 1994.  It's a document contemporaneous to the events.  The best you can say about your own involvement on the document is that he's got the year wrong of your being the permanent secretary to the MRND in Kibuye.

Now, if you look at the document, it refers to, for example, the massacres at Gatwaro stadium in 
Home Saint-Jean.

Do you agree there were massacres in both those locations?
A.	It is true I was no longer MRND permanent secretary, and there were massacres at the 
	Gatwaro stadium and elsewhere, but if these massacres are mentioned in this report, it is also true that at that time I was no longer in Kibuye town. 
Q. 	Well, that's what you say, and it seems quite convenient that your evidence is you left Kibuye on 
11th of April and that you only came back for the 3rd of May meeting, and if we look at the report which is filed and also evidence that we have and we've heard previously - 
MR. MORLEY:  
Your Honours are reminded of GK.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	-- the massacres start on the 12th of April, surprisingly, the day after you say you left.

Now, I suggest to you that on the face of this document your saying you were elsewhere is not true and that it's just too convenient that you walk out of Kibuye on the 11th of April when the history records the massacres starting on the 12th.

You disagree with me, do you?
A. My testimony is true, and that's why I decided to testify in open court.  I left the town of Kibuye on the 
	12th of April, and I returned to Kibuye on 3rd May.  I left on the 11th of April, and I returned on the
3rd of May.  I went to Karongi.  There were many people on the road, and there were Tutsis who were fleeing, and I was not in Kibuye when the massacres occurred.  I don't agree with this report which was written on the 25th of June in which the author of the report claims to be a survivor and to have counted survivors.

Where did he do such counting?  Where are the reports regarding survivors written in December 1994?  This document is fake and was written by somebody with a precise statement -- concern.  They claim that they counted the survivors, but where did they meet to write -- to have the content or to write the report? 
Q.	It seems to contain an accurate description of the massacres.  It refers the buildup to them, to the gathering of the refugees, to how the massacres at Gatwaro and Home Saint-Jean took place between the 18th and 20th of April.  It's written within five weeks of the events taking place, and it names you as one of the principal persons involved.  It also suggests that there was an Interahamwe in Kibuye - 
MR. MORLEY: 
If Your Honours look, please, at the fourth page -- that's the last page, which is item  number 3, list of Interahamwe - 
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q. 	-- that stood out during the massacres.

Do you still maintain there was no Interahamwe despite the fact that Karemera addressed the Interahamwe in Kibuye and it's recorded in the minutes on the 3rd of May? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Please, Your Honour, is there an error in translating, or is he stating that Mr. Karemera took the floor before the Interahamwe on 3rd May?  Can Prosecution confirm this, or is it a mistake?  And, 
Your Honour, I'd like to draw your attention as well on the time that Mr. Morley has been allowed for the cross-examination, and he has by far surpassed the time of the cross-examination, and I wonder why he has benefited from such an advantage.  
MR. MORLEY:
With regard to Karemera's address to the Interahamwe on the 3rd of May, it was referred to as part of.
Exhibit P. 82B yesterday if my learned friend might remember that.

With regard to the timing, I started at 4 o'clock yesterday.  We finished at quarter to 6.  That's an hour and 45 minutes.  There were a number of helpful interruptions from my learned friends, and I'm now about ten minutes into the morning session.  Technically I think I'm still within the two hours.  I am coming to an end.  I am conscious of certain information which I received, and also I said yesterday I wouldn't be much more than about 15 or 20 minutes with this witness.  If I may proceed, please.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	You've probably forgotten the question.  Mr. Witness, we have a document dated the 25th of May 1994 referring to the Interahamwe, and you've been at pains throughout your testimony to suggest -- and I suggest fantastically -- that there was no Interahamwe in Kibuye.
This document flatly contradicts you, doesn't it?
A.	This document does not contradict me because I don't recognise this document, acknowledge this document which, in my view, is a fake.  This document was written recently as far as I'm concerned.  With regard to the Interahamwe, I'd like to repeat that there was never any Interahamwe in Kibuye apart from the fact that later on all the killers were qualified as being Interahamwe, but there were never Interahamwe in Kibuye.

Furthermore, Clément Kayishema was not a member of the MRND to be an Interahamwe.  
Number two, Ngesangaima (phonetic) was not a member of the MRND to be an Interahamwe, and 
Anastase Bayarita (phonetic) is somebody that I know who worked in the OTP, and he had no right to belong to a political party and so could not be an Interahamwe, and I will leave it at that.  It is clear that the author of this report fabricated names or put names on the list of Interahamwes while there was no Interahamwe in Kibuye.  However, he mentioned people that he knew and whom he knew not to be Interahamwe but who were members of Kibuye whom the author of the report knew well because he had a precise goal regarding these people. 
Q.	So do you agree that the author knows the individuals he's written about personally?  Is that your understanding of the document?  He's identifying people that he knows.  You know him.  He knows you, and you know that he knows the people he's identifying.
A.	For the record, these people were his neighbours, and I know them because they were his neighbours, but they were not members of the MRND and could not be members of Interahamwe because there were no Interahamwe in Kibuye.  
Q.	Do you think that Kayishema bore responsibility, any culpability, for the massacres that took place in Kibuye and Gatwaro and Home Saint-Jean?  Do you think he bears any responsibility?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could you instruct the witness to speak more slowly for the Kinyarwanda interpreters?

Can you repeat your question, Counsel, for the Prosecution? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the interpreters have also requested that you speak a bit more slowly. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, I suggest to you that you ask me to repeat questions when the questions I've asked of you are slightly tricky.  You did it four times yesterday on issues concerning whether other people were culpable.  Now, I have asked you a question about Kayishema.  This is the fifth time you've asked me to repeat the question.  In this case the question you're asking repeated is, do you think Kayishema bears any responsibility for the massacres which took place in Kibuye?
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  The reason I asked the Prosecution to repeat your question is for me to be in a position to understand them, and I believe it's my right, wholly my right.  As a matter of fact, I have difficulty hearing as a result of the trauma I went through because of problems I've had.  So the Prosecutor should not get unduly angry.  As a matter of fact, I am not an accused here, and I am not trying to justify myself or to show that I am not guilty.  

Here I am.  I'm here to testify on the truth so that light should be shone on what happened, and you should be in a position to reach a balanced judgement of the facts regarding the role of Mr. Kayishema in the Kibuye massacres.  Kayishema was tried here in this Chamber, and if indeed this Prosecutor was not here present during Kayishema's trial, I believe he should be in a position to obtain Mr. Kayishema's judgement and read it to have an answer.  That is my answer, Your Honour.  
Q.	Well, that's not an answer at all again.  I'm asking you, from your experience of what took place in Kibuye, do you agree -- do you think that Kayishema is responsible for, is culpable for, what took place?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Your Honour, objection.  Mr. Morley should stop harassing the witness.  The witness has answered.  Mr. Kayishema was tried.  If he's guilty or innocent, that is found in the judgement, and the witness is asking -- referring him to this judgement.  Mr. Morley ought to have understood that's what he had to have done.  Now the witness has answered, and Morley says it is not an answer stating that he has to answer by force.  The witness has already answered, and he has no further answers to give.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I respectfully submit it's a perfectly proper question.  Either this witness is going to say he agrees that Kayishema is culpable or he's going to say he doesn't.

And certain consequences flow from either of those two answers.  Whatever the Tribunal has decided, I'm asking for this witness's personal view, and that's a proper question.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Objection.  Witness is not a judge.  He cannot judge about Kayishema's guilt or innocence.  That is not possible, and that is not his role.  Objection, Your Honour.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's a proper question, Your Honour.  I'm not asking the witness to try Kayishema.  I'm asking about his perception of his culpability.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We think it's a proper question.  The witness can answer it.  

We remind you of the time, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
I accept that.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So what is your answer?  Do you think before the world in open session, yes, Kayishema is responsible for -- one of the people responsible for the massacre of the Tutsis at Gatwaro stadium and  
	Home Saint-Jean?
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  I would like to state the answer that I made to the Prosecutor a while ago, at least part of it.  I know Kayishema was tried here in this Court, and the entire world knows about it.  Now, if you claim that I didn't know that, then you also claim that I was not alive, but I was alive, and I do know it.  Kayishema was tried here.  There is a judgement to that effect.  

Ask the Tribunal to provide you a copy of the judgement, and you'll know if he's culpable or not.  I cannot assert that Kayishema played a role in the massacres in the Gatwaro stadium and in the 
Home Saint-Jean because at the dates at which these massacres were committed I was not in the Kibuye city to know the perpetrators.  That is my final answer.  
Q.	What happened to the children in the hospital as discussed on the 3rd of May of 1994?
A.	Your Honour, I would like to ask the Prosecutor to be more precise because his question is not very clear.  He asked me what happened relating to the children in the hospital.  
I could say in French that it is a vague question.  
Q.	I suggest it's not vague at all.  On the 3rd of May 1994 at the meeting you say you attended, what happened to the children in the hospital about which there was discussion?
A.	Where would these children have been at that time?  Where were they actually at the time?  
Q.	Do you want to tell Their Honours about the conversation, the discussion which was raised before Édouard Karemera and the prime minister about children in the local hospital and what was to happen to them?  Because you were there.  I've told you already yesterday that we have the minutes, and we have all sorts of bits of information from radio transcripts.  So what do you think about the children in the local hospital as was discussed at the meeting in the presence of Karemera?
A.	Mr. President, I do recall that some questions were put to the prime minister and to the préfet of the préfecture who was a doctor.  In fact, it was a medical doctor who was in charge of that hospital and who put that question, and that person went by the name Léonard Hitimana.  Léonard Hitimana said there were some children who had sought refuge in the hospital, and among those children there were some who were wounded.  

He called on the authorities to help him in feeding those children and to protect them.  The 
prime minister responded by, first of all, calling on the préfet to address that matter, and he said, as far as the food supplies were concerned, he was going to contact the social welfare authorities to take care of those children, and as far as the safety of those children was concerned, the gendarmerie was required to do its level best to find a solution to that problem.  Some questions were not put to Karemera who was not part of the administration.  He wasn't an administrative officer.  He was an official of a political party.  I do not know what transpired subsequently.  I was an ordinary citizen who had no responsibilities. 
Q.	An ordinary citizen with no responsibilities.  On that very day, the 3rd of May, those children were killed in the hospital.

Are you saying that you don't know that?
A.	I learnt that news while I was in prison.  I heard people who made their confessions say that when Hitimana left the hospital to attend the meeting those children were immediately murdered.  That is a piece of information I received while I was in prison, and I believe that at the time the question was put those children had already been killed.  
Q.	That seems to be an appropriate note on which to end.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.

Any redirect?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness Mathias, I will start off immediately with the documents that were handed to you yesterday by counsel for the Prosecution.  So with regard to the first document, because we will need to revisit that document; otherwise, it will be levity, it is established before this Court that errors, mistakes, or any attempts at manipulation must be reported because when it was known that you didn't have your glasses, a document was given to you which did not appeal to you.  For the purpose of the record, I am going to put you the following question:  Was it you, Mr. Mathias Habiyaremye, which is spelt, H-A-B-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E?  Was it you?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That does not refer to me.  I tried to look at that document as the document is quite legitimate, and the person who goes by the name Mathias Habiyaremye is not me. 
Q.	Witness, please, respond to my question one after the other.

Is Mr. Mathias -- or are you Mr. Mathias Habiyaremye?  If it's not you, kindly spell your name for the record.
A.	The person mentioned in that document is not me.  My name is Mathias Hitiyaremye which is spelt H-I-T-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  It is true that both names seem to be similar, but if not for vigilance, that attempt would have been successful.  It is further purported that the said Mr. Mathias Habiyaremye lives in the Kabuguru cellule, spelt K-A-B-U-G-U-R-U, at the Nyakibanda secteur.  Is that you? 
A.	No.  I never lived in those two locations. 
Q.	Where are those two places located?
A.	I do not know that cellule.  However, let me state that there were two Nyakibandas, and I do not know which of the two is referred to in that document.  There is a place called Nyakibanda in Kigali, and there is yet another location known as Nyakibanda in the Gitarama préfecture.  There is a Nyakibanda of Kigali or a Nyakibanda in Gitarama.  I never took up residence in those two locations.  
Q.	Thank you.  May I recall as a reminder what the Prosecutor said yesterday about that document.  He said on page 78, line 20, "Witness, we have a transcript about you on radio on the 25th of May 1994 referring to civilian defence as to the excellent idea that was, according to you and your pride in the government."  

I am trying to use his discourteous tone, but I know it is going to be an unsuccessful attempt.  However, let me further recall what he said.  "I am asking you if you recall having spoken over the radio in favour of civilian defence.  That was on the 25th of May 1994, and it was on that date that Karemera, in his capacity as minister of the interior, submitted a document according to which civilian defence had to be set up."

That is how charges are made before this Court.  So I'd like to know from you if it is you, Mathias, if you are Mathias Habiyaremye.
A.	No.  That is certainly not me.  I am not Mathias Habiyaremye.  I am Mathias Hitiyaremye.  Furthermore, I have never granted any interview to any radio station or any journalist on that said date.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
	My apologies, interpreters.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, as far as you are concerned, what do we do with such a charge?  Do you believe that the entire indictment has been based on this approach?  And today you have seen the Prosecutor build his case on the basis of forged documents.

Are you surprised by the way charges are levelled before this Court?  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend has milked a mistake which took place yesterday in respect of the identification of this witness's name and is now trying to extrapolate that into inviting the witness to make comment on the entire proceedings in relation to the entire indictment.  I respectfully submit it is obvious that this line of questioning is, firstly, redundant, and secondly, utterly inappropriate.  

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, by way of a response that if the Prosecutor had admitted yesterday that he was misled, I would have stopped there because to err, Mr. President, is human.  However, let me say what the Prosecutor did after that mistake, which he only admits today within the purview of my redirect, Mr. President, because, Mr. President, Your Honours -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have the point.  Let's proceed.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I'm obliged.  I'll proceed.  
 
In the lines of the questions put by the Prosecution in regard to that document, because, Mr. President, I had objected yesterday by seeking that the document be set aside and which was not heeded to.  And Mr. President, I understand that that kind of encouraged the Prosecution in its manipulative attempts, and that is sad.  On page 79, line 17, you said, "Counsel Diagne, we know what you're saying is not correct because we can see the witness's name," and that was the statement by the Bench itself, Mr. President.  That also I thought to raise and state that it was a mistake, and I thought I should take it over with the witness to show it was the witness and to show how much I was hurt.  

I'll proceed however.  I was saying that the Prosecutor did not admit his fault when the witness testified, and that is on page 80, line 14, "It seems to me that I am not the person referred here because in 1994 I did not at all grant any interviews," and he responds, "If you had responded in that manner, it would have made matters clear.  Now kindly put that document aside," and the document was set aside.  Was it an admission of a mistake, or was it because the document had to be used subsequently?  That is why, Mr. President, I have come back on this matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Miss Diagne, this is not the time to make that argument.  You may continue with your redirect examination.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Very well, Mr. President.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Let me address now the second document presented in fanfare yesterday as a document that originates from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees with a K number ending with figures 851, and on the next page K number ending with the figures 852, we have every reason to believe that the Prosecutor tendered a document which is uniform, as it were; and this morning we are told that the author of that document is a certain Mr. Nkurunziza.  
	
	Witness, you testified that you knew Mr. Nkurunziza,  isn't it?
A.	I know him. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court by way of confirmation that as soon as the RPF took power he was the first bourgmestre to be appointed at Bugeze?
A.	No.  That is not correct.  In fact, he was the first bourgmestre of the Gisovu commune.  
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Witness.  What was of import to me wasn't the commune.  It was the payment for services rendered, and you confirmed that he was appointed bourgmestre as soon as the RPF took power, and he was the first bourgmestre for Gisovu commune.
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	So let's proceed in the manner of the Prosecutor and go to the end of the report because, as he often does, he cuts and pastes documents -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, this is not an appropriate time to make those types of comments.  Please continue with your redirect examination now.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  However, I am stating before the Court that the counsel for the Prosecution has copied and pasted documents so as to extract some pages and to extend those pages to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Miss Diagne, if you have no further questions, terminate your examination now.  If you have questions, put them to the witness.  We're interested in the witness's testimony, not your comments.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I have a great deal of questions, Mr. President, to put to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then please do that.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I do not understand, but that is precisely what I'm doing.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, the counsel for the Prosecution told you that Mr. Kayishema, Clément, was an Interahamwe as established in the report put to you.  

Was Mr. Kayishema a member of the MRND?
A.	Kayishema wasn't a member of the MRND party.  In fact, he was a member of the PSD party. 
Q.	Witness, in the report there was yet another person, point 16 - or, paragraph 16, called 
	Simon Ntamahungiro.  I'm going to spell that name, N-T-A-M-A-H-U-N-G-I-R-O.

First question, do you know this person?
A.	I do not know Simon Ntamahungiro.  Furthermore, I know that no bourgmestre of that commune bore that name, and there was no staff of the préfecture who worked with me and who went by the name Ntamahungiro. 
Q.	If he had been a member of the MRND, if he were in the same party and in the same area, would you have known him?
A.	I would have known him. 
Q.	What about Kayihura, which I'm going to spell, K-A-Y-I-H-U-R-A, Bernard?  Do you know 
	Bernard Kayihura?
A.	I know Bernard Kayihura who was a trader at Kibuye. 
Q.	Was he a member of the MRND? 
A.	No.  He belonged to the MDR party. 
Q.	How, according to you, would a serious report consider members of a political party as Interahamwe and publish this worldwide?  Is it possible?  
A.	This is a forgery.  It's a forged document that was fabricated completely. 
Q.	Thank you, and I am going to conclude with those two documents handed to you yesterday by the Prosecution and to revisit the questions he put to you in regard to your detention.

And Witness, that will be my last question.  And as you have done ever since the beginning of your testimony, that you respond if it is to your knowledge.  If it is not to your knowledge, kindly answer clearly.

So, Witness, in the prisons where you were detained, did you witness any manipulation of witnesses for the purpose of coming to testify before the Tribunal here in Arusha?  
MR. MORLEY:
Right, out of cross-examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We do not allow the question for that reason.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.      Thank you, Witness, and this marks the end of my redirect, and I would like to commend you for the quality of your testimony, Witness.  Thank you.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  You see me on my feet, sir, and it is obviously not to notify you that I am going to redirect.  That is not the reason why I'm standing.

Since I didn't examine the witness, I do not need to re-examine a witness whom I did not examine in-chief.  Now, the reason why I'm on my feet is to pray that you reconsider the order or the decision you ruled on yesterday in respect of the objection I raised when counsel for the Prosecution made an attempt to extract some information about Mr. Ngirumpatse to further his case by way of cross-examination.  

I had made that observation and that objection because nothing in the examination-in-chief justified that line of questioning and, further, because I had not examined the witness.  And accordingly, nothing would have justified the Prosecutor's attempt to extract some information against Mr. Ngirumpatse.  The answers given by the witness were probably not satisfactory to the Prosecutor, but for reasons of principle, which are obvious for that matter -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, as we've been indicating since yesterday, we don't want to entertain legal argument at this time.  We will note your objection.  You will be given an opportunity to develop it in due course, but we want to conclude the testimony today as soon as we can.  So we'll note your objection and provide an opportunity for it to be developed.  
MR. WEYL:
Very well, Mr. President.  If you will allow me, sir, I would like to exert my observation since the witness is still in the box and is still available to the parties and to the Bench.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness is not adjudicator.  So we will determine your objection, and you'll have an opportunity to develop your legal summations in due course.  We just didn't want to take up the time this morning in hearing oral arguments on this matter.  We'd like to complete the testimony of the witnesses who are available.  

Yes, Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of your testimony, and we would thank you for assisting the Court in its work.  There is one comment I would like to make though, and it's in relation to the issue of the document which described the person who had had that radio interview.

When I looked at the document, the name looked like yours, and that was the basis of the remark I made.  Since then, we have noted the evidence you have given which has clarified the issue, and we will take due cognisance of it.  You are now excused, and you may leave.  
MR. MORLEY:
As the witness leaves, may I make the application to have exhibited under seal -- no, not under seal, to have exhibited the document dated the 25th of May of 1994 which has a fax marking at the top, the 17th of June 1994.  
MR. WEYL:
Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, the Bench has a difference in this matter.  We will reserve our decision and adjudicate in due course.  
MR. MORLEY:
Contemporaneous to the relevant time from a person known to this witness.  So on the face of it, it comes into a category of documentation different from, for example -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, if you wish to advance further arguments, we will give you leave to advance your arguments in writing if you wish.  We are managing a time issue as well this morning.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  Can I also mention that we still haven't dealt with the documentation by way of exhibits proposed for the Prosecution for TXL, KBL, and LSP. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I'm aware of that as well.

Mr. Witness, you are now excused. 
THE WITNESS:
Your Honour, thank you for the manner in which you welcomed me and the answers that you gave to the request I made at the beginning, but there is the same question -- request I did not have an answer to, that is to say, to greet the person on whose behalf I came to testify.

I would also like to tell you that Your Honour and your peers, as the Bench, Defence witness, and Prosecutor, I would like you to go down -- carry out a field visit to see what the truth is.  

As for Karemera, he should be released because the charges against him are baseless, unfounded; but if as the Defence, the Bench, and Prosecutor, if you went down to the field to see what is happening on the field, you would give a better image of yourself before the eyes of the international community.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Permission is granted for you to visit Mr. Karemera, and the registry will make the appropriate arrangements in due course. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Miss Diagne, which is your next witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Your Honour, UKL is the pseudonym of the next witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Bring him in, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just say on the information which has been disclosed to us in relation to this witness that on the face of it he's irrelevant to any issue on the indictment.  Now, I'm not promising I won't cross-examine him, but if the three sentences I have -- and that's all I have by way of disclosure as to what he's going to say -- is all that he does effectively say -- in short, he's going to talk a lot about the RPF -- then it may be that this is going to be a reasonably short witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Morley, we were wondering whether it might not be appropriate, in terms of the evidence issues, just to simply allow a few days for both sides just to simply submit their submissions in writing on the outstanding issues.  I think there are four issues left.
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  I understand that given the timing constraint.  However, may I just invite Your Honour for the next session to have in mind that it's probably best for the exhibits to be dealt with when we have the witness here or as he's finished because, otherwise, this sort of thing builds up and then becomes an extraneous exercise and builds into a bigger legal argument than it really needs to be.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I was just reminded too that there was one issue raised by Counsel Webster on which we have not yet adjudicated, and I don't know if it might be of interest to produce any additional arguments on that, but we will make an order in connection with that at the end and identify how much time is required for both sides to respond to our submissions. 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Can you hear me?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I can hear you now.  As a preliminary to giving your evidence, the registrar will administer an oath to you to tell the truth during your testimony.  
(Declaration made by Witness UKL in French)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Witness, you will give your evidence by responding to questions put to you by counsel designated for that purpose, and you'll respond, first of all, to counsel representing Édouard Karemera, Maître Diagne.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Your Honour, for giving me the floor.
WITNESS UKL,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Now, Mr. Issa, with your kind assistance, I would like to have submitted the identification sheet to witness for him to look at it, take a look at it, and to confirm the information in it, and if there are no changes to be made, that he signs and dates it.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, as I was saying earlier, kindly cross-check the particulars and confirm it by signing the identification sheet.
A.	There is, I notice, an error on the town of residence.  
Q.	Now, please merely correct it.  Don't say anything about it because if you do, it will reveal your identity, and we're trying to avoid that.  So just write the right -- the proper town or city of residence, sign beside it, and date it.
A.	I understand.  The microphone. 
Q.	Hang on.  Mr. Issa will assist you.
A.	I would like to state that the travel documents that I have were obtained in this city that is written here before I transferred.  
Q.	Put your current city of residence because the information needs to be correct.
A.	Okay.  What is the date of today?  
Q.	16th of July 2008.
A.	I am done. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  Mr. Issa will collect the sheet, and we are going to begin with your examination-in-chief.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. Issa.

Your Honour, I would like to pray the Chamber to have this document admitted as exhibit under seal, and I believe, Mr. Issa, D. K96.

MR. MJUI:  
	Yes, Your Honour.  It will be Exhibit D. K96.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. K96 admitted, under seal) 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, I would like you, in a very succinct manner, as we have time constraints, to describe to the Chamber the situation, the prevailing situation, that is, in the Kibuye préfecture after the RPF attack in October 1990.
A.	Difficult question to answer because I wasn't on the field, but as far as I can -- as far as I know, there was no reaction by the population, no unrest of any sort.  The administration had everything under control.

Did you say 1990?  
Q.	Yes.  I said 1990.
A.	There was no special reaction.  There was still public peace.  Things degenerated only subsequently. 
Q.	Did the RPF attack in 1990 hurt your préfecture?
A.	Our préfecture is far from the RPF attack area.  It is to the west of the country.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would like to put to you a question that relates to the advent of multiparty politics in 1991.

Could you describe to the Chamber the political situation in the Kibuye préfecture?
A.	After the promulgation of the 1990 constitution, parties were informed and registered, and with regard to our préfecture, of course there was the new MRND, the MDR, the PL, the PSD.  I recall that there was also the PDC party that was represented.  The others I can't recall precisely.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You need to pause a little to allow interpreters to work properly.

According to you, on the advent of multiparty politics, what was the strongest party in the 
Kibuye préfecture?
A.	Well, I believe I know it.  On the field there was a declared domination of the MRND which was an opposition party.  For the record, the MDR, which was an opposition party, although it wasn't clear from the onset, but on the field the MDR was very present and followed by the MRND and the PL.  I think those were the three main parties in our préfecture. 
Q.	Based on what you're saying and which have been confirmed by all preceding witnesses, the MDR was the most important party in the Kibuye préfecture, but did that lead to political rivalry on the field according to you?
A.	Political rivalry you say?  Rivalry?  Rivalries always exist, not conflicts.  But they didn't lead to any major confrontations as far as I recall. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Still with regard to the political situation which I would like you to describe as far as possible to the Chamber, were there Interahamwes in Kibuye?
A.	Of course.  The Interahamwe, who were the MRND youth, were found during celebrations as was the case in Kigali.  Let me say in Kigali it was better organised, but in our préfecture, those youth were visible during rallies, celebrations.  They, in short, guaranteed law and order.  Otherwise, it was not a properly organised structure so to speak.  They were youth who entertained people, but it was not structured. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness UKL, I would like you to provide the Chamber with a description of Rwanda.  Maybe that could be difficult.

I would like you to describe to the Chamber the Bisesero area physically, physical features, that is, if you could, please.
A.	Yes.  Bisesero is an area which -- I can't recall.  Administratively it was a secteur of the 
	Gishyita commune, G-I-S-H-Y-I-T-A.  It was in the former commune of Gishyita.  It was in the former commune of Gishyita.  I don't know if it was a secteur.

Nevertheless, that area is located on altitude on the western slope of the Congo Nile crater, on the equator which is the culminating point of the area, and it was neighbours with three secteurs the 
Gisovu secteur.  That is to say the Gikaranka secteur, Gitabura and Rakuga, and since it was on the high altitude, it was an area that was appropriate for stock rearing, and it's an economic activity that is strongly found in that area.  It is also a mining area.  You also have a shooting range, a military camp, and some isolated houses.  That's how I can describe it.  
Q.	And if you were asked who inhabited mainly that area, what would be your answer?
A.	What do you mean in majority?  
Q.	I mean the ethnic groups, the Tutsi or the Hutu?
A.	It is common knowledge that it was a Tutsi zone.  In fact, they were in the majority, overwhelming majority for that matter, as in the other parts of the Gishyita commune and Rwamatamu, those areas were predominantly populated by the Tutsi.

1030H
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Thank you Witness. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I wonder if it is not too auspicious to go in recess, if it pleases you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much time do you anticipate you will need to complete your examination?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
To meet the expectations of the Bench, I expect to be done within 45 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you.  

We'll take a mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1111H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is anybody missing?  

Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, your Honour, I have just a couple of things.  It's out of -- I wish to apologise for the lateness of our co-counsel, who is unavailable -- who will be available in the Chamber, and I hope that you would accept this apology out of principle and out of definition.  I am referring to Counsel Diagne.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I apologise to the Chamber.  I was just next door, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  Are you going to continue examining this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, if it pleases the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may proceed.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, when we adjourned a while ago, you were describing the Bisesero area to the Chamber.  And I would like to proceed, together with you, by asking you if you were aware of the existence of a radio that broad -- was broadcasting over the airwaves and was known as Radio Muhabura.
A.	Yes, I heard about it, and I listened to some programmes on it.  And all Rwandans -- and all Rwandans who owned a radio set tried to tune in.  And I think all Rwandans were aware of the existence of that radio.  
Q.	And if you were asked to tell the Chamber, on the whole, what was the nature of the type of messages that were broadcast by that radio, what would you say?  
A.	Well, I would say that, clearly, it was a propaganda radio and it broadcast RPF propaganda.  Oftentimes, it went even further than -- than intoxication, I would even say inciting people to hatred, and calling on youths, especially young Tutsis, to join fighters across in Rwanda.  And, at some point in time, in our préfecture, it quite simply calculated two communes, the Rwamatamu and Gishyita.  At that time, RPF had its headquarters in Murindi (phonetic) around Mwendo.  
Q.	Could you state to the Chamber what you know, if you are aware, whether or not many youths responded to these RPF calls in the area?  
A.	In the area, I was not privy to information regarding any of them.  But I heard those broadcasts, but close to us in a commune, that was -- those performances were not quoted.  I know one youth who became a soldier, and who left before 1990.  I don't know the other ones.  
Q.	Thank you.  Could you (no interpretation) the name as an example to the Chamber of this soldier? 
A.	This soldier, of course, because I lived in Kigali, I don't remember his name.  But I know both his mother and father's name.  His father was Niybizi Ezéchias, and his mother was called 
	Mukangoga Vérédiane (phonetic).
Q.	Could you spell the surnames of the father and the mother? 
A.	Spelling, father:  Niybizi, N-I-Y-B-I-Z-I, Niybizi, Ezekias; Mukangoga, the mother, 
	M-U-K-A-N-G-O-G-A, Vérédiane.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, could you tell the Chamber if you knew the RPF -- the following RPF personalities:  
Seth Sendashonga, Atnapole (phonetic) Rwigara; Denis Polisi, and Sebarenzi, Kabuye.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Hold on one minute.  Let me show the Chamber where their names are found on the spelling list.  

Sendashonga is No. 27 on the spelling list; Sebarenzi Kabuye is No. 26; Rwigara is No. 24; Polisi is No. 20.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Had you heard people talk about these RPF personalities who are natives of that area? 
A.	Yes, I heard talk about these personalities.  But, for Sendashonga, I knew him, and he knew me as well.  Rwigara, who was a businessman, someone I knew, and he knew me as well.  Sebarenzi Kabuye was the chairman of the national assembly.  I've never seen him, but I knew that he was a native of that commune.  Polisi, I know him, yes.  I can't tell you if he remembers me, because it's about -- we haven't seen each other for about 34 years.  But I also know him, and I know that he is a native from the Gishyita commune.  
Q.	Was there another one?  
A.	No, that's it.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you confirm to the Chamber that these were personalities -- influential members of RPF? 
A.	Yes, they were very influential members considering the fact that Sendashonga, I think, was even a founding member.  He was the minister of the interior in the first government, the government of the 19th of July, I believe, 1994.  Sebarenzi Kabuye, as I told you, was speaker of the national assembly.  And I think he was an important figure in the RPF.  Rwigara Asinapole (phonetic) was a businessman, very influential businessman, and who travelled extensively.  

Although people didn't say so, these are the people who bank-rolled the party and who participated in the recruitment -- internal recruitment.  We referred to the massive exile of youths who went to the front.  I believe that these people were not unconnected to that --
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	-- because that is, indeed, an attempt to see the entrance of these founding members to the RPF in that region, which we have talked about a lot here during this trial.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

According to you, at least as far as you are aware, in the month of May and June, did Bisesero refugees organise raids in the Gisovu -- No. 5 on the spelling list; Gishyita, No. 4; Gitesi, No. 6, in order to have food supplies?  Were you aware of this? 
A.	Yes, I was slightly aware of this.  However, these people spent more than three months -- at least three months in that highland region, and that they couldn't continue living without eating.  Later on, and I think last year or so -- I saw a programme -- unfortunately, I can't remember the TV station that broadcast that programme in which they showed survivors, Bisesero survivors, who were describing how they lived during those three months.  They explained, themselves, that they carried out raids in order to get food supplies.  

At that time, I was not aware that I was going to make a testimony before this Tribunal, so I can't remember the name of the person of the -- of the person who was speaking.  They identified 
Éric Nsabimana, who was bourgmestre.  They clearly explained that in the night they had to carry out raids to -- to obtain food supplies from the farms of citizens.  
Q.	Thank you.  What was the reaction of the population against these raids?  
A.	The people reacted in a manner which can be described as being terrorised.  They felt terrorised, and they would have -- they wanted to have the army intervene.  As a matter of fact, they were wondering and they dreaded the possible incursions by the RPF fighters.  It was a situation of unspecified terror.  
Q.	Witness, thank you for having described to the Chamber.  In any case, that was our goal, the situation in that area.  I thank you for having answered the -- I mean responding to our invitation to come and answer questions on behalf of Mr. Karemera.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
And, Your Honour, I have completed my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  

Do any other Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
I wouldn't have any questions, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
We shall not put questions to the witness either, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to the Prosecutor, who may have questions for you in cross-examination.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you in Bisesero in April, May, June or July of 1994?  
A.	No, Prosecutor.  
Q.	Where were you residing between April and July of 1994?  
A.	Between April 1994 and July, I was -- I was, firstly, in Kigali, where I was employed, and in ************** which is my native hill.  Secondly -- did I answer properly?  Could you please repeat the question?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
May that statement in regard to his native commune be redacted, Mr. President.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, it's a very big area, a commune, and there's no indication as to who this man is.  I respectfully submit that's overly sensitive on the part of my learned friend.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we agree that the name of the commune, by itself, is not sufficient to identify the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What happened to the Tutsis in your area during the events of April to July of 1994?  
A.	What area, Counsel?  Are you referring to Kigali, where I worked, or are you referring to my native cellule, commune or secteur?  
Q.	I'm referring -- and you're quite right to ask me for clarification -- to your native area.  
A.	Thank you.  When I got to my hometown, some Tutsis were dead, others had gone into hiding, either at their neighbours or elsewhere.  And this also obtained (sic) in Bisesero.  
Q.	Do you agree that many Tutsi civilians were killed in the Bisesero area?  
A.	Listen, how can I tell if they were killed or had not been killed?  That was said by those who were there, including authorities.  And Tutsis had been killed, because -- I mean nobody can dare claim that Tutsis were not killed.  
Q.	And can you help us with who was doing the killing?  It was the army, and the Interahamwe and the gendarmerie and other members of the population; isn't that right? 
A.	I never was there.  But from where I was, we could hear the sound of automatic weapons and explosions.  I heard people say that, at some point in time, the gendarmes of Kibuye had gone to Bisesero because they had been called in for assistance.  

And, by the way, some were killed.  And the news went around, especially as there was a lieutenant and fighting was raging in that area.  I can't tell if the army went there, but there was a group sent by the gendarmerie that was there.  But all of that is hearsay.  
Q.	Thank you.  I understand people's hearsay.  I understand that.  And did you hear it said that the army and the Interahamwe had appeared in Bisesero to support the gendarmerie?  
A.	I didn't hear about the army.  The Interahamwe could have been possible, but I wouldn't have been surprised.  However, there were no armed Interahamwe.  I did not meet any.  
Q.	And were you aware of the massacres which took place in Kabuye town at the Gatwaro stadium in the Home Saint-Jean.  
A.	Not immediately, not at that time.  But around the -- 2000 or slightly before.  But in the year 2000, I visited Kibuye.  And I was at the scene which had become a memorial at the entrance of the church.  Otherwise, whilst I was still on my native hill, I couldn't have known, because there was a distance of 
	36 kilometers and there were no persons who were travelling to bring the news to me and enable me to hear about it. 
Q.	Can you help us with when it was that you went to your native hill from Kigali, the month in 1994?  
A.	Yes, I went there.  And I can even give the date.  I got to my native hill on the 17th of April.  I had left Kigali on the 15th.  And I spent two nights at Gitarama.  And I was lucky enough to find a vehicle which ferried me, together with my family, all the way to -- I wonder if I should mention the location near the communal office -- a small centre just located just near the communal office.  
Q.	What had happened to the Tutsis in Kigali between the death of the president on the 
	6th of April of 1994 and your leaving Kigali on the 17th of April?  
A.	What happened to the Tutsi?  What had befallen the Tutsi, rather, had befallen the Hutu.  Tutsi died and Hutu died.  And to respond, there were Tutsi and Hutu who died.  It was total commotion, Counsel.  
Q.	Did you see any bodies of Tutsis in Kigali?  
A.	Bodies of Tutsi?  I did see a body.  I no longer recollect the name of that person who had been killed by bandits, who had come from Gikondo -- or, rather Magerwa.  I lived in ***********  And when we were attacked, the massacred persons -- and I saw somebody -- or, the body of somebody they had killed, close to where we lived.  
Q.	Throughout the period of April to July of 1994, how many bodies did you see?  Was it just the one that you mentioned?  
A.	I saw that body.  The other bodies, I saw -- while I was leaving Kigali  I saw bodies in the secteur -- I don't remember the name -- how is it called?  Anyway, it's close to the Kigali central prison, where we tried to pass by to leave the capital.  But we were sent back and were bound to go through the Nyabugogo boulevard, which is located from the Kigali junction all the way to 
	Nyabugogo valley.  And I saw lots of bodies around that area. 
Q.	And who sent you back?  Was it the Interahamwe, or the army, or the police, or -- or how did you get sent back?  Did you go to a roadblock and did they tell you to go a different direction?  Help us, please.  
A.	Indeed, there was a roadblock at that place and there were armed persons.  I do not remember if they wore any uniforms.  But as I backtrack, everybody has to go through the Nyabugogo boulevard to exit if you're heading to the south.  
Q.	And as you backtracked and then you took the route out of Kigali, you tell us that you saw quite a number of bodies.  And how had those people been killed?  Could you see?  
A.	No, of course, we couldn't have known.  How could we have known?  But, you know, this happened about more than 14 years ago, and I no longer remember the nitty-gritties.  But what I remember is that some people were bleeding profusely, and apparently they had been killed by sharp weapons.  
Q.	They had been killed by the Interahamwe, hadn't they?  That was your understanding of what was taking place, Tutsis being killed by Interahamwe with machetes and other sharp objects; isn't that right? 
A.	That's a hard question.  Counsel, please bear in mind, if nobody has told you, in that mayhem, the Hutu could have been killed, likewise, the Tutsi.  And, secondly, I did not go to check.  And if I had conducted that check, I might have been mistaken by claiming that this was a Tutsi or that was a Hutu.  So I really cannot answer that question.  
Q.	Do you accept that there was a slaughter of Tutsi civilians in Kigali between the 6th of April and the end of April of 1994?  
A.	But why do you say "accept?" You seem to mean that I should admit culpability.  It is known that Rwandan citizens were -- died, actually, and died in their numbers.  Many Tutsis -- are you asking me if Tutsis died?  My answer is yes, Tutsis died.  And I would say further that the Hutus died as well.  And that is obvious.  I mean, 14 years later, it's a matter that is established.  And the purpose now is to render justice.  And we cannot claim that people did not die.  
Q.	Do you agree that the Tutsis were killed in much greater numbers than any numbers of Hutu deaths in the Kigali -- in Kigali between the 6th of April and the end of April; that the Tutsis were killed in much, much greater numbers? 
A.	I, frankly, cannot know, unless I assume.  I cannot say, yes, they were killed -- more of them were killed.  I would say that is a sweeping statement.  But all I know is that, certainly, persons died.  I know those were reported missing, nobody knew their whereabouts, and they were Hutu, and those were counted among the Tutsi who had been killed.  And that is a fact.  And so I really did not know those who were killed massively, that is, who were those that were killed more than the others. 
Q.	Do you accept that there was a slaughter of Tutsi civilians throughout the Kibuye préfecture between April and July of 1994?  
A.	Counsel, your questions are honestly -- in fact, it bears this connotation:  Do you accept or do you agree?  Counsel, Hutus and Tutsi died in Kibuye préfecture.  Perhaps, I may say that -- for sure, that the Hutus who died were less in number than the Tutsi.  But Tutsis died.  
Q.	Do you accept that there were gatherings of Tutsi refugees in various locations, for example, Gatwaro stadium; for example, Home Saint-Jean; for example, Bisesero; and they were wholesale slaughtered?  
A.	At Home Saint-Jean, at that location, by whom, I cannot say.  Claiming that they had been massacred, I heard about it.  And when I was able to move and go to those places, I told you what I had seen.  And so in some places like the Home Saint-Jean and elsewhere, you are certainly in a better position; you are certainly more informed than I am.  But all I know is that, after the tragedy that heaped our country, nobody can really say that people did not die.  
Q.	And if there were slaughters, wholesale, of Tutsi refugees gathered in the thousands at the 
	Home Saint-Jean, the Gatwaro stadium, and also the Bisesero, can you help Your Honours with who was killing them?  What organisations were slaughtering the Tutsi?  
A.	That, I can't answer.  I do not know who staged all of this.  I do not know.  In fact, let me say, I do not know who, for instance, was the area commander in Kibuye.  I do not know who the military authority was.  The civilian authorities, I knew, but I do not know what their actions were, what were their reactions, what, rather, were the orders that were issued.  Really, I know nothing about that.  All I know is that people had been killed.  
Q.	Well, on that note that you don't know, I finish my cross-examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

Is there any redirect of this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
No, Mr. President.  No redirect.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Now, Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you for assisting the Tribunal in its work. 

THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, can I request a favour, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may -- you may make your request.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  You see, Mr. President, after concluding my testimony, I would like to see the person who is on trial in this case, and on whose behalf I have testified.  And if it is possible, with your leave, I also would like to see someone who is in custody here, a very close friend of mine, who lost a child in June.  And I would honestly like to extend my condolences to that person.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I'm curious as to who the very close friend of this witness is who's at the UNDF.  Now, implicit in the request is that the witness needs to tell Your Honours who it is that he would like to see other than any of the defendants in this case.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we grant permission for you to see the Accused in this trial.  And the registry will make arrangements.  In relation to other detainees, we don't exercise jurisdiction over that.  But the prison authorities have indicated that the request could be addressed through the registrar.  So the registrar will probably make enquiries and inform you of what is possible.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I'm on my feet.  

I have an application to ask a further question in cross-examination.  And it arises out of something that a witness said a moment ago to Your Honour by way of request to visit an unknown member at the UNDF who is said to be a very close friend.  I want to ask him who that is.  It may go to credibility.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, we think this is a matter of -- of minimal significance, but I will ask the witness myself to indicate who was the person he wished to visit with at UNDF.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

As a matter of fact, the family of ************************* and my family are friends  And not long ago, that family lost a son, and I would like to see him to extend my sympathy to him.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the witness re-pronounce that name slowly?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The interpreters have requested you to restate the name slowly.  
THE WITNESS: 
His name **************************** 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY: 
That seems to be ***************************************************************************, who a convictee of the ICTR.  
THE WITNESS: 
Indeed, he's the one.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Thank you very much.  You are now excused, Mr. Witness.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  You may bring the next witness in, please.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I enquire what is the pseudonym of the next witness?  Is it RQU or WKL?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
The witness's pseudonym is RQU.
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, do we confirm that this is the last witness that is available?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Otherwise, may I advise that if it is not to your knowledge, witness was prevented this morning from leaving the airport, and the plane is still waiting.  And I believe it is not the jurisdiction of the Trial Chamber.  The witness's passport had a validity of only eight months.  And the witness could not board the plane, and, therefore, is in limbo at the airport in Amsterdam.  So I confirm hereby that this is the last witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  That conforms to the information we have as well. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apparently, the witness is still tuned to the channel of the previous witness, which was French.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Mr. Witness, you are going to testify now.  But, before you do that, you will have to make an oath or a declaration to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now assist you to do that. 
(Declaration made by Witness RQU in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you'll have to respond, first of all, to Ms. Diagne, who is representing Édouard Karemera, and she'll be giving examination now.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Your Honour, members of the Bench, I would like to state that this witness cannot read the particulars on his personal information sheet, so we should go into closed session in order to cross-check it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  For the benefit of the public, the Chamber has made an order for the protection of this witness for security reasons.  And one element of the order is that his identity should be concealed from the public.  At the commencement of his testimony, he has to say who he is.  And we have to go into closed session for that portion of his testimony.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 28 to 30] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, we are now in open session, so I will no longer call you by your name.  Otherwise, that could reveal your identity.  
A.	I would be very grateful.  
Q.	I would also like to ask you that when you answer, you should avoid providing addresses that are too precise in number -- nature, as this could also reveal your identity.  
A.	Okay.  
Q.	Lastly, I would like to ask you the name of the person whom we referred to a while ago in closed session, under no circumstances should you repeat it in public.  Quite simply, I will tell you the name of your neighbour, and you will understand whom I'm talking about.  

Are we agreed on that code, so that you don't reveal the identity of that person as well?  
A.	Well understood.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

Witness, I heard -- and I need not tell you how I came across this.  I heard your neighbour say things about Mr. Édouard Karemera.  He said that Mr. Karemera came on one occasion -- the first time, I should say, as far as he -- as far as he knows, to Gasenyi, in the company of -- of the conseiller de secteur, the headmaster of Musango primary school.  M-U-S-A-N-G-O, and the bourgmestre of the Mwendo commune.  

And he states that these people came into the Gasenyi centre at the time when he was in his house located at the distance of 10 metres.  And these people who were in the company of Mr. Karemera were there when Mr. Karemera incited people from the commercial centre, in which you say you have spent 20 years, therefore, incited people to go to Bisesero to carry on the word -- work, which was that of exterminating the Tutsi.  

Did you follow -- did you understand what I said?  
A.	I did.  
Q.	What do you say to that?  Do you believe that this declaration is true?  
A.	That person lied to you.  
Q.	Witness, are you of the opinion that had Mr. Édouard Karemera come to the Gasenyi commercial centre, where you've been for 20 years, in the company of these people -- do you believe you would have known about it?  
A.	I don't know that.  The person who stated that lied.  
Q.	Wouldn't you say, Witness, that this could have been -- that is to say, this could have happened on the day when you were not at the commercial centre, for example, on a day you took ill?  
A.	During the entire period you're referring to, I was at the Gasenyi commercial centre, but I never witnessed the events you're referring to.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, do you believe that had your neighbour seen or heard about this, that you would have been informed about it by him?  
A.	No one can know the real intimate -- the mind of others.  But I would like to state -- repeat that that person lied.  
Q.	Witness, your neighbour also stated -- he cited names of persons who, according to him, were the killers of Bisesero.  These are Bunyenzi, Noel; spelling -- this has been spelled before, but I will do it again:  B-U-N-Y-E-N-Z-I, Bunyenzi.  He also talked about Budaraza, B-U-D-A-R-A-Z-A.  Those are examples that he provided of people who went to Bisesero to kill Tutsis.  

And my question is as follows:  Do you know these people cited about -- 
A.	Yes, I know Budaraza and Bunyenzi.  
Q.	Do you live together?  
A.	Both men live in Gisovu commune.  But, as a matter of fact, we lived in the ****************  
Q.	And would you know if they had been accused of having killed Tutsis in Bisesero, as your neighbour stated?  
A.	These people that were mentioned by my neighbour are no longer alive.  
Q.	Thank you.  Your neighbour stated that he had seen Mr. Édouard Karemera, on a second occasion, come along with a person by the name of Ndindiliyimana, and that he saw them still in Gasenyi commercial centre.  Was this to your knowledge?  
A.	That never happened.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Sorry, just to be accurate, in relation to the Ndindiliyimana citing, as I recall the evidence, it wasn't at the centre.  It was on the road leading from Bisesero.  My learned friend has put something, which, as I recall, is factually inaccurate, because she's put to the witness that that sighting with Karemera and Ndindiliyimana was at the Gasenyi centre.  It may not be a point of great significance, but it maybe helpful to be entirely accurate.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
My apologies, Mr. President, but I'll continue to refer to that person as "the neighbour."  And that neighbour said Mr. Karemera came on board a vehicle, and he gave the make of that vehicle to the Gasenyi commercial centre.  

May I recall the exact statement of the neighbour -- and I am certain that my learned colleague will admit his mistake, but we're going to proceed, because, as he says, it's a detour; it's not too important.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, did Mr. Karemera and Mr. Ndindiliyimana -- could they have possibly gone to the 
`	Gasenyi commercial centre, where you stated you had spent 20 years, without having been aware of their presence?  
A.	I do not know the person named as Ndindiliyimana.  However, I know Édouard Karemera, and I never saw him at the Gasenyi commercial centre, where he is said to have come and told members of the public to kill the Tutsi, and that he had made such a statement during a meeting.  I wasn't informed about this, neither was I a witness.  And, besides, I am not the only dweller at that centre.  And nobody else was a witness to that event.  
Q.	You have pre-empted my next question, because I was about to ask you whether, in the bars, in the taverns, which are certainly found in the Gasenyi commercial centre, since you, yourself, ********* during conversations in taverns or bars, did you ever hear that Mr. Karemera was around that area to ask the inhabitants -- the traders to go to Bisesero to help the gendarmes, who were being killed?  
A.	I will be saying the truth by saying that that never happened.  
Q.	Witness, where precisely is your **** located at the Gasenyi commercial centre?  Where precisely is your business found?  
A.	My ***** is situated around ******************** that is, towards the *********************************  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  But my question was:  What is the location -- or, what was the location of your ***** in the commercial centre?  
A.	As you start climbing, my ***** is located to the ****************************.  But you should understand that it is not my (unintelligible).  I am a tenant at the building where my business is found.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness gave a name which was not understood by the Kinyarwanda interpreter.  He did not understand the statement of the witness.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
That name should not be mentioned, says Counsel.  

Yes, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You probably heard the interpreters.  I wasn't sure if you had.  I was just drawing your attention to his comment.
(Pages 31 to 33 by Lisa Smith)








1240H
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, as I have said earlier on, remember that when we are referring to your neighbour, please abstain from mentioning any name. 

Witness, have you ever been prosecuted or convicted in Rwanda? 
A.	No, never. 
Q.	Witness, thank you for testifying.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
And let me also avail myself of this opportunity to notify Your Honours that I'm done with my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Do any of the other Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, we do not intend to examine the witness, as far as Mathieu Ngirumpatse's team is concerned.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, same applies here.  We are not going to examine the witness.  Thank you, sir.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I have an application for five minutes -- I want to discuss something with those behind 
me -- and then I'll be able to assist Your Honours with what next.  

I think Your Honours will be aware that there are a number of matters I need to discuss with those behind me before I make a decision about whether to apply to Your Honour about whether I'm cross-examining this witness today.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will take a 15-minute break now.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
(Court recessed from 1242H to 1300H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I have an application to adjourn the cross-examination of the witness, RQU, to the next session.  It is my understanding that the present session will end today and, therefore, an application to adjourn to tomorrow, or later, would be no different to an application to adjourn to the next session.  
The reason why I make the application is I would like some enquiries made about the nature of the relationship between the witness, RQU, and the witness, AMO, whom Your Honours have been informed, albeit it wasn't something disclosed, is -- the witness says -- related.  I use the word "related" because we are in open session.  

I regret the application.  Your Honours will be aware that a motion was filed at one point by my learned leader, Mr. Webster, to the effect that none of the nine potential witnesses, other than the video link witnesses, might properly be cross-examined during this session.  And I hope Your Honours has observed that I have made every effort to deal with as many of the witnesses as have appeared in court. 

But this is the one witness, in light of the relationship which has been described, which of itself may carry a certain weight, insofar as the witness, RQU, goes on to contradict the witness, AMO; in light of the lack of clear disclosure; and the lateness of notice that the witness, RQU, would be called, I would welcome an opportunity for further enquiries to be made.  

And I can tell Your Honours that there is an investigator in the field over in Kigali presently, and it may have been, if we were to sit tomorrow, that I would have some answers to questions for tomorrow.  But I'm conscious that the session is due to close today.  

In light of the difficulties, which Your Honours are fully aware of in the presentation of the Karemera Defence witnesses for this session, I make the application as I have.  Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, thank you for giving me the floor.  

I wish to state that I am not opposed to an adjournment of proceedings till tomorrow, if the Prosecutor is of the view that he needs to make investigations on the basis that the link between the two witnesses is important.  I do confirm and certify that that link does exist.  

I wonder what kind of notice the Prosecutor would have expected other than civil status documents?  Let me inform the Prosecutor that I did not want to take them unawares.  Because I received the information very belatedly.  I couldn't have received it earlier than yesterday.  And, of course, as soon as I received the information, I realised that the documents were very important.  

And I want to state on my honour, Mr. President, that I didn't want to take the Prosecutor unawares.  If he wishes to conduct investigations, I wouldn't oppose that.  However, Mr. President, I wouldn't accept that he should carry out his cross-examination in the next session.  I do not see why.  Because as far as I am concerned, I feel that a simple phone call would suffice for the Prosecutor to obtain the information he wishes to obtain.  And I, therefore, request you, Mr. President, most respectfully, to reject -- or, to deny the application made by the Prosecutor.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I just mention that I would be hopeful that some enquiries might be made, or makable, today; but I am not sure that by the time we would assemble tomorrow those enquiries would have been satisfactorily made, if at all.  

It's a matter for Your Honours how we should proceed.  But my application, on the understanding the session comes to an end today, is that we bring this witness back as the first witness for the next session.  And then all matters will be to hand.  Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, if the Prosecutor's objective is to adduce evidence contrary to the evidence that has been brought by the witness, that is, if the evidence is to prove that the witness hasn't told the truth, I believe the Prosecutor has other opportunities to do so.  That is why I object to the application.  And if the Chamber were to grant the Prosecutor's application, I wouldn't mind having us adjourn until tomorrow, but definitely not until the next session, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, we -- I think I have to make a comment on the issue of timeliness of -- and the quality of information being provided concerning the presentation of the Defence.  

On the information that we had, both from you, your side, your team, and the registry, it was apparent that it would have been very difficult for the session to have lasted longer than today.  So we, despite our efforts to have all nine witnesses heard this week, we regretfully concluded that that was impossible, and other plans were put in place to utilise the time, which means that sitting tomorrow as a full Bench was not a real, or viable, option.  

We considered, however, the issue as to whether we could sit under 15 bis, at least for part of the day tomorrow.  But in light of the general attitude to 15 bis sittings exhibited by the parties in this trial, and also the uncertainty of an effective result of the enquiries that may be conducted, we thought it would be better to let the cross-examination commence at the beginning of the next session.  

So those are the factors we've taken into account.  We accept that the -- we also accept that the quality of information in the summaries provided is very, very sparse.  In fact, it is almost -- I doubt if it really conforms to any proper definition of a summary.  It's more an identification of the topics on which the witness will discuss.  And I think the rules require that what is provided is a summary, and we would think that that should be adhered to.  It's an issue which assists -- it definitely assists, I think, in the fairness of the trial, in general, and also assists in more effective management of our time and the time of all the parties.  So we add that comment, which we hope will inform the next trial session in a more effective manner.  

We are in the process of completing -- completing a scheduling order which will deal with the next trial session.  It will address the witness list that has been filed, that was filed last week Friday, and the time estimates for the completion of the presentation of your Defence.  And would also provide an indication of the date on which the Ngirumpatse Defence will commence, and an indication of its duration.  But we think that we ought to run the adjournment until the next session for those reasons.  

Mr. Morley?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I thank you.  I have properly understood your decision.  However, may I say that I am not debating your decision.  It is impossible for me to start trying to discuss your decision or to contest it.  If I have given any such impression, it is only due to a misunderstanding.  

What I would like to say now is only to point out the consequences that will not fail to arise.  What I want to say, Mr. President, is that I had envisaged calling several witnesses hailing from Rwanda.  I am sure you fully understand how delicate the problem is.  

Mr. President, whatever you have perceived as rebellion on the part of the Karemera team is only the result of desolation in light of the prejudicial consequences of decisions that you took.  Insofar as you ordered that my list be disclosed to the Prosecutor, my witness, that is, the witness I considered as the most important witness on my list, was immediately summoned by so-called Gacaca jurisdictions.  And that witness had all the time to appear before this Court.  But in the final analysis, in the last minute, the minister of justice of Rwanda instructed that witness to remain at his disposal and to follow his instructions.  That is why that witness could not be called during this session.  Perhaps you wouldn't have known about it if I hadn't told you that.  

But let me point out to you that as for those I have managed to bring here for this session, if I were to say that they will come next session, that will not be possible.  I might as well just say goodbye to them, because I risk not seeing them again.  I am presenting a very real problem to you, Mr. President.  I did not want to raise these problems to you because I was wondering what influence you could have in terms of resolving that problem, but now I am obliged to point these problems out to you.  This is what happened, and these are the problems that may continue to crop up.  

I have tried to do my best to call the witnesses to appear before this Court.  I would have liked to do everything to make sure they do not have to come back in the next session, but I understand the full purport of your decision, and it's unfortunate that we have to take that decision.  If you have not been able to understand the actions of our team, the Karemera team, but I am glad that I have the opportunity to underscore the reasons why we may have had such a conduct.  And I wish to reiterate that I do fully understand your decision.  

And that is it, Mr. President.  And I apologise for any misunderstandings. 
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, as we prepare to adjourn, I wish to present the best wishes of Ngirumpatse's team up until we resume on the 1st (sic) of August.  I do understand the problems Mrs. Dior Diagne has encountered, they show the extent of the difficulties that our Defence teams have contacting and calling potential witnesses in Rwanda, and also underscores the problem of protecting the identity of witnesses, without which their security is at stake.  And all the hopes of the Defence teams are dashed when that happens much. 

So it also prevents those witnesses from bringing to light the truth before the Chamber, not only in the interests of the Bench, but both parties.  And the relations between Defence teams and potential witnesses is also jeopardised, and they will not be able to appear and adduce evidence before the Court.  It is not only security problems we face, we also face material, organisational problems.  

For instance, when the witness protection section, or DCMS gives us only one hour to meet with our witnesses, here it is equality of arms that is at stake.  The Chamber should take stock of the arms that the Prosecutor has in its relations with the Rwandan authorities.  It has more than sufficient staff in terms of investigators, legal assistants, and so on and so forth.  So there is no equality of arms between the Defence and the Prosecutor, and the Defence is extremely penalised by all that obstructs the free exercise of our profession in defending our witnesses -- our Accused.  Unless there is equality of arms, there cannot be any basis for a fair trial if the Defence cannot adduce its evidence relying on its own witnesses, free from all pressure, free from all duress, such as to appear before the Chamber and to tell the truth as people who are independent and who are not under the pressure of the Rwandan authorities or under threats or fear of reprisals.  

I just wanted to bring this to the attention of the Chamber before we adjourn.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I can see you smiling already.  But rest assured, sir, mine is simply to wish you a good rest while we'll be on recess.  And this wish also extends to the entire teams of the Prosecution and the Defence, with great white hope that on our return we are going to resume with a spirit of fraternity, mutual respect, and hopeful that in our work only the truth will prevail at the ultimate end.  And that you, Mr. President, Your Honours, will be indeed the church standing in the middle of the village.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Regrettably, I'm not offering goodbyes at this precise moment.  May I mention two matters of housekeeping?  

The first concerns the status of the forthcoming witnesses from the Karemera Defence.  The ever helpful Miss Visser in the Prosecution team has reminded me that in light of the court order of the 2nd of April of 2008, which was supposed to have been complied with by the 5th of April of 2008, regarding details of witnesses.  

The situation presently is this:  We have personal information sheets in respect of only four of the forthcoming witnesses in the Karemera Defence case -- namely, ETB, WTE, XLL and XCU -- and we do not have on those personal information sheets all the details that had been ordered by paragraph 8 of the decision of the 2nd of April, and have no details in respect of others.  

And what we would ask for, or at least put Your Honours on notice about, is that not only do we ask for the names of the witnesses, but their personal information sheets ought to reflect, referring to the order of paragraph 8, 2nd of April:  One, their nicknames; two, their nationality; three, sex, date, place of birth; four, full names of both parents; five, residence in 1994; and six, occupation at present and in 1994. 

That information is helpful to the Prosecution, assuming it's received in timely fashion -- and should have been received some time ago -- so that we can conduct proper enquiries.  I'm simply putting Your Honours on notice that, as I understand it from Miss Visser, we have personal information sheets only in respect of four of the otherwise long list of Karemera Defence witnesses.  

Having said that, do I understand correctly that we resume on the 18th of August?  Is that a decision which is clear?  A moment ago somebody mentioned that we were resuming on the 1st of August.  And that might have been a translation error.  But is it clear when we leave Your Honours' presence today we know that we will be in court, in principle on the 18th of August?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that is clear. 
MR. MORLEY: 
That is clear.  Thank you.  And may I ask, it being 25 to 2 -- and I had understood Your Honours might sit until 2 o'clock -- whether this is a convenient moment to deal with the Prosecution exhibits which Your Honours thought a little earlier today, when we thought we would have evidence all day, might otherwise be dealt with in writing.  Your Honours are reminded we have the witnesses TXL, KBL, LSP; and the witness in open, Mathias, to deal with.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I suppose we could reduce the paperwork if we heard oral arguments now.  We have time to do that now.  But there's just one other comment I wish to address -- or, remark, first. 

I confirm that we do commence on the 18th of August.  

We would just like to make remarks to particular issues.  Our decision on the issue of sanctions is already written and it will probably be filed this afternoon.  But in that context, we have taken note of the remarks made by Maître Diagne, and accept, to some extent, the apologies and explanation that's she has given.  

We think this is very important to emphasise:  That the communication of information is not regarded by us as being at the same level as the disclosure obligation of the Prosecution.  And I think that is quite clear in the fairly-well established jurisprudence of the Tribunal.  But this information is an important element in the whole concept of our fair trial processes, and we think it's important that the principles be respected. 

I think that we have explained fairly fully the rationale for the rules regarding the disclosure relating -- of material relating to protected witnesses, and the time when that material should be disclosed.  And we are interested in ensuring that the principles are adhered to and respected, and we intend to enforce that.  

With regard to the issues raised by Mr. Weyl, we would like to say, which probably ought to be known already, that the Chamber considers that it has power to address issues that he raised.  If the Defence run into the type of problems that he hinted at, a timely application to the Chamber, supported by appropriate evidence, will be adjudicated upon in a manner which we will hope would assist in ensuring that a just resolution to the issues is found.  And the Chamber is anxious to ensure that adequate facilities and time are given to the presentation of the Defence.  But we can't do anything if we don't know what the problems are, and we can only know about these problems if an appropriate application is made and supported by evidence which will enable to us take necessary action. 

With those remarks, I think I will end, and reciprocate the good greetings for the recess.  

I think that it might be better for everybody if we took away the need to make written submissions on the issue of the evidence admissions.  And so if you're ready now we could hear the -- any arguments that might be presented on those issues. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  My first application concerns the witness today, Mathias Hitiyaremeye, who gave evidence in open, and it concerns the document dated the 25th of May of 1994.  The application is that the document be admitted.  In any event, marked for identification.  But the application is for it to be an exhibit in the case formally. 

And the reason for that is the document has, on its face, a contemporaneity to events which took place.  The witness has given evidence that he knows its author, and that the author knows him, and the witness has made a series of observations about the document itself about whether it's reliable.  And it's a matter for Your Honours whether the nature of those observations carry any weight.  For example, his description of how the document cannot be right because it refers to the witness as being the secretary of the MRND office in Kibuye in 1994, when technically that's wrong.  He was the secretary in 1993.  That sort of thing. 

I respectfully submit that, in light of the way the evidence developed in respect of that document, it is plainly -- and admissible as an impeaching document for consideration as to weight for Your Honours when weighing the testimony of the witness.  That's my first application.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, we have a number of questions.  But the one which I'll ask you at this stage had to do with the absence of a fax number on the cover page.  Do you have an explanation for that?  
MR. MORLEY: 
The cover page seems, on the face of it, to be the origin to the OTP of the three pages which follow.  The three pages which follow clearly, on the face of there being a fax with telephone numbers at the top of those three pages, suggest that this is a document which ended up being faxed to the location of the cover page, and the cover page people, at some stage, then placed the document in the hands of the OTP.  

What is interesting about the document is the extent to which, on the face of it, it seemed to be adopted by the witness, because he was arguing at one point it was the bedrock of the false allegations, as he put it, in respect of which he served time in jail.  

So I hope that assists.  When one looks at the document, pages 2, 3 and 4 seem to have moved from Belgium and have ended up with the U.S. committee for refugees.  But I cannot offer you at this point an entire chain of custody as to how the document came to go from one party to another, and so on. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. 
MR. MORLEY: 
And I'm not relying on putting the document in by reason of chain of custody; I'm relying on it by reason of the observations made, and adoption of the document, by the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, thank you for that explanation.  

Yes.  Any converse submissions?  Is the application opposed?  
MR. NIMY: 
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, Mr. Weyl stood up before you, only you couldn't see him.  
MR. NIMY:
Oh, sorry, I didn't see him.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I'm obliged once again.  And I did not believe I have to lay claim to any precedence over any of my learned colleagues.  But I do not understand the observations of Mr. Morley.  

Firstly, the document has two separate papers.  There is a cover page, which is not signed, and has a header bearing U.S. committee for refugees.  If that had to be admitted into evidence, the U.S. committee for refugees should authenticate the document.  

And then you have the three Vs, which are quite suspicious to the extent that it is a fax.  So we have to take it with some caution.  And it is a poor quality fax.  And besides, that fax does not originate with the witness.  If a document has to be admitted into evidence, perhaps it would suffice to question the survivors or Mr. Nkurunziza, Jean Marie, who claims to be acting on their behalf, to come and give an explanation about this fax; or to contact Mr. Gasana who seems to be the sender of the fax, so as to explain the conditions under which the fax was sent.  It is not because a name features on a document that that person is qualified to authenticate the document and warrant the admission thereof into evidence.  So we cannot allow that document to be entered into evidence.  

For several months now we have learned about admission for identification purposes.  Should the Trial Chamber rule for the identification of that document, especially when such a document is not admissible, we cannot envisage to admit what we'll consider before our Courts as rubbish and to enter such into evidence.  It is a document whose probative value should not even be considered.  

But let me say it originates, perhaps, from somebody whom the Prosecution can call for the purpose of admitting that document into evidence.  And we are going to contradict that person.  But the admission of that evidence into evidence should not be admitted on the sole basis that the name of the witness features there on.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I believe that a lot has been said on this document.  Mine is just to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber on the fact that this document, beyond its defects, procedural defects, there is a substantive defect which has been picked out by the witness.  The witness did not only outline the fact that his occupation was not accurately reported, but the witness pointed out a fundamental issue.  When in this document the author lists among the Interahamwe persons who clearly have never been members of the MRND, the problem is a major one, especially in respect of the relevance of the document and the contents thereof.  

When the witness clearly highlights the acquaintances, this is euphemistic, between the author of the document and the RPF, there is a credibility issue with this document.  When the witness notes that the author of the document, immediately after, was appointed or promoted to duties, and which appointment was effected by the RPF, then this document is problematic, Mr. President, and this document should not be given a weight it doesn't have.  It is not relevant, Mr. President.  It can be admitted for the sole purpose of identification, Mr. President.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would honestly like to state what the witness testified before this Court this morning.  He doesn't claim to know the author.  When the name of the author is put to him, he doesn't say he knows the author.  He doesn't have any personal acquaintance with the author, and he claims it is a forged document.  And that means that the witness is refuting the person in question as being the author, or he is completely unaware.  When the Prosecution moves that the document be admitted on the basis of the fact that the witness purportedly claimed to know the witness, I know for sure that the Trial Chamber will not admit this document.  

And, Mr. President, this morning I did say that this document, which originates from the OTP, we laid hands on two copies.  And I would like Mr. Issa to exhibit those documents to you, and you would clearly see that these documents, which come from the Prosecutor's office, deal with the same issue, but don't have the same K numbers, they don't have the same writing.  One is a fax, the other is not a fax.  
And to give you proof of my claim, I would like Mr. Issa to pick up these two documents I laid hands on, and I believe that it will convince you beyond reasonable doubt that this document has been doctored, beyond the fact that the witness never testified before this Court that he knew the author of that document as a personal acquaintance. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We think we're going to admit it.  The -- there is some indicia of authenticity with the fax numbers, and the particular issue had bothered us.  We just -- seems to be an address.  Because the fax numbers on the three pages of the document are connected to the address that -- the fax number of the address on the cover page.  

And then there's an issue of relevance, the witness's name makes it relevant.  

The issue of the weight to be attached to it is a matter which will be addressed when we have -- when we are considering the evidence in general.  And the admit of the document is not a comment on the issue of the weight to which we will attach after we've had an opportunity to review the evidence in the trial as a whole.  

So we admit this document.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The second -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Issa, would we have a number. 
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be P. 322.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. P. 322 admitted) 
MR. MORLEY: 
The second document refers to the witness, KBL.  It was pages 3 and 4 of the bundle distributed then.  And Your Honours may call what it is, is the 1996 Rwandan promulgation of suspected génocidaires, and the witness, KBL's, name appeared on that list.  

And that application is made.  It's a like application in the respect of so many other witnesses who have given evidence both for the Prosecution and for the Defence.  And the objection to that particular document comes as a surprise.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Court's indulgence, Mr. President.  Karemera's Defence team has some concerns.  
This session is completely unexpected for us.  We expected to end at 2 p.m.  And I was asked whether I would be able to hold out, I said yes.  

Regarding the issue on admissions of documents, I did not know that we would have to make oral submissions.  I thought we were going to make written submissions.  I do not understand what we are doing now.  

I completely misunderstood what was said, Mr. President.  I did not understand that we would proceed to have a session on the admission of documents.  I would like to inform the Chamber that I do not have my file here.  I was expecting that the session -- this hearing would end at 2 p.m. today. 
MR. MORLEY: 
In fairness to Ms. Diagne, of course, we remind ourselves she was not, in fact, here when the documents were being dealt with with the witness, KBL, or the witness, LSP, nor the witness, TXH.  Mr. Sow dealt with the witness from the Chamber.  Although it is right to say that Ms. Diagne is aware of the documents in respect of KBL and LSP, who were video witnesses, and she was present in the room when the witnesses gave evidence.  But in fairness to Ms. Diagne, it may be right that she doesn't have the paperwork to hand and that Mr. Sow would be better placed if he was sitting in court to deal immediately with the oral arguments.  

I hope that's of assistance.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I thank you, my learned friend, Morley, for what you have just said.  

However, Mr. President, there is a principle of continuity in our teams, and in our case it is present.  It is true that I was not there at the beginning.  But that said, Mr. President, I didn't bring my file of documents here because I had expected that we would end at 2 p.m. and I came unprepared for these kinds of submissions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, it had been our intention, as we stated early today, to have written arguments on these matters.  But when we discovered that we had some time, we actually enquired, and it was my understanding that all counsel had agreed that we would hear oral arguments to take away the need for having to file additional written submissions.  So when we embarked upon this exercise, it was our understanding that that was the consensus of counsel.  

However, in light of the objection you have raised, and in light of the comments made by your confrère, Morley, we will again direct that submissions on these matters be put in writing.  

How much time will be required?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I can do it by lunch time tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much time would the Defence need?  

Tomorrow is Thursday. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes, the 17th. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So who applies -- you submit first tomorrow, the Defence reply on Monday.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes.  Technically, it's their objection.  But to help everybody, I'll apply, and they can then object. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  And how much time will you need to respond?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm not going to have to respond. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Not going to have to respond.  

Is that orally accepted to everybody, that schedule?  

Good.  Well, that's the order. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
We also have exhibits to file, Mr. President.  You shouldn't forget that.  May I request that, for purposes of courtesy, those applications be sent to us in French, Mr. President, so that we can respond expeditiously?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, Ms. Diagne.  In relation to the exhibits which you're required to file, would you make your application tomorrow at midday, as well?  And the Prosecution will reply on Monday.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Certainly.  But, I'm a bit at a loss as to what the exhibits could possibly be. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, same here.  But I've made the order.  We'll have a written application on both sides tomorrow at midday, with a reply on Monday. 

MR. MORLEY: 
And I hope it's clear to Ms. Diagne that the application in respect of the exhibit for KBL, LSP and TXL relate to the documents which were used in cross-examination.  It's not some application in relation to documents which haven't been seen before; it's specifically the documents which were distributed as the cross-examination material.  That's what the application here concerns.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We've decided we'll now adjourn the session.  And, as usual, we'll just express a global thank you to everybody for their contribution to our work.  

We take our adjournment now.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President?  Regarding my witness who is in detention in Rwanda, should I make an application for cooperation, or do you consider that my request has already been registered and you'll consider it?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, Ms. Diagne.  If you have a witness who is in detention in Rwanda, or anywhere else in the world, the rules provide for a particular type of application to be made, and the Chamber will address it according to the rules.  We will not take any action unless you apply.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Understood, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we also have to make an order, Mr. Registrar, for the return of the Witness RQU at the commencement of the next session.  
(Court adjourned at 1411H)
