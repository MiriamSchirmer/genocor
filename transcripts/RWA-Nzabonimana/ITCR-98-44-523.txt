MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 10th of November 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What language are you going to testify in? 
THE WITNESS:
French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will testify in French?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Then you should speak French all the time because -- so that the translators -- 
THE WITNESS:
D'accord. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 

THE WITNESS:
D'accord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I request the Trial Chamber to apologise (sic) for not having given this information earlier.  To our knowledge, the witness has expressed her wish to waive her anonymity and wishes to testify under her real identity.  

I have problems with my earphones, Mr. President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says Counsel Weyl.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  We appreciate that.  

Madam Witness, we had previously made an order for your protection for security reasons, one element of which was that your identity should be concealed from the public.  And we're aware that you have indicated that those protections are no longer necessary and that you're willing to have your identity revealed.  Could you state what your position is for the benefit of the Court? 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you testified in any other cases before the Tribunal? 
THE WITNESS:
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

In those circumstances, we revoke the protection order that we made in favour of this witness.  

Before you testify you will have to take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by Cynthia Isimbi in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, what is the most efficient way of starting in having her identity on the record?  Do you introduce her information sheet or do I ask Mr. Weyl to do it? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, in the past I believe Mr. Weyl did that.  That's why I was hesitating to begin.  But it doesn't matter who does it.  This witness has a statement that's admitted under 92 bis.  Yesterday -- or the day before, we received a copy of the certified statement.  So if we could produce that, it can be entered into evidence.  And it does have her particulars at the top.  Or if we don't have a copy in Court, we can bring it later, but we can certainly give it a number at this stage. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.

Mr. Weyl, is that acceptable to you? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I thought that I would request the Tribunal to admit into evidence the personal identification sheet of the witness after verification of the PIS by the witness.  It has been proposed that this should be D. NG151 after verification and admission into evidence.  So it should be D. NG152 for the written statement as such.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you would prefer to allow her to put her personal information on the record.  Well, then, you may do that now.  

Madam, you've been called basically for cross-examination by the Prosecutor on the written statement, which is admitted into evidence.  But we'll allow Mr. Weyl to lead you through the description of your name and admitting the statement that you made in court.  It should not take very long.  

Mr. Weyl, you may proceed.  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CYNTHIA ISIMBI,
first having been duly sworn,
 testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Miss.  Can you please tell the Chamber what your name is, and your first name.  
A.	My name is Cynthia.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I didn't get her second name.  

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Contrary to what is the norm, I have not gone into the rules of procedure.  We're working both in English and French, and, therefore, your statement or testimony will be interpreted, as well as the questions that will be put to you.  Please allow time for interpretation to the interpreters.  So answer slowly, and when you mention a proper name, please spell it out so that the stenographers can correctly record your testimony.  So I would ask you to take and adopt this habit.  

And I would like to ask you right away to spell your last name.  Your last name.  
A.	My last name is spelt I-S-I-M-B-I.  And my first name is Cynthia, C-Y-N-T-H-I-A. 
Q.	You have a sheet of paper in front of you bearing your personal particulars.  I'm asking you to verify carefully the same and correct any possible errors that may appear there.  And at the end of that exercise, I would like you to date the document using today's date, which is the 11th -- the 
10th of November 2010, and then I'll ask you subsequently to sign the same document so that it can be admitted into evidence, as has been indicated by the presiding Judge. 
MR. WEYL:
If this exercise is concluded, may I request Mr. Issa for his assistance, so that the document can be taken so that it can be admitted into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG151 admitted)
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I also wish to request the Chamber to kindly admit the written statement from Ms. Isimbi, and this has been certified according to the rules.  So I'd request the Chamber to kindly admit this document, which has been certified, as Exhibit D. NG152. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG152 admitted)
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President.  I think at this point in time I can hand over to Mr. Webster so that he can continue with the procedure.  

And I would request Ms. Isimbi to kindly answer the questions asked of her by Mr. Webster and adhering to the rules that we use.  And I'm reminding her to kindly spell any proper names she may use in her testimony.  Thank you.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Once again, good morning to everyone.  

Let me begin by apologising to the Court and to everyone for my lateness this morning.  I was, unfortunately, delayed, but I thank you for your graciousness in waiting for me. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good morning to you, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  Good morning.  Oh, bonjour. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Good morning."
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Madam Witness, you gave a written statement to Mr. Weyl on the 5th of July 2010, a few months ago, and that statement was certified a few days ago.  In other words, someone from the registry went over its contents with you and you repeated that it was true to the best -- the contents of the statement was true to the best of your belief.  Everything I've said so far is accurate, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I confirm.  
Q.	Now, your statement makes it clear that you were a member of the extended Ngirumpatse family, the family of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and that you consider yourself the daughter -- or you identify yourself as the daughter of Monique, who is Ngirumpatse's sister-in-law.  And that's because your mother -- or the person you identify as your mother is the younger sister of Rose, Mr. Ngirumpatse's wife.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You still live with Rose, don't you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you've been living with her basically since the age of six years old. 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So it's almost as if Rose is your mother because she's the one that raised you and you continue to live with her.  
A.	Yes, yes. 
Q.	Wouldn't you consider your testimony before this Chamber almost as a tribute -- or an indication of your appreciation for Rose's generosity towards you because it's intended to assist her husband in his defence? 
A.	Not at all.  I do not agree with you.  I have come here to speak the truth.  
Q.	Well, I can accept that, Madam Witness.  And, quite honestly, I accept that you made every effort to speak the truth when you provided information that was recorded on the 5th of July 2010.  But having said that, let me ask you, do you really think that you are prepared to confront the truth? 
A.	Yes, I am ready to confront the truth.  
Q.	And you realise that the truth can sometimes be very unpleasant.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did Madam Rose or Mr. Weyl explain to you that some of the questions you'd be asked on cross-examination today may become unpleasant for you? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, they did.  
Q.	And how did they explain that to you?  Is there anything in particular that they told you that may become unpleasant? 
A.	They explained that you were going to ask me questions about my life since I was six years old, and that I should -- that you're going to ask me questions on difficult memories.  But I am ready to ask -- to answer all your questions.  
Q.	Well, your statement is very brief.  At its core you simply tell us that you know that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is a good man because he sheltered you after your father was killed.  
A.	Yes, indeed.  Yes.  
Q.	Your father is Victor Kayonga, who was Tutsi.  
A.	Yes, that is the case.  
Q.	Which means that under the laws of Rwanda, you are Tutsi even though your mother, Monique, is Hutu; right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And you suggest that because Ngirumpatse took you in after your father was killed, knowing your 
Tutsi ethnic identification, that that makes him a good and moral man.  Is that the basis of your suggestion, that he was good and moral and put himself at risk for your benefit? 
A.	It's -- that's not all, because when we were young, we would go to their place every weekend and they took care of my older brother.  Since we went to their house every weekend, I believed that he was a good man because we understood one another very well with him and his children, as well as his wife.  So it's not only because he welcomed us after the death of my father, but because every -- almost every weekend we went to their home and we got on very well.  
Q.	All right.  Well, thank you for that.  The other aspect of your statement that may be of value for our trial is that you and the Ngirumpatse family drove to Gitarama in a four-by-four Pajero vehicle, instead of using his black Mercedes.  You know that Ngirumpatse owned a dark-coloured Mercedes vehicle in 1994, don't you? 
A.	Yes.  But I recall that it was a Pajero because every weekend -- as I have previously said to you, when we went to their home every weekend, we would take the Pajero to go and take a ride in town, or this would happen with my brother or with Delphine.  So I do confirm that it was a Pajero.  
Q.	Well, that seems to be the only issue in contention -- or, excuse me, one of two issues in contention that your testimony is going to help us with because none of the parties dispute that the Ngirumpatse family left Gitarama -- left on a road trip to Gitarama on the 12th of April.  None of the parties contest that Ngirumpatse owned both a Pajero and a Mercedes.  None of the parties contest that you were welcomed into the Ngirumpatse family after your father was killed.  

The only thing you can help us with today, based on your written statement, is whether Ngirumpatse was a good and moral man, and whether the vehicle that you used on the 12th of April was the Pajero and not the Mercedes.  

Now, you were only six years old in 1994? 
A.	Yes.  I was only six years old, but oui -- pardon.  Yes, I beg your pardon, I was six years old at the time, but I can confirm that it was a Pajero, for sure.  
Q.	Well, did you have any appreciation at all for the Hutu-Tutsi conflict and the war and all of the things that made it necessary for you to leave Kigali on the 12th of April 1994?  Did you understand that at six years old? 
A.	No.  No.  
Q.	And did you have any appreciation at the time of the significance of your own ethnic identity and your father's ethnic identity and Ngirumpatse's ethnic identity at six years old in 1994? 
A.	Not at all.  
Q.	So when you say Ngirumpatse was good and moral because he helped you, that's an assessment that you make years later based on what you hear in the Ngirumpatse household about all of this Hutu-Tutsi business.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, everything dealing with Hutus and Tutsis -- at the age of six years, I did not understand the notion of Hutus and Tutsis.  What had really traumatised me, in fact, was that I had lost my father, and everything dealing with Hutus and Tutsis -- the only thing that I knew is that the plane came down.  But as for the rest of the business dealing with Hutus and Tutsis, I had no notion. 
Q.	Yes.  But in your statement when you say that Ngirumpatse put himself at risk to save you, this is your adult reflection on the events of 1994, as those events had been explained to you much later in the Ngirumpatse household.  
A.	As you said earlier -- that I was not living with my mother, I was living with Rose Ngirumpatse.  And sometimes my mother would call me and we would have discussions on the telephone.  And in the -- on the phone, she said that my father had something to do with the RPF, but she didn't specifically say what it was because, at home, generally, one cannot ask one's mother such details.  Our mother would not answer such questions because she knows -- and if -- because she'd lost her husband, she wasn't going into detail.  But it was my mother who, indeed, told me that he had something to do with the RPF.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that information.  But the point I'm trying to make with you -- or to elicit a response from you is that your assessment of Ngirumpatse, of his acts and his sacrifices in 1994, is really a product of how you have come to reconstruct those events in your adult -- in your adulthood because you didn't understand them in 1994.  But through conversations with your mother and Rose, and with anything you may have read subsequently, that's the basis for you to now tell us that Ngirumpatse sacrificed himself for you in 1994.  Right? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I said that Ngirumpatse was a good man, as you say, and I said this because he welcomed us in his home every weekend and he treated us as his children.  So if that was the case -- if he didn't beat us up, if he gave us food, he took us on rides, I thought that he was a good man.  So I don't understand what you want to say.  

For me, he was a good man, not only because he welcomed us after the death of my father, but because he treated us well every time that we went to his home every weekend; and, furthermore, he gave lessons to my older brother Jupiter.  So for me he was someone who was good because he wanted to educate us, to learn things from outside the school situation.  

Furthermore, I think that since my father was very strict with us, he often would send us to the Ngirumpatse home because he knew that they were people who were very well educated and we would be able to learn something from them, not only by staying with them but going to someone from the family who -- who was well brought up, who was well educated.  
Q.	All right.  Madam Witness, thank you for that.  Do you know a man named Georges Twagiramuhoza?  T-W-A-G-I-R-A-M-U-H-O-Z-A.  Georges Twagiramuhoza.  
A.	No.  
Q.	Well, I understand that this is your uncle.  He's a brother to Monique, your mother, and to Rose, your aunt.  But he may have died before you were born.  But in any case, he was married to a woman whose name I don't want to mention, but let me have Mr. Issa pass this up to you.
MR. WEBSTER:
This is document number 1 in my bundle.  

If you could just place that in front of the witness, please.  

The documents -- most of them are available in French and in English.  So this is document number 1.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You see where it says "Witness", that's the witness statement, and there's a name of a person there.  Do you know that person?  Or have you ever heard of that person? 
A.	I have never heard mention being made of her.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, this is someone who knows you.  She lived right near where you were living with your father Victor and your mother Monique up to 1994.  And she has some things to say about Ngirumpatse and about your father and your mother which aren't very pleasant -- or will not be very pleasant for you.  So it surprises me that Rose hasn't discussed that with you.  

According to this person who lives right in the vicinity of your home, her suspicion -- and this is not the result of any investigation -- but her suspicion is that it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse himself who ordered the killing of your father.  You've never heard anything like that?  Rumours to that effect from your mother? 
A.	No, I don't agree because -- oh -- excuse me.  I do not agree because when they came to kill my father, they asked for my mother.  So if it was Mathieu who had sent people, it would -- of course, they would know because my mother was not there, because my mother and father had disagreed the day before, and she had gone to the Ngirumpatse home.  So if he was the one who had sent those people, they wouldn't have asked for my mother.  
Q.	Well, if they asked for your mother, it's clear to you that those people knew who they were coming -- knew the household that they were entering on the evening of the 7th of April.  That much is clear, right? 
A.	I'm telling you that it is not those people who came to kill my father -- it's not Ngirumpatse who had sent them.  Because they beat him up and they said, "Where is your mother?"  And he was bleeding from the head and he was spitting blood.  For me, I was very traumatised.  So for someone who was spitting blood -- would someone who was suffering -- and I didn't believe that anyone could beat up my father.  

So this is why I'm confirming, and I'm 100 per cent sure, that it was not Ngirumpatse who sent soldiers to come and kill my father.  It is impossible.  Because the way in which they beat him up, they broke a beer bottle on his head, and then they asked us for money and all that.  So it is -- it's not possible.  
Q.	These people were Interahamwe, right, the ones that were attacking your father? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly whether they were Interahamwe or -- I don't know.  All I know is that they were soldiers who came to kill my father.  And I even forgot to tell you that during the day, someone came -- a neighbour came to tell us that there were soldiers who were going to come and kill him in the afternoon, and my father said that he couldn't care less.  

At that point in time, I was with my father when the neighbour came to tell him this because my father was taking me to the toilet and this is how I knew that soldiers were going to come and kill him, but not someone who was sent by the Ngirumpatse family.  
Q.	There were several soldiers and there were also several militiamen; in other words, men with uniforms, with guns, and then other persons who were not wearing uniforms but who might also have been armed.  Is that what you remember, soldiers and militiamen? 
A.	Counsel, I was not taking care in noticing how the soldiers were dressed because at the age of six, if I was seeing my father spit blood and bleeding from the head, his forehead was opened up, I wouldn't be able to determine how a soldier was dressed. 

I'm sorry, Counsel for the Prosecution, but I cannot tell you how they were dressed.  All I know is that they had weapons and they shot my father seven times because they killed him in front of us.  And when I say "us", I'm referring to my older brother, the maid and myself.  
Q.	That was not the first time that those types of soldiers or militiamen -- those people that were harming your father on the 7th of April -- that was not the first time that those types of people had come to your house.  They had been there before, months before.  Do you remember that? 
A.	No, not at all.  
Q.	Was there a period of time that your father was in prison or arrested?  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, because -- in fact, it's my mother who told me this, that at a point in time he was in prison because I believe she told me that he had drank and he was telling people that the president was going to die.  And suddenly people beat him up and the police took him to prison.  But I don't have any more details, because it's only of late.  But this -- this is what she had told me earlier, but... 
Q.	Was it Rose and Ngirumpatse themselves who came to pick you up the day after your father was killed? 
A.	Can you please repeat your question.  
Q.	Yes.  My question was:  Was it Rose and Mathieu Ngirumpatse themselves who came to collect you from a neighbour's apartment or a neighbour's home the day after your father was killed? 
A.	The day after my father was killed, it was Rose and my younger brother and my mother who came to fetch us from the neighbour's house.  We had gone to the neighbour's house after the death of 
my father because, in fact, when we were young, we played with the neighbours and -- 
Q.	Do you remember what type of vehicle they used when they came to pick you up that day? 
A.	No.  Because -- I don't remember because I had cried a great deal and I was still hearing bombs falling, so I wasn't really paying attention to what was happening.  I was happy to see my mother again and 
to see Rose again because she was someone I liked a great deal -- two women whom I love a great deal and I still love today.
Q.	But you drove in the vehicle from your home through Kigali to the Eden Garden restaurant, right, that morning?  Rose and your mother? 
A.	We didn't drive -- we did not leave our home.  We were in the home of our neighbour.  So we left that place with my mother, my younger brother and Rose and we went to Eden Garden.  
Q.	Yes.  But you drove from that location to Eden Garden; right?  I'm just confirming what you told us earlier.  
A.	Yes, yes.  Yes, indeed.  
Q.	Well, the person whose statement I handed up to you a few minutes ago gave us much of this information.  That Rose arrived in that Pajero to pick you up the next day.  She told us about other persons who were in your home when your father was killed.  

You know of a Mr. Kamanzi, Philippe and Gaspard?  You know those names?  
A.	Non -- I beg your pardon, no.  
Q.	There wasn't a friend of your fathers who had come by on the day that he was killed? 
A.	No, Counsel for the Prosecution.  No.  The only man was someone who came to tell my father that he was going to die, and then he later left.  But we were alone.
Q.	Well, I mean, those details really weren't -- aren't important for the issues we're dealing with in this trial.  I just mentioned them to you because I think there are witnesses who know more about the circumstances of your father's death than you do.  Because, according to the person whose statement is in front of you, your father didn't like -- excuse me.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse didn't like your father.  He didn't approve of his politics.  He had threatened him on a number of occasions.  On the day -- on the 5th of April -- this is coming from other witnesses.  Not all of this information is coming from the woman whose name is on that statement.  

You have an uncle, your father's brother, a Nyamushara.  Do you know that person? 
A.	No, I don't know that person.  
Q.	You've never heard that name before? 
A.	No, I have never heard that person before.  
MR. WEBSTER:
This is document number 3 in my bundle, which is available to us in both French and English.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	He claims that on the 5th of April, Mathieu Ngirumpatse berated your father and that he had advised his younger brother, your father, to run away and to leave home, which he didn't do.  And two days later he was killed.  
A.	I do not agree because, as far as I'm concerned, it's impossible because if my father didn't like Ngirumpatse or the other way around, they wouldn't send their children -- their children to them at the age of six years.  They would never send us to them.  They wouldn't send anyone.  Our father loved us a great deal, and, for him, we were very precious to him, so he wasn't going to send us to someone who was against him.  It's impossible.  

So I'm, therefore, sure, and I can confirm to you that what this person said is not right.  It's wrong.  
Q.	Well, what witnesses -- or, one witness, at least, seems to suggest is that the reason that you are alive and you're -- you have a -- a sister, Fifi? 
A.	A sister?  No.  When we were young, my brother was called Fifi.  I don't have a sister.  There are three of us.  There's Earvin Kayonga, Jupiter Kayonga -- before that he was known as Fifi.  We're only three, and I don't have a sister.  My father loved my mother a lot and I don't think that he could have cheated. Even if they've had -- if they had problems, he wouldn't have done anything wrong, and I'm sure of that.  
Q.	Well, the problem between Ngirumpatse and your father was not because he cheated or did any -- it was because of his politics because he was a member of the PL party.  And it was my mistake to identify Fifi as your sister.  You've now explained it to us that he's your brother.  

But one of the witnesses is suggesting that the reason that you and Fifi are alive is because of your relationship with Ngirumpatse through your mother, Monique, because usually soldiers and Interahamwe kill everybody in the house when they arrive.  They kill the political personality that they're looking for and then they kill that person's wife and children.  But you and your siblings survived, according to this witness, because they probably got -- the killers had gotten instructions not to harm you, just to harm your father.  

You've heard about the events on the 7th of April, certainly from reading about them as an adult, haven't you? 
A.	To answer your question regarding reading, I'm at the university and I'm not interested about what happened in Rwanda because that was in the past and it is very painful for me.  So I don't read books on Rwanda.  

The reason we are alive is because when they came to kill my father, they hit him with a bottle of beer.  He bled from the head.  And they asked him, "Do you want us to kill you or to kill your children?"  I started crying.  And, at one point, one of them held my brother's neck and said that if I don't -- I didn't stop crying, they would harm him.  And I was only six years old.  
Q.	Rose took you to the Eden Garden restaurant where you were able to be safe until you left Kigali on the 12th of April; right? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Did your mother stay with you -- Monique, at the Eden Garden restaurant between the 
8th and the 12th of April? 
A.	Yes.  She stayed with us and with my younger brother, Earvin.  
Q.	The other members of the Ngirumpatse household stayed at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  Did you know that back in April 1994? 
A.	Can you please repeat the question because I did not quite understand it.  
Q.	I'll ask the question in a different way.  Is there any reason why you and your brother were left at the Eden Garden restaurant while the rest of the Ngirumpatse family stayed at the Hôtel Diplomates where they were protected by soldiers?  Why was it that you, who was probably among the more vulnerable of the family, given your ethnicity, was left at the Eden Garden restaurant without protection; whereas, Ngirumpatse and the rest of his family stayed at the Hôtel Diplomates where they were protected? 
A.	Let me repeat, I -- I don't remember specifically when I was six.  So what happened when they left -- I don't know what happened later.  What I remember is that all of us -- or, rather, I was with my mother when my mother -- when my father had died, I was with my mother.  And we were always talking about how our father had been killed rather than what other people were doing.  

I remember that, after that, I fell asleep in my mother's arms which had a calming effect on me; so I was calm when she was there.  But I was not calm when I heard shells falling.  But I didn't know what happened to the other people who had left us there.

1015H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, when you were leaving Kigali on the 12th of April and you were in the vehicle with Ngirumpatse, did you notice roadblocks throughout the city of Kigali on your way from the city centre going out of the city towards Gitarama? 
A.	No, because I was lying on the -- I was lying on my mother's lap.  Therefore, I did not see roadblocks or any such thing.  I was -- at age six, I was so traumatised that I could not look at what was happening around.  My mother covered my eyes so that I shouldn't see what was happening so as to avoid me being even more shocked by what was happening. 
Q.	So in terms of the events of that week, from the 7th of April to the 12th of April 1994, the only thing you can really help us with in this trial is that you think Ngirumpatse is a nice man because he treated you and your brother well, and you insist that he travelled in the Pajero and not the Mercedes? 
A.	Yes.  I said that in the Pajero -- or, rather, I knew who were in the Pajero.  Do you want to do me -- do you want me to give you names of the people who were in that Pajero?  
Q.	No, I don't think that would be necessary.  And, again, you can't remember the vehicle that transported you from your home to Eden Garden on the 8th of April; right? 
A.	Do you want me to remind you when I left our neighbour's place, or -- 
Q.	Did Mr. Weyl explain to you the importance of which vehicle took you from Kigali to Gitarama on the 12th of April 1994? 
A.	I have a photograph which I attached to my statement.  I remember clearly that it was a Pajero, because as I told you earlier, we had already taken that car.  And when I was young, we knew the difference between a small car and a big car.  A Mercedes is smaller, whereas a Pajero is bigger.  So, according to the number of people who were in the Pajero -- people -- it's obvious that all of us could not have fitted in the Mercedes-Benz. 
Q.	I thank you for that, but my question to you was:  Did Mr. Weyl explain to you the importance of how you identify the vehicle that you travelled in on the 12th of April? 
A.	What do you mean when you use the word "importance"?  
Q.	Did he explain why that information would be significant for the defence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	He did not explain to me the reasons for that.  The subject here is that we want to know whether he was with us in the car or not.  But he did not tell me whether that was important or not.  

He does not need -- he did not need to tell me that, because I remember that the car was a Pajero.  So it's not up to a lawyer to tell me about what the significance was.  I am here to speak the truth, and the truth is that we were in a Pajero.  And what is important is my testimony before this Court, because I have come here to give evidence.  I have not come here to tell something which is not true. 
Q.	All right.  Well, I thank you for your efforts to assist us.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have no further questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Weyl, do you have any questions to put to this witness in redirect examination?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have only one question seeking clarification -- or, rather, two questions seeking clarification.
RE-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Ms. Isimbi, can you specifically remember, for how long were you at your neighbour's place after the 7th of April? 
A.	One day.  On the following day, some people came to get us. 
Q.	Can you remember specifically, how long did you spend at Eden Garden? 
A.	We left Eden Garden on the 12th. 
Q.	Do you know whether you had spent one, two or three days, that is, at Eden Garden?  To the best of your recollection, how long were you there for?  
A.	I think we were there for two days. 
Q.	Are you sure about that point? 
A.	Yes, because we left on the 12th.  My mother told me that on the phone. 
Q.	Thank you, Miss. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have no further questions for this witness.  And I would like to, first and foremost, thank the witness for her contribution.  And, Mr. President, you will not be surprised if I request you to allow Cynthia Isimbi to meet Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to rectify something in my statement.  I said that my younger brother was at the house with us, but he was not at -- with us.  He was at Ngirumpatse's house.  I am talking about Earvin Kayonga.  When my father died, he was not with us.  That day he was at Ngirumpatse's house because there had been an argument between our parents earlier. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
You're welcome. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That concludes your testimony before this trial, and we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You are now excused and you are free to go.  The registrar will make arrangements to grant the request made by counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much. 
(Witness excused) 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would like to inform the Trial Chamber that the next witness is pseudonym BRM.  He has informed WVSS that he also wishes to waive his anonymity, and he would like to testify using his real name. 
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the Chamber had made an order for your protection for security reasons, one element of which was that your identity would be concealed from the public.  Now, it has been drawn to our attention that you have provided information that that situation has changed and that those security measures are no longer necessary, and that you would like to testify openly.  What is your position, please?  Can you confirm your position to the Chamber.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct.  I confirm that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you ever given evidence before any other case in the ICTR?  
THE WITNESS:
You are asking me whether this is my first time to testify or whether it's the second time?  Because I didn't quite understand the question, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I want to find out whether you have testified in any other trial at the ICTR.  
THE WITNESS:
You mean the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this is your first time?  Is this your first time as a witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, this is my first time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you very much.  That allows us to revoke the order for protection that we made in your favour, and you will now be testifying in your own name as an unprotected witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before we begin your testimony, you will have to take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now assist you to do that.
(Declaration made by Eugène Clément Nahimana in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you, first of all, by 
	counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 

Mr. Weyl, it's almost 10:30, but maybe it might be better for you just to take his personal particulars and then we have the mid-morning recess.  Just put his name and his personal particulars on the record, then we can take the mid-morning recess.  
MR. WEYL:
That is what I was going to suggest to the Honourable Trial Chamber, Mr. President.
EUGÈNE CLÉMENT NAHIMANA, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to, first and foremost, remind you of procedural matters.  Since both of us are speaking in French, we have interpreters translating into English what we are saying.  Therefore, you have to speak at a moderate pace.  And then you observe a pause between my question and your answer, and I will try to do the same.  And try to spell all the proper names we come across for the first time. 

At this point I would like to request you to tell the Trial Chamber your names and also spell your names.  
A.	My name is Nahimana. 
Q.	Can you spell it, please.  
A.	N-A-H-I-M-A-N-A. 
Q.	What is your first name? 
A.	Eugène Clément. 
Q.	Date of birth? 
A.	6th of April 1962. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, before you you have a document which is titled "personal identification sheet of the witness".  Could you please look at it closely and confirm the information therein.  And if there are any mistakes, please correct them.  After that exercise, can you please write down "10th November 2010", and then sign that document.  
A.	I have done that.  It is correct. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Issa, kindly assist. 

Mr. President, I request the Trial Chamber to admit into evidence the PIS of Witness Nahimana as D. NG153. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG153 admitted) 
MR. WEYL:
And I agree with the Trial Chamber that we can take the break and resume my examination-in-chief after the tea break.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1034H to 1107H)
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, if I could make one comment before we get started with this witness.  There were a few documents that I used yesterday with the last witness which we didn't discuss because we ran out of time yesterday.  And I've discussed them with Mr. Weyl.  He is not in agreement with me, so it's going to take some argument before the Chamber to resolve the evidentiary issue for three documents that I used.  So if we could put some time aside to do that later on today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  We will do that. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I didn't quite understand what Mr. Webster was saying.  Maybe there was a translation problem.  However, we discussed with Mr. Webster and we agreed that we do not agree with admitting into evidence this document.  Maybe the Trial Chamber could rule on this point.  The only agreement between us was to agree to disagree. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
What Mr. Webster requested is that we set aside some time for it to be -- for you to make submissions before the Trial Chamber, and we will do it as soon as we have an available moment. 

You may continue your examination, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, we are going to start while keeping in mind the rules of the fact that we have to observe pauses and speak at a moderate pace, as well as spelling names.  Mr. Nahimana, can you please tell the Court, where were you born?  Where did you grow up? 
A.	As I said, my name is Eugène Clément Nahimana.  I was born in Birembo, the former 
	Giciye commune in the former Gisenyi préfecture.  I grew up in the former Butare préfecture in Gakoma, in Muyira and in Busoro.  My father worked for the Bugesera, Mayaga office.  So I was brought up mostly in the south, more specifically in Butare préfecture. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, can you briefly tell the Trial Chamber, what is your academic background?  And if you have any proper names, could you kindly spell them.  
A.	I did my primary studies in Mayaga, M-A-Y-A-G-A.  We were living in Busoro, which is spelled B-U-S-O-R-O.  This is where I started my primary school studies.  I completed my primary school studies in Cyangugu in Mururu.  Cyangugu is written C-Y-A-N-G-U-N-G-U (sic).  Mururu hill is written M-U-R-U-R-U.  Mururu.  

After that I studied for one year, that is, primary six, in Kora -- Kora is spelt K-O-R-A -- in 
Mutura commune.  Mutura is spelt M-U-T-A -- I beg your pardon -- T-U-R-A.  M-U--T-U-R-A.  This was in Gisenyi préfecture.  

Immediately after that I went to the Nyundo secondary school.  Nyundo is written N-Y-U-N-D-O.  I finished secondary school studies in 1982.  After that I went to the national teachers training college in Kinshasa.  I am sure all of you know how Kinshasa is written.  It is written K-I-N-S-H-A-N-S-A -- K-I-N-S-H-A-S-A.  I finished my higher studies at the national teachers training college in Kinshasa in 1988. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, thank you.  After completing your studies, did you start working?  And if so, can you tell the Trial Chamber, what was your occupation, briefly. 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  During my higher studies in Kinshasa, I was lucky in that I passed each and every year at the first attempt, and I applied for a leave job.  And every year I was employed by SONARWA, the national Rwandan insurance company, every year during my leave.  At the end of my studies, my dissertation was linked to my work at SONARWA.  In other words, I wrote a dissertation on school -- educational insurance in Rwanda.  So immediately after my higher studies, I was fortunate to be employed by SONARWA where I worked up to when I went to my specialisation studies in insurance in Brussels. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, so you were hired by SONARWA.  Can you tell us what were your duties when you joined SONARWA and who hired you in SONARWA.  
A.	I was recruited by the general management.  And the managing director at that time was 
	Joseph Sibomana, who had also studied in Kinshasa.  I decide (sic) my duties at SONARWA, firstly, as a reception -- or contact officer in the personal insurance department.  Two months later I was hired as -- at the management level looking at insurance dossiers, work accident, life insurance and group accident insurance. 

In September or October 1988, SONARWA underwent restructuring.  And during that restructuring exercise, I was lucky because I was appointed as the head of the personal insurance department in SONARWA.  I worked there from 1988 up to 1990 -- up to August 1990, because I arrived in Brussels on 27th of September 1990 in order to start my specialisation studies in relation to insurance management. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  During the period you describe between September 1988 and August 1990, did SONARWA have the same managing director, Sibomana? 
A.	No.  That is when I came to know Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I had heard his name.  I knew him by name, because he was one of the few known lawyers and jurists.  I know him -- I knew him by name.  But I saw him first at SONARWA.  And if I am not mistaken, he was appointed SONARWA's 
	director general at the end of August 1988 or beginning 1989 -- I don't remember the dates -- but I knew him when he was director general, I think about a year before I left for Brussels. 
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse take part in restructuring SONARWA, which you referred to earlier, which was something that occurred when you joined SONARWA? 
A.	When I -- I was hired.  And as you know, restructuring in any commercial company, especially in an insurance company which had a monopoly, restructuring is an ongoing exercise.  When I joined SONARWA, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not yet there.  And when he joined SONARWA, I have to say there were many things that changed because of his personality, his humanism, as well as his way of seeing things. 

Our society enjoyed a monopoly.  And I have to say that when he arrived there, he started eradicating corruption and corrupt exercises -- practices.  And then there was competition which was introduced reducing corruption.  And Mr. Ngirumpatse placed heavy emphasis when it came to getting rid of people who wanted to continue with their bad practices. 
Q.	Did the arrival of Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- was Mathieu Ngirumpatse's arrival characterised by movement of staff, hiring, transfer or sackings? 
A.	No.  From what I know, I was there for eight or nine months when Mr. Ngirumpatse was the 
	director general of SONARWA, we did not experience a significant movement of staff.  There were transfers which -- in a normal manner.  Things were changing in how we worked, but we did not experience any radical change. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, in the discharge of his duties as you noticed at SONARWA, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse take into consideration political affiliations of staff members in order to grant some groups favours or to punish some people, or when it came to recruitment and transfers? 
A.	The short time during which I was at SONARWA with Mr. Ngirumpatse, with regard to that, I have to say that when multiparty politics was introduced in Rwanda, at SONARWA -- and thanks a lot for that -- political leanings were not visible.  And the leadership, be it the director general or heads of departments or section heads, during working hours, and even after working hours, we were wary of political leanings, because we were a commercial company and our ethics -- ethical guidelines -- that we were not to work -- we were not supposed to work on the basis of political leanings.  So we didn't have that tendency there.  The ethical practice of a commercial company automatically excludes such biases -- such bias. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, I wanted to ask you if Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse took into account ethnicity of 
	staff members when he hired people or granted privileges to people?  Did he take into consideration ethnicity? 
A.	Counsel, once again I have to say that knowing the intelligence and humanism of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, particularly in those delicate times, Mr. Ngirumpatse did not act in that manner.  Contrary -- and maybe we will get there.  But Mathieu Ngirumpatse did everything possible to see to it that multiparty politics is a gain but based on consensus, but that was not taken into consideration at SONARWA.  

	I don't know whether we'll get there.  I don't know if I am going beyond the scope of the question, but the national Rwandan insurance company, SONARWA, was lucky to have a total diversity reflecting the Rwandan nation.  We had Twas, who were pygmies.  We had Tutsis, who were the majority, I daresay.  SONARWA was a commercial company.  More than 60 per cent of the staff were Tutsi, and the remaining staff members belonged to other groups.  So he did not take into account ethnicity or political leanings of staff members into account. 
Q.	When you say that Tutsis made up 60 per cent of personnel at SONARWA, was there a quota policy in recruitment and in the management of staff members? 
A.	No.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse came there in 1989.  I went -- joined before that.  That was the composition of the staffing of SONARWA.  SONARWA had existed for 20 years.  Maybe that question can be answered by the former or previous directors general.  But I have to tell you that at SONARWA, commercial common sense was placed ahead of anything else.  I don't know how recruitment was carried out, but there was never a problem regarding those aspects of ethnicity and politics during the one and a half years I spent there.  At that time I did not hear anything to the effect that there was a 
	quota system or a special quota recruitment system; no. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, we will get back to how you came to know Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse in the early years.  But from what you knew of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, up to when you left SONARWA, would you say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was actually motivated by his hatred of Tutsis? 
A.	That question does not at all match with how Mathieu Ngirumpatse lived.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was very loyal, exceptionally loyal towards all ethnic groups.  And knowing Mathieu Ngirumpatse when he was at the president's office, I didn't know him personally at that time, but I know that he was well appreciated by people who met him.  

I knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse when he came to SONARWA.  I knew him by name.  But be it in Butare, Byumba or elsewhere, people knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse as a loyal jurist, and someone who was loyal and who respected each and every individual. 

And I can confirm that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, when he was at SONARWA, was a dignified leader who was respected by members of all ethnic groups.  He had a national reputation, and, therefore, no member of any ethnic group could have associated him with any extremist group who could have placed into question his loyalty or even his commitment to multiparty political system. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  Can you please tell this Trial Chamber what were your -- what was your occupation after leaving SONARWA in the summer of 1989.  
A.	When I arrived in Brussels -- I went there to study my specialisation course in insurance.  I was given a scholarship by the European Union.  The study was supported by the European Union because it was felt that SONARWA had to work in a competitive climate.  SONARWA had not yet prepared itself because SONARWA had enjoyed a monopoly for 20 years, so when I left there were already two other insurance companies.  I think there was Ingoboka insurance company, which was under the 
	ABB group, which was a Belgian insurance group, and then there was the SORAS.  SORAS was a significant competitor.  

So the former director general, Joseph Sibomana, had requested that scholarship for that training so that we could prepare ourselves properly to face competition.  We were still a strong company in terms of insurance, but we felt the competition. 

You know that a company which has worked for a long time in a monopoly at times have problems adapting to competition.  It was in that context that I went for my specialisation studies.  

And let me correct.  I arrived there on the 27th of September 1990 in Brussels, and I started my course either on the 2nd or 3rd of October at -- I started my specialisation course, and I did my 
practical courses at a company in Brussels.  

And I have to say that when I got there -- the 1st of October came just a couple of days before I started the course, and the Rwandan community in Belgium was somehow surprised by the 1990, 
1st of October, aggression by RPF forces coming from Uganda.  And there was a great deal of concern and disquiet in the student community in Belgium.  

There was an MRND section, but it was a section which operated as any of the other sections of political parties in Brussels.  And given the events of the 1st of October and given the fact that as a student I had much more time than any of the other students -- I was an intern -- the Belgian MRND section asked me if I could be of assistance to it.  I immediately said yes because we were not expecting the war in Rwanda.  We were expecting the arrival of multipartyism and political pluralism.  But we were surprised by this war.  And so the whole Rwandan community in Rwanda came together up until the end of 1993.  All ethnic group students came together to see how we could accompany our older brothers who were in Arusha and were facing the negotiations.  

But since I was more or less available -- in other words, after my studies I could go to undertake practical courses in an insurance company.  But that was not obligatory.  I needed to complete my courses, and this was always after 1400 hours, and from 1400 to 1800 hours I was free.  So this is why I was so able to go and do these activities more than other students who were much more busier than I was. 

So I agreed to assist and support the community of -- the student community in Rwanda, CAB, in Belgium.  And furthermore, since I was a member of the MRND, I gave a helping hand to the section.  And this was until the end of 1993 -- or should I said the end of 1992.  I no longer recall. 

But the MRND Belgian section asked the presidency of the MRND in Kigali -- the section had enjoyed my assistance for about two years, so it requested the presidency of the MRND in Belgium whether I could be accredited to Brussels as a press attaché of the MRND.  And this was for a simple reason, since there was a lot of lobbying being done, a machinery of information of the RPF in Brussels, and every time we needed to attend a press conference, it was necessary to present a press identity card or an accreditation card, otherwise one wouldn't be allowed to attend press conferences.  So the section met and the MRND presidency -- well, they suggested my name, not because it was me, but it's because I had more time available to me.  And that is how we were lucky -- I was lucky to be appointed as a press attaché of the MRND in Brussels. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  Could you please explain to the Chamber why at that time it was necessary for the MRND to have a press attaché in Brussels over and above the mere fact of accreditation.  
A.	For Rwandans who are here, maybe they would be able to easily understand this, but for the other nationals, maybe those who were keeping abreast of the news would recall that period of time, let me say -- and I do admit that communication and information were a solid basis or foundation for the RPF -- the Rwandan authorities were concerned about peace and national unity.  They were preoccupied by the aggression or invasion which had always been understood as an internal civil war; whereas, Rwanda was formally and officially attacked with everything that can be demonstrated, be it the press, be it some organisations which should have stood against that invasion.  Nothing was done in that respect. 

The Rwandan community in Belgium was so much attacked by the press, and the Rwandan community within the country was also attacked by the international press.  And we who were outside of the country, we felt doubly attacked.  Our country is being attacked from the outside.  Everything is known.  And this was proven later on.  And by the way, that's not the subject at hand, but the 
Rwandan community in Belgium and the students, who were people of note and were considered, were not set aside as such.  

We didn't have any representation at the level of the press.  So everything which was being said in press conferences -- we realised that in the print media, the newspapers that we needed to buy -- that we had to buy, we were unable to contradict the information provided by the RPF communication and information machinery.  We realised and felt that we needed to have someone who had proven himself and who could be employed, as it were, on a part-time basis, because I was a student, but to have a well-orchestrated and managed campaign.  

And it is for this reason that the section insisted that we have a press attaché who would have access to these conferences -- these press conferences to try and ensure -- and I am saying try because it was not easy -- to try and give another version which was contrary to the version proffered by the RPF who had attacked Rwanda and which had its headquarters in Brussels. 

So the motivation for the existence of that function or position came from all that I have said. 
Q.	What about your relationship as an MRND attaché -- a press attaché with the Belgian media? 
A.	Before I answer this question, I wish to specify that my function as a press attaché in Brussels was on a voluntary basis.  I wasn't receiving a salary.  And, furthermore, it was not within the national organisational chart of the MRND at national level.  It was only the MRND section in Brussels, which given the pressure that was being exerted by the press in Brussels or Belgium, the section of the MRND in Belgium exceptionally requested that this accreditation be made possible so that we could have this card and I can -- I could participate and attend press conferences. 

But now let's go back to your question.  As a press attaché, even before the accreditation was obtained, I told you that the section had asked for ideas and for assistance so that we could give another contrary view to the massive press and information machinery of the RPF, which was tarnishing the image of Rwanda.  Rwanda, which was a country which had been well considered in the 1980s until the end of 1989 -- I think we now have Internet -- but Rwanda was very well considered at international levels.  And in the framework of development cooperation, Rwanda was well appreciated.  But with this destructive machinery of the RPF in information and communication, Rwanda's name and image was quickly tarnished.  And in order to counter this, I had formed very, very good relations with some representatives of the Belgian press and even the international press. 

In particular, I had a friend -- I can say that this person was my friend, André Rubens.  Rubens is spelt R-U-B-E-N-S.  André Rubens.  And he was working with the Belga agency.  As soon as we contacted the Belga agency, one would have access to almost 70 per cent of the world press.  It was like AFP in France.  So it was a press agency or news agency.  And with this relationship I would be able to know that there was a press conference on such-and-such, where and when.  But the problem is that I still didn't have an accreditation card.  I didn't have the accreditation, so one couldn't just enter a 
press conference like that. 

I am saying this because this is what encouraged the MRND section to make this request.  But we did manage to provide information to journalists which was not taken into account 100 per cent, but at least we managed to balance the information that was coming out on Rwanda. 

So we had relationships with the Belgian media, and this happened wonderfully until the end of 1993.  

At the end of 1993, we began to realise that there was a situation where positions were taken.  I am regretting having to say this, but there was a biased press.  This was towards the end of 1999, as I have said -- 1993, I beg your pardon.

1145H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
With regard to the press policy in Belgium -- I think this was written; I'm not the only one to say it.  But the political parties which were friendly -- I know that in politics there are no friendly relations, it's only policy that matters.  But given those who were supporting late President Habyarimana, and especially those who were supporting the democratic process which had been engaged by the MRND, I believe -- and I'm thinking now at -- the Christian democratic party in Belgium.  These were parties which were acceptable and with whom we could associate.  

But there was the socialist side, especially the liberals, who -- who were against, I would say, any position taken politically by the MRND.  So, in that regard, our relationships were not good.  It was an internal political situation in Belgium.  But the liberals didn't want anything to do with Habyarimana, they didn't want to have democratisation which would be established by the MRND.  And the socialists didn't go this far, but we know that the socialist minister was the first to refuse to deliver weapons.  And this was at the time when Rwanda was being attacked.  

So, this is one way of saying to you that, on the one hand, we had good friends, but, on the other hand, we also felt that something was brewing.  But we didn't know what was in fact being planned, but we realised that Belgium was divided.  We could feel this.  

But, since the MRND had strong people who were -- had on its side strong parties in -- on its side, and with all due respect the royal palace continued to support the pluralist political commitments in Rwanda, and with the strong parties on our side, we believed that we had friends, as MRND.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, you have used a term which we would like you to explain further because we're not sure whether it was properly rendered in the transcripts.  You said that at the end of 1993 you had a press which was quite biased.  You said that you were regretting having to say that.  What did you mean by a biased press?  
A.	I know that this is a sensitive issue.  To allow one's self to criticise the press, I know what that can lead to.  But here I have taken a solemn declaration, and I need to say what I experienced and what I saw.  

In the preparation of the aggression against Rwanda, the RPF had come to understand what we were experiencing now.  One cannot live without communication and without having new and fresh information coming in.  They were well briefed and advised, because the infernal communication machinery of the RPF -- I'm using that term for it, but it was impeccable.  In other words, the RPF was able to make lies be accepted as the truth.  

And what was of surprise to us is that even journalists -- newspapers such as Le Soir, La Nouvelle Belgique (sic), and other newspapers which were well understood, or well known, they adopted the RPF situation overnight.  And in less than a month, everything had been turned upside down.  Intellectually, this was very troubling for us to change suddenly.  And to demonise the person that you had previously lauded, that was -- well, we were saying that this could happen in Africa, but in a developed country, this was something quite incredible.  

So, there were some Flemish journalists -- and, in fact, they exist up to now, and they were the only ones who were trying to talk the real truth.  Apart from publications of Paul Dononue (sic), everybody dropped their hands.  They gave up.  Although this did not have the same scope, we felt that the RPF lobby was still behind the press, strongly behind the press.  

So, to be brief, some newspapers, especially the Belgian newspapers -- Belgian, British newspapers -- let me limit myself there in order not to mention everyone -- they took positions in favour and strongly for the RPF.  
Q.	According to you, did they report accurately on the situation that was prevailing in Rwanda?  
A.	Not at all.  In fact, this was what was of disturbance to the whole Rwandan community in Belgium.  Even those who were not pro-Habyarimana or pro-MRND or the power -- powers that be in Kigali, they were wondering how a country which had been taken as a model was now being demonised.  They were taken -- taking positions quite ostensibly, and they were strong about their stand that they had taken.  
Q.	These relationships that you had with the press, were they the same after the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	After April 1994, nothing changed.  To the contrary, I had told you a few minutes ago that we realised the change, which was sudden and biased in the press at the end of 1993.  And from 1993, and more particularly after the 6th of April, the manipulation and misinformation continued.  And we realised that there was some profession -- some form of professionalism behind this.  

Each time that the Rwandan community was faced by events -- there was the aggression or the invasion of the country on the 1st of October 1990 -- the country is demonised, whereas it had been a model country previously.  Despite the poverty in Rwanda, it was nonetheless a country -- and I'm asking for some five minutes for you to go to the United Nations or the UNDP site, all these international organisation sites.  Before 1990 -- before 1988, Rwanda was a model country.  

But having the same thing after the 6th of April 1994 happens, instead of deploring what had happened, regretting what had happened, regretting the fact that this aircraft had two heads of state -- they began to even refer to it as an accident that the aeroplane crashed.  But no one -- among all these journalists, no one among them wanted to say that this aircraft had been shot at.  
So the ill will was there, and as I will admit, and you will admit with me, communication and information had become essential elements, or even crucial elements in the West.  But here in Africa, information was not yet considered as an important aspect, especially in the preparation of political pluralism in our countries.  

So there you are.  Our relationships, let me come back to that, at the end -- 
MS. WILSON: 
Excuse me.  Mr. President, I was just wondering about the relevance of the evidence that we've been hearing.  I wonder if maybe Mr. Weyl could enlighten us.  Because so far I haven't seen the recent line of questioning very relevant, or relevant at all, to the proceedings before the Court.  
MR. WEYL:
If the Prosecution had not made us used to making press cuttings of articles of the Figaro reports from press conferences of Mr. Ruzibiza, or a press conference and words attributed, rightly or wrongly so, to Mathieu Ngirumpatse in Nairobi, that question would not arise.  

The issue of information or disinformation -- or misinformation, I think that this is at the very heart of the evidence of the Prosecutor which he's using against Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Whether it's from The Washington Post or other newspapers, these are reports that are used against him.  And we are trying to demonstrate how this misinformation was established.  I think the testimony of the witness is pertinent and goes directly to refute the evidence adduced by the Prosecution thus far, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We permit you to continue, Mr. Weyl.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are talking about lobbying carried out by the RPF.  Can you give us some examples of that lobbying as you noticed it, particularly after the 6th of April 1994.  
A.	You asked me whether our relationship had continued without change.  First I will address that and then talk about the lobbying after that.  

Journalists who could understand us and who could get through our message from our point of view continued being our journalists.  But, in the media in general, everything had changed.  That's why I saying -- I'm saying that there was professionalism behind all that, because we had never seen such a well-orchestrated and prepared campaign as that one against Rwanda.  

Now, concerning lobbying:  Firstly, the first lobbying -- regarding the first lobbying exercise, I can say that in view of the relationship between Rwanda and Belgium which had always -- always been a good relationship, the RPF decided to set up a main office in Brussels.  What we call the head office.  So, it was in Brussels, in the centre of Europe, next to all European organisations based in Brussels.  That is something that we could not feel when we were at the roi Baudouin when things were still working normally.  

Secondly, all the French-language media in Belgium, after the 6th of April, could never, ever talk about the goodwill or the overtures made by President Habyarimana or MRND in respect of political pluralism.  Every one of them was against MRND, Habyarimana, and against people who said, "They tried their best but they did not achieve everything."  So everything coming out of the media was negative.  

The other lobbying exercise which I find to be quite problematic, and bothers even the Belgian government, is that the government of Rwanda was attacked.  A Belgian federal minister called Mr. Guy Com, G-U-Y, and second name is C-O-M, Com, refused to deliver weapons to Rwanda for which Rwanda had already paid.  Belgium was a friendly country, Belgium had been our coloniser.  Rwanda was attacked and the country which was supposed to deliver weapons to and for Rwanda did not do so.  

And there was a relationship between RPF and the social -- French-speaking socialist party in Belgium.  

I can give other examples, because there are other examples.  I lodged a complaint against Ms. Colette Braeckman, and up to now no hearing has taken place.  I don't know why.  I have been told that I have to wait for her -- I have to wait for her to go into retirement before the hearing starts.  I complained because she dared write things which I don't even dare talk about here.  He (sic) described MRND Melgians (sic) -- Belgian -- he talked about MRND members in Belgium as collaborators, the children.  So this shows that the RPF's lobbying was very advanced, and they certainly used resources and means which they are still using, even now.  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, two questions regarding this problem.  The announcement or communications which you can describe as press release, were they published in the media, in the print media?  
A.	No, no.  I told you that my accreditation arrived around the beginning of 1993.  The RPF lobbying and assault had already started, so much so that our press releases were published in the Flemish-speaking media.  The French-speaking media rarely published our communiqués.  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, thank you.  When you or an MRND representative spoke publicly, were your words faithfully reported by the media?  
A.	There was a section of the media -- unfortunately, I live in Belgium.  You have a Flemish part of Belgium.  Whenever there's an MRND -- there was an MRND leader coming to Belgium, when French-speaking journalists accepted invitations, they would come to meet the leaders but they did not report -- they did not report faithfully what our leaders had said.  On the other hand, the Flemish-speaking media and television stations reported faithfully and in their integrity what our leaders were saying.  

I have an anecdote.  I have to say that for the last five months there's -- they've not been able to form a government in Belgium because of the difference between the Flemish- and the French-speaking parts of Belgium.  
Q.	Thank you for that information, Mr. Nahimana.  Now let us look at more technical aspects.  

When you were a press attache, did you receive instructions to draw up a communiqué or to contact people you dealt with?  
A.	Once again, I have to say that the MRND section in Belgium was not in the organisational structural chart of the MRND, as such, in that it was not official.  It was a section to support MRND by MRND supporters in Belgium.  So in press releases, what we did, we would consult and agree with the MRND section in Belgium, that is, the chairman and the secretary general, as well as the press attaché.  So we would consult one another.  And whenever there was an emergency we would speak over the phone to one another.  The chairman could make a proposal, and the secretary general or someone from the committee could call me or send me -- and send me a proposal.  And when a draft proposal was ready, we would sign what was agreed on and then release it as a communiqué.  But we did not await orders from Kigali.  We had contacts with the -- Rwanda, but we did not seek the authorisation for us to make press releases.  
Q.	Before publishing a press release, did you need to have the press release endorsed by other authorities or leaders? 
A.	I could not publish -- I could not publish a press release without the approval of the chairman of the MRND section in Belgium, or without it being read by the secretary general of the section in Belgium.  At times we had to act fast.  However, I should have had at least an approval over the phone from either the chairman or the secretary general of the MRND section in Belgium.  This is how we organised ourselves, and this procedure was complied with until -- up to the time when we stopped our activities.  
Q.	So, did the press releases have to be approved by the national MRND authorities in Rwanda?  
A.	No.  We worked logically, we respected the MRND statutes, we respected everything -- all the procedures, we could not have gone against our superiors.  However, the MRND section in Belgium was more or less autonomous, and we only reported to the superior authorities in Kigali when we deemed it necessary.  We did not have to wait instructions from Kigali.  Ours was a support committee.  

And I have to say that up till March 1994, we were the only party in Brussels that was able to expand diversity.  There were no representatives from the Twa ethnic group in Belgium at that time.  Now you have them in Belgium, but before you didn't have them.  In Belgium, our section had a diversity.  We had Tutsis, we had Hutus, reflecting the Rwandan population.  But at the time we did not have Twas in Belgium.  We were lucky in that we worked with the two communities without any problems.  And this was something that was really -- that really could have inspired people back in our country.  And I can say that was the case, also, in Rwanda.  Because MRND was the only party in Rwanda which had members of all ethnic groups.  

I don't know if this is the right forum, but I have to appreciate Mr. Ngirumpatse's attitude.  Because he did everything possible to maintain that unity and diversity within MRND.  It was a party which could say, "Look, we have members from all groups."  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  Maybe you could now tell the Trial Chamber, what were your sources of information, where did you get information which you used in your press releases?  
A.	Thank you.  That is a relevant question.  This is the third time that it's being put to me.  Actually, I was asked this question, even before the Belgian senatorial committee.  

I am saying that I was lucky in that up to now I have still retained my friends; I have still kept my friends.  I have been in Belgium for about 20 years, and my friends I met when I got there, and those who are still alive, I still see them, I still visit them.  As a press attache, I was able to open doors.  

I have to admit here that, as an African, I used family relationships.  This means that at times I had more information which I could use to counter the RPF media machinery.  I opened doors.  I was able to win over many friends in Belgium.  And that has served me, and continues to serve me, even right now.  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, maybe you could tell the Trial Chamber -- you could enlighten the Trial Chamber regarding what you referred to as "family relationships" which facilitated your gathering information, important information.  Maybe you could tell the Chamber what you mean by that.  
A.	You see, I had a file consisting of 700 pages, and I have to say that I have not been able to read the entire document.  

When I went to Belgium I came to know a niece of President Habyarimana.  In 1992, I married his niece.  In other words, I'm his nephew-in-law, nephew through marriage.  In the West this is not important at all.  But in Africa such a thing has much considerable connotation in that I can -- I can easily have information or send a fax to such-and-such a person.  

But, apart from that relationship, I don't have anything to add.  We humbly lived through this relationship, and it helped me a lot.  But apart from that, I didn't really have any problems with that relationship.  This is how it worked.  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, thank you.  Could you clarify -- could we make a clarification regarding the period following the Arusha agreement.  That is the period when Rwanda was trying to set up institutions.  Was MRND against the Arusha Accords?  
A.	There were many misunderstandings, and there was mischaracterisation to the effect that MRND was against the Arusha Accords.  Now, to start with, our section -- I'm sure you've seen this in your documentation.  You've seen our communiqués, what we wrote, and our proposals.  To start with, our MRND section in Belgium, we always supported the Arusha Accords, and even sent a small -- we sent a small contribution to MRND's representative who was in Arusha.  And we were thanked and congratulated in that regard.  

Now, talking about MRND which I knew when I was in Rwanda and which I knew when I was in Belgium, MRND has always supported the Arusha Accords.  I know that even -- MRND even made a lot of concession so that we could have an agreement.  MRND was a party of peace, but a party of unit -- of unity, a party seeking the overture of our country.  

So the former president's party did not intend to block the Arusha Accords.  The party wanted to do everything to facilitate the accords.  I think this is actually what made Mr. Ngirumpatse to accept the leadership of the party.  Because, knowing Mr. Ngirumpatse, I can say that he's someone who could have led MRND up to the elections.  There are some people who have claimed that he wanted to be the leader of the party so that one day he could be the -- our country's president.  

I did not meet many times Mr. Ngirumpatse at that time, but on the few occasions that we met I can tell you that he said that, regardless of the contents, after the Arusha Accords we have to lead Rwanda towards a process of democratisation.  And that he -- and I'm saying this in his presence; I've seen him here.  He was not -- he did not have any other objective.  He would have preferred working as a lawyer, which was his profession.  He was somebody -- you know he's a -- he's a poet and an historian.  He had a choir group in Kigali.  He had a choir; he was dedicated to it.  Always -- people remember that choir.  He was someone who worked in associations.  

He is somebody -- I believe that if your Honourable Tribunal and Trial Chamber could release him, because he is a victim, I am sure that he would go and establish children's associations, because he had a major intention of looking after abandoned children; children born out of wedlock and who had been abandoned.  And given the situation in Kigali, he wanted to look after those children.  

He was not someone working for his personal interests.  He was somebody who wanted dialogue -- a dialogue -- a dialogue of ideas.  And he believed in that because he had lived in the West.  And in view of the fact that the United Nations and some Western -- Western countries were supporting the democratisation process, he believed in it.  And since he had lived in Germany, Belgium, and other places as a diplomat, he supported that process.  
In short, whether it was the national committee or the various party sections across the world, MRND supported and continued to support up to the very end the Arusha Accords.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I think that I still have 15 -- or 15 minutes -- around 15 minutes.  And looking at the clock I was wondering whether the Trial Chamber would allow me to continue, or whether I should wind up my examination-in-chief after the lunch break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take the luncheon recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1230H)

(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MR. WEYL: 
I thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, good afternoon.  
MR. WEYL: 
Good afternoon also to everyone in this courtroom. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Counsel. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, you were in Brussels in May (sic) 1992? 
A.	Yes, I was in Brussels. 
Q.	Did you ever have the opportunity of becoming aware of a meeting which was held in Brussels in early June 1992 and which would be relevant to our case? 
A.	Right here and now I do not remember any such meetings. 
Q.	Did you become aware of a communiqué co-signed by the RPF and the parties involved in what was referred to as democratic forces of change? 
A.	Yes.  That rings a bell.  I remember.  We followed all that over the radio.  It would appear that that initiative was taken by three parties amongst the five parties recognised in Rwanda.  There were three political parties which were invited to Brussels.  

But I think even at the national level the event was not well seen, because out of five political parties, three sort of sneaked out and went to negotiate with the RP -- RPF without the knowledge of the others.  I believe -- I remember that this was not well seen even within those parties. 
Q.	Are you aware of the purpose of that communiqué, and are you also aware of the -- the outcome of that communiqué? 
A.	I do not remember much about that communiqué.  But I know that it created some political tension inside the country.  I learnt of all this over the radio.  

But I know that Mr. Twagiramungu apparently confirmed that he was going to become prime minister as, moreover, he continued to insist and to negotiate so that he would be the only one designated in the Arusha Accords as prime minister.  I know that this political move was not well seen.  

But we all know that these people were working in connivance with the RPF.  In fact, considering the good manners, quote/unquote, of the RPF in preparing the Arusha Accords and also in preparing, quote/unquote, the couacs, if the RPF had not been involved, they would not have agreed that any name be included in the Arusha Accords.  
In fact -- I remember this now -- I believe there were other people who said that -- or, rather, in Rwanda it was said that those who had signed an agreement with the RPF did not have the right to return to Rwanda.  But these are hearsays (sic).  I did not see any document -- official document.  But it was clear that even the signatories had to regret what they did. 
Q.	Do you remember any event which occurred after the signing of the communiqué and who involved the RPF -- or the communiqué which involved the RPF? 
A.	As you know, the RPF was always involved in manoeuvres to divert attention.  

But, in fact, I do not remember clearly.  Perhaps, if you could jog my memory I -- that would assist. 
Q.	Do you think that through that communiqué the RPF was preparing peace? 
A.	The RPF never prepared peace.  The RPF passed for a political party, a so-called political party.  But as a matter of fact, it was a military front.  It gave the impression that it was -- it was a political party.  But it was, in fact, a -- a -- war machinery.  

I do not think that the RPF ever envisaged a peaceful path to power in Rwanda, especially after the minor attempt in the buffer zone where they tried to organise elections.  The defeat -- their defeat was resounding.  And, therefore, they shunned any election. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  Mr. Nahimana, I would now like to know whether after the contacts you had with Mathieu Ngirumpatse at SONARWA you had the opportunity of meeting him again either in Brussels or in Rwanda.  Can you tell the Court in what circumstances, if at all, you met him.  
A.	In Rwanda it was at SONARWA in -- for reasons of work.  But in Brussels he didn't have much time.  However, I was able to meet him.  I was able to have some time to talk with him.  

But at SONARWA it was in the context of work that we met.  I did not know him in my private life.  He was not part of my generation.  He -- he's as old as my father.  I used to see him but just to say 
good morning, just to greet him.  When I returned from holiday or when I was leaving, I would go and say farewell or go and bid him goodbye.  

In Kigali I did not have the opportunity of meeting him for a long time.  But in Brussels, yes.  Moreover, I met him twice in Brussels.  I think we met twice.  

In fact, I will take this opportunity to make this point that it was during our first meeting when Ngirumpatse told me that he had been approached by the MDR party and the PSD party, the PL party.  Given his notoriety in the country, given the fact that he was well known in the country, these opposition political parties -- and what kind of opposition -- sometimes they were in the opposition, and at other times they were in government.  

But I remember Ngirumpatse told me that these parties had contacted him telling him, quote/unquote, dear brother-in-law -- they used the word "brother-in-law".  They used -- they went through his wife to ask him to come back to their party or to come to their party.  

And I know that Ngirumpatse was -- was a convinced democrat.  And he preferred to remain in the MRND where he could have all ethnic groups, all political views, and, in particular, remain in a major party through which he could channel his ideas of democracy.  So he preferred to remain in a major political party in an attempt to see -- in fact, to instil in the Rwandan culture a democratic culture that he had experienced in the West.  

But I think that the MDR as far as Mathieu was concerned -- he didn't give me all the details, but knowing him very well -- Mathieu said -- well, the MDR tended to be more a power wing -- PARMEHUTU.  And Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not one of those who wanted to be pulling -- to pull strings, ethnic strings.  

The PL party was -- or contacted him so that Mathieu could help him (sic) in business matters, in trade matters.  And again, this was not part of his -- his interest.  

The PL (sic) was too much to the south.  

So Mathieu preferred to remain in a party -- a major party with several ideas through which he could channel his ideas.  He was somebody imbued with a sense of humanism, and he wanted to protect Rwandans from extremists, wherever they came from.  

Obviously, he was against the war, like every other person was.  Everyone was against the war.  But he gave priority to -- to what I will call a spirit of consensus.  He had a conciliatory and reconciling spirit.  In fact, he believed in reconciliation.  

So on our first meeting in Brussels, he was able to convince, to persuade, many people.  And I must tell you that whenever Mathieu was in Brussels even members of other opposition political parties would attend our conferences or meetings because they thought they were dealing with somebody who was above the fray. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  During those trips or meetings in Brussels, did you have the opportunity of hearing any speech made by Mathieu or any utterances that he may have made during a meeting? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, of course. 
Q.	On any one of those occasions, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse make utterances which signified or reflected some inclination to incite discrimination? 
A.	Since this morning I told you that that is not something that could be associated with Mathieu.  He couldn't do such a thing.  

If you would allow me -- but, nevertheless, I should tell you that you have Mathieu Ngirumpatse here.  You have Édouard Karemera here as well.  I must tell you that they are hostages.  Under the law and proper justice, you have here two hostages who can even help us to attain national reconciliation.  

If they are released -- I say so, and I weigh my words -- if these gentlemen were released, were acquitted, in the worst-case scenario, if the UN could protect them and send them to Rwanda, you will have the outcome of all they stood for, the outcome of all they fought for.  They are people who wanted to prepare Rwandans to engage in multiparty politics.  But they were taken hostage.  I do not know how to put it.  

But what I would say is that these people are individuals who can continue sensitising Rwandans to the need to reconcile.  I -- that is my belief.  And I think it is still possible to reconcile Rwandans.  I think that even the final goal, the final objective of this Tribunal is the reconciliation of Rwandans.  

These two gentlemen here are hostages.  You, the United Nations Tribunal, it is within your powers to acquit them, protect them, and send them back to Rwanda so that they can continue their mission, the mission of preparing Rwandans to engage in multiparty politics in a spirit of national and sincere candid reconciliation.  That was Mathieu's spirit.  

I would not even say, well, that it was the same thing for his colleague.  I'm not his witness.  But from the little I know for Karemera, Karemera -- Karemera is a similar person to Ngirumpatse in their attitude of preparing Rwandans for multiparty politics in a spirit of mutual respect.  

We would never hear Mathieu inciting people to hatred.  He's imbued with a sense of humanity which was appreciated.  

I do not know whether you are aware that he is the first poet who wrote a poem on 
Monsignor Aroz (sic) Mu -- Mumwami (sic).  That poem already shows you his spirit, the spirit that inhabited Mathieu Ngirumpatse for a long time.  

He is not someone who thought -- or who was ethnic oriented.  No.  He didn't think on ethnic bases.  

He's somebody who wanted to bring Rwandans together and prepare them for the exercise of multiparty politics.  This is what he did even when he was a diplomat.  He believed in what he did. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, I thank you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have no other question for this witness.  And I would like to thank the witness for the evidence he has been able to give in the service of the truth.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Sow, do you have any questions of this witness?  
MR. SOW: 
No, Mr. President.  I have no questions for this witness.  

	However, Mr. President, before we adjourn, I would like us to talk about some housekeeping matters for next week.  I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you are now going to have to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor.  And you'll have to respond to questions put to you by the Prosecution. 
MS. WILSON:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Defence team, members of the public.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	I will now ask a few questions just to clarify certain issues which were raised in your direct evidence.  

Now, you said you worked at SONARWA and you left for Brussels on the 27th of September 1990; is that correct?  I have -- I put two propositions to you.  Maybe I'll take it one at a time.  

So you had been working at SONARWA.  Yes?  
A.	Yes.  Indeed I worked at SONARWA. 
Q.	And when you worked there full-time, it was between 1988 and 1999 -- 1990.  Sorry.  Do you agree? 
A.	I do not know what you are seeking to know from me.  But so far you are right, right up to the end of August, August 1990.  Yes. 
Q.	As I said, just simple clarifications.  Yes.  

And you said in your evidence that you left for Brussels on the 27th of September 1990, did you not?  
A.	I have already testified in several cases.  And it is the first time that I am receiving -- or being questioned so many times on dates.  But these are dates that I cannot forget.  
So I arrived in Brussels on the 27th of September 1990.  So I left Kigali on the 26th of September.  Oh, what am I saying?  Yes.  The 26th of September 1990.  And I arrived in Brussels on the 
27th of September 1990. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, please understand, I simply want short responses.  You don't have to wonder why am I asking the question.  If you don't understand it, then you -- you can ask me.  Is that okay?  

Now, from your evidence, after leaving for Brussels in 1990, did you ever return to Rwanda?  
A.	During my academic life, I have always had the luck or good fortune of succeeding in my exams the first time around.  And on the first opportunity I always went forward into the next stage -- 
Q.	Sorry.  
A.	So up until 1994 --
Q.	Sorry.  Mr. Witness, please, I'm asking a particular question.  All I want is your response to that.  

After leaving for Brussels and arriving there on the 27th of September 1990, did you ever return to Rwanda?  That -- that's a simple question. 
A.	Yes.  It's a simple question, but I don't have to answer yes or no.  

But I was saying that I have always been lucky enough to pass my exams.  And every time I finished my exams I would go to Rwanda.  So I was in Rwanda in 1991, 1992, and 1993.  

And I even told you that I got married in 1992.  I didn't marry in Belgium.  I got married in Rwanda. 
Q.	Thank you.  And in answer to Mr. Weyl, you indicated to the Chamber that whilst working at SONARWA you only saw Mathieu Ngirumpatse to say good morning or when you were going on holidays; am I correct?  Was this what you said? 
A.	I don't believe so.  I indeed said that when I was still at SONARWA I was an official at SONARWA and Mathieu was the managing director of SONARWA.  And it's quite normal that when I was working 
	full-time at SONARWA I would see Mathieu several times.  

But when I left for Belgium, I had come for two months.  I was coming for my holidays, and I took one month for my holidays.  And I couldn't go and see the managing director to go and -- providing him with reports or anything like that.  I was no longer an official.  I had come here -- I had come there to go and do my work over the holidays.  When I was an official of the company, yes, because I was a full-time employee.  But when I was dealing with my holiday work, I would go to him to say hello and goodbye.  And that is what I did say, and I repeat it. 
Q.	Okay.  So it -- over an eight to nine-month period when you were at that company, Mathieu was -- was the director general; that's correct? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	And during that eight to nine-month period, did you report directly to Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No.  No.  No.  I had a head of department.  And the head of department went through another supervisor.  And if necessary, the head of department was to report to the managing director.  But when the managing director needed to speak to the head of service or head of department, he could call upon that person directly.  And in that framework, the head of section and head of the department would go to the managing director whenever he was available.  

But hierarchically, I needed to report to the head of department.  And the head of department could go and see the managing director in order to report.  But a head of section, given that we were in a commercial organisation, could be contacted directly by the managing director --
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	-- at least at that time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the way the testimony is given is that you respond to the questions that are put to you.  So it would facilitate the proceedings if you simply responded to the question.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MS. WILSON:
Thank you. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, over that -- that eight to nine-month period whilst working at SONARWA -- just give us how often would you see Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Just an approximation.  
A.	On average, once a month, at my request. 
Q.	And you gave an assessment -- you described many different qualities of Mathieu Ngirumpatse during your direct evidence.  Do you agree that apart from the instances in Brussels your contact with Ngirumpatse was very limited over that eight to nine-month period at work? 
A.	In Brussels?  
Q.	I am speaking about the time when you worked at SONARWA.  Do you agree that over that 
	eight to nine-month period your contact with Ngirumpatse was limited to the once a month, as you've just indicated in evidence? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	And you gave us -- you told us that you met him in Brussels, and you spoke about one particular occasion in some detail.  Whilst in Brussels how often did you see Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	In Brussels -- when our party chairman came to Brussels, we were almost always with him -- 
Q.	Sorry.  
A.	-- except -- 
Q.	Sorry.  Mr. Witness, try to listen to the question and simply answer it.  I simply want to get -- have an idea of how often you saw Mathieu Ngirumpatse when he came to Brussels.  
A.	Every day. 
Q.	And how often -- how many times did you meet with Mathieu Ngirumpatse whilst he -- whilst he was in Brussels and you were there? 
A.	When the chairman of the party was on mission to Brussels, except at the time when we were in school, we were supposed to be with him by his side in order to accompany him in his appointments.  He didn't take us to all his meetings.  But we were supposed to be beside him in order to tell him who he was going to see, what was that person's opinion in respect to our party, and so on and so forth.  So we were supposed to be close by him.  

It was not always with me.  It was a group.  And everything depended on our own timetables in the in -- educational institutions that we frequented. 
Q.	Sorry to interrupt you.  But I'm not talking about the group.  I simply want to know about you.  

You said that Ngirumpatse would come to Brussels on mission.  How often did you see him whilst he was there?  Do you understand the question?  
A.	I understood it from the outset.  I would see Mathieu Ngirumpatse every day, and this is the second time I'm telling you this.  When he was on mission, I would see him every day. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, how often was Ngirumpatse on mission in Brussels? 
A.	On average, it would be once a year -- once a year, on average. 
Q.	And can you tell us between what year and what year he was in Brussels.  Are you able to assist us in that regard?  Was it between 1990 and 1993? 
A.	As I said this morning, I was accredited in 1993.  So everything that happened from 1990 to 1993 -- I was not yet a press attaché.  But I was a member of the MRND.  Yes.  

But I was not yet working as an official -- well, official in inverted commas, because I told you that -- the reason why a press accreditation card was asked for.
Q.	Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  
A.	But I -- 
Q.	We're having some difficulty here, simply because you find it very difficult to answer a question directly.  

Are you saying that it was from the time that you were accredited in '93 as a press attaché that you would meet Ngirumpatse when he was on mission?  Are you saying that? 
A.	Yes.  But I should go on and tell you that I have no difficulty, and you don't either.  This is your method.  I don't have any difficulty, and neither do you.  

I have told you -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness --
A.	-- that from 1990 -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, excuse me.  
A.	-- from 1990 to 1993 -- 
Q.	Listen.  I'm asking you simple questions.  I want simple answers.  If there is a need to re-examine you, Mr. Weyl would do that.  

There are no trick questions.  It's either you know the answer, or you don't.  We don't need to take longer than is necessary in getting through in this.  Do you agree?

So if you don't understand my question, you just simply...(microphones overlapping) 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So let's try to make this go very smoothly.  

So you just agreed that from 1993, when you were given the official accreditation, that you would meet with Ngirumpatse when he came on mission.  Is that your evidence?  
A.	Please don't put words in my mouth.  I'm here as a witness.  Please allow me to speak.  You are asking me a question, and give me the time to answer you. 
Q.	Are you going to respond to my question or not? 
A.	The way we worked from 1990 up to 1993 is different from the way we operated -- or I operated after accreditation.  I was more available after accreditation was given.  

And I told you that I would see Mathieu every day after 1993 when he came on mission.  But before 1990 -- I'm sorry -- before 1993 I may not even have been aware that he was in Brussels.  I was not as yet engaged in working as a press attaché. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  Now, what I'm trying to ascertain from you is -- if you could give me a figure -- a number of times you met with him.  If you met with him five times in all, ten times, 20 times whilst he was in Brussels.  That's all I'm trying to get from you.  

So if you tell me every time he came to -- "Every time he was in Brussels, I met with him and I met with him every day," I don't have an idea of how often you met him whilst he was in Brussels.  Do you understand the question?  
A.	I understand.  And I told you that as soon as he was appointed chairman of the MRND he came twice to Brussels and I saw him twice in Brussels.  And on average, he would come one -- one time every year, once a year. 
Q.	And how long was his mission in Brussels when he -- when he was there on mission? 
A.	Two to four days.  Between two and four days. 
Q.	Okay.  So you would agree, between your limited interaction with the Accused whilst working at SONARWA and the limited times that you met with him in Brussels, that you did not have many opportunities to interact with Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I told you, but I will repeat it.  I met him twice.  That was from the time he had become chairman of the MRND.  I don't think there needs to be any confusion between his presence in Brussels or my presence in Kigali when he was managing director -- director of SONARWA.  But in Brussels he came there twice.  I saw him on two occasions, and that is when I had the most opportunity to discuss with him, the longest time to discuss with him. 
Q.	Thank you.  And on those two occasions -- let me -- let me ask you a different question.  

Over the period you met with him, generally, you were able to make an assessment of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Yes?  
A.	I didn't come to my appreciation of him on those two occasions when he was chairman of the MRND.  I did that through what I knew of him since he had been my managing director.  And I put all this information together.  And I was able to come to that assessment on the basis of the real facts that I myself experienced and saw. 
Q.	And you gave evidence about Mathieu being a poet and in a choir and lots of other personal engagements in which he was involved.  That information -- you would have gotten that from what others told you.  Do you agree?  Or maybe you -- about -- what you read in a newspaper.  
A.	Please allow me to add one thing.  Rwanda was a country which was 80 per cent Catholic.  And at home, as a practising Christian that I am, we would go to church every Sunday.  And when the small hymn book was opened at church, one could already read Mathieu Ngirumpatse's name, because he either was the author of poems or he was the author or composer of the songs -- the -- and hymns that were being sung in church.  

So someone who lived in Cyangugu, 300 kilometres from Kigali, could say after Mass, "Well, today we sang a song which was composed by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse."  This is to come back to your question.  

I knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse by name.  I said this this morning.  I knew him at SONARWA personally or physically, and I knew what he did before I was able to know him in person.  

His choir -- even today I know the choir is in existence.  It is something that no one can forget.  The songs and the poems, they are still there. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You have answered my question.  Thank you.  

And in your evidence in direct, you were asked about whether the changes in multipartism was made visible at your workplace.  Do you recall that question being asked?  
A.	Yes.  But not in the way you have formulated it. 
Q.	Okay.  Whether their political leanings were visible after multipartism.  That is well -- how it was asked.  Do you agree?  At the workplace.  Tell me, what did you say in relation to multipartism at the workplace?  
A.	I didn't say it.  And once again, I would like to ask you not to put words in my mouth.  

I said that -- you are a person from a university.  Now, in a commercial company, you cannot talk about politics.  The ethics of a business organisation is known.  And it excludes political notions in the workplace. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, as I said at the beginning of my cross-examination, I am simply requiring some clarifications from you.  

I recall and it's -- it's in my notes that a question was asked in relation to multipartism, whether or not the political leanings of individuals -- whether it was visible at the workplace, at SONARWA.  And you said that it was not.  Do you agree that you said that?  
A.	Yes.  That is what I said. 
Q.	Thank you.  But you agree that multipartism -- let me ask you an open question.  

When did -- in your view when did multipartism come into being in Rwanda?  
A.	I don't want to be specific.  It's about 23 or 24 years ago.  But I know that, after a summit which took place, first of all, in France, President Habyarimana, upon his return from the francophone summit -- I think President Mitterrand had banged on the table and said that African countries must begin to go into a democratic process.  President Habyarimana, two or three months later, directly launched the idea of democracy.  

In fact, let me use this opportunity to say that Mr. Ngirumpatse was member of the commission of initiative for pluralism in Rwanda. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, all I wanted to know -- there's -- there was a constitution in June of 1991 which introduced multi-parties in Rwanda.  And by '91 you would have already been living in Belgium; is that not so?  Can you give a response.  Thank you.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And in answer to Mr. Weyl, you also spoke about the diverse composition of staff at SONARWA.  Do you recall saying that? 
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	But this diversity was introduced even before Mathieu Ngirumpatse became the director general.  Do you agree? 
A.	Yes.  I agree that that's what I said.  
Q.	And let's go to your position as press attaché in Belgium.  Do you agree that whilst you were in Belgium you had to rely on information from others in order to perform that job as press attaché?  
A.	Counsel, with all due respect, if I say I'm in agreement, then you change the questions and answers that I gave.  I would not agree with you.  Please go according to the questions that would be put to me, and I would agree.  But you should not distort matters and put words in my mouth.  In that case, I wouldn't be in agreement.  With all due respect, please respect and keep -- stick to the questions that were put to me. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you don't agree with what I'm saying, you just simply say that.  There's no difficulty with that.  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	I am seek -- seeking clarification.  
A.	I don't agree with the last question.  I do not agree.  The last question was not put in that way.  I do not agree.  That's not how it was put to me.  Please reformulate your question. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you're making this very difficult.  

Now, tell me, when you -- any -- whatever information you wrote about what was going on in Rwanda -- I'm asking you an open question -- you'd agree that you would have had to rely on others for such information since you were living in Belgium.  
A.	I would say that I took the initiative to ask about what was going on.  It's not other people who were telling me what was happening.  One would learn something through the press in -- on the radio, and you are based in Brussels.  And there were 24,000 Rwandans in Brussels, in Belgium.  And we even had radio stations which broadcast in Kinyarwanda.  So for me Brussels was very interested in what was happening in Kigali.  

So we would learn through the press.  And I would take the initiative with my chairman and my secretary general to verify the information we received.  It was the opposite.  We hear, and then we verify.  And then we write our -- our communiqués.  That was our method.  

Otherwise, you risk not working properly if you base your work on hearsay.  You hear something, and you verify.  You read something in the papers.  You hear it on the radio.  You make a phone call.  And you verify what you've heard.

	1500H
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	I understand what you are saying.  You do not have to repeat it.  And you would verify from other sources in Rwanda, I take it? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	You can't nod, you have to say it so it is in the record, sorry.  
A.	What I'm saying by nodding is that I'm agreeing with you thus far.  Yes, we would verify. 
Q.	It has to be recorded; that is all I am saying.  
A.	We would hear news, we would phone, verify what we heard.  My president, my secretary general and myself -- I mean the president of the MRND section in Belgium, I do not mean the national president of the MRND -- the president of the section of the MRND in Belgium which was a support committee of the MRND, because that section in Belgium was not recognised in the organisational chart of the MRND.  We were benevolent -- 
Q.	Sorry, I do not know what you are answering in response to now.  You gave me your answer earlier on.  Thank you very much.  Can we move on?  

So you agree that -- 
A.	Please, continue.  
Q.	So because you were placed in Belgium, and you lived in Belgium, you could not provide an objective account or a direct account of what was happening in Rwanda; do you agree? 
A.	I do not agree with you, with the current or present means of communication.  In fact, even at that time I could phone my native commune 250 kilometres from Kigali and I would have information from a reliable source.  So I do not agree with you.  I do not agree with your point of view. 
Q.	But you must have -- you must agree that you were at some -- at disadvantage by not actually being in Rwanda to witness what was occurring yourself? 
A.	Once again, I must say that we did not make declarations on national political life.  We issued press communiqués addressed to the international press, and particularly to the Belgian press -- Belgian media and the media agencies located in Brussels.  

The general political situation was assessed or viewed by the MRND in Kigali or in various préfectures.  At 50 per cent, our objective was to inform the Belgium external press.  The external position was taken by Mr. Ngirumpatse's collaborators or his collaborators at the level of the préfectures. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you for that over-extensive response.  

You mentioned that you were married to the niece of Habyarimana; am I correct in saying that? 
A.	Yes, you understood me well. 
Q.	And you referred to her - again, I want your clarification.  Was she one of your sources of information? 
A.	No.  She did political science, she studied political science, but she was not very much interested in what was happening in Rwanda.  
Q.	And do you agree that your role as press attaché for the MRND was to ensure that the party was presented in a positive light? 
A.	Yes, among other things.  But above all we would try to contain the infernal machinery of the RPF. 
Q.	And would you not agree that in ensuring that MRND had a positive image, you would engage in what we might refer to as propaganda for the MRND? 
A.	Learned Counsel, for all the respect I owe you, every political party must carry out propaganda, positive propaganda, of course, for its growth, everywhere in the world.  I saw Mr. Obama recently visiting all the states of the United States in less than one week to do propaganda for his political party.  A political party that is not engaged in propaganda will not win any elections.  We believed in elections. 
Q.	So do I detect that your answer is yes, like Obama, you engaged in propaganda for the MRND whilst a press attaché.  
A.	Of course, I was an active member.  I was a member and an active member.  We believed in elections.  And we were going to win them if the democratic process had not been torpedoed. 
Q.	Mr. President, Mr. Witness, these are my questions for this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Weyl, do you have any redirect questions -- any redirect examination of this witness? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have only one question of clarification. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, to your knowledge, when Ngirumpatse was at SONARWA, did he have the power to dismiss any staff member? 
A.	I thank you for that question.  A general manager is not just anybody.  A general manager had the responsibility or had under him more than 300 staff members.  And if he noticed that somebody had -- was guilty of some serious misconduct, I think it would be his duty to take the necessary decisions.  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, to your knowledge, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse dismiss anyone from SONARWA as a result of his ethnicity? 
A.	Never.  I am not going to repeat what I've said, but Ngirumpatse never, never acted along those lines.  

As I told you, Ngirumpatse was imbued with a sense of humanity.  Throughout the country, even those who did not know Ngirumpatse, Ngirumpatse was known as an example, one of the rare examples in our country.  As a jurist he was known even by those who had not seen him. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Nahimana.  

Mr. Nahimana, I thank you, once more.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have not further questions for Mr. Nahimana. 

I would simply like to thank him for having contributed in shedding light on this matter.  Obviously, I would also like to make the usual application that the Court is used to, and I would kindly request the Court to ask the registry to facilitate a visit to Mr. Ngirumpatse by Mr. Nahimana.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I would also like to ask you, if you would allow me.  I have people here whom I know.  I would therefore like to know whether you would allow me to greet them, to say hello to them whenever you think I could do so. I have five people here, whom I would like to greet -- to whom I would like to say hello.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, first of all, I should just let you know that your testimony is now completed.  The request which Mr. Weyl made will be granted and the registrar will make arrangements to facilitate that.  

Now, in relation to the other request which you have made, you will have to address the WVSS section, who are taking care of you, and they will assist you in making the necessary requests to the appropriate authorities for addressing that.  

You are now excused and you may leave. 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  

Can I say hello to Mathieu? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Not in the courtroom.  
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, is there a problem? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, in fact, there is no problem.  Maybe there has been some misunderstanding.  We thought that the day of today would be devoted to hearing these two witnesses, and that we will have some discussion -- some legal discussion on the admissibility of documents tendered in evidence.  We still have two witnesses to be cross-examined on the basis of Rule 84 bis (sic) and so we thought that we could request the Chamber that these witnesses be heard tomorrow, and that we should complete our hearing by looking at the legal matters. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You do not make a request of that nature by telling the witnesses not to come to Court.  We have gone over this over and over again.  

The trial proceedings are not run in this manner.  Are your witnesses here? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am confused.  The Chamber is aware of the efforts that we are making to avoid any interruption in the arrival of witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I know that the two witnesses are in Arusha.  It is now time for you to call another witness.  I've been informed again they're here, at the Tribunal; is that correct?  Can you produce another witness? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I reiterate my apologies.  We are confused.  We did not take the necessary steps for a third witness to be heard today.  I am sorry that this has caused some difficulty. 

In any case, I am available to the Court to provide any information that may be useful for the rest of the evidence to be adduced by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

Mr. President, I would like to say that we wanted to bring some difficulties to your attention, difficulties which seem to arise not only as far as we are concerned, but as far as the Tribunal is concerned.  Because right now we are facing the refusal by a state to cooperate, to cooperate on the basis of a decision that you made -- a decision to organise a video conference.  

Yesterday, we received information that the state in question does not want to cooperate.  Those are some of the matters we wanted to raise with you to see how the Tribunal can go beyond the opposition that we are encountering, opposition to an order made by the Tribunal.  That is one of the questions that we think we should solve, of course, with the assistance of the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, the procedure for addressing matters of this nature is very clear cut.  It is tried and tested.  If there's a problem we would expect that you would know how to handle it, how to manage it.

Now, what specifically are you referring to?  What are you referring to?  Which witness are you referring to?  And what is the -- what do you describe as a refusal to cooperate? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, the Chamber is certainly aware that among the witnesses who we have called there is a witness regarding which the Chamber proprio motu made an order scheduling that that witness be heard by video conference.  That is Witness BU.  That witness had to be heard by video conference.  We think we could call him next week, and I should specify that this witness was on the list, the list of Joseph Nzirorera, and the Chamber kindly allowed us to list that witness as our own witness.  And on the Chamber's initiative, the Chamber decided that the witness be heard by video conference.  All the procedures - or, steps had been taken by the registry.  The registry sought the assistance of Belgian authorities in view of organising that video conference.  

Mr. Hometowu, yesterday, kindly disclosed to us a letter from the federal public service of the justice system of the country concerned.  That country stated its willingness to cooperate fully in order to allow the testimony to be given or taken, but that country refused to provide its assistance in organising a video conference.  In other words, the country says, "We will cooperate, but we will not cooperate".  

And to the extent that this is a response to your decision, a decision which the registry also sought to implement, we would like the Tribunal to remind the authorities of that country of their obligation to cooperate so that we should overcome this obstacle, the obstacles created by the judicial authorities of that country because they said quote/unquote, within the limits of their resources they will not honour the obligation to cooperate.  It would appear that the resources of the country concerned would not be such as to prevent the witness to be heard by video conference as the Tribunal had ordered and as the registry sought to make its assistance available.  I would therefore like the Tribunal to remind the country concerned of its duty to cooperate.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, are you familiar with the rules which govern the way we operate in these areas?  Do you know what other steps that should be taken, assuming that the information you provided is accurate? 

You suggest that the Chamber made this order proprio motu and that it is not necessarily in the interests of the accused persons.  There's also that inference in what you've said, that this is something which you did not want; it was not necessarily in the interests of the Accused.  And now you're saying that we should also do something with regard to a state when the procedure which normally precedes such action has not been implemented 

What is the position?  Were you dissatisfied with the order for the video link conference that we made?  Do you wish some other (inaudible) to be put in place?  I don't really understand what you are saying.  
Are you saying that the state has refused to allow the video link conference altogether?  Is that what you are saying? 
MR. WEYL: 
That's it, Mr. President.  That is indeed what I am saying. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, if you would allow me to clear any doubt or misunderstanding? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have seen the correspondence as well, Mr. Weyl.  But you may proceed.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  To avoid any -- Mr. President, we were grateful to the Chamber and we were pleased with the decision that the Chamber made to order that video conference.  Unless we misunderstood the correspondence of 9 November, we understand -- we take that correspondence of 9 November as a refusal.  The authorities of that country recall that the testimony is only possible if a visit to the seat of the court is not possible or if for health reasons the witness cannot go there.  For the case in point, the authorities concerned do not want to support the holding or assisting the holding of a video conference.  That is our understanding. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl -- Mr. Weyl, isn't the position that the state itself confirmed that the witness was willing to travel to the Tribunal to give testimony?  If the witness was willing to travel and was able to travel then the video conference would have been unnecessary.  It so happens that there's other information which is available to the Tribunal which makes it apparent that it would not be safe for the witness to travel.  And it's a matter of communication that's involved here.  

I think that the allegation of failure to cooperate is a very loose and inaccurate statement.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, we remained with the impression that the witness could not and that because he could not travel, it was necessary for a video conference to be organised.  Perhaps -- well, I am referring, once more, to the correspondence of 9 November which I cannot interpret otherwise than as an objection, a refusal.  Perhaps this was a reply to previous correspondence indicating some reluctance and it is that reluctance that caused the registry to write a letter and to make observations on the 5th of November.

The letter of 9 November, as far as we are concerned, cannot be understood otherwise except that it can only be considered as a refusal.  Perhaps the registry could obtain from the authorities of the country concerned a different interpretation, but for the time being this is our understanding.  And I do not see how to interpret this correspondence otherwise.  We take that it is a refusal to cooperate. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, if that is your interpretation and if you want to address in that manner, then the Rules require you to make an application to the Chamber for action to be taken in breach of Article 28 of the Rules.  If that's the course of action you'd like to pursue then you are at liberty to (inaudible) it in accordance with what the Rules stipulate.  If that is what your request is then you file your application.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm going to do that.  I thought I could make it orally in the course of this hearing but I am going to put my application in writing.  But I respectfully want to remind the Chamber that we had this decision yesterday evening and we devoted the entire day to the hearing of witnesses, and when I leave the courtroom it is clear that I will make the necessary effort in order to be able to submit a written application.  

I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

Mr. Sow, you had raised -- said you wanted to raise some issues before us.  Earlier this afternoon you said you had some housekeeping matters that you wanted to raise before we rose today.  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, quite so, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, according to the scheduling calendar of the Tribunal, Monday is a public holiday.  And I believe this was done in respect of the Tabaski festival.  It would so appear beyond any reasonable doubt.  I have received information according to which, here in Arusha, it would probably be on the Tuesday and not the Monday of next week.  

So what I wish to suggest to the Chamber is this:  That we use Monday and that Tuesday be a holiday because according to information given to me we wanted to start on Tuesday at about 11 o'clock, which would cause a problem for we Muslims because that is the day when we go to the mosque, but we also slaughter the sheep.  And it is the very act of slaughtering the sheep that is important and we need to take time to do this properly and appropriately so that we can enjoy the sheep.  

So if we are to come here on Tuesday at eleven, our minds will be elsewhere, and this is why I am requesting the Chamber to kindly review its timetable, either that we have a long weekend so we would have Monday and Tuesday off.  But if you believe that we want to make use of Monday, I don't see any problem with that.  But simply, we wish that we set aside Tuesday, so that we can enjoy the holiday in our peace and quiet.  That is my first point of housekeeping that I wish to put before you. 

Secondly, I am dealing with my client, and I believe next week he needs to speak with his son to speak about some family issues.  He has made me understand that it will be very difficult for him to do this after the sessions because the UNDF has its own regulations, and consequently he would wish to be authorised as soon as his son arrives next week to be able to be absent from Court.  And he is specifying that he accepts that I be able to represent him so that the sessions are not unnecessarily disturbed.

Those were my two issues which I wish to submit to you and thank you both for your understanding, especially and in particular with regard to my first point. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it's much easier to deal with the second point and the requested authorisation is granted.  

With regard to the first point, we had in fact taken some consultations on the matter when we understood that the religious day would be on the Tuesday.  And the consultations which we undertook produced the information that the religious needs would have been satisfied if we allowed a late start on Tuesday.  And it is really in respect to the religious interest to which you referred that we had raised the issue of starting only at 11 o'clock on Tuesday.  

It's too late to sit on Monday because I think that the publication of Monday as a holiday has been in existence for a long time.  And everybody has made their plans already.  And I don't think it would be appropriate to reschedule.  

I see Mr. Weyl nodding.  It is not often I see Mr. Weyl nodding his head in the courtroom.  And I see him nodding his head at the thought that we will not revoke Monday as a holiday.  

I am not sure what else to say at this stage about Tuesday.

Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I think we should be able to assist or give some consideration to Mr. Sow's request if we agreed to sit on Friday.  Usually, we are off on Fridays.  So, I think this Chamber could maintain its schedule or the pace of the trial by sitting on Friday the whole day as opposed to not sitting at all and concede to Mr. Sow's request.  But, the Prosecution is in the hands of the Chamber.  We don't have any strong feelings one way or the other.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, would that solution be a reasonable one? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, when the Chamber assesses how much we are constrained to organise the arrival of our witnesses, I would like to be as flexible as possible.  But it is very difficult.  The Chamber is well aware of this and the Chamber can note how quickly we are always trying to meet with the constraints.  But when we hear that we are supposed to meet on Friday, with what witness?  How can we bring these witnesses?  Under what conditions? 

Now --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is not this week Friday, Mr. Weyl, next week Friday.  Not this week Friday.

You see, the point is this, right:  Do you have witnesses for three days' sitting next week who will be in Arusha?  Because basically we'll still be having the same three days' sitting; instead of sitting Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, we will be sitting Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  

So there is no need for an additional witness.  The witness who would have testified on Tuesday will testify on Wednesday.  It is the same witnesses, so there is no additional burden that's been placed upon you.

1535H 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, yes, because Friday -- we do not have any new witnesses for Friday.  The difficulties of travel -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, do you have witnesses for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday next week? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, we have.  We will have witnesses.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, instead of sitting Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, we sit Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  
The same witnesses.  Nothing extra.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, if I could explain to the Chamber.  The witness that we have asked to come on the Thursday must work in the Emirates on Sunday.  And there are travel days required.  He can come on Thursday, but he cannot come on Friday.  We are really constrained -- under extremely difficult time constraints and we can't change one day for another.  

There's one who is coming on the 15th to testify on the 16th.  And it's already very complicated.  And he must go back on Thursday evening.  I don't see how we're going to tell him that, "You're coming earlier," and then they leave later, whereas, they are not able to stay here on the Friday.  

It's -- I would like the Chamber to understand our situation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I don't understand the problem.  Why can't that witness testify on the day he was supposed to testify and one of the other witnesses take the Friday slot?  That's very easy.  If the witness was supposed -- scheduled to testify on Thursday, he can testify on Thursday.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, there was no one scheduled for Friday; that's our difficulty.  So we'll have to find a witness who will agree to remain on Friday.  I'm not sure that we'll be able to guarantee this to the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is simple because the order is, if you don't have any other witnesses, Mr. Ngirumpatse starts to testify.  So that is also not a problem.  So in the absence of other witnesses being available, we start the testimony of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So there's absolutely no problem.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'm confused.  But really, in front of this Tribunal, I am suffering a great deal, and this is because of the constraints in that the organisation of the presentation of evidence for Mathieu Ngirumpatse can be subjected to consideration of religious festivals.  So I really don't know what to say to the Chamber.  We are here as the Defence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse and we have been dealing with this, rather, in a difficult manner, and I'm really suffering with this.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like to make another suggestion because the matter is quite simple; it shouldn't be made complicated.  Since we are looking at witnesses for next week, let me suggest that the problem be postponed till tomorrow so the Ngirumpatse team will be able to provide -- get information from its witnesses to see if any of them are ready to testify on the Friday.  

Now, if that is not possible, it is not possible.  And, so, if that is the case, we will come here on Tuesday at 11 o'clock.  I think my request was merely linked to seeking a solution and not for complicating issues any further.  So, I'm suggesting that the Ngirumpatse team can look at the situation between now and tomorrow morning, whether there is a possibility for a witness to testify on Friday.  If that is not the case, then I will thank you and thank Mr. Weyl for the efforts that will have been made to find a solution.  

But I'll come back to the starting point where we will come here at Tuesday at 11 o'clock in order to continue with the session.  Thank you.  That would be my proposal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, thank you -- Mr. Sow, thank you very much.  I agree that we should reconsider it tomorrow morning.  I want to assure you that the Chamber is not insensitive to the religious implications and we will try to make arrangements that's accommodating to everybody.  
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning.
