MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 13th of June 2005, for the trial in the matter of the Prosecution versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44-C-T. 

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Appearances are the same as last week, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, they are, Your Honour.  Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  

Defence?
MR. HOOPER: 
And they remain the same for the Defence, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I notice the Accused is not here again this morning. 
MR. HOOPER: 
No.  I was able to see him Friday afternoon, and he was in good spirits, having got over the disappointment of the failure of his earlier motion.  And he responded well, was capable of giving me clear, explicit instructions and still can't quite bring himself to make the -- the journey from the detention centre to here.  I'm quite sure it's a voluntary decision, and I'm quite content that the trial continue in his absence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Well, I would be grateful if you would impress upon him that the Court thinks it's important for him to attend. 

To rule on the discussion on Friday concerning your examination -- cross-examination of the witness, we think that you're entitled to inquire of the witness the -- of the -- the names of the investigator -- the other investigators.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Registrar, does the witness continue on the same oath, or does he have to be sworn again?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, the witness continues as is. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are still under oath, and your examination will continue.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
UPENDRA SINGH BAGHEL,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Baghel. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I apologise.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Baghel.  I'll come back to the issue of the investigation in respect of Butare at a later point this morning.  I'm going to move to Gikomero and -- but before I do so, I just want to clarify one point.  You may recall last week that I referred you to the Prosecution Exhibit No. 4, number 22 on the exhibit bundle, which is a document produced by the MDR party, to which André Rwamakuba was a member, and is referred to as "Interahamwe za Muvoma or the MRD party headliners 'attempt to root out the evil,'" a working document by the MDR steering committee dated the 14th of May 1992 and appearing in our exhibit bundle number 1 -- number 2 at exhibit 22, and in English, page 14, and in French, immediately before that -- or maybe that isn't the document in French.  I'm not sure where the French version is, actually, but -- I'm sorry. 

And I asked you about that, and I asked you whether or not it wasn't, in fact, merely a severe criticism of MRND activity, i.e., the MDR criticising the MRND for its establishment of the Interahamwe.  And you said that you thought that there were, in fact, some content referring to MDR people and critical of them, of a deviance within the MDR.  

Now, I don't know if you've had the opportunity to remind yourself of the contents of that document over the weekend -- and I don't blame you if you haven't -- but I have, as I said I might, and I can assure you that there's no such criticism of any -- any MDR deviation in it at all.  Your recollection of that content is, I suggest, a mistaken one.  Would you accept that from me?  
A.	Good morning to all of you. 

In fact, I did not have time to go through the document on the weekend or during the weekend, so I cannot recollect the exact content of the document.  I appreciate the Defence counsel if his interpretation is that way, because I cannot comment on this.  Thank you. 
Q.	Very well.  It's not an interpretation.  What I'm putting to you is a factual reflection of the contents of the document.  But I'm not going to take you through it line by line, because if there's anything in what you say, there will come an opportunity for the Prosecutor to remind you and help you about it.  But I'm going to, as it has been referred to in that way, just highlight two matters.  On page 2, the author of this document writes, "In furtherance of this evil undertaking, the MRND has formed a group known as the Interahamwe za Muvoma, or the hardliners of the MRND regime.  In order to intimidate the people, commit armed robbery and create a sense of insecurity in the country by maintaining a permanent state of fear and insecurity, with a view to turn the people's attention away from their political struggle for genuine democracy." 

And at page 20 -- page 11 of Exhibit 4, exhibit document page -- exhibit 22 in the bundle, the author of this document, an MDR member, writes presciently, one might think, the following:  "Currently, some préfets and bourgmestres compete with each other in creating Interahamwe groups, each in his administrative area.  Hence, the local administration must be purged swiftly in order to stop the growth of this terrorist organisation.  Otherwise, the country will be set ablaze and plunged into bloodshed.  The youth must be rescued from the Interahamwe scourge.  The nation's future depends upon it." 

And I think that those two extracts, I hope, reflect the nature of the document.  And it terminates in this way in the final paragraph of page 17:  "That is why the MDR party, the party of working masses, has launched a crusade for a free world and for genuine democracy in our beloved republic, which the sons and daughters of this country won after so much sacrifice, and in spite of countless obstacles, nothing will stop it.  Nothing will stop our march towards democracy and freedom."  Dated Kigali, the 14th May 1992, and signed by a member of the MDR political bureau, Dr. Anastase Gasana. 

I'll put that document aside, and I don't propose to come back to that today, but I hope it's corrected, what I suggested was the misstatement.  I quite accept the impression of that document which you lent to it last week. 

Now, can I come to Butare -- I'm sorry, to Gikomero, Gikomero commune -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, may I just make an inquiry?  

Mr. Registrar, was that document P. 4 or P. 5, could you -- 
MR. FRY:
I'm not sure, Your Honour.  If you could give me the details, I could check.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, yes.  It's number 22.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, Mr. Hooper.  Can Mr. Hooper's microphone be lit?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry.  Exhibit number -- document 22 on the exhibit list, and it is -- I've lost it. 

I don't know why it seemed to have disappeared from my list. 
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we believe it's P. 5. 
MR. HOOPER:
P. 5 you have it as.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was my note, as well.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's what we have, too, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. HOOPER: 
It's mine, too.  I'm sorry, I misread the line it was written on, P. 5.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you. 
MR. HOOPER: 
So, that's P. 5.  Thank you very much, Mr. President, for the correction.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And coming to Gikomero, you've produced at page 8 of your bundle, and a generally helpful bundle I can see, a map of Gikomero and the relevant area.  

Now, I think the last time that I was putting any questions to you was September -- November 2003, and I asked then whether it was possible to produce a map that we could read, that was legible, on an area that's quite significant in this case.  And you left, I think, with a parting promise that you would certainly try and find one, and I take it that in the almost two years since, you haven't been able to find one; is that right?  
A.	This map is an extract of a larger map, and I asked the evidence unit to make a copy, photocopy, coloured one, and they made it, and I've brought with me the big map. 
Q.	This is -- this is a significant part of the case, and we're going to need a decent map, in fairness to all the parties, both sides.  The map that we have of Gikomero at page 8 has, as you've indicated, been reduced to half its size.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, it's right.  
Q.	Is it possible to at least provide a copy of a map that is in its proper scale or even a larger scale, so that we can all read it?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe the witness just said that he brought a map with him today.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, it's all very well in your pocket, but it's not much help to anyone who's trying to look at this area.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is it possible that that map could be photocopied and distributed so that we have a proper, legible, scale map or even an expanded map of this area?  Is that something that can be done and done fairly soon?  
A.	This extract is A4 size after getting it reduced from the original by half.  And now I have a big map from which I have taken the extract, and I think it can be produced, same area, but it will not come on A4 size.  It will come maybe on A3 size, which will be bigger than this page.  And I can produce the whole map here.  It's in the coloured photocopied one. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I think that would be a very helpful start, and then we can try and see if we can have it photocopied in its -- to the largest extent possible.  So do you want to tender that map formally as an exhibit, Prosecution exhibit, or the copy that you have of it? 
A.	The copy is here, and I can tender this map as Prosecution exhibit.  
Q.	Well, can that be done?  And can I have sight of it, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
It seems a bit irregular.  My suggestion is that we have the witness unfold the map and we can display it to the Defence and to the Court.  It's not -- I don't find it particularly useful.  I was not planning on tendering it.  I think the excerpt that is in the bundle is sufficient and meets our needs.  But if Mr. Hooper would like to proceed, we can have the witness open the map and he can look at it, and the Court can inspect it, and he can put it in as a -- as a Defence exhibit.  

MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I think, looking at -- well, if you want it put in as a -- let's put it in as a Defence exhibit, Exhibit 1, please, Mr. Upendra.  And can it be passed to me first before it goes in.  At least I should know what my own exhibit is.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just to clarify matters, Your Honour, I can also state for the record that during the first trial there were two -- two other maps that were admitted in evidence.  One was a map that was called touristic map, and another one I believe is the same map that Mr. Hooper is in the process of examining now.  I had requested that the registry bring those exhibits to the courtroom on Thursday.  I imagine they've so done today as well.  So we have three maps that the Court can look at, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
-- quite frankly -- yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, those maps are not in evidence in this trial.  If you wish them to be put in evidence, you have to put them in evidence.  We are not looking at the exhibits in the former trial at all.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I understand that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So if you wish to move them into this trial, it will be very simple to do that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no intention of moving them in this trial.  I was responding to Mr. Hooper's concerns for -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- a larger map.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- the point is that the Court will not be looking at it unless it's moved into it.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm simply stating for the record, Your Honour, that Mr. Hooper can refer to those two exhibits which were brought to the courtroom -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
They are not exhibits as yet.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
He can look at those two maps, and if he prefers to have one of those two other maps presented to the witness, then we can proceed and put those before the Court as exhibits if he desires.  
MR. HOOPER: 
One of our recollections is in error.  I've never seen this map.  And for the record, the Defence have made it plain before that we've gone to great effort to find a map.  We've gone through all the agencies in Kigali, and where the maps should be that are relevant there was just, as it were, a hole in the wall.  The maps have gone.  But we have here an ordinate survey map, for the record, which is, of course, a quality of map which is wholly satisfactory in a case where routes and opportunity of access are one of the principal issues in the Defence case.  

I'm looking at this map, and it's -- can't find the date, but it was, in fact, composed -- it's, in fact, been produced by the Canadian Forces mapping and charting establishment.  I don't know if that was a product of UNAMIR and the Canadian contingent in that.  And it's -- well, perhaps we can come back to describing it, its provenance and when it was drawn and -- which is relevant in a moment.  

If you could just lay it there for a moment.  
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Where did you get it from, Mr. Upendra?  
A.	In OTP investigation evidence unit has got a collection of maps, and as I recall, these maps have come from different -- different sources.  Some maps were in ICTR office in Kigali, and I think those maps were transferred from UNAMIR.  Some maps have come in evidence unit from different sources, so exact source of this map I do not know, whether it's part of the documents which came from UNAMIR or from some other sources. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, I'm going to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you wish to put that in evidence as a Defence exhibit?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I do.  Can I leave it till a little later, till after a break?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sure.
MR. HOOPER:
And then I can formally describe it, as it were.  It's a bit cumbersome to refer to it at the moment, but it's a very useful contribution to the -- understanding the area which is -- which we're discussing now. 

There's been some sketch plans made, and I emphasise the word "sketch".  Prosecution have been provided with them, and they are an approximate indication of places that are going to become relevant in this case.  And the first one, which I'd ask be made Defence Exhibit 2, after it's been examined -- well, I don't think there's any dispute about it.  It can go straight in as an exhibit.  There's one there for Mr. Upendra, and there's one for each of the Judges.  There's -- I composed an electronic format, but I haven't been able get it through to the court management yet this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shouldn't the witness see it first?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, please.  Yes, one to the witness.  One to the witness and three to the Judges.  Thanks.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, the interpreters would also wish to have a copy, if possible.  
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	So, Mr. Upendra, just dealing with -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the interpreters requested a copy.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Certainly.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There are three booths. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
They have indicated there are three booths.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, we're getting close.  I think there's three of the next map, certainly.  And I brought some others, it's just that they seem to have gone adrift this morning.  Oh, here we are.  Yes, I've got sufficient also for the first one. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Mr. Hooper be made to use his microphone.  
MR. HOOPER: 
(Microphone not activated)...there's lots of copies there.  So we'll keep on -- thank you.  

That's just the same as you -- as the Prosecution have.  It's just that it's in black and white rather than technicolor.  

Ms. Fall, I see you're looking puzzled.  Do you have a copy, or should I get you another one if I can?  
MS. FALL: 
I thank you, but we do already have a copy.  We don't have any problem as yet. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I think everyone who'd like one has got one now, I hope.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, the document that was just handed up to you, I hope you agree, is an approximate sketch showing the area of Gikomero commune in which is placed, as we can see from the top, Gasabo, Ndatemwa, Rutunga, Kayanga and Gikomero secteur.  Is that right, Mr. Baghel? 
A.	Yes, that's right, approximately. 
Q.	Yes.  And just so that we're not confused from the outset, because it is confusing, the area of Gikomero commune occupies a massif or with -- a massif with a plateau, as it were, on the top just north of Kigali city.  And it really is a bit like a hand, a three-fingered hand, pointing north with the easterly finger containing Gasabo, Rutunga, Kayanga, Gikomero secteur.  The middle finger contains a place called Gishaka, and rather confusingly, that's where Gikomero commune bureau is, the offices themselves.  It's not the name of the place, it's the name of the administrative offices for Gikomero commune.  Gikomero itself, as we can see on the third right-sided finger, Gikomero secteur is indicated there, and the commune offices are not there.  That's the position, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Now, the commune is, I think, one of 11 -- or, sorry, not one of 11.  The commune is one of a smaller administrative area within a préfecture.  There's, I think, 11 préfectures.  Each préfecture has a number of communes.  Each commune is then split up into secteur.  That's the hierarchy:  préfecture, commune, cellule -- sorry, secteur, and then finally a much smaller area, cellule.  So there's four divisions, as it were, within the préfecture system, very simply.  I hope you can agree with that.  
A.	Yes, I agree with this. 
Q.	And Gasabo, Rutunga, Kayanga, Gikomero, Gishaka, et cetera, these are all, in fact, secteurs.  Ndatemwa is not a secteur; it's a place.  We're going to have to distinguish between secteurs and places, but it's a place lying, more or less, on the borders of two secteurs, Gasabo and Rutunga.  

That's our Defence Exhibit 2.  I'm going to now produce exhibit -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's -- which was Defence Exhibit 1?  That will be -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President's microphone, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You've asked us to reserve Defence Exhibit 1 for the map. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, is that right?  
MR. FRY:
As you wish, Your Honour.  
MR. HOOPER: 
That will go in this morning.  It's just once we've seen exactly -- once we can describe it accurately.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  Just a qualification before this is admitted in evidence.  I assume that Mr. Hooper is trying to put it in evidence now as Defence 2. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's his application.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
There was no testimony that this map was drawn to scale or where the information came from.  I don't want to interrupt his cross-examination.  We can accept the map for a simple layout that he has assembled for Gikomero commune, but it should be clear on the record that this is not an official map, it is not drawn to scale, and it is his approximation of the layout of the area.  It was a previous exhibit, a Prosecution exhibit, and the map that was tendered earlier, which is an official map that was done by a cartographer, and simply to clarify for the record, this is simply a sketch that was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's a matter which could be clarified through the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's a matter which could be clarified through the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphone not activated)...the witness on that, Your Honour?  Because Mr. Hooper has not laid that foundation in his cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you'll have a chance to examine the witness again. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I've examined the witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You've made the point.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He can clear it up now.  If he doesn't, you can do it in re-examination.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I prefer that he clear it up now.  
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	I thought I had, actually, asked you, Mr. Upendra.  You gave me a positive answer.  I invited you to look at the plan and to agree that it was a sketch and an approximation of the area and the places that are on -- on the sketch.  And you agreed that it was an approximation; is that right?  
A.	Yes, it seems to be approximation.  Like, the places more or less seem to be in the order as in the map which was given by me, but exact boundary and other things I cannot find out. 
Q.	Well, you can find out.  You may not have it at your fingertips now, but I invite you to go away and scrutinise this with all the care I hope it deserves.  But I think the sufficient realm for it to go in as an exhibit.  It's a sketch.  We all know it's a sketch, and if it's wrong, then it can be corrected and -- but it's the best we can do at the moment. 
MR. HOOPER: 
So can that be moved as Exhibit 2, and can it be called the Ndatemwa -- the Ndatemwa sketch, to just say that -- just distinguish it from the next one that's going to go in.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence as D. 2, the Ndatemwa sketch. 
(Exhibit No. D. 2 admitted)
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Now, the next one that's going in is a similar sketch, approximation, indicating a wider area, together with the principal river and road complexes.  Again I'm going to show you this, Mr. Upendra -- Mr. Baghel.  It's a sketch, an approximation, done as accurately as possible and open to such correction as becomes apparent or necessary.  
MR. HOOPER:
And there's sufficient copies here.  However, I think they have all been -- I think the interpreters had these.  The Bench hasn't, the witness hasn't, but I think everyone else has.  And there's one there for the Court.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Baghel, again -- I've given the Prosecution a copy this morning.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, what I have before me is I believe what we just put in as D. 2.  
MR. HOOPER: 
It's also in green, but it's a different plan.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So looking at that -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Looking -- looking at that, Mr. Baghel, again, with all the drawbacks of a sketch -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I think the problem is revisited.  You see, the witness has not acknowledged what he has received. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Indeed.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, you have before you a sketch plan of a wider area of Gikomero commune and surrounding communes with principal rivers and road network.  And again, with all the drawbacks and weaknesses that a sketch presents, do you accept that as an approximation of those features and places? 
A.	Yes, I accept these are the approximations or relative locations of the places. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And can that be moved in as an exhibit, as Defence Exhibit 3?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted as -- admitted as D. 3.
(Exhibit No. D. 3 admitted) 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I now move into as an exhibit a scan of a map of Rwanda from which the sketches, together with other information, including resource to the document that was produced by Mr. Upendra last week in our book from which it was composed, just to show the basis of it.  It won't be necessary for the interpreters to have these -- there's only four, anyway -- but if Mr. Upendra Baghel could be shown one and the others distributed to the Court.  I've shown the Prosecution these.  And the original map I don't proposed to exhibit, but it's here for reference if anyone wants to see it, as it's the only map I have.  It was here.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And again, Mr. Baghel, looking at that, perhaps I can invite you just formally to look at the original copy, original map -- if that could be shown to the witness -- and that's a scanning from one part of the map, the relevant part of the map, for our purposes or my purposes this morning.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't propose to exhibit the map.  It's in a delicate condition, and they're not easy to find, as you've heard.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have not asked the witness a question yet.  
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, sorry.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you recognise -- do you accept that the scanned copy that you have comes from -- appears to come from this original map? 
A.	Yes, it appears that it has come from that map, only the portion. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I'm wondering if that scan from an original map of Rwanda, which is available for inspection, can be formally exhibited as Defence Exhibit 4.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence as Defence Exhibit 4. 
(Exhibit No. D. 4 admitted) 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, I want to show you another map, but again, I don't want to exhibit it because it's the only one I've got, but it's a large map, and if it goes in as an exhibit I lose possession of it.  But I want you to look at it and just tell me whether you've seen such a document -- such a map before.  

And for the record, the map that's going to you -- if the Judges could be shown perhaps just -- well, Mr. Baghel can be shown it.  The Prosecution, again, have had sight of it.  

This is a map of Kigali city showing its road plan with all the usual, relevant features that one might expect.  Have you seen a plan like that before, Mr. Baghel?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The description of the plan to be part of Mr. Baghel's evidence?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes.  Perhaps, Mr. Baghel, you could just describe what you're holding. 
A.	Yes, I have seen a similar plan like that, but I don't recall whether that was exactly the same as it is.  But this plan is plan touristic of Kigali and October 1993.  The one which I saw earlier I don't remember but looked like similar one, so I don't remember whether date was same or some other dates, because when I was in Rwanda I keep looking different kinds of plans, maps, sometimes in office, sometime outside, but I've seen a similar -- similar one earlier.  
Q.	Very well.  
MR. HOOPER: 
For reasons I've said, I don't propose to exhibit that, but perhaps it could be shown, please, to the Bench, and it's a resource that is available if anyone wishes it.  And I have scanned in the entire -- the entire map onto a CD, which is -- has written on it "Defence sketch map, 12th of June '05," that has this map, because of the limits of the scanner, divided into six or seven blocks.  So it's not particularly easy to follow, but the other sketch plans that have been exhibited are also on this CD, and one other document that I'm going to refer to in a moment is also on here, and as soon as that's been processed it will be available to be put on laptops.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But would we be able to use it if Mr. Baghel doesn't identify the -- it on the CD?  

MR. HOOPER: 
It would -- I'm reminded from you, Mr. President, and from Mr. O'Shea that it will have to be shown to him.  And I'll make that available to him, and perhaps he can look at it in his own time and -- over the break, if he has his laptop with him and if he can open it, and then we can secure the position on that.  So I don't exhibit that at the moment.  I'll wait until Mr. Baghel has had the opportunity to see it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  It would be helpful if we had those items on the Prosecution side as well; we can look at those during the breaks.  But as a general proposition, we're not contesting the use of these exhibits, but things would go much faster if we could see it and consent rather than having Mr. Hooper lay his own foundation for these -- for these items. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  I take the point, but it's not always easy to get everything quite as prepared ahead of time, as the Prosecution have experienced. 

Can I show a further document to the witness?  I haven't been able to photocopy this this morning, and I -- and it's late because I thought it got lost, but in fact, I found it last night.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And looking at that document, Mr. Baghel -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I apologise for interrupting, but it would be easier if we could see the exhibit before they're actually shown to the witness.  Mr. Hooper may have shown me this last week, but I don't recall what it is I've seen.  He's shown me a number of things.  So as a matter of procedure, before anything is shown to the witness, could you kindly show it to the Prosecution?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Certainly.  

Can you give that to the Prosecution as well?  

And there's an accompanying sketch document drawn from that document, which I'll explain, which is going to you now.  Have you seen the last document that went to the witness?  

If that could just be shown, please, if it hasn't been shown already, to -- to Mr. Webster.  The photocopy of the map, if that could be shown to Mr. Webster, if it hasn't been.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
You know, quite frankly, Your Honour, I'm a bit surprised to see these things now because none of these things have been displayed to the Prosecution before.  Last week we took time to go through with Mr. Hooper what we requested were set for discovery.  We asked him to show him the -- to show us the exhibits he was going to use.  I've never seen this.  I've never seen the thing that was just passed up to the witness.  What we were looking at earlier this morning that entered into evidence as D. 2 I've never seen before.  I've seen it -- I saw it for the first time after it was admitted into evidence.  I thought we were looking at D. 3 when Mr. Hooper admitted D. 2 into evidence.  

So it would be easier -- I'm not objecting to these things being admitted into evidence, but I'd like to see them beforehand, and I'd like to be able to show them to the witness before he's asked to admit them into evidence.  He's actually using our witness to admit his exhibits.  I don't know where they come from.  There's no foundation laid as to the accuracy of the maps, when they were drawn, and so on and so forth.  These are simple issues.  We don't want to be disruptive, but we have to protect the record by understanding what these items are and where they came from. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, Mr. Webster has a point which we would like to enforce.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  Well, all the exhibits were tendered to the Prosecution last week.  They were provided with the two sketch maps, which were also provided to them two years ago.  The only exhibit, in fact, which hasn't been shown to them is the exhibit headed "Defence sketch" -- well, you haven't seen it yet.  It's an exhibit of -- a skeletal exhibit of roads which is drawn from the maps as a sketch, and subject to all the criticism of that.  We haven't come to that yet.  

The document that I've just shown Mr. Baghel -- 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, looking at that document, can you confirm that it's a scanned, reduced version of the big map you just looked at of Kigali city; that's all it is?  
A.	To me it appears to be the same, but there's highlighted yellow one, I don't know what does it mean. 
Q.	The yellow roads are the principal roads, but that's the only -- in fact, that's a Prosecution document.  It's come to me through the back door.  So that's a Prosecution document I'm showing you from, I believe, another case.  So it's quite available to the Prosecution.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The point is not whether it's a Prosecution document or not, whether it originated in the Office of the Prosecution.  The point is that I have not seen it prior to this moment, and as a matter of procedure, I'd like to look at all the exhibits before the witness is asked to comment on them.  I'm not objecting to the admission of the item.  I'm looking -- I'm addressing procedural issues.  All of this could have been addressed outside of the courtroom.  I made our team accessible to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, as I -- 

MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphones overlapping)...through a number of issues. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As I indicated, the Bench accepts the point that you have made, and we have asked the Defence to comply with the point.  We think that's a perfectly reasonable position to have. 
MR. HOOPER: 
And I apologise to the Prosecution for placing these two matters before them late.  It's just, I'm afraid, how it came about.  And I think I've explained that the scanned, diminished map of the larger map, which is there to be seen, I only refound last night, which is why -- why it comes to you today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, there's no need to discuss it any further.  We accept the proposition put forward by Mr. Webster, and we would expect you to imply with -- comply with it.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, can I show you a final -- well, have we finished with that one?  Do you accept that that is a scanned -- a scanning, a diminished scanning, of the last document, of the larger map?  And you can compare the two, if you wish.  
A.	Yes, it appears to be the same, but I can make the final -- final comment only after comparing. 
Q.	All right.  Well, we'll have a little opportunity, I hope, to do that later.  
A.	And there is the point about the highlighted yellow ones.  I don't know what -- what does that mean here.  
Q.	Yes.  I think the highlighted yellow ones are the principal roads, aren't they, going in and out of Kigali?  Would that make sense to you, looking at it?  
A.	Here I'm noticing some more roads are there which go out of Kigali town to different directions.  
Q.	Very well.  
A.	So I think those roads have not been put in this map or maybe in that earlier map also.  
Q.	Very well.  Then I will invite you to do a better map and draw a better sketch and show us what's missing, in due course.  And perhaps you can come back and produce it. 

Can I show you, finally, a document headed "Defence Sketch" showing the main roads from Kigali city. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you applied to have those documents put in evidence?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I was hesitating with this one because of the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have not applied. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Because of the criticism he's made of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
And I thought it might be helpful, perhaps, not to move that in as an exhibit until perhaps Mr. Upendra has had the opportunity to look at it a little bit more closely, perhaps over one of the adjournments this morning.  And perhaps I can come back to that shortly or later this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So finally, Mr. Baghel, if you can turn to the document headed "Defence Sketch" showing the main roads from Kigali city, I appreciate you've only just seen that.  Going round from the top, road 1, the road to Byumba, road 2, a road going towards Deutsche Welte.  We'll come to a better explanation of all this in a moment.  Road 3 to Karama and road 4, the road east, eventually to Tanzania, I suppose, to -- east Kanombe camp and to the airport.  And the red are roads, and it's a skeletal map.  There are other roads within Kigali, of course, but these -- this sketch is tendered to indicate the main roads leading from Kigali north and east.  And the blue reflects rivers and streams in what is a very hilly area on which Kigali is built.  I couldn't show the hills, but it demonstrates perhaps some indication of hilliness.  Would you accept that that's a fair representation, in skeletal sketch form, of the main roads leading from Kigali city? 
A.	As far as -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
THE WITNESS:
As far as north-east area is concerned, it's a fair representation about the main roads leading out of Kigali, but these are not the only roads available.  There are some more roads.  And if you classify them as not leading, then it's okay, leading roads.  But there are some few roads also there which branching off at different places or branching in at different locations. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Right.  And I'll invite you -- I'll provide you with that sketch -- to add any roads that you say exist in that way.  I won't ask you to do it in court now.  I wouldn't impose on you like that, but I'd invite you to indicate any alternative routes relevant to this case.  As I say, I won't do that now.  You can do it in your own time. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm assuming that Mr. Hooper wants to move this in evidence at -- as D. 5, it would be?  What number would it be?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Five. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
For the record, Your Honour, I'm opposing introduction of this -- this sketch until I have had an opportunity to discuss it with -- with the witness.  None of these sketches are to scale.  I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Discuss it or examine him in re-examination?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would have to discuss it with the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He's giving -- he's giving -- he's in the middle of his testimony. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I understand, Your Honour.  I'm willing, if after a discussion with the witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But are you entitled to discuss with the witness?  He's in the middle of his sworn testimony.  You can examine him in re-examination.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If the Court is about to rule on the admission -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's been no application yet. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I thought Mr. Hooper was just making that application.  In fact, I started my questioning with asking him if he was -- if he was proceeding to admit it into evidence.  If that's not case, then I'll sit down. 
(Pages 1 to 18 by Sherri Knox)











1000H
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  On what Mr. Baghel has said, I'd ask that this be moved in evidence, and I accept that if there's any additions or assistance or help that he or the Prosecution can lend to the subject of access to Gikomero, then we welcome it, and this sketch will be seen in the light of that.  But Mr. Baghel has conceded that it is a fair representation of the principal roads leading out from Kigali, to the north at least, that he's opined that there are, in fact, some other routes, as I understand it, and I've asked him, when he has the opportunity, to indicate what those are.  We'll get a -- we'll get a D. 6B, perhaps, or Prosecution exhibit in respect of that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
At this point, I renew my objection.  If the witness is going to add other -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I've heard your objection, Mr. Webster.  We will mark this for identification as ID. 1, I think, and we'll rule on it after Mr. Webster's had a chance to examine the witness in re-examination.  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, looking at our Defence Exhibit 3, which would be the principal matter I'll be looking at just at the moment, the green shows upland areas, and where the map is in white, shows -- shows the valleys and lowland areas between those uplands.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, this manner of questioning is a bit irregular.  Is Mr. Hooper testifying and telling the Court what the map represents, or is he introducing it through the witness?  That's essentially the stumbling block that we've been coming up against.  If Mr. Hooper is testifying, that's one thing, but if the witness is testifying -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Mr. Hooper, the question was leading.  I know you're in cross-examination, but we do need to get the witness's answer on the record. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  I should -- at least my voice should have gone up a bit at the end of it.  I appreciate it.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you accept that the green area represents the highland area in -- the highlands area, the uplands area?  
A.	I don't accept it as it is, because when this map was shown to me few minutes before, I was asked to identify the relative locations; Gasabo, Ndatemwa, Kayanga, Gikomero, and others, and the principal roads.  So about the topography, about the green colour and white colour, I am not aware, and there is no index here in the map what does those colour mean here.  
Q.	Well, let me tell you, the green equals upland.  Looking at that, would you accept that?  
A.	Again, same thing.  I have -- I have travelled this area quite a number of times.  There's a mountain, yes, uplands, or kind of valleys, but exact locations of these areas where the mountains are there or valleys are there, I cannot confirm.  If this map is taken as an extract from some better map, like -- like the authenticated map, then I can say it seems to be, but by looking into the area (unintelligible) area, I cannot point those hills or the valleys on the map.  
Q.	How many times have you been to this area? 
A.	In my examination-in-chief, I told I have been to this area minimum at least 15 times or more than that.  
Q.	Let me ask you this:  Let me start with Gasabo.  Is Gasabo up the hill or down the hill?  
A.	If you refer Gasabo as the Gasabo secteur, then in Gasabo secteur, there's a territorial area.  There are some hills, some down hills.  So it's a mixture of both.  
Q.	Well, let me ask you this:  This area of Gikomero commune is a hilly area, isn't it?  
A.	Yes.  Just now I told it's a mountainous area, and it's hilly area.  There are few valleys and hills, a combination of both.  
Q.	And how high does this plateau reach?  
A.	The measurement of plateau, how high, I do not know.  Only I can comment from the map, which is the larger map which I gave you in the morning.  In that map, there's some indications about the height of various hills. 
Q.	To get to anywhere in Gikomero commune, you have to climb up a quite steep road, or roads, to get up there, don't you?  
A.	Kigali town is located in a valley and also on the hills around the valley.  So to go out of town to any side, either one has to climb the hill, and when the roads are there, the roads are not on very steep hill.  Roads have followed the area which is low-lying, like valleys, and that's how the roads have gone out of Kigali; like the road to Byumba side looks very flat because it's following, more or less, a river and the side valley, but on the side, one can see the hills.  
Q.	Let's start then with that road.  Let's start with the Byumba road -- with the Byumba road that follows the valley.  Which river valley is that it follows?  
A.	The river which goes to the north from Kigali, and I don't remember the name of the river exactly.  I think Nyabugogo river, but I cannot confirm.  If I see the map, the name of the river should be there in the map.  
Q.	Well, shall we have a look at your -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Shall we have a look at your map at page 8, and you can tell us what the name of the river is.  
A.	Can I see the larger map which I brought -- which I gave in the morning?  Because the map on 8, I cannot figure out where it is written.  Whatever I told, I told on the basis of my experience in Kigali and in Rwanda.  
Q.	Yes, I don't think any of us can probably see it.  So please do look at the bigger map.  
A.	In this map, which is a larger map, it's mentioned that Nyabugogo, N-Y-A-B-U-G-O-G-O, centres on the right side of the road which goes from Kigali to Byumba.  And more or less, the road follows this river in the valley, almost a flat valley on the right side.  
Q.	If we look at the -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Mr. Hooper. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	If we look at the Defence sketch map and, indeed, at your exhibit page 8, map of Gikomero relevant area, and E3, those three maps, perhaps we can see more clearly how it goes.  The road north to Byumba is indicated on D3 as a tarmac road, red with black spots on it.  If we look at the Defence sketch, that becomes road 1 -- or is represented by road 1 or route 1, the road north to Byumba and Kabuye.  And how far would you say Kabuye was from the point where you cross the bridge and leave Kigali town?  How far would you say Kabuye is?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, the interpreters have a problem because it seems that they would need the second sketch plan of Gikomero that Counsel is referring to.  
THE WITNESS:
(Inaudible)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me, please, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Hooper, the interpreters are complaining that it's difficult to translate your questions because they don't have a copy of that sketch.  
MR. HOOPER:
Of this one?  I thought -- I thought there were some copies given to them.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We do not have them.  We are sorry.  
MR. HOOPER:
I need to retain one.  There's one with Court -- I've printed out quite a lot.  So there should be some.  I don't know what's happened to them.  I haven't got any more here.  That's all I've got, I'm afraid.  

Kabuye is K-A-B-U-Y-E and is also on D3, the green map.  In fact, most of these places will be on the green map.  The skeletal map is just an extract with perhaps one or two added names to it which I'll spell.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But looking at D3 and your map and our tendered sketch, the first route out takes you out of Kigali through an area called Gatsata, G-A-T-S-A-T-A, Gatsata; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, as indicated in one of the sketch which is given to me by you, Gatsata.  
Q.	Well, do you know Gatsata?  I mean, it's, I suggest, a very well known exit point in Kigali.  Do you know it?  
A.	When you leave Kigali area to Byumba, through Byumba main road, Gatsata area is just a descent to the Kigali town.  So it's correct.  
Q.	And how far would you say -- how far would you say Kabuye is from Gatsata?  From the bridge as you cross into Gatsata, how far would you say that was?  
A.	Kabuye from the bridge should have been around six to seven kilometre.  In Kabuye where the sewer factory is there.  
Q.	Now, that road goes up following the river -- and just may I correct you on one thing or invite you to correct yourself -- it's right that the river doesn't flow to the north; it flows from the north, doesn't it?  
A.	I do not know the flow of the river, in which direction the water was there.  
Q.	When it rains, it's a torrent, isn't it, that river?  
A.	During the rainy season, I have notice sometime more water in the river, but exact things I can like -- like the exact thing, I cannot tell how forcefully that water was flowing.  
Q.	And it's a good tarmac road; is that right?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me, Mr. Witness.  May I ask you a question?  You had said earlier that Kigali was in a valley.  Would that assist in indicating if -- I don't understand.  The area that the river flows to Byumba, is there a difference in elevation between Byumba and Kigali?  Which would be higher?  
THE WITNESS:
Kigali is a town where there are few valleys, and then few hills on both sides.  And this valley passes almost one side of the town between Kimihurura, as a locality, and Kicukiro, then take a turns, goes toward Byumba road.  So it's a mixture of valley and a hill, but larger portion of town is on the hills, not in the valley.  Valley only -- I could recall there's only one road which goes along the valley and few houses on one side more, other side where there's a river like (unintelligible) kind of river, a small river, houses are less on that side.  So larger part of town is on the hills, not in that valley.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Indeed, Kigali town, have you ever heard it called the Rome of Africa, because it was built on so many hills?  Have you ever heard that said?  
A.	I've not heard this name, but it's on many hills.  
Q.	So we move from Kigali, hilly Kigali, out along the valley floor, up towards Byumba.  Eventually that road takes you to Uganda; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that -- that road leads to the border of Uganda.  
Q.	And when you leave Kigali town, you cross a bridge over that river, and you enter the place called Gatsata; is that right?  
A.	Yes, that's right.  
Q.	And on either side of the road as you leave Gatsata, there are hills; is that right?  
A.	When you leave Gatsata towards Byumba, on the right side there's a flat valley and a river, and hills are on other side of the flat valley and river.  That's on the right side.  But on left side, yes, hills start immediately almost.  
Q.	Well, when you leave -- when you leave Kigali, isn't there a big hill called Gisozi, a steep high hill on your right as you leave Kigali?  
A.	If you leave Kigali, there are many hills.  So the specific hill, I have not located which was that hill.  
Q.	Have you never heard of Gisozi?  
A.	Yes, I heard about a hill Gisozi which is around Kigali.  
Q.	Do you know where it is?  
A.	I have not located that hill physically because that was not of my concern or of my interest to locate the hill.  So I didn't locate specifically where that hill will come in the map or physically by going and noticing or viewing or looking at the hill.  
Q.	Very well.  If you just look briefly at D3 -- I hope I don't have to take too much time on this -- D3, as you leave Kigali on the Byumba --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, having raised the issue of time, I have found the geography lesson very interesting, but I trust we'll see its relevance to the case in due course?  
MR. HOOPER:
The relevance is -- and I think it right that I should perhaps state it now so that you can see, as it were, the geography of the case as well.  Part of the Defence case is this:  That at a time when Rwamakuba was meant to be up in the uplands of Gikomero, the roads leading there were cut off by military action.  And there are limited numbers of roads and limited access, and that is brought about by the road system, by the geography, and also, in terms of the cut, by military activity from the 7th of April onwards.  So the roads become very significant to this case.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And, Mr. Baghel, you appreciate that, don't you, that access to Gikomero at a certain time, or there not being access is a probable feature of this case; you know that, don't you?  
A.	About discussion whether I should comment on the basis of my experience of investigation in this case or the previous case in which I was also involved, Kamuhanda, Jean de Dieu, so I do not know which way because this is like commenting on the situation in 1994.  
Q.	Well, I'm not asking you to do that, merely that you are alert, as an investigator in this case, that one significant feature deals with access and the roads?  And that's why you've produced your own map, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, it's so.  
Q.	Right.  So let's get back, I'm afraid, to just a little bit of the geography because you're not sure where the hills are, are you?  
A.	I cannot pinpoint the exact location of the hill Gisozi.  Only I can see the map and tell you where this hill should have been there, but I have not gone to that hill to verify the hill physically.  
Q.	All right.  Let me ask you, on route 1, the road north to Byumba, there is only one way to get on that road, and that is over the Gatsata bridge; is that right?  
A.	To go to that road which identifies road number 1 or the tarmac road to Byumba, from Kigali town, that is the only bridge to cross.  And, in fact, this bridge in Gatsata town can be classified as part of the town because the area by name Gatsata and the town both are intermixing type, like continuous localities are there.  It's part of the town.  
Q.	So the answer yes is, yes, that's the only -- the only route onto that tarmac road up to Byumba.  

Now, you have, in your evidence -- let's deal with the Byumba road -- you provided a map that was in orange, had an orange line on it, illustrating the route that one could take from Kigali town to Ndatemwa, to Kayanga, Rutunga, and Gikomero secteur.  And I'm going to come to that, but first of all, I'm going to ask you this:  If you look at my sketch, D3, it illustrates -- or has on it, the name "Nduba," N-D-U-B-A, and can you confirm that that is the family home of the Accused, André Rwamakuba, approximately on that hill?  
A.	From the records, yes, Nduba was the place from which Mr. André Rwamakuba belong, but where was his house or home, I do not know because I have not visited the house.  
Q.	You haven't investigated that?  
A.	I have not visited his house.  I have done investigation on certain portion of the case.  So I cannot say where was his house in Nduba area.  
Q.	Not his house, his family house, where -- where -- where -- where his parents lived and where he was brought up for a while and where the chambre is, where the -- where the fields are, you haven't been there at all?  
A.	I haven't been to his house or his family house in that area.  I have passed through the road, but this road, not very frequently.  
Q.	Have you been to Nduba?  
A.	I've passed through Nduba and went to location L on my sketch, but during the mission when this map was prepared, during that mission, I did not pass.  That's why this distance from L to D through Nduba, I have not noted in my report, only this is just confirmation that the road exists from point L to point do (sic) through Nduba.  
Q.	Now, on my map, D3, if we go north out of Kigali, we come to a place which I've marked as the Nyacyonga bridge.  Do you know that bridge?  
A.	I know this place where the diversion take place to the right, which goes to Nduba.  
Q.	In fact, last time we met you didn't know it, and you didn't know that route at all, did you?  But you've been there since, I take it?  Is that the position?  
A.	Since last testimony, I have not gone on this road.  And as far as I recall, last time also I told -- I have not investigated or have seen the house of family of Mr. André Rwamakuba.  And when this report was made, the mission report, and it was signed on 8 November 2003, that time also I did not visit this road, but during my stay in Kigali, I been on this road on earlier occasion on few times, so that's why I saw this road as this road as existing road.  But not the distances, I have not marked.  
Q.	So you've been up that -- across that bridge and up that road towards Nduba; is that correct?  
A.	I have been on that road few years back, before 2003, before the preparation of this road -- this map.  
Q.	So the answer is yes?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Fine.  And coming out of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, it's about 10:30 now.  I don't know if you can find a convenient time so we can take a break. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, that would be convenient, and if there's any maps that anyone needs to look at, perhaps Mr. Baghel then will be in a position to let him see them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We'll break for about 15 minutes.
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1052H)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Baghel, we're going up to the tarmac road to Byumba.  We pass Kabuye, and we get to the Nyacyonga bridge which you know, and at that point, we're on the valley floor; is that correct?  And even a yes or no might be sufficient.  
A.	Yes, on the right side of the road.  
Q.	The Nyacyonga bridge is a bridge made of wooden logs; is that right?  
A.	This bridge I travelled few years back.  I did not document the kind of bridge, but in Rwanda, if you leave the tarmac road and on the unpaved road, most of the bridges are wooden bridge.  
Q.	And the valley floor here is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, during the break, I was asked to remind that the translators would like a break between question and answer -- the interpreters.

MR. HOOPER:
I was, in fact, mugged during the break by various interpreters, and I do apologise to them.  And, also, they hadn't got the maps and various other difficulties, and I'm sorry for that. We've sorted it out and fresh supplies, I hope, will be arriving in the department as soon as we can get to a printer.  And just while we're on that subject, just to clarify because they went to the booths misnumbered or misunderstood, the more detailed sketch map, the one with more information on it is D3, and the other document with less information on it is -- is D2.  And I'm also going to have to make an effort, I learned, to pronounce my Kinyarwanda words better than I've been doing, so I'll make that effort as well.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So the valley floor of this river, by the time you get to the Nduba turnoff there, it's a narrow valley, isn't it?  
A.	Wherever the bridges are there, the width of river at that point is comparatively narrow.  I did not go into such minute details while travelling, but it's logical to me, the width of the river should be narrow at that place where bridge was constructed or has been there.  
Q.	So the answer is yes, really?  
A.	Answer is yes, because bridge is there.  
Q.	And having crossed the bridge, you then climb up an unmade road, quite a steep road, is it not?  
A.	Yes.  After the valley there's a hill, so I had to climb through the vehicle.  So vehicle went up.  
Q.	And so if we look at our D3, would you agree that where, at Nduba, where the road leaves the valley floor, and you enter the green area, that fairly reflects, does it not, the fact that this is upland area?  
A.	Yes, it fairly -- fairly reflect that after the valley, there has to be hill or the area which is little bit at higher elevation.  
Q.	And between -- the difference between the valley floor and the height of Nduba up there is several hundred metres, isn't it?  
A.	I do not know about the measurements, about how much elevation is there.  
Q.	Well, would you agree it's several hundred metres?  
A.	Only I can comment on the basis of the map, which is the bigger map, fairly reflecting the height of few hills from that, but, again, it's a hill.  I do not know how many metres.  
Q.	If one continues up the road towards Byumba, you come to another route that can take you up to that part of Gikomero commune; is that correct?  And if it can be a yes or no, it may help.  
A.	Just during the break, I was looking into the map again, and I found, through the Byumba road, as the map has shown, there are at least six roads entering into Gikomero from the town, to the point K, which is pointed out in my sketch.  So, yes, there are few other places also which may lead to Gikomero area from the Byumba road.  
Q.	How many bridges are there over the river between Nyacyonga and the bridge I've indicated as Nkubana?  
A.	I do not know because I have not travelled on each road from Byumba road entering into Gikomero area.  And I have not surveyed the river also at how many bridges are there on this river between these two points.  
Q.	And by "bridge," I mean a bridge that could take the weight of a car, not just the weight of a pedestrian on foot.  How many road bridges are there?  
A.	I do not know how many road bridges are there on this river between two points.  
Q.	And from what you say, you've never been on any other route up into the Nduba plateau, other than the route at Nyacyonga and other via the route at via Nkubana bridge as indicated on the sketch; is that right?  
A.	In fact, I cannot recall, but I'm sure that I have not travelled on each road in this commune.  I have used two roads -- one road is very frequently which goes through Ndatemwa centre.  Other road only few occasions which goes via secteur Sha and secteur Nduba.  And I'm not -- so I cannot say all the roads, but I can say through the maps and while travelling on the road, looking the branches, roads going to different directions.  
Q.	On your map at page 8, if we leave the orange line at L, is that the road that takes you up to Sha, yes or no?  
A.	On my map, on page 8, the road which indicated by dotted line, on that road, secteur Sha and secteur Nduba both are there.  
Q.	If you leave the road on your map at L, that takes you up into Sha; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  If you leave the road at L, it will take to Sha.  But I -- again, these roads which are shown on the map are not the only roads.  
Q.	Well, you, I hope, can provide a map showing the other roads for us, will you?  
A.	That thing only -- those roads have been indicated in the larger map which I gave in the morning.  
Q.	Well, I invite you to help us a little better than that if you can.  

When you leave the road at L, which approximate, in my suggestion, at the Nkubana bridge, you cross the river by a road bridge, and then you ascend up to the plateau on a fairly steep road again; is that correct?  
A.	Logically, on the right of Byumba road, if you take any branch road, it will cross the river, cross the valley, and has to be steep road on the hill.  
Q.	If we continue up the tarmac road towards Byumba, we come to a place called Kajevuba; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	At Kajevuba, we find ourselves, on your map, at point K, page 8, the end of the orange road that you've indicated, and you then leave the road to tell us and five kilometres afterwards, we get to Ndatemwa centre, which is the scene of some allegations in this case.  Dealing with that road again, when you leave the tarmac road at K, you're on an unmade road that climbs steeply up to Ndatemwa; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, it's correct.  
Q.	And once you're there at the top of the massif, past Gasabo and onwards, when you're on the top of the hill there, the road runs, as do nearly all these roads in the green area on my sketch within Gikomero, they run fairly much on the flat once you're on the top; is that right?  
A.	When you leave Byumba road from the point K, on my sketch, page number 8, you go up, reach somewhere where it is written "Gasabo."  Then the -- then the road from Gasabo to Ndatemwa centre, J, and further.  The slope of the road is not much.  It can be said has fairly decent slope road, but it's on the hill.  That's how roads are made in the hills.  No road will go almost to the top of peak of the hill.  
Q.	All these places that are indicated by name on my sketch -- Gasabo, Rutunga, Kayanga, Gikomero -- they're all very small and poor settlements; is that right?  
A.	I do not know -- I do not know the meaning of "poor settlements," but I can say Ndatemwa centre as shown in the photograph, having few houses, shops and the area used for trading.  And Rutunga is little bit larger -- larger area, having more houses and more shops.  Kayanga is also similarly and similar person at Gikomero and others.  
Q.	Would you agree it's quite difficult to picture what it's like up there, the hills, the valleys, the kind of settlements that are there, without visiting the area?  
A.	Yes, I agree with that.  
Q.	Now, that first route that you took via Kajevuba and up to Ndatemwa took you, in November when you went, three-quarters of an hour to drive from the outskirts of Kigali city, itself; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, it's correct.  It took around 40 minutes to drive from the outskirt of Kigali to Ndatemwa centre by this road.  
Q.	And to drive on from there to Gikomero secteur, which is a continuation from Gasabo of the upland road, through Ndatemwa, through Rutunga, through Kayanga, to Gikomero secteur, altogether that took you an hour and a quarter, another 30 minutes after Ndatemwa; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, it's correct.  From Ndatemwa centre -- 
Q.	Which would be -- which would be, to state the obvious, a two-and-a-quarter-hour roundtrip; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, it's mentioned in my booklet the time which I took, and it should be around that, around two and quarter hours or so.  
Q.	And all these trips you did were in November, and that's the dry season, isn't it?  
A.	If I recall, November, when I undertook this trip, 5th November to 7th November, it was not raining on those days.  
Q.	Well, there's dry and wet seasons in Rwanda as there are here; isn't that right?  
A.	Yes.  The seasons are dry and wet, both.  
Q.	April is a wet season; is that right?  
A.	I do not know about the month of April because I can't recall.  
Q.	But you lived in Kigali, didn't you?  
A.	Yes, I lived in Kigali.  
Q.	And these trips that you went on, to measure time and distance, you conducted those trips in a United Nations, four-wheel-drive vehicle; is that right?  
A.	Yes.  All these trips I conducted by the vehicle provided by the office.  
Q.	Can I go to your next route, which is indicated by the blue line on your sketch and is represented on D3 by the road that runs from Remera in Kigali east, up via Karama hill, as indicated on the map, and then up to the words "Gikomero commune."  I think you'll agree, looking at the two, those are the same -- the same routes, your blue line and the road Remera, Rubungo hill, Karama hill, Gikomero commune, which is your D on your exhibit, page 8.  Does that look right to you, what I've just said?  
A.	Yes, the document D3.  
Q.	And you told us that to go from your point A, page 8 -- or on that route, I should say -- took you one hour to get to Gikomero secteur, that is, the place on the right of the sketch, just above where Lake Mahazi is indicated.  Mahazi, M-A-H-A-Z-I.  That was an hour's trip, or two hours return if you went back the same way; that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, it's correct.  
Q.	And if you went to -- and if you went to -- sorry.  Pause.  

And if you went to -- onward to Ndatemwa, that would be, again, another half an hour, making a roundtrip for you, in your UN vehicle, in a dry season, three hours return from your point in Kigali to Ndatemwa and back; that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, it's correct, because 60 minutes and 30 minutes, 90 into two, 180, three hours.  
Q.	Now, we come to -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	We come to your final route, your green route, taking us up through MNFE, and if you look at my sketch plan, D3, I suggest that that's the route that takes you off the main tarmac road near Kanombe; and then you pass up through Ndera, N-D-E-R-A, and up to Jurwe, J-U-R-W-E, where you join the upland road there, the road on the top of the massif, and you turn right to go round to Gikomero; and if you went to, as we can see, down to Ndatemwa; and that route took you 45 minutes to Gikomero secteur; and we know it's half an hour -- an hour and a quarter to Ndatemwa, making a total roundtrip to Ndatemwa of two-and-a-half hours, and to Gikomero, an hour-and-a-half; would you agree with that?  
A.	This road took me from number 10, which is in the town, to Gikomero secteur office G, 45 minutes, and from there, 15 minutes to Ndatemwa centre.  So 60 minutes into two, it would be two hours roundtrip. 
(Pages 19 to 29 by Wendy Molnar)



1115H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And just on that point, that is from an area called Remera that you start your measurement; is that correct? 
A.	If you see on page 9 the measurement is from number 10, which is a diversion to Kigali, Romongoni (phonetic) road, this for Kanombe airport. 
Q.	And if we look at your map, your sketch, or your page 8 exhibit, if we look at 9, your letter 9 and your letter 13, those are both Remera aren't they.  That is the area, it is Remera.   If you draw a line from your 13 to 9, that is the area in Kigali called Remera; is that correct? 
A.	The Remera is a quite large area in Kigali town.  
Q.	So, is the answer yes or no?
A.	So, roughly, you can say Remera.  But number 9 is the point where it is called Giporozo also.  On the right side Giporozo, left side Remera.  Number 13 point is in Remera.  Again, number 14 border is Kimironko.  So these are the clustered areas in the towns.  The distance cannot be more than two or three kilometres between 9 to 13.  So, these are really the areas located near by. 
Q.	And they are both called Remera, yes or no?  
A.	By and large you can say Remera, but if you go to the address of the person, if his house depends on which side of the road. 
Q.	So, there is effectively Remera left and Remera right? 
A.	Yes, it can be divided left, right or east, west, or whatever is to be given the name. 
Q.	Now, to get from your starting point there to the diplomat hotel, where the interim government was based for several days, would, in good traffic conditions, take you how long? 
A.	From this place which is around 9, 10 or 13, which is by and large known as Remera, to go to diplomat, one can reach in ten to 15 minutes, depending on the traffic conditions, and the number of vehicles on the road. 
Q.	And so to go from the diplomat hotel to this point where you start these road measurements and timings, we could say it would take another 20 to 30 minutes to do a return trip between those distances.  So, we could add, fairly, 30 minutes to all of the journeys you have measured going out of Kigali eastward, that is from the diplomat; is that right and fair? 
A.	That is a fair approximation to be added this time with the timings of each route denoted by pink or blue, because all of the measurements but from the point which is a little bit away from hotel diplomat. 
Q.	Now, of course, we don't know the moment where the diplomat is.  If you take the skeleton diagram, the one in red and blue and, if you look at that, we have Remera indicated at .4 on the right of that sketch.  And then the roads that enclose Kigali, and the Diplomat is indicated on the left of the page, above the area named Nyarugenge, and I hope I pronounced that correctly? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster is on his feet. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, we recall what Mr. Hooper is referring now is in as ID. 1, it is not an exhibit in this case.  I'm wondering whether it is appropriate to have the witness testify in relation to the map that you have directed his attention to right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, he can testify about it.  It is not an exhibit in the case as of yet, but he can be asked questions about it.  Mr. Hooper, do you recall that this is not in evidence as of yet. 
MR. HOOPER: 
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q. 	My ID 1 document, I appreciate the position, but perhaps Mr. Baghel can assist us as best he can.  Can you see there, I have indicated Diplomat Hotel, approximately, in relation, for example, to Remera, the Diplomat is on the other side of town, in other words, directly opposed to Remera on the other side of town.  Is that correct, can you help us on that?  
A.	In this sketch, which is obviously a rough sketch, if you see in Kigali, like town centre of the Kigali which is known as the centre in any town should be in the centre.  But here in this sketch the centre has been put almost on the left side of this sketch.  Even then, if that is so, it lies -- okay the Diplomat Hotel is in Nyarugenge area and to be replaced -- to be shifted to a little bit right where you are showing many doors crisscrossing each other, so that the Diplomat Hotel is in the town where the cluster of roads are there.  
Q.	Okay, well, just so -- can you see the map I am holding up? 
A.	Yes I can. 
Q.	Which is the full-scale map of Kigali town.  And do you accept that I put my finger here on the word Remera, from where you are can you see that or would you like me to come closer? 
A.	Well --  
Q.	Are you willing to take my word for that? 
A.	Yes, I can see. 
Q.	Remera, I will put my finger, there you are, R-E-M-E-R-A? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And here is the diplomat.  This is the diplomat there, isn't it, where the hotel is? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	All right.  So, that is reflected on that sketch you are holding, isn't it, the red and blue sketch?  Anyway, we are half an hour in good traffic conditions from the Remera to the diplomat.  We agree on that.  
A.	Yes, I agree on that but the similar time to be added then time to be calculated for other routes also, if not 30 minutes, at least 20 minute.
Q.	Now, between Remera, the point where you started your measurements, and the Diplomat Hotel at the relevant time, that is between the 8th or 9th of April, and the 12th of April, we will come to that because it is right that the government moved on the 12th to Gitarama on the 12th, isn't it, another place.  Can you just deal with that? 
A.	My concern is that if I comment on this question, it is not in my direct knowledge, it is on the basis of the statements I recorded or the literature I read. 
Q.	Yes, well I don't think would be in dispute that the government moved on the 12th to Gitarama which is, we heard from you, about 45 minutes or an hour, quite the other side of Kigali, not on any of these plans or maps we have looked at, but referred to last week by you on the road to Butare; it is a distance away.  But on the period 7th or 9th, when the interim government was -- well, I will start from the 7th, the 7th of April to the 12th, can you help us as to how many -- how long it might have taken anyone to go from Remera to the Diplomat Hotel, given the barricades and the killing and the soldiers, and the fighting; have you any idea? 
A.	Yes, again, in the context of my earlier concern, I would like to comment the time between 7th April to 9th April for a person traveling from Diplomat to Hotel Remera could not be more than 10 or 15 minutes in spite of barriers, because the authorities were moving at that time and barriers were not coming in the way, because those authorities were escorted or they would either bid soldiers or gendarmes or any other kind of person just to facilitate them. 
Q.	So you say -- how many barricades do you think were there, between Remera and the Diplomat; how many barricades were there? 
A.	I do not know exactly because, again, on the basis of secondary sources and other statements, there were barricades in Kigali.  As witnesses account differently that at almost each crossing there was a barricade.  But I do not know how many exactly.  And these barricades were not like proper barricades blocking the roads.  These were locally, locally erected with the help of local material available, like either putting stones or putting a wooden pole or just two or three persons standing with the traditional weapon. 
Q.	Obviously, you were not there at the time but you tell us that you have had access to some statements concerning this question of time to travel.  Can you produce any such statement to me at any time? 
A.	I do not know whether any statement has been recorded on a similar line to find the time.  My knowledge is on the basis of many statements, taking bits and pieces because during my stay of five years with ICTR, I have read many statements and I could gather this kind of information and can make conclusions, local conclusions.  The time should have been the same or similar for the authorities to travel from a place A to B, or from Hotel Diplomat to Remera. 
Q.	Are you in a position to share that information with me? 
A.	At the moment I don't have the details of the statements.  As I told you earlier while investigating one case or the other case or part of any case, we go through many statements previously recorded or I recorded myself a few statements, it may not be in this case, maybe in other case.  But at the moment I cannot give the names of any witness because I don't recall them. 
Q.	Well, I quite accept that, Mr. Baghel.  You don't want to carry all of this information in your head, but if you go away and sit in a quiet room for a while with access with some other documents, you would be able to provide me, will you, with a list with these statements? 
A.	Again, on this issue I have been pushed to get -- to get the records from OTP.  And I think this is true, I can raise the to the OTP management, if they allow me, because I am just an investigator, and it is an issue to be taken up by OTP management.  And certainly I will raise the issue with OTP management. 
Q.	Now, if we go back to D3, -- if we go back to D3, there is another route that I have indicated here which -- the second of the routes, which you haven't indicated and this is a route that also goes from Remera, and passes up by a place called Deutsche Welte which is spelt, I hope D-E-U-T-S-C-H-E-W-E-L-T-E, it's two words, Deutsche Weltie, with a W.  Do you see that indicated on D3? 
A.	Yes, I can see this route on the map. 
Q.	Do you know that route; have you been along it? 
A.	In my sketch, which is on page 8, this route is not mentioned because I also therefore -- this sketch is not adjusted, like all of the routes are not there.  And, specifically, I did not take this route but once I remember when I was in this area of Gikomero commune and while driving the car inside in the commune area, I got lost.  And I reach to Deutsche Welte from behind, from the Gikomero side.  And then I came to know, oh I have reached near Kigali town instead of going inside.  So, I can say if you enter into the area, roads are many, confusing.  If you take a wrong turn at one point you reach to other place, that is how I came on this route.   And instead of going through on my mission inside of Gikomero area, I came back to Kigali town from this route.  That is only time I saw this road. 
A.	That road goes up to a hill called Bumbogo, B-U-M-B-O-G-O.  That is a very steep climb, isn't it?  
A.	That is why I do not know the appearance about this route, because on this route when I was traveling I was lost because I was looking for  certain places and I came to Deutsche Welte from back -- from the rear side. 
Q.	You don't remember it.  It is quite a dramatic route to forget, isn't it.  It is very steep.  
A.	Yes, the road is on the hills, so routes are dramatic.  And when you travel only first time or maybe once, then you don't remember only thing, okay, that route is rough. 
Q.	And another route which divides into two, I believe, is from Rugende on D3.  Again going along the tarmac road east, one comes to Rugende, R-U-G-E-N-D-E, where there is a road that goes up to Gikoro, where on D3, it is marked Gikoro commune.  And I believe that road may split, there is a question mark there, which is why the road is not connected with Rugende in the sketch.  So, I believe there is probably another road there.  Do you know those, that route or routes? 
A.	There are many routes.  The route which I mentioned, which goes by Ndera, like N and N on my sketch, then these two routes I have taken on many occasions.  Another route, if I don't take the turn to the left from N, I go straight on the tarmac road for a few kilometers, I again take a left turn and I can enter into the area.  If I don't take that one, so, I go further ahead, which may be in your map of Rugende, take a left turn.  So there are many routes, and many of those routes I have traveled, but not on all of the routes.  
Q.	Sir, I suggest there were five or six routes for vehicles.  What are the routes, other than these, do you say that exist? 
A.	To go to Gikomero commune from this side, which is the east side, yes, there are five to six routes.  But if you go farther to Rwamagana.  Rwamagana is around 30 to 35 kilimeters and any road from the left, branching off from the tarmac road may lead to Gikomero commune because after Rwamagana, Lac Mahazi comes.  So, any road before Lac Mahazi can take the person to the commune area. 
Q.	I accept that.  In other words, if you go east towards Tanzania, there were other turn offs that can take you up that.  But in this road in common, the Remera Rugende road in common, you would have to go along that road to get to any of those routes; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct, and any route you can take, from any route to any other route you can branch off because there are linking roads between the routes also. 
Q.	Now, between Remera and Rugende, are you saying there are other roads that take you up to Gikomero, yes or no, with a vehicle?
A.	Your map, which is D3 seems to be confusing if you try to explore all of the routes.  I think the larger map, which I gave in the morning, is better to use because that map is having markings of the routes or the roads, I think with the red ink.  And if you analyse that map, you can find, yes, there are linking routes or roads. 
Q.	So, your map of Gikomero at page 8, what does that map of yourself intend to show us?  What is the purpose of that map that you have produced? 
A.	The purpose of this map is to show the relevant locations of Gikomero area which is question in this case; the relative location of this area from Kigali, and its accessibility from Kigali to various routes.  It is not like only two or three routes are there. 
Q.	So, on your evidence, would you agree that this is an incomplete map that you have produced us, because it doesn't show, you say, all of the vehicle routes; is that correct? 
A.	I have not traveled on each route.  
Q.	Okay. 
A.	As my purpose was not to examine each road that branched out on each route.  That is why I verified certain routes from that map, with reference to that; I found them to be correct.  And I saw on this -- in this space, which is Number 8, possibilities of different routes.  So, it is not complete, it is not exhaustive, that was told right in the beginning.  This shows a multiplicity of routes and approximate time taken. 
Q.	Do you think you are in a position to help us by producing another plan or sketch, indicating what you say are all of the road access points to Gikomero; is that something you can help us with, given time? 
A.	On this, again, I doubt that I will be in a position to map out -- because this is a very large exercise, and asking, either, taken an aerial photograph and showing that some of the routes are there, to have all of the area detailed photograph.  Otherwise, by mapping, I have to have certain basis, maybe I will go again on the map that we have, on the basis of that map and I will try to see some roads.  But it is impossible to see all of the roads, all branch roads, because in the towns you cannot travel on all of the roads and then map them down separately.  
Q.	So let me come back to my tendered sketch, the blue and white one which you have in front of you.  I use this because it is perhaps more straight forward in its way, I hope, to understand.

Aside from road 1, 2, 3 and 4, are you saying there are any other roads leading from Kigali town -- does it matter how they then break down into many, many different roads and crossroads.  Are you saying that there are more than these four routes to get up to Gikomero; yes or no?  
A.	This document ID 1 says main roads.  So, I can accept, yes, these are the main roads.  But my reservations are there that additional roads or additional features have been missed out, like the route number -- the road that goes to 4, which you pointed out as route number 4.  Before going out of Kigali town, where the junction is there, it is written to the east, Kanombe camp and airport.  One person, if he wants to join to route number 3, he can go following a street in Remera, not one street, many streets. 
Q.	I'm not sure I accept that, I accept it in part.  What I am asking you, sir, is this.  Looking at route 1, route 2, route 3 and 4, are there any other roads that you know of that lead out and up to Gikomero commune? 
A.	These are the main roads, I accept with that.  But I don't accept that this map showing all of the routes going.  This map is also not exhaustive, as I pointed out in my map, it is also not exhaustive. 
Q.	To get onto route 4, you have to pass through Remera; do you not? 
A.	I assume to get to route number 4, your question is that, to get on this road from Hotel Diplomat?  
Q.	My question is from --  
A.	From where?  
Q.	To get onto the road indicated as route 4, you have to go through Remera; do you not? 
A.	Again, on route number 4, you have to go through Remera, when you start from which place?  If you are starting from Kanombe, then you are not going on route number 4 passing through Remera.  That is why I asked, beginning from Hotel Diplomat again. 
Q.	Well, how else would you get there, travelling from the diplomat?
A.	Okay, from Hotel Diplomat, logically, yes, you pass through Remera.  And there are two main roads which will bring you from Hotel Diplomat.  Those have been shown in your map, one is passing through Sonatubes and then, again, going and meeting.  Another one is passing through CND.  

But from Sonatures, your map shows the branch road goes towards the bottom, if it is a map then it is towards south.  If you enter through Kicukiro, you can bypass the whole area, go around Kanombe airport, and go to route number 4.  So, I accept -- I agree with your proposal that, logically, yes, but if somebody wants to bypass Remera, he can bypass whole Remera after taking a turn from Sonatubes.   
Q.	And on our ID, we can see Sonatures, and it is marked, indeed, on your page 8 as 7, and on my sketch of the road as Sonatubes.  And your evidence is that you can -- if you get to Sonatubes, you can then take the road south, or a road that heads south through Kicukiro, K-I-C-U-K-I-R-O; do a left and go around the airport and pass the Kanombe Presidential Guard military, camp and go around that way; that's your evidence, and that was the position in '94 you are saying, is that right? 
A.	This is one of the possibilities of bypassing Remera if someone is having intent of bypassing Remera.  But, logically, the other two are the direct routes.  One is through CND and the other one is Sonatubes directly going there.  So, I gave a possibility to your question that one has to bypass -- one has to cross Remera in all of the cases.  I told you; in all of the cases it is not necessary. 
Q.	Right.  And you have given us an example of that route.  Can you think of any other route?
A.	In the town, there may be any other routes because towns and many localities are there. 
Q.	Would you be in a position to indicate to me, given time, with another sketch map what that position is, so that we have the position and I don't have to go through this perhaps as laboriously as I do.  Can you do that for me?  
A.	Unless I visit Kigali again, otherwise, I can do only by the map, because this is not a place where there are water bodies, like lakes or rivers, so only limited bridges. This is a continuous land (unintelligible).  So there may be many possibilities may be there. 
Q.	Perhaps, given time you could indicate those to me; that would be of great assistance to me, you understand.  Can do you that, Mr. Baghel?
A.	Again my position is that I will bring this position to the notice of management, because my work depends on the instructions given by the management. 
Q.	But we dealt with road one, and you agreed that the only route there was through and over Gatsata bridge, and I'm talking of people in vehicles.  The road that leads to the very steep hill climb, to Bumbogo that passes Deutsche Welte, passes the CND, which is marked on the tendered sketch, and also on your exhibit page 8.  CND -- can you explain what CND is? 
A.	CND, which is marked on number 1, on page 8 on my sketches, this is the parliament building.  And when we travel on this road from Kigali town to Remera side, which passes through CND, it is on the left side of the road.  
Q.	And that is the parliament building? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And in April 1994, the parliament building had been given over to the forces of Paul Kagame and the RPF, as their command headquarters, and their barracks; is that correct? 
A.	Again, on the basis of various statements and my knowledge to various sources, RPF -- one battalion was housed in this parliament building.  And the whole building was not given to RPF, I think half of the portion where RPF was there, and it was after negotiations and during the peace process as the Arusha Accords. 
Q.	And they were there with their weaponry, their light and medium weapons; is that correct? 
A.	I do not know the military logistics which was with them. 
Q.	In Remera stands the main football stadium in Kigali called the Amahoro stadium indicated on my sketch.  And just about visible to the naked eye on your map, page 8, just to the right of where number 8 is to be found.  One can see there the shape of a stadium-typed shape.  And that is the stadium.  And in April 1994 was that the headquarters of the United Nations's forces in Rwanda, UNAMIR? 
A.	In 1994 where (unintelligible) -- hotel.  On the side of Amohoro stadium there is Amohoro hotel.  And in the same building, ICTR Kigali headquarter is there.  This building was the headquarters of UNAMIR.  For the troops which were deplored at certain and certain locations, I think, part of UNAMIR forces were in Amohoro stadium also. 
Q.	President Habyarimana's plane is shot down, as we know, on the night of the 6th of April.  Shortly after that, is it right that this fighting, certainly from the next day, between the RPF and the government forces, the FAR, is that correct? 
A.	Again, it is on the basis of my understanding of various records or various (unintelligible) that after the death of the president on 6 April 1994, shortly after the hostility between RPF and the government forces did not start.  If you want me to comment on the situation in Remera, or around Amohoro stadium, then also I can give my opinion how things double up in this area.  But, again, it will be only my understanding, as I am not a factual witness for all of these things.  
Q.	As far as I know, the Prosecution are calling no factual witnesses of these events in Kigali, and of the capacity for people to realistically move through, what were military contested areas.  Having heard your evidence, I am not sure that I consider you a source, with respect, of this information.  But I will ask you this, in your review of material, I take it that you have had access to, first of, the UNAMIR documents that were produced contemporaneously at the time, the telegrams, for example, to the United Nations in New York, the KITBAT, that is the UNAMIR contingent, contemporaneously recorded records, and the KITBAT report on the military situation from the 6th of April to the 30th.  I take it, you have seen those documents; if not, can you let us know? 
A.	I have not seen all of the documents, but I have not reviewed all of the -- all of these documents which were from UNAMIR, in an exhaustive way.  Because my opinion will be based on some documents which are part of the Prosecution, either one or the other case, and about the situation around Amohoro, the stadium.  I did some work in -- quite a considerable amount of work in the previous case Karemera (unintelligible), so my opinion will be based on those thinks. 
Q.	Well, so let me, first of all, gage your capacity, really, in terms of this aspect of things.  Have you read the basic document, the KITBAT report, this document? 
A.	I have not read that document. 
Q.	Right.  Have you read the outgoing telegrams and faxes from UNAMIR? 
A.	Again, I have not read all of them, only a few selected ones, depends on case to case. 
Q.	Have you read the outgoing UNAMIR telegrams and faxes for the period, or any part of the period from the 6th of April to the 20th of April? 
A.	I have not read all of them. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm objecting to this line of questioning on the basis of relevance.  Mr. Hooper can elicit information from the witness, he can ask him if knows something factual in relation to the case, but now what he has read and what he has not read, that is not an issue here.  If he wants to know when the troops left the CND building, if the witness knows that he can answer that.  He shouldn't have to go through a litanies of questions of what he has read and what he has not read. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I will not stop this line of questioning as yet because it seems related to the question which the witness had earlier been asked about the comments made of hostilities between the RPF and the FAR forces.

Yes, Mr. Hooper 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you recall which of these telegrams you have made? 
A.	I cannot recall the specific telegrams, because I was never asked by the management to do thorough research on this aspect.  That is why -- that is why I pointed out that my opinion will be only my opinion on the basis of limited material or selected material. 
Q.	And so far, that material seems to have avoided the contemporaneous documents, I'll make that document, and ask you about another series of document.  Have you seen the military situation reports that were compiled by the intelligence service of the Belgians.  They, of course, were on the ground in Kigali, very much so, their reports that were sent back to the appropriate department in Brussels, again, contemporaneous documents.  Have you seen those, and read those?
A.	I have not read Belgium intelligence reports, only I came to know that some reports were there and they were sent to ICTR later on. 
Q.	So what reports have you read, could you just nominate them for us? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I would objection to that question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will allow the question. 

Do you have another question.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Which reports have you read if you can help me with --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The reason is that the witness has said that he has read some reports, and it is reasonable to inquire which ones he has read. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
As I told you in the beginning, as a part of investigations, or in been working with ICTR for the last five years I have read some reports, one way or the other way, but at this moment I cannot recall which report I read, because sometimes it was just cursory scanning on the reports, sometimes going through in detail and it depends -- it was all depending on the cases, or the lead which I was pursuing. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  Well what kinds of reports were these and what were they, United Nation's reports, were they -- what were they? 
A.	Our evidence in the database is having many reports, like UNAMIR (unintelligible) -- newspaper clippings, Human Rights Watch reports, and similar other material including statements.  So it is a continuous process, so I cannot give you a list of the reports which I have read, because I have not written any papers or any documents so that I can say to my document is on the basis of these reports. 
Q.	Let me finally ask you this on this particular subject, what, if any, military reports have you read? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm objecting to this question, Your Honour.  This is the same line of objection, when Mr. Hooper began his questioning on this issue; he asked the witness did he know what time the hostilities began between the RPF and the government forces.  The witness gingerly answered that question and clarified that he could only give an opinion based on secondary sources.  Mr. Hooper then went on with a litanies of questions about what reports he had read.  Well the witness has already stated that he did not do an exhaustive review of the materials, that he could only provide an opinion based on secondary sources.  And we have listened for the last ten minutes, question after question over what records he has read and what reports were available.  It is completely irrelevant at this point.  So, I'm suggesting that this line of questioning come to an end. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we think you can ask the witness whether he has read any military reports. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, have you read any military reports? 
A.	I have not read any military reports and I don't recall, because I have never worked on military files also. 
Q.	So, you are not in a position, I take it, to confirm that both of Sonatubes and of RWANDEX from the 7th, 8th of April there was intense fighting between FAR and RPF over the next week?  You are not in a position to confirm that for me? 
A.	Yes, I am not in a position to confirm, because I am not a factual witness for that. 
Q.	If it was the case that there was intense fighting there with mortar fire, casualties taken by the UN, for example, and other forces, there would be no route through Sonatubes and there would be no route through RWANDEX, would there? 
A.	About the routes, I have given the possibilities.  And my sketch is drawn on the basis of my traveling in 2003 and around in that year.  So, in 1994 which route was available or not I cannot comment at all. 
Q.	And you cannot confirm that by the 9th of April, the 9th of April, UNAMIR were reporting that the RPF had captured the area between the CND, the hospital, that is the Faycal, that's F-A-Y-C-A-L, around Amoharo -- Amohoro, sorry and Meridien, that is the UN area was taken over by the RPF, all of that quarter of Remera was in RPF hands very quickly, you can't confirm that? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Objection to the question, Your Honour.  Mr. Hooper is in effect testifying through his question to this witness.  The witness has already stated that he has no factual information about the position of troops, the commencement of fighting and so on and so forth.  It is not a question that this witness is competent to answer, so he should not be asked the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness can say yes or no. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
With all due respect, Mr. Hooper's question includes information; whether the witness answers yes or no, the implications left on the record is that the information imparted by the question is accurate, and that is what I am objecting to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness can answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot comment on this question, but I can give my opinion again.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you confirm from what you have seen and read that the RPF very quickly reinforced their battalion of men at the CND building by bringing soldiers from the north --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Hooper, you can't over do this in light of the fact that the witness has indicated that he has not got any source of information on these issues. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you know an investigator who does have any information? 
A.	I do not know about this thing. 
Q.	Have you ever come across anyone who has any knowledge of the RPF advance into Kigali town from the time that you have been working for five years on this case, have you ever come across anyone who you can say to me, Well, I think Mr. So and so might be able to help you? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm objecting to the question, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
On what grounds, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The testimony of this witness is not an opportunity for Mr. Hooper to conduct Defence investigations if he is looking to put that type of information on the record, he can put it on during the Defence case or he can call his own witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All he is knowing is if he knows an investigator who knows information.  He can say yes or no. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The question is irrelevant in the context of this witness's testimony, Your Honour.  If the witness can give the information, and can answer the question substantive that is one issue.  But it is not appropriate for Mr. Hooper to say to the witness, tell me who else knows or who might know, this is not -- the witness is not here for investigative purposes.  He is here to introduce information about the photographs and the case.  This is not an opportunity for Defence investigation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, all of my questions I hope were relevant or sought to lead to a relevant answer.  They are all bought, I think, properly under Rule 90.  They all deal with the nature of my case.  And the questions that I am asking here, which deal with access, is exactly the area, in any event, whether it is part of my case or not, which of course it is, is exactly and precisely one of the principle reasons why this witness was called.  And he has provided already documentary material relating to access.  And it is in respect of that that these questions are being put.  They are being put, because it is a significant part of the Defence case, that there was no reasonable access to the heights of Gikomero from the 7th of April onwards due to the military, due to the fighting.  

And in order to do that, we are going do have to examine the routes.  We are going to have to exam them in the context, and he can't provide this information, where the fighting was, to support this contention.  But I would also put it in this way, we are raising a matter; it is not for the Defence to prove the negative, it is for the Prosecution to proof a positive.  It is for the Prosecution, given that this has now been demonstrated to be a Defence point, to bring that evidence, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that access wasn't impossible.  So we have got a significant lie of the land ahead of us.  And I think it is appropriate that I paint that picture as clearly as possible at the outset of this case.  

But returning to the essential matter at hand, these are Rule 90 questions.  The witness has been brought in this particular area, and these questions, it is my submission, are appropriate and not inappropriate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Hooper, we will allow this question; but it is clear you cannot push this too far because the witness has already explained the state of his knowledge, or lack of it.  So we will not allow you to go to the point where are harassing you the witness, and it is almost at that point 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sorry, Mr. Baghel, I hope I am not treating you too unkindly, it is not my intention.  Did you -- can you indicate any one from among your colleagues and investigators who would perhaps be in a better position then you in helping us in the military position in that week or two in Kigali, do any names spring to mind? 
A.	At this moment no name is coming to my mind.  I will bring this fact to the notice of OTP management. 
Q.	I am coming back now to a matter that was raised last week, and that is other investigators that have worked on this case.  Would it be possible to help us, whether there is a record of the work that people do on a case or in other cases, and perhaps develop a degree of expertise with facility to documents, is it possible to provide me with a list of investigators with particular knowledge of the investigations the aspects of the investigations? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, he has not said that such a list exists. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Does such a list exist?  Is there a method that records the work that people do, investigators? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm objecting to this line of questioning, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper -- sorry, what is the reason?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
On the grounds of relevance.  It is not a relevant question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, there is a context here and you see me struggling to hang points on this particular witness, even in areas where he has declared he hasn't got the knowledge to respond.  The Defence, in my submission, has every right to have produced before them a person who can answer relevant questions dealing with this case, and with the aspects of the Defence case that they can assist with under Rule 90.  It is not sufficient to produce someone who lacks all of this information; that is not assisting the Defence and it is not assisting the Chamber.

Now, my questions are aimed at trying to discover whether there are, in fact, other parties who can assist me and the Chamber, where Mr. Baghel has declared a lack of capacity to do that, and with respect of which that lack of capacity touches upon significant aspects of the Prosecution case and the Defence case.  And, of course, I can put questions, and have a duty to in respect to the Defence case.  And the clearer I indicates what that is, and it parameters, the more I hope I am assisting the Chamber.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is -- if I can request that Mr. Hooper direct us to the paragraph in Rule 90 that he is referring to, because I see nothing in the text of the rule that requires the Prosecutor to produce any particular set of witnesses or to produce witnesses that should be of assistance to the Defence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is not quite -- the question is not really about the Prosecutor in this case.  This is a question to a witness, if he knows who the other investigators are.  I thought that on Friday of last week -- on Friday you had stated that there was no legal objection to that question.  It is just a question, as far as I can see, who are the other investigators. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm responsing to Mr. Hooper's last submission, Your Honour, I believe he stated quite clearly that he was relying on the Rule 90 for the proposition that a Prosecutor must produce a witness who could answer his questions in response to the substantive matters of the investigation.  And I'm asking him to refer me to the specific provision.  

I renew my objection, the question is irrelevant, and I am objecting to it on that basis, the Court has already ruled, but I was responding to Mr. Hooper's last submission. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think it is necessary to follow that argument, because there is clearly no obligation for the Prosecutor to call any particular witness.  I think the Prosecutor the discretion as to what witnesses to call, So, I don't think we need to have argument on that issue.  But I do think the question as to who -- if he knows the other investigators is a relevant question.  He can state whether he has the knowledge or not.  

Can you Mr. Baghel?  
THE WITNESS:
In this respect I do not know which investigators have more knowledge.  Only I can tell that in Kigali things are divided as for the groups.  So I can give the names of the people who are in the Butare team.   But this will be just a guideline, because yesterday I found a message -- no, that message came on my e-mail a few months back about the reorganisation of teams.  On the basis of that, I can say who is on the Butare case team. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So can you provide a list of names of people who have worked on this case, or on cases dealing with events in Gikomero and events at Butare hospital? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, is it necessary to have that on the record in this case?  
MR. HOOPER: 
It need not be on the record, he can provide me with a list of names outside of court, or even Mr. Webster can, of course.  There is no objection to that, but it may provide us with the facility to go see these people and we will have that option. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, it is now 12:30, our time for our lunch break and this may be a convenient time to stop.
(Court recessed at 1230H)
(Pages 30 to 44 by Donna M. Lewis)






















(Court resumed at 1407H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And while we are waiting for the witness to enter the court, Mr. Hooper, now that the witness has given evidence that the investigative names -- the names of the investigators exist, we do not think that you need to have the names on the court record.  It doesn't assist us any further in our judicative processes.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, is that something that he can follow up with you outside of the court?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Is the Court ordering me to do something?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I was asking whether it was something he could follow up with you outside of the court. 
MR. WEBSTER:
We can discuss it, but in view of Mr. Hooper's questions and my objection to the question, I think the Court should give a specific order of what we should do so I know clearly what -- how we move forward on that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if it becomes -- if an application is made then we will make an order.  I don't think an order is necessary in this circumstance, so I trust that your discussions will not make it necessary.  

Yes, Mr.  Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	So just dealing with that -- that last point, Mr. Baghel, I'm merely inviting you to produce a list of those people who were investigating both Butare aspect and the Gikomero aspect, not necessarily particular to this case, but focussed on massacres at Gikomero, which is the subject matter of this case, and massacres at the Butare hospital and selection of parties at the préfecture in Butare.  

Now, over the luncheon adjournment, I don't know if you had the opportunity to look at the CD that was produced -- you had the opportunity, did you -- did you take the opportunity?  Did you manage to find a laptop to access it?
A.	Good afternoon.  During the lunch break I managed to see the CD on my desktop in my office, and it contains more or less the same documents which were given to the -- given by the Defence to me in the morning session. 
Q.	So can I formally exhibit that CD with the electronic format of the maps or sketches that are on it, which I think are Defence -- there's a difficulty here at the moment, because they include not just Defence 2 and Defence 3, but also the tendered document, which is the blue and red skeletal document and the other -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You made the application, we will rule on it after Mr. Webster has re-examined the witness.  So you would just remind us to do that.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  In relation to the large map that needs to be moved as an exhibit, I'd ask that be done, but we are also interested that it be -- that the relevant part of it, not all of it, but the Gikomero-Kigali nexus part of it be scanned so that we all have a copy of that.  Now, that's not -- that's a facility I think that can be organised, but I understand from court management, if we move it as an exhibit now, that might create a problem.  I'm unclear as to quite what the position is.  If we can move it as an exhibit and if it can then be scanned, then -- then obviously that's the preferred position.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry -- 

Mr.  Hooper, once the map is tendered as an exhibit it has to remain in the custody of the registrar.  The registry believes that you have access to a scanner and we could defer the formal tendering of the relevant scanned section until you've had an opportunity to undertake that task.  
MR. HOOPER:
I -- I don't have access to a scanner.  We possess a scanner, but someone's lost the software to it, so we have a very nice machine and no software.  But I understand a scanning facility exists that is part of the general court material.  Would it be possible to move this as an exhibit and then we can -- then we can arrange or have arranged for the particular part of the map that's particularly relevant to be scanned so that we all have access to -- to it?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly, that's quite possible.  The registry can do that, but I will just let you know that once we have it as an exhibit, it remains in the custody of the -- of the Court.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, well, if that's the position, we are content with that.  And formally that is a 1 to 50,000 scale map that is --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Perhaps the witness could describe it, so it can be put on the record. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  Perhaps I can help -- help.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you accept that's a 1 to 50,000 scale map ordnance survey map?  
A.	This map, if I have a look again, then I can describe the scale and the other details.  
Q.	And if you look at the very top of it, it gives details as being produced for UNIMIR 2, and it was made, as far as we can see, post-1984 because there is a reference to that date on it.  
A.	This map is having a scale of 1 to 50,000; part of the UNIMIR 2 region of Kigali and the CD (unintelligible) 723, seats 16, 17, 23, 24.  And apparently on the left corners it is written as, "Reprinted by Canadian Forces, mapping and charting establishment."  After that, again it's written, "Produced in cooperation with the Belgium GS3 GEO."  And this map, I got it from evidence unit and it was copied by the evidence unit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.  What is the exhibit number?  
MR. FRY:
D. 1, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
D -- no, no, not 1. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, this was the one.  I do apologise.  Thank you very much.
(Exhibit No. D. 1 admitted)  
MR. HOOPER:
And finally with the map at this point, if Mr. Baghel could just be shown the single page, which the interpreters won't need, of the map that is lying on the desk by court management there.  And if he could just be shown that -- the Prosecution's here -- and this is merely an enlarged scanned -- a scanned enlargement of the -- of the map that -- which has already been the subject of an admitted -- I think it's our 5 -- Defence 4 or 5, was it?  Four -- Defence 4, this is an enlargement of part of Defence 4.  I've only got a single page because the scan -- the -- I'm missing the scanned record of this.  But, again, hopefully once it's moved in as evidence we can arrange for that to be again scanned in this enlarged form. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And looking at that, Mr. Baghel, is that right?  That is merely an enlarged scanned image of the map that was previously copied as our Exhibit 4.  It shows Gikomero and it shows the hills of the elevation there.  And it can be related to the sketch, our sketch 5, for which it forms some of the basis -- much of the basis of sketch 5 -- I mean, sorry, sketch 3.  
A.	This map -- this map which is claimed to be enlarged after scanning, but I cannot make out in this scan which portion of the other sheet has been scanned and after that enlarged.  And by that enlargement, it's been in a new form for the whole map or maybe some mixtures.  
Q.	Can you just compare it to the area of Kigali and Gikomero on the -- on the scan?  I think you'll see that it's pretty apparent what it is.  
A.	Yes, I can make out that this map seems to be enlarged, a small portion from the -- another map, which is given to me.  But I cannot comment whether the locations are exact or not on this map itself, because certainly in a larger map, more features are there compared to -- on this map, which is given to me on A4 sides.  
Q.	Well, it's -- it's -- it's a scanned enlargement.  It's merely a photograph, isn't that right?  It's effectively a photograph of a map.  There's no difference except that it's only one part of the map and it's been blown up so that we can see the detail in that part more clearly; that's what it is, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, it seems to be there.  The map which is given to me just now, it's been enlarged from a small portion. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, on that basis, can that be exhibited?  I think that will be Defence 6.  If that can be admitted into evidence.  Are we up to 5 still?  5, sorry.  
MR. FRY:
The next exhibit will be Defence 5.  Do you have copies for the other parties?  
MR. HOOPER:
No, I'm afraid, as I explained, this was scanned into a scanner, and I don't have -- I don't have the original electronic image anymore because that scan has been, in effect, lost to us. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we just see it first, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I think once it's seen, it will become plain as to what it is, and we hope to get it scanned again once it's in evidence.  

And can I just clarify again, the provenance of that image comes as an expanded, of course, magnified part of the original map which hasn't been exhibited, which I hold and which my friend, Mr. Webster, inquired about as to when it was printed, and there's a reference here to first edition 1998.  So, I think that's it's source.  The date of the map is 1998.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted as D. 5. 
(Exhibit No. D. 5 admitted)
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  And before we -- I'm sorry. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I suggest that we just make Xerox copies of that and that way we have a record of everything that's going in, and that should be fairly simple to arrange by the -- by the registry.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, we'll try to get it scanned in colour too because it's more helpful, I think, because it's clearer.  But certainly photocopies can be made and we can do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And just before we leave this morning's matter, can I remind you, Mr. Baghel, that you've been invited to add any other roads that exist that link this area with -- with Kigali that are vehicle worthy.  And I pass on from our discussions of this morning and come to, I hope, briefly some specific aspects of the Gikomero commune area.  Dealing first of all with Ndatemwa, did your investigations reveal that there were three dwellings in Ndatemwa that belonged to families who were ethnically Tutsi?  
A.	I do not know this fact.  
Q.	In Kayanga, you had indicated you -- to you some mass graves, and the fact of the mass graves is accepted.  Can I ask you, have you seen or obtained exhumation reports relating to those mass graves?  
A.	I did not obtain any exhumation report and I came to -- to know the fact about mass grave through the secteur conseiller.  
Q.	Are you aware that there are exhumation reports relating to that?  
A.	When I carried out this mission my task -- tasks were specific.  Similarly, like the point was raised yesterday about Butare hospital -- task specific.  So I did not obtain an exhumation report and I'm not aware -- I did not inquire.  But about Butare hospital, I carried out a search yesterday, on the weekend and I found the exhumation report in the video cassette in the evidence unit.  
Q.	I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that.  You found what document?  
A.	About Butare hospital exhumation, the point which was raised yesterday, and if I remember correctly, I told that I did not inquire about the exhumation report.  Then, during the weekend, I'd carried out some search in the evidence unit database and I found the exhumation report about the Butare hospital mass grave.  Even I found a videotape for that.  Now, with respect to Gikomero, the task was very specific on that day; to draw the sketch and to -- and to have some photographs.  So I did not inquire whether exhumation reports were available in the secteur office or not, so I do not know about this fact.  
Q.	Can I take you then, please, to -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Counsel. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I take you, please, to page 11 of the bundle dealing with Ndatemwa and Gikomero centre and looking at the sketch there, on the right of sketch B, Gikomero centre, of -- you're driving along the road that runs from -- from Kigali, going north across that part of the commune towards Kayanga, the -- the main road would take you along where there are circles containing the letters B7, B6, B2, B1, would it be fair to say that that would be the main road with Gikomero centre itself being a deviation, as it were.  You'd -- you'd have to turn off to go down to the centre.  
A.	This aspect about the road on this sketch B, page 11, to me, both seems to be the main road.  If somebody wants to go to the secteur office, then he will take a road B1, like, coming from Kigali side then B7, B6, B2 and bypass Gikomero centre.  If somebody wants to go to Gikomero centre, he will take B7, B5, B4, B3 and then go to B1.  Both roads are fairly -- in good condition, and if you see the distance from B7 to B1, it will remain more or less the same.  
Q.	You don't agree then that it might be the case that if you were driving along that road you could quite easily just go straight past Gikomero centre and not know it's there?  
A.	It depends again, because the turn, the diversion which is B7, point B7 where it's a fork, the angle is not much there.  In one of the photographs, I think this has been shown; that both roads look the same.  It depends on the driver, which road he wants to take.  The distance is in the middle of 100 metres.  
	100 metres is not a big distance between B6 and B5 approximately.  
Q.	B5 represents the then home of Witness GIN; is that correct?  
A.	In the sketch, house of the Witness GIN is shown by H3.  B5 is the location from where few photographs were taken.  
Q.	I see.  I'm just going to -- to pass up to you a composite photograph that has been made, which I will exhibit, I hope, through you this afternoon.  I only want to deal with it briefly.  But this is an opportunity for me to exhibit it.  
MR. HOOPER:
And, if the witness could be shown the document.  The Prosecution have seen it and there's one original and there's two photocopies.  If the witness could be shown that to identify it, then if it can be shown to the Judges, please.  
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	And this is a -- you're being shown a composite photograph, Mr. Baghel.  Can you just identify it for us  when -- when it comes to you.  Do you recognise that as being a composite of photographs showing Gikomero centre?  Do you have a difficulty with that?  
A.	Just -- I'm trying to figure out from which angle these photographs have been taken.  
Q.	May I ask you as you look at that, how many times have you been to Gikomero centre?  
A.	Quite a number of times.  I cannot recall, but at least more than half a dozen times.  
Q.	Well, can you then agree that is a composite of photographs at that centre?  
A.	Yes, it appears to be the same.  
Q.	And looking at it, the right-hand side has the area of GIN's house; is that right?  
A.	That is what I was trying to make out, but I could not locate the house of GIN in this photograph.  
Q.	Well, it's at that end of the village.  Would you be happy to accept that?  
A.	Yeah, it was at the end, there was a road.  
Q.	And we can see from your photograph 12, at page 19, that GIN's house is just a little set back from the ordinary building line; is that right?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So, we have a clear image of -- well, a clear image of that house in photograph 12, page 19.  I think you've accepted that document as -- as falling within the description I've given it.  A composite photograph of Gikomero village or business centre, on the right, GIN's home and to the left we have the houses stretching away towards, but out of sight of the Gikomero secteur office.  And I make the distinction between Gikomero commune office and the secteur office.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr.  Hooper, I don't really want to slow you down at all, but we haven't got the witness's answer.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.  There was -- there was an occasional nod, I thought.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that -- would that be right?  Going from the right, the location of GIN's home, moving to the left, towards the secteur office, but out of sight of the secteur office, and generally showing the commercial centre.  Would that be right?
A.	Yes, it's right, but in this photograph, house of GIN is not seen.  So if you take the first house, which is seen with the shade in the starting -- in the beginning of the house, that should be the house after GIN house.  So right side is okay.  Left side -- if you take last house, then the secteur office will come, which is not seen at all in this.  
Q.	I'm going to come to the secteur office in a moment.  
MR. HOOPER:
I wonder if that original photograph could go to the Judges and -- and then I'd request that it be exhibited.  Thank you.  

There are some photocopies but only one in the colour original, and the original photographs are available for inspection if anyone needs to see them.  

If I can better relate it to the plan you have, it's a photograph that tries to capture the area between B3 and B5.  And the photographs are taken from about the position of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster is on his feet.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Hooper is testifying; he should be sworn and take the witness box, and then he can put all the photographs that he wants, Your Honour.  But, I mean, most of the direct examination of this -- most of the cross-examination of this witness has been his own testimony where the photographs and sketches are concerned.  This completely distorts what the location looks like.  I can deal with this in my redirect of the witness, but for the record we are objecting to the admission of this photograph. This -- it would have been more honest to give us the Xerox copy than to give us a scanned photograph that purports to be one wide-angle shot, when it clearly is not.  
This was assembled by taking three or four -- it looks like maybe even five or six photographs and stretching them together and makes us -- gives one the impression that you are in the centre of a huge public place when, in fact, the area is quite small.  

So, for the record, I'm objecting.  If the Court is going to exhibit it, then I will deal with it on the redirect.  But this is a clear distortion of what the area looks like. 
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if I need to respond or perhaps I do.  I rather bridle at the suggestion that it's a clear distortion; it certainly isn't produced in that way.  It has the defects of a composite photograph, but we say it does actually fairly reflect the locus in quo of some of the allegations you're going to hear.  It was, one can see without commenting if you're looking at the original photograph, taken from -- taken from a series of photographs, taken from a fixed point, and then obviously there are angles -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I think you've said enough at this stage.  We have had the answers of the witness to your questions.  We could defer making our ruling until Mr. Webster has had a chance to re-examine.  But we've already heard what the witness has said, and we'll make a decision on the basis of his evidence.  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Thank you.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, also in your -- just before we leave Gikomero, that -- that little area there, have you ever gone and tried to speak to the people who live there about what happened?  The people who live, say, in those houses, that we saw in the composite photograph, have you done an old policeman's door to door?  
A.	Carrying out investigation in Rwanda is itself a little bit different from a national police investigation.  I've not talked to the persons who are residing in the Gikomero centre house by house.  The focus of investigation always depends on the lead which I was pursuing.  While taking photographs and other things and documenting the features about Gikomero centre, I took approval of the secteur conseiller and gathered few information which are in the sketch from him.  
Q.	Thank you.  Can I ask you -- can I ask you now just a general question relating photograph 23.  It's on page 41.  And it's subtitled, "View from Kayanga health centre, Lac Muhazi scene and hills across the lake are in Byumba préfecture."  Byumba, B-Y-U-M-B-A.  Can I suggest that's not Byumba but Giti, quite a different direction.  
A.	By writing this thing and by taking photograph, just -- I want to show the Lac Muhazi -- part of the 
	Lac Muhazi is very near the Kayanga centre.  And that cross hill, yes, that can be called Giti.  Giti is a commune; Byumba is a préfecture and Giti commune is a part of Byumba préfecture.  
Q.	Thank you for that helpful clarification.  

There's a photograph included in your bundle at page 22, photograph 17, which is subtitled, "A view from a hill in Gikomero area, Jurwe secteur overlooking Kigali."  Can you confirm that the hills of Bumbogo, Jurwe and Karama are all elevations overlooking Kigali, the airfield at Kanombe, and the barracks for the FAR also at Kanombe?  
A.	This photograph number 17 is taken from some (unintelligible) and Jurwe secteur, and I remember when I was travelling from E2G in my sketch, so this photograph is taken from the roadside.  Now, it will be inappropriate to tell at this point that from each hill it was therefore like Karama or another hill -- which is not noted down in my sketch at all -- you can see Kanombe camp.  And here also, I'm not referring whether it's looking Kanombe camp, because I cannot make out, but -- by the lights or the houses or something you can see part of the Kigali town, which can be seen from the road itself, even after reaching Jurwe secteur. 
Q.	I don't know whether you are in a position to answer this question, but would you agree that commanding those heights over Kigali, and an enemy camp would have been a very attractive proposition to the RPF for their guns?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the question.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, he can or cannot answer that and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's what I thought.  

Can you answer the question?  
THE WITNESS:
Again, this question will be my opinion, as I'm not aware of the military tactics of RPF in 1994.  But just by looking at -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me, before the witness answers, it's just for clarity of the record, is he being asked to comment on RPF positions that were there, or if the RPF was there, it would have been a good thing for them?  I think that was the tenor of Mr. Hooper's question and it calls for speculation on the part of the witness.  It's not even a question -- a factual question on whether positions were there, but whether it would have been a good thing or not and that's the basis of my objection.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, I can remodel the position perhaps into a slightly more different form and ask you this:  In your investigations of witnesses have you heard or received any evidence that the RPF did in fact assume positions there, from an early point, had their guns in placements there, and were firing into Kigali from there?  Have you received any evidence from anyone in your -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
At what point, please?

BY MR HOOPER:
Q.	They were there by the 10th?  I suggest that that's not evidence, that's a response to your question.  Have you come across any -- any witnesses that have been -- have been able to tell you whether yes or no the RPF were there, or have you not come across any -- any witnesses who could help you on that?  
A.	If Chamber allows, then I can express my opinion.  
Q.	It's not an opinion so much as have you been in contact with witnesses who can assist?  
A.	And this opinion is based on some of the statements either I recorded or I read or some of the literature that is available here and there.  But it will be my own opinion and I'll not be able to give source at moment, because I'm not prepared myself to note down those statements from which I can draw that kind of opinion.  
Q.	Very well, then I think that's a road that you can't go down.  But what you can perhaps do is perhaps provide me with details of the statements that you've taken once you've been able to resource them.  Perhaps that's something you are in a position to do, would that be possible?  
A.	I told that really my opinion, obviously, it is based on certain statements or documents which I either recorded or I read.  So if -- if you allow, then I can express my opinion about the movement of the people, but to substantiate that opinion, if OTP management allows, then only I can go through those doc -- those statements and again list them.  
Q.	Well, what I'm getting at is the core material that you resourced that you've told us from which you drew an opinion and I'm merely asking, can those documents be made available to me?  Is that something that's possible?  
A.	I do not have those documents in my possession.  Those statements are in the possession of the evidence unit, so I cannot give a guarantee that I'll make available those documents or statements to you.  In fact, I do not know the details of those statements now or the names of witnesses or any other details.  
Q.	But just before I leave this -- and this is my last question, I think, on this -- you are confirming there are statements that deal with that issue; is that right?  
A.	Right from the beginning I told you that this is an issue I handled for some time in the case of 
	Jean Dieu Kamuhanda, and on the basis of that statements, I can express my opinion.  If you're willing to listen, just now it's listed around 10th of April, but my investigations revealed -- 
Q.	Well, just before you go on -- (Microphones overlapping)...
A.	It was not 10th of April, it was around 17th or 18th of April when RPF came to that area.  
Q.	Well, you see, a moment ago you were very hesitant about which materials it was that you had managed to glean that information from, and I'm inviting you to provide me with such statements as you've resourced so that I can see and perhaps gain assistance from them.  Is that possible?  
A.	First thing, right from beginning I'm telling, I don't have those statements in my hand.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he has already clarified his position on that question.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, very well.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I move to another subject which is generally your method of investigation and what happens when you find a witness, the taking of statements from such a person, what is the actual method that you employ?  And, by you, I mean, United Nations investigators, right?  We've seen, obviously, statements from various witnesses, and it would seem, if I can lead you, to some extent, on the obvious and then you fill in some more detail, first of all, once a witness has been identified and is to be interviewed, it seems that normally there are two investigators involved and not just one.  Is that correct?  
A.	Normally, yes, but this is not all the time.  
Q.	Sometimes a potential witness will speak not just Kinyarwanda but also French and perhaps even English; is that correct?  
A.	This depends on the witness, and witness to witness.  
Q.	And it is normally necessary, isn't it, to employ an interpreter?  
A.	Yes, normally, yes, because most of the witnesses speak Kinyarwanda.  
Q.	And the witness statement form, which eventually is where the witness's evidence is reduced in writing, takes a particular form, and we've all probably -- all seen copies of this with their name and personal details and the like, including their family name, their ethnicity, their job in '94 or work, their marital status, children -- if they have any -- associations that they belong to, and a name and address of a friend or relative that they can be contacted through.  That's right, isn't it, all that material appears on the pro forma of the statement?  
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	You've been a -- involved in police work for some 18 years; is that right?  
A.	Yes, including the experience here with ICTR. 
Q.	And you will appreciate that taking the statement is a matter that has to be done with great care?  
A.	Yes, it's done so.  
Q.	The signed statements that I've seen have all been typed, presumably they're not typed at the time normally when you see the witness.  Presumably, the typing occurs back in an office and then the statement is taken back to be signed by the witness; is that correct?  
A.	Again, it depends on witness to witness.  Most of the time we travel with a laptops (sic) and portable batteries and we type on the spot.  After typing, the statement is read over to the witness in his or her own language through the interpreter and is signed.  If by chance or anything -- the laptop is not working, then yes, the possibility is there.  It's typed in the office.  Again, taken back to the field and we get the statement signed.  So it's a mixture of all.  
Q.	Of course, we nearly all have laptops these days in 2005, but that wasn't the general position in 1998 or 1999 when many of these statements were taken, was it?  
A.	That thing I do not know what -- '98 or '97, but from the year 2000, myself I have travelled most of the time with laptops.  Previous statements, I do not know.  
Q.	Do you make every effort to ensure that what you type is accurate and correct?  
A.	Yes.  That's why statement is read over to the witness again, and in the last, there's a certification by the interpreter.  
Q.	Is the statement always read over to the witness?  
A.	Yes, that's why in the last there's a certification by the interpreter.  
Q.	That certification by the interpreter is itself read to the witness; is that right?  The witness by that certificate acknowledges, first of all, that the statement is being read back to them; secondly, that they had the opportunity to correct and alter anything in it; thirdly, that the statement is the truth.  
A.	Yes, you're correct.  
Q.	And is that certification an important part of the process?  
A.	The certification is part of every statement which I have recorded.  
Q.	And it's sometimes the case that the witnesses do alter things and change things when it's read back to them; is that right?  
A.	Yes, that's also right.  
Q.	Aside from using a laptop, your laptop  -- well, let me start again, please . Your laptop becomes a record of all that's said; is that right?  
A.	When we carry laptop, we carry portable printer also.  When it's printed, signed, then it depends on the investigator whether he keeps the file in the laptop, comes to office, download to the desktop or he deletes, because the statement has already been signed and it became a document.  So I do not know, it depends on individual investigator to investigator what he does with the soft copy. 
Q.	A number of the statements I have in this case -- the statement is -- is stated to have been taken on one day and then it's signed two or three days or a week later, which suggests that perhaps not everyone carries a laptop with a portable printer.  Would you agree with that?  
A.	I told you it's quite possible.  Maybe some problem with the laptop and printer in the field or maybe the investigator might have adopted that first he'll interview two or three persons in a day or two days, then he will concentrate on getting them written or typing -- again reading, so it depends on the individual approach.  
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you, and can I ask you about another interviewing procedure --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, it's -- it's -- it might be interesting, but is it relevant to your case?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I think so, yes, I think it's going to emerge.  There's a -- at least a degree more significance than perhaps it might appear at first hand.  I'm merely going to ask about the confirmation process.  I'll try and keep it fairly short.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	There's also a confirmation process; is that right?  
A.	Yes, you're right.  
Q.	Can you briefly explain what that is?  
A.	After some time, then the case is ready for the trial.  Before the trial, the trial team asks the investigation team to reconfirm their statements and this -- and this process that is carried out to see whether the witnesses are still alive or have the same location or different location; that's the first issue.  

The second issue, whether he reconfirms the previous statement which he has given.  The third issue, if he wants to alter or make some other changes or give any additional information - then, take that information.  There's a reconfirmation process.  
Q.	Just for clarification, is the original statement read back to the witness?  
A.	Yes, the original statement is taken to the field and that statement is to be read to the witness.  
Q.	And I've seen some examples of that.  They're again often on a pro forma with the date and person who confirms.  I also have here, documents called "notes of investigators" where a witness is met -- for example, the witness who is going to come next in the court and there then follows in his case, some 
	10 paragraphs of statement, essentially.  Why is it taken in that form and not as a second statement?  
A.	If I'm correct you're asking me about investigator note.  Investigator note is prepared and it's not signed by the witness.  So this note is not read over to the witness again.  This note can be prepared in the field or can be prepared in the office on the basis of some small notes or on the basis of memory of the investigator.  The decision not to convert to a statement is taken by the investigator if he's feeling issue is very small or minor issue and he'll not take a statement.  Or second thing, maybe at that point of time, he might not be having time.  The missions are limited -- for a few days.  So he'll keep some record for a file purpose so the lead can be pursued later on by him or by other set of investigators.  
Q.	But some times, there's quite a radical change in that process as to what a witness tells you; is that right?  
A.	Just now, I told -- it depends on investigator to investigator's individual approach, which again, is dependent on the logistics available and his decision which he takes at that moment.  Maybe some radical changes are there.  He has put in the investigator note, because he might not be having time.  I cannot comment for this -- these things to be seen page by page, or incident by incident.  
Q.	All the confirmation documents I've had, I've received after the 27th of May of this year.  Was the object to have them in that form so that they wouldn't be revealed to the Defence?  Is that the purpose behind having it in that form as opposed to a statement, which would have to be revealed?  
A.	About the disclosure issues, I do not know anything.  
Q.	Finally and ultimately, I just want to move briefly into general investigations.  You've spoken of -- of Butare and, I think I asked you last week, but just to confirm, you hadn't accessed CARITAS or Red Cross reports yourself, is that right -- on events at Butare hospital?  
A.	Only I came across the report which is in the bundle.  The MSF report and other reports, if there are any, I have not seen them.  
Q.	In respect of Butare, do you know if any Gacaca traditional court process, has taken place in relation to the hospital?  
A.	About this, I do not know anything.  
Q.	Do you know how many witnesses have been seen that deal with Butare hospital?  
A.	I do not know how many witnesses or how many statements have been recorded from Butare hospital.  
Q.	Is that something you can find out for me?  
A.	Again, I'm finding the issues which are raised to me, I'm not a competent person because my job profile and the work assignment depends on OTP management and these documents are not under my custody.  
Q.	Coming to Gikomero -- in respect of Gikomero, have you had access to the resources of other files dealing with events at Gikomero?  
A.	Right from the beginning, I think it was clear that I handled part investigation of the case under the commander.  Who else happened to be from Gikomero and because of that case, I had access some documents in that case (sic).  
Q.	If we look just very briefly at your plan of Gikomero, plan B of Gikomero centre at our page 11, we can see on the Gikomero centre plan, on the left, the symbol of a church, Gikomero parish.  It reads, "To Protestant parish, Gikomero parish, 200 metres."  And there's a rather ornate church -- in fact, it's a very modest and simple chapel that is there; is that right -- well, it doesn't matter.  But if only -- it's very close to Gikomero centre, is that right?  
A.	Yes, it's close to the Gikomero centre.  
Q.	And the Kamuhanda case, to your knowledge, concerned the massacre of Tutsis who had gathered there as refugees; is that right?  
A.	Yes, that's also right, that one of the legal advisors advised us about the killing at this church.  
Q.	And that case was opened and run on the basis that that killing was on the 12th of April in the afternoon; is that right?  
A.	I don't remember exactly and I did not follow the trial, so how the evidence came up during the trial, but yes, around the same period the killing took place.  
Q.	Well, it was the 12th, wasn't it?  
A.	I do not know.  I cannot say exact date.  
Q.	Were you the investigator called in that case?  
A.	Yes, I was the Prosecution witness 1, like in this case.  
Q.	Did you give your evidence at the beginning in that case -- of that case and again, at the conclusion of that case?
A.	And I gave evidence with regard to photograph, the sketches, but not about the dates.  
Q.	You have -- you've referred to it already -- had access to the Kamuhanda file.  Can you confirm that there are about 30 statements dealing with the killings there, none of which refer to 
	André Rwamakuba?  
A.	In that file I do not know exactly how many witnesses were called to the court.  But, yes, around 30 witnesses maybe there -- between 20 to 30.  And I do not know whether any of them referred to Rwamakuba or not during the trial testimony or whether that question was asked or not, I cannot comment.  
Q.	Are you aware of a report that was drafted or published, I should say, in 1996 by the Rwandese authorities on the genocide, listing the places where killings had taken place both at Butare, for example, and in particular, Gikomero, listing those who were responsible for them, the victims, the sites of mass graves?  Have you seen that document?  
A.	If you're referring to -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me, does the document have a name?  I think if Mr. Hooper has something specific in mind, he can place it on the record.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I only have extracts, not the front page of the document, which is -- runs to 100 pages, I think.  But as I recall it, it's a report on the genocide in Rwanda and it's produced by a Rwandese commission.  And it deals with Gikomero; for example, at pages 192 to 195, and the neighbouring areas.  It also deals with Butare.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Are you aware of that document?  
A.	I'm aware of such document.  If you are referring the same document which I have in mind, it came up somewhere in the year 1996.  
Q.	I think it's June '96, yes.  
A.	And it runs to some 200 pages.  Once, I tried to find out the source of this document and I remember correctly, this was the preliminary report.  Somewhere it is written in the appendix or in the forwarding note, the final report never came out.  

The second thing, during my brief inquiry here and there, I came to know the names of the people who were responsible for genocide or killing in different places; the list was not exhaustive.  There may be some missing names, and this inquiry which I'm referring to now, I was following up in the case of 
Jean Dieu Kamuhanda.  His name was also not in the list.  That's how I came to know the names -- all names were not listed in the book.  I don't know how -- how the source -- how the inquiry was done, how the survey was done, so I do not know anything.  
Q.	I think the front of that document makes it clear the source and also survey -- the nature of the survey; isn't that right?  I'm afraid I don't have it to hand for you, but we will doubtless see it in due course.  
A.	I told you just now I made some brief inquiries to find out, but I could not find the real source or how the inquiries were conducted.  I met a few persons here and there in Rwanda and I got all vague responses.  And they told us this list is not exhaustive, this list is not complete, and whatever the regions are there.  So I do not know.  I cannot comment on the content of the report.
Q.	But you would agree that André Rwamakuba, then a minister of the government, and a known -- a well-known local person, at least in some parts of the commune, his name doesn't feature.  That's right, isn't it? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the question, Your Honour, it calls for a hearsay response.  Mr.  Hooper is trying to place the report in evidence without even showing us what the report is.  We don't even -- the Court hasn't even seen the report and he's asking questions to elicit the contents of the report.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it's a question that the witness can answer.  
THE WITNESS:
This report I have seen in some other context, not in the context of this case.  But I have a feeling and I have opinion, the many important persons' names or all the leaders' names are not in the report.  Someone can do a little bit of research and exercise to find out whether all the ministers are listed in the report.  That's why it's my opinion.  But yes, it's a fact, if you can show the report, Rwamakuba's name is not there.  But maybe other leaders' names may not be there.  So I cannot  comment, I'm not author of the source.  I'm not collect it.  I'm not -- I don't have this document, so I cannot say why the name is not there.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	One of the sources or the source of information at Gikomero is given as Faustin Rutamire (phonetic).  Have you ever met the man who was the acting bourgmestre from 1994 to 2001; have you ever met him?  
A.	During the investigation we meet many people, and I think from my experience of my last case, he's one of the protected witness.  So I do not know whether we should worry about him in the open session.  
(Pages 45 to 60 by Jean Baigent)










1530H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, he's not in my case, and I don't know of any protection that extends to him.  Have you met him? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, if there's a protection order, it applies.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Once I know about -- I won't be -- I don't want the inconvenience of going to closed session on this.  It's a simple question.  I'll reserve that to another moment, if I pursue it at all.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you know or are you aware of current Gacaca trials and hearings concerning Gikomero? 
A.	I do not know now. 
Q.	Isn't that a significant matter for you to know, whether Gacaca hearings are ongoing, whether people are discussing and talking about who did what in this area?  Isn't that something you should know and be alert to? 
A.	I'm not involved in Gacaca proceedings or Gacaca process, and I'm based now in Arusha, so I do not know what's happening. 
Q.	Have you any idea how many witnesses have been seen concerning events in Gikomero between the 6th of April and the 20th of April of 1994? 
A.	About this question also, I do not know how many witnesses have seen from Gikomero area.  Maybe couple of -- like, maybe a few dozen. 
Q.	Maybe a few?  
A.	A few dozen, but I'm not sure.  I do not know.  I have not made a list of such witnesses.
Q.	Is that something that's available to you that you could pass on to me, in redacted form, of course?  
A.	Again, my position is same.  These are not readily available to me.  They are not under my custody, and my job profile or the work which are assignment (sic) to be given to me are decided by the OTP management. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, if you have an entitlement to see those statements, don't Rule 66 and 68 provide an adequate procedure, rather than doing it through this witness?  
MR. HOOPER: 
One would hope so, but I haven't in fact had access to them, and I haven't been provided access to them.  I've asked for access to them.  I've asked for access to them -- I don't want to go into it now in detail, but I have, and perhaps I can explain at a little more length at an appropriate moment, but I was just trying to get from Mr. Baghel whether it was possible a figure in the round as to the kind of scope of investigation the numbers of witnesses who had been seen, perhaps to be better armed for a further discussion about this.  But I think Mr. Baghel is indicating that he can't help me on that because he doesn't know the breadth or extent of the investigation.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would that be a fair way of putting it, Mr. Baghel? 
A.	Yeah, it's a fair assessment.  I'm not -- I'm not representing investigation management of OTP management here. 
Q.	Let me move on and ask you this:  In the course of statements, including statements that have been given to you, certain names of participants in the genocide have been given to you, amongst which I'm going to name some.  A man called Mahire, have you ever met him?  Do you know if he has been seen by anyone investigating this case for the Prosecutor? 
A.	During the last five years I might have met many people, so just by giving a name, I cannot say whether I met him or not unless I go through my previous records. 
Q.	I'm going to mention some other names and I'll mention them as a small group.  I'm not going to go through them all, just as an example.  The name -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm objecting to this line of questioning.  It's an objection that I've made several times today and yesterday.  Mr. Baghel's presence here is not an opportunity for the Defence to investigate the OTP investigation.  It's simply not appropriate to ask this witness or to give this witness a list of names:  Did you speak to this one?  Did you speak to that one?  Who did you speak to?  That's not what the witness is here to present to the Court.  It's an inappropriate line of questioning, and I'm objecting to it, for the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Why should it be inappropriate if a Mr. Mahire or Mr. Habimana, or whatever the name may be, who has been named as a participant in genocide to this witness, say, why should there be any objection to knowing -- to the Defence knowing whether that witness has actually been followed up and has been seen?  

If the answer is no, he hasn't been seen, well, that may be the subject of criticism.  If the answer is yes, the witness has been seen, then I'd be interested to know if he made a statement and whether it was in fact exculpatory.  And it's only, in fact, by following this route that I can begin to unearth the necessary inquiries I need to make. 

So, for example, Mr. Mahire was a name.  I can take this witness to the source who's named and asking him, well, to his knowledge was Mr. Mahire ever seen?  He's in prison in Kigali.  Was he ever seen?  Did he make a statement?  

And if Mr. Baghel can't, in fact, provide that information, then it's reasonable information that the Defence should be acquainted with and which can be provided it.  I'm quite sure that the Prosecution have that facility.  

And I'd also make one further comment in relation to this.  There have been tremendous difficulties in obtaining access to information in this case, and then things changed.  At the beginning of this year, an electronic suite was set up.  I'm told that all the relevant material will be in that.  When I made an inquiry recently, a week ago, as to what was there by way of statements, I was told, oh, they will be put on but they haven't been put on just at the moment because it takes quite a long time.  It does seem to me rather odd that here we have an electronic suite, which we haven't had time to access, incidentally, for various reasons.  Here's an electronic suite which is, in any event, deficient in respect of statements.  That deficiency will be remedied in time.  And this trial is not going to take that long, despite, perhaps, present indications with this witness.  This trial is not going to take that long, and by the time it's all done and dusted, only then will these statements be made available to the Defence.  

Now, why does the Prosecution seem to want to seek to hide everything, hide everything in the shadows in this way when it would be so much fairer and proper for it to be brought out into the open and when it's now their own policy to do so with the electronic suite.  It's not my fault the electronic suite started so late, and it's not my fault that the statements haven't made their way into it.  But it's quite apparent it is the policy of the Prosecutor here, not necessarily in this court, but the Prosecutor here generally, to make available to the Defence all this material.  So what's holding it back now?  

If Mr. Baghel can go away, as the representative of the Prosecution who's giving evidence, and no one else is, he can go away and come back with a list, then it was an indicator to us as to where to look and where to go in order to try and, I hope, at the end of the day secure the best quality of justice we can in this case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, would this be the type of information which is covered by Rule 66 and Rule 68?  Why should it be necessary to ask these questions in court?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I think it's wholly inappropriate to ask these types of questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's what?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think it's wholly inappropriate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're saying that the -- the Defence is not entitled to this information?  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Some of the information that the Defence has sought is not -- is not appropriate for disclosure, no.  But there is the avenue of Rule 66.  The Defence has previously made a motion under Rule 66.  That motion was decided by the previous Trial Chamber, and it was denied. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, this is a new trial.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's understood that this is a new trial and that the previous decisions are not binding, but I'm simply trying to clarify for the record this -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a waste of time -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a waste of time to keep on referring to it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  Well, I mean, in the same manner, as is said, if this is a new trial and the old decisions are no longer valid, then the Defence can very well file the same types of motions that it has filed in the past, and this Trial Chamber may deliver a very different decision.  

Now, just looking over these proceedings from the last several days, it should be apparent that the Defence have gotten a whole volume of material which they haven't even looked through yet.  We went through items to be admitted into evidence two days ago when numerous claims that the Defence claims to be confronting for the first time are things that they received in 2002 and 2003.  

So there is no failure of disclosure in this case.  The Defence have had volumes of material to look through.  The EDS was set up months ago.  Mr. Hooper's application was made perhaps a week ago.  

So, no, we are not opposing providing the Defence with materials that they're entitled to.  The position of the Prosecutor is to -- is to provide the maximum amount of disclosure, but it is not appropriate to take the Prosecution witness that was brought to this court to introduce photographs and use the opportunity of his cross-examination to go to make a wide-ranging investigation into the nature of the Prosecution's case. 

We have no opposition to disclosure.  We have complied with disclosure.  We have done Rule 68 searches.  We have provided investigators' note.  Things that previously were categorised as Rule 70 and were not routinely disclosed, we made a thorough search and provided those materials to the Defense.  We have provided as much disclosure as we can.  We have set up an electronic suite to allow the Defence to investigate on their own.  There is nothing that we are trying to hide from the Defence, but this witness is not -- should not provide an avenue for conducting a Defence investigation in court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It seems to me, Mr. Webster, that the questions -- that some of these questions that are being asked are questions which really could be addressed to the Prosecutor.  If -- what is the Prosecution's position with regard to that?  Because certainly if there's information which they should have access to and it's not provided by the Prosecutor, then we may have to allow them to ask these questions.  But is there -- is there a situation where the Prosecutor will respond to the inquiries which are being made?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Hooper asks the question, "Have you ever spoken to Muhire?" that's a very simple question to answer.  We can do a ZY find search and we can indicated to Mr. Hooper if we've ever taken a statement from Muhire.  That's a -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the simple question being asked now. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, but that's a very different question than asking this witness, "How many investigators from your office have worked on this case?  Provide me with a list of all of the OTP investigators that worked on this case."  That's a very different question, and that's a question that I object to, and we will not provide that information unless the Court orders us to do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if an application is made, then we will address it at a time, but I thought that that question yesterday (sic) followed directly from the answer of the witness.  When he was asked a question, he said the investigation was done collectively as a team effort and he had a very small part of it.  So that question followed directly from his answer.  That is why it was allowed.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The same question was asked today, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And whether there were 50 investigators or only 5, what relevance is that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is not what we're dealing with now.  You have said that if the Prosecutor asked you, gave you a list of the names, you would indicate whether statements were taken.  You see, if that is what is your position, then it would be simple to stop this line of questioning.  Because we thought -- we think that those questions really should be addressed to the Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We have served at least 30 or 40 witness statements in regard to the events in Butare and Gikomero taken together.  In all of those witnesses statements the -- the witnesses provide names of other persons who may have been involved.  The Defence, as well as the Prosecutor, has had the opportunity to conduct follow-up investigations with respect to those names.  I would presume that Mr. Hooper has gone to Kigali and has asked to see those witnesses in Kigali.  We know that's the case because some of our own witnesses complain of being harassed by Defence investigators that go to Kigali and ask questions, follow-up questions, based on the statements that we disclose to them.  

So it's disingenuous at this point for Mr. Hooper to give the impression to this Court that somehow we have information that we're not making available, because all of those statements have been in their possession for over a year, and they have conducted Defence investigations to follow up on the names that are mentioned in those statements.  

Now, if Mr. Hooper has a specific finite list that he wants us to run through our database to find out if we have statements from those witnesses, that's not a problem.  He can ask -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's -- that's fair enough. 

Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know if I'm going too far by accepting Mr. Webster's comment as an undertaking from the Prosecutor to provide that response to that question.  To me, I think it's a more appropriate question to be addressed to that source.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  I agree with that, but we've met difficulties, which is why this avenue is being pursued, but I think I've -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) ...
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping) ...misunderstood the situation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You've just said (microphones overlapping) ...
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping) ...
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you've just now undertaken, Mr. Webster, is that quite fair?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's an undertaking that I can take if we apply the standard of reasonableness to it.  If Mr. Hooper comes back with a list of 10 people, then it's not a problem.  If he comes back with a list of 500 that he just searches through every statement and makes a list of 500, then it's unreasonable in that context.  But if we're governed by the standards of what is reasonable and fair, then it should not be a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Thank you very much. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  We'll prepare what I think would be a reasonable list extracted from statements of people who are assessable to the Prosecution with an invitation to indicate whether they've been seen and if they've made a statement, to provide it to us. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER: 
But the other area is -- apart from those that are referred to in that way, is whether the Prosecution are also willing to provide us with the statements, redacted or otherwise, of witnesses or persons who provided statements on the narrow events at Gikomero, Ndatemwa, or Kayanga between the 5th and the, actually, 15th or so of April, and of Butare hospital between the 20th and the 30th of April, and of the préfecture at Butare during the same period.  

Now, the Prosecution have access to their documentation, which we haven't, and they can let us know the range of statements that have been taken, and we can then see, as we believe to be the case, the extent of witnesses who don't mention Rwamakuba and yet were there.  That's where we're driving.  We can't really progress our case, this side, unless the Prosecution assist with that.  

And it's really based on this, and I think it's been the basic kernel of the problem, that we on this side take this view, that where you've got a witness talking about fairly narrow events, take Butare hospital between the 20th and the 30th, who's a witness to the events there in time and place and doesn't mention André Rwamakuba -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, you've made that point already, I think.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And it probably would be more appropriate in your -- at a later stage when you're addressing us. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But we have heard -- and the trial has started.  We are going to proceed according to our schedule, and we have heard the undertaking given by the Prosecutor in open court.  I think it's up to you to take it from there. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This may be an appropriate time for a short break now, 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed at 1545H) 
(Pages 61 to 68 by Sherri Knox)
























(Court resumed at 1605H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are back in session.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	For the final lap, I think, Mr. Baghel.  So I hope not to take too much longer.  

Broadcasts, you didn't find any other Radio Rwanda tapes, other than the ones that had been produced relating to André Rwamakuba; is that correct?  
A.	This is correct about the Radio Rwanda tapes.  
Q.	And dealing with radio, Télévision de Mille Collines, the RTLM, did you find any tapes relating to    André Rwamakuba amongst those tapes?  
A.	Among the RTLM tapes, I did not carry out exhaustive search.  
Q.	Sorry, you didn't carry out a what search?  I didn't quite catch your last words.  
A.	I did not carry out an exhaustive search among the RTLM tapes.  
Q.	I understood that you were, in particular, the tape man, that you'd spent a year on tapes; is that right?  
A.	Yes.  I was given a responsibility about handling Radio Rwanda tapes, not the RTLM tapes.  
Q.	Do you know who did have the responsibility for the RTLM tapes?  
A.	I do not know.  
Q.	Now, I want to come to your own particular involvement with witnesses in this case, and before I do so, I just want to briefly clarify one thing.  First of all, I understand what you say about the care that's taken in taking a statement, the reading back, and the declaration that's signed by the witness.  Then there's a confirmatory process which you've gone into, and from the documents I've received, that seems to end in one of two ways -- or both ways, perhaps.  One is that a pro forma is filled in where the witness indicates, as you said, I'm still alive, I am willing to come or not willing to come to Arusha, and may make a few changes, which is written on the face of that document; and that document is then signed by certainly the investigators and maybe other parties but, as I understand it, not by the witness; is that right?  
A.	Yes.  The confirmation process, that a confirmation form is not signed by the witness, but there are -- but there have been changes in the reconfirmation form time to time.  So in our database some reconfirmation forms you may find which might have been signed by the witness also. 
Q.	But essentially it's a short, two-page pro forma with tick boxes and a spot to make any changes, and that's the kind of document that we have and we can see; and then there's this notes -- the note of the investigator -- again, you've explained it -- which itself is a product of the confirmation process but from what you said, as I understood it, is the investigator's own note of relevant, salient aspects of what he's been told, reduced into writing, either there or, depending on the individual's method, back at the office; is that right?  
A.	When it's -- during the reconfirmation process, if there are some changes which might be substantial change, then it depends on the investigator.  He will write on the pro forma that investigator note prepared and attached or separately submitted, or if it is a one word or two word, then he may write on the pro forma itself, On page K00, he says this thing.  So it can go in any way.  
Q.	All right.  But in that note which sometimes can run to a page or two pages and is signed by all the people who were present there, other than the witness, that note is selective, is it?  
A.	Again, it depends on the investigator and the judgment.  He will prepare investigator note, signed both investigators or investigator, one investigator.  Obviously when he makes a statement, then the witness has to sign.  
Q.	I'm not talking about statements.  I'm talking about these notes of investigators, which, I understand from you, are selective inasmuch as it's up to the investigator to write down what he feels is relevant that he heard at the confirmation process, that hasn't found its way onto the confirmatory pro forma where there's room for some alterations.  This is a different kind of document.  Is it selective in that sense?  
A.	Yeah, selective in that case.  Depends on the investigator, of what facts he wants to put because it's not signed, it's not (unintelligible) to witness, even he may express his comments, like his physical or emotional feeling of a witness, all he can express.  It's up to the investigator totally.  
Q.	Will you write down in there everything the witness has said?  
A.	He's supposed to write down, but it's not read over to the witness.  So it depends on the investigator, in which way he's writing, whether he's able to make all the points or -- or he's covering few points, or he can give his comments also, what does he feel about the witness.  So it's -- this thing totally depends on the investigator. 
Q.	So looking at that kind of document, and it's clearly distinguishable from the statement -- we're not dealing with the statement here, a different procedure now, but when we look at that kind of document, notes of investigator, we don't know if everything the witness has said is written down on that document; is that right?  
A.	Yes, we don't know.  It depends on the integrity of the whole like -- between the investigator and the record.  
Q.	But the investigator, himself, will surely have some notes from which he compiles such a document; is that right?  
A.	I do not know.  There's no system of keeping the notes.  It depends on the investigator, whether he's keeping notes or he's writing on his own memory, or he has made some small notes keeping them himself, or he might be destroying after that.  I do not know.  
Q.	I want to briefly run through -- I hope briefly -- the witnesses that you've had contact with in this case referred to by pseudonym.  I hope that's not inconvenient for you.  I don't have a list of pseudonyms and names.  So, anyway, we'll see how we go.  Witness ALA I think you had no contact with; is that correct?  
A.	I also don't have list of pseudonyms with me here, so I'm very sorry that I don't know the witness unless name is told to me.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can you give me a moment to do that?  I hope it won't take too long -- unless the Prosecution have a list.  In fact, we have -- we should have a witness appearance list, and that will do -- do the job.  If you have two copies, it will do the job even better.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	We don't need to know the names at the moment.  We just need to know -- you're the one who needs to know the names, so I'm passing you up a document -- Prosecution document that merely deals with disclosure of witnesses.  
MR. HOOPER:
Show it to the Prosecutor first, please.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm going to refer to the witness by pseudonym.  First is ALA.  I have no reference to you on any of the statements or confirmatory matters.  So is it right that you've never met that witness or is it the case that you have?  I don't know.  
A.	Many witnesses in this case I have met, and for me it would be difficult to recall that when I met them, that I recorded a statement or reconfirmation or maybe some other matter. 
Q.	Well, let me go, then, to one you did see.  AVC, do you recall seeing that witness?  
A.	This witness I recall that I recorded his statement, I think.  
Q.	Yes.  I'm going to go through this, I hope, fairly quickly.  So I'm not showing you statements, but they can be followed by the parties who need to see it.  You took the statement on the 6th of November 2003, and the 8th of November 2003.  So that was perhaps an example of you going to see the witness, not completing the interview, or not typing it out, and going back later to have it signed.  Whatever the position, doesn't really matter.  He says this is his first interview by the ICTR, and he's seen by you and a Mr. Mengale -- or Mengale; is that right?  
A.	Yes, you're right, Mr. Charles Mengale and myself, two persons.  
Q.	Right.  What led you to that witness?  What caused you to see him?  Can you remember?  
A.	During the process of investigation, we keep collecting the information and witness evidence or the statements.  So in this case also, to find out about the incident at Kayanga, so in connection with that lead or clue, I carried out investigation, and during that process, I recorded the statement.  
Q.	My question goes to this:  Did he ask to see you, or did you have to go and find him?  What was the process of your investigation that led you to this particular witness?  Can you remember?  
A.	We get information from different sources after visiting area, like reading links, chain links, from one person to other person and other person to third person.  That's how investigation is carried out.  And those things, we don't document everything and how we get information, that who referred, because those are the -- those are confidential documents, the person who's referring me or telling me in confidence without being written anything in the record that this person might be having information.  
Then during the interview we find if he's having information and the informations are relevant, then we record a statement.  
Q.	I'm not asking you to indicate the names of any informant, you understand that?  I'm merely asking you, was it a question of you going to a place and knocking on doors and asking to find -- and asking people, or was it a question of him contacting you, or was it a question of somebody saying he can help you?  Can you remember which it was?  
A.	I don't remember those kind of clues and leads now because those are not documented.  This is a question of informants.  We dealt with informants locally in the area.  
Q.	Well, you've just said you don't remember.  So it could have been that this witness came to want to speak to you.  You can't remember?  
A.	This interview was carried out in the field, not in the office.  So he did not come on his own to the office.  
Q.	There was a confirmation on the 16th of March of this year which you attended with Ms. Fall who prosecutes in the case.  There was a change to the statement which is unclear -- and I'm wondering if you can help me with it.  He's changed a page or paragraph reference, and it's unclear quite how it's meant to read now.  Now, I'm not going to go laboriously through the statement with you now, but I'm wondering if, after today's session with Ms. Fall, perhaps we can clarify it between us, because I think it would be very ponderous to go through the statement and discuss it, all right?  But I don't want you  to leave, as it were, without helping us do that -- if that's acceptable to the Court.  

Now, he clarifies the matter and makes confirmation of his statement.  Did he provide you with any other information?  
A.	Whatever informations -- whatever information he provided, those have been put, either in the statement or during the reconfirmation, on the form, except that he did not give any other information.  
Q.	Can you remember the fact that he didn't?  
A.	I don't remember because I don't have a document now.  If I read that document, I come to know and I clarify what changes he made during the reconfirmation.  
Q.	Now, I thought you said a moment ago that he didn't add any other information, and I was merely wondering how you could remember that.  You now say you can't remember whether he gave you further information or not.  Would it be fair to say that if he had, you'd expect it to be on the confirmation form?  
A.	That time I think I told very clearly, whatever he give information, that information should have been on the reconfirmation form.  If he's not there, then he did not give the information.  So I have put on the -- on the form -- and I don't have a copy of the form now, so I cannot tell whether he made some changes, because you suggested he made some changes.  And I recall because that day I reconfirm, I think, two witnesses, and one of them made some changes, but I'm not sure exactly because I'm not going through the reports of that day again for this testimony today.  
Q.	Can you recall whether he was asked anything about killings at the Kayanga health centre?  
A.	I don't recall.  If I would have asked, I would have put there.  
Q.	Very well.  The next witness I want to ask you about is AVD, who was seen by you and, again,           Mr. Mengale, on the 6th of November '03.  That's the same day as the previous witness.  Dealing with that, were they seen together or separately?  
A.	When we interview the person, we interview each person separately, and we take adequate care for that.  
Q.	Now, in the course of his statement, he says, or claims, that he was with others when a man arrived, and those others told him they were André -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think this line of -- we're objecting to this line of questioning.  How can Mr. Hooper go into the substance of the witness statement with this witness?  The witness will testify on his own when -- when he comes into the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the reason I ask this is this:  There's no description of Rwamakuba in the statement, which is pretty fundamental, police investigatory work, to ask for a description, and I'm asking why there is no description.  Is it that he didn't provide one, or is it that you didn't ask for one?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the statement (sic), Your Honour.  The witness's testimony before this Trial Chamber should be the evidence that this Court considers.  If the witness -- if after the witness testifies             Mr. Hooper wants to bring out lapses or compare his in-court -- his in-court testimony to his out-of-court statement, that's one issue, but he should not, as a preliminary matter, put these types of questions to the investigator.  It's not the statement, the written statement, that should come before the Court.  It's the witness's testimony.  And if there are lapses or contradictions in his in-court testimony, that's the point at which we should go into a prior written statement.  An inquiry into the prior written statement should not come before this Court through the investigator.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, this is the investigating officer, policeman, whatever.  He goes to see a witness.  He takes a statement.  There's no description of the man who commits the crime, and I think it's fair that I ask this witness why that's not in the statement.  Is it because he didn't ask such a basic question, or is it that the witness was unable to provide one, a description, or did he provide a description but he's forgotten to put it down?  Can he help us as to that?  Because along the line we're going to have witnesses who may say all matter of things, as we've found out.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, what I'm suggesting is that's an awkward way and an incorrect way to go about putting this type of information before the Trial Chamber.  When the witness comes to testify, the witness can be asked for a description of André Rwamakuba, and at that point, Mr. Hooper can then, in his cross-examination, bring out whether there's a prior description or not.  But it's not appropriate, as a preliminary matter, to go into an out-of-court statement and put the substance of that previous, out-of-court statement before the Trial Chamber.  The witness has not even testified yet.  The only reason we have these written statements is to provide a basis to -- the written statements should not come before the Court until the witness himself has testified before the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we think that the inquiry as to which witnesses Mr. Baghel interviewed is proper at this stage.  The content of the interview process, we think, is premature.  Mr. Baghel, if necessary, he works in this building, and if it is necessary, then we will deal with any application that remains at a later stage.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you for that indication.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I deal with Witness GAB?  I appreciate it's not always easy dealing with witnesses through pseudonyms.  If I can help you, if you're unclear which witness that is, I quite understand that, with respect, and -- but you saw him on the 4th of November 2004, and there was a positive confirmation where you weren't present with Ms. Fall and Ms. Cummings-John on the 17th of March 2005.  Were you aware that he gave evidence in the Kamuhanda case?  
A.	Yes, I think he's the person who gave evidence in the Kamuhanda case, but I cannot confirm exactly now.  
Q.	Was there a confirmation exercise in the Kamuhanda case?  
A.	I don't remember the confirmation exercise for Kamuhanda case.  
Q.	Are you aware that his evidence was criticised in the Kamuhanda case?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection.  Mr. Hooper's question is going directly into the substance of this witness's prior testimony in another case, his prior witness statement.  That is not an appropriate line of inquiry for this witness.  The witness will testify, himself, and he can put these questions to the witness when the witness is before this Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In fact, you weren't present at the confirmation, and perhaps that's the more relevant matter.  Can I pass over this, but mark up I'm concerned to know if there was a confirmation, in the Kamuhanda case, of that witness's evidence.  

Can I ask you this:  When you go and see any of these witnesses, either to do with Gikomero or Butare, did you ever have a photograph of Rwamakuba with you?  
A.	No, I never had a photograph of Rwamakuba with me.  
Q.	And as far as you know, none of these witnesses have been shown a photograph of him; is that right?  
A.	I do not know, but the witnesses I have seen, I've not shown any of them the photograph of any of the Accused.

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Witness -- (microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Witness GAC, GAC seen by you on the 8th of November 2004 and in respect of this case, but were you aware that he had given evidence in the Kamuhanda case? 
A.	Witness GAC?  
Q.	GAC, yes.
A.	Sorry, it is not on the list, this one, which was given to me by you. 
Q.	Can I hand you up his name then on my document? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Show the Prosecutor first, please. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	GAC and GAB, this is the GAC, do you remember seeing him?
A.	If I remember, I have seen him. 
Q.	In respect of GAC and GAB have you made any inquiries to confirm or throw light on their claim that, for example, there was an opportunity to see Rwamakuba at the stone laying of the local school.  Have you made any inquiries as to that event? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm objecting, Your Honour.  This is hearsay, not within any -- hearsay is admissible, that is granted, under Rule 89, but it is improper; it is prejudicial.  The witness will testify before the Trial Chamber.  At that opportunity, Mr. Hooper can cross-examine the witness, but the presence of Mr. Baghel should not present him with an opportunity to go into that substance of the witness's statement.  What would be the point of calling witnesses to testify before the Trial Chamber if an investigator could go into the substance of their statement?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Well in relation to GAC and GAB, there is a particular situation which under pins the reasons why I asked these questions.  And the reason is this, they gave evidence, as the Court has already heard in Kamuhanda case, and the Court rejected their evidence.  And, in so many words, found them untruthful.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but that is not an inquiry.  You don't prove that through this witness. 

MR. HOOPER: 
No, but their basis for saying that they had seen Kamuhanda was opportunities A and B.  Such same opportunities as arise now with Rwamakuba.  So, bearing in mind they now come to court to give evidence on these two opportunities of knowing the Accused, that is at a stone laying of a school and at a political meeting held in the summer of 1993, I am asking this witness, whether having in mind the concern that what must naturally arise, given the decision of the previous Trial Chamber, has any investigation been made, to his knowledge, by the Prosecution into those two opportunity -- events?  Has that stone -- or have those two stones been turned. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Baghel, are you in a position to answer that question?
THE WITNESS:
I'm not in a position to answer this question, and I don't have a statement also.  What are the    questions (sic) I have put, those have been recorded in the statement. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Witness GII is not someone you have taken a statement from nor someone who you have been present for confirmation.  But have you ever spoken to him, to your knowledge? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	Very well, Witness GIN, you were present at a confirmation exercise on the 27th of March 2002; did you record all relevant and salient matters that she told you? 
A.	Whatever she told me, it should have been on the reconfirmation papers.  I don't remember the exact wordings of what is there, but it should have been there. 
Q.	In her case, on the 27th of March 2002, you asked her about the murder charge that she was currently facing.  And she protested her innocence, essentially, to you; is that right? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, is that -- is that something which can be dealt with in open session?  It is a very specific question which may reveal her identity. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, aside from the issue of witness confidentiality, Your Honour, the question is inappropriate.  I am renewing my objection.  It seems as if the Court is allowing Mr. Hooper to go into these directions, since his other questions have been -- he has asked other questions along the same lines, but it is inappropriate.  And I'm simply going to reiterate my objection to it.  The witness will be -- we will call the witness before this Trial Chamber, the Trial Chamber can assess the witness's credibility based on her testimony and based on her cross-examination.  It is inappropriate at this stage for Mr. Hooper to prejudice the Trial Chamber by going into this information. 
MR. HOOPER: 
With respect to confidentiality, I hadn't specified when the murder took place and I hope leaving that at large, given the circumstances sadly of Rwanda, that it is not case or person specific in terms of leading anyone to know who that would be.  But I will move on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think the Prosecutor has a point though on the content of the statements.  I think it is probably premature to address those issues in light of the fact that these are witnesses who will actually be testifying before the Chamber. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	I think that certainly touches on all of the Gikomero witnesses.  Can I come to the two Butare witnesses that you have had dealings with, and can I for just one moment look at the pseudonym of one witness,  Witness GO - GIO.  Do you have the name there to help you and do you remember seeing her?  I think it was in a confirmation. 
A.	Yes, I remember that I saw her when I went to take photographs of the hospital. 
Q.	And again, Witness RJ or TM, again, you were party to the confirmation exercise in October 2003 relating to that witness, together with Mr. Mingle (phonetic), do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, that is so. 
Q.	And they had full opportunity then to add or to order anything that they wished to do, so they had that opportunity? 
A.	Yes, they had the opportunity. 
Q.	Were you at any time aware that they had giving evidence in cases within Rwanda? 
A.	At that time I was not aware, and during the reconfirmation we take all of the statements and that statement is read over to them.  And this is also verified in the reconfirmation form with the statement, it is being read over to them. 
Q.	Let me put the question again.  Were you aware that they had given evidence in Rwanda, in Rwanda courts? 
A.	While doing the reconfirmation in October 2003, I was not aware. 
MR. HOOPER:
So, I think that is all.  Thank you, Mr. Baghel.  And this has been said, you are never too far away so if we do need you, we can find you, as the say.  Thank you, very much? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I am reminded of one matter, I'm sorry, and that is the names of the other investigators, I'm not sure where we are on that.  I think it is a matter to be dealt with out of court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think that was an issue which was to be inquired about from the Prosecutor. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. Baghel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, since we have just ended with the discussion of OTP procedures and witness interviews and statements and things of that nature, perhaps you can go over that a bit with me.  How long does it usually take you to take a statement, a two or three page statement from a witness that does not speak English; for a witness that you have to interview through an interpreter? 
A.	Normally, a statement of two or three pages takes me around four to five hours, or sometimes it is more depending on the information which he is giving, the witness. 
Q.	And when you say four to five hours, are you talking about the conversation that you had with the witness or does that include actually drafting the text of the statement? 
A.	Sometimes, like with some witnesses, this time, four to five hours goes in conversation.  But sometimes when we are quick, the team, like two investigators, then we can do it simultaneously, like one is recording, typing out and the other one is questioning.  So then we shift and do it this way.  So it depends on the kind of witness we are facing that time. 
Q.	And when you speak to a witness that only converses in Kinyarwanda, it is clear that you have to go through an interpreter.  With respect to the interpreters that you have used in the OTP do you know if they are professional interpreters or if they receive any special training in interpreting Kinyarwanda? 
A.	About their interpreting ability or their training, I do not know; but as far as I am concerned those interpreters are assigned to us.  And after that, we have to work with them. 
Q.	But you couldn't work without them.  You would never be able to speak to the witness without an interpreter? 
A.	Yes, we would not be able to speak to the witness without an interpreter. 
Q.	And the interpreters that you do have, based on your familiarity with the investigations in Kigali, would you characterise them as professional, simultaneous interpreters? 
A.	They are not like simultaneous interpreters.  So when they speak -- like when I speak to the witness, then I put a question, then he translates, or interpreters in the language so it comes like a one way process, then I get one way.  It is not exactly a simultaneous process. 
Q.	In that context when you generate a two- or three-page statement, can that two or three pages reflect everything that is discussed between you and the witness? 
A.	During my experience, sometimes I found that there are changes.  And when the statement is read over, then the witness points out that he did not tell this way or that way; so some errors are there. 
Q.	Yes.  Well, I presume that you are talking about in a confirmation process there that you are making corrections -- or clarify that for me, please? 
A.	During the statement, when the corrections are there, they are made on the spot like before the signature.  But during the reconfirmation those corrections are noted on the sheet of the confirmation. 
Q.	Does the confirmation process usually take as long as the initial witness statement -- the process that you use to take the initial statement? 
A.	No, it takes much less time compared to the statement process. 
Q.	In the reconfirmation process, can you state that every single witness statement is read to the witness verbatim; would you be able to say that on the basis of your own personal knowledge?
A.	The statements which are taken in the field, the statements which were read to the witness, those were recorded on the reconfirmation form, with their K numbers.  So, I cannot tell whether all of the statements have been taken by the investigator when he went to the field for confirmation, or he       took -- let's say, somebody might have given four statements to OTP on different dates.  It may be possible that the investigator took two statements which might be the (unintelligible) for the file or the case.  And the reconfirmation was done for those two statements.  
Q.	With investigators notes you explained that those were statements that were taken or records made by the investigator that the witness did not sign, or does not sign usually.  In the past, what has been the usual procedure with respect to those investigator's notes.  Are they things that are made accessible, freely accessible in the office or was there any special procedure adopted for handling those types of documents? 
A.	On the basis of my experience in the Kigali investigation office ordinarily investigator notes were not handed over to the evidence unit and they were considered as internal matters of the investigation, and they were kept with the team.  But quite lately, it was decided that these investigator notes also should go to the evidence unit.  
Q.	Based on your experience with how the witness statements were taken and how the reconfirmation process was handled, based on that experience if the same process was engaged with the investigator's notes, do you think witnesses would change or alter the contents of those notes as well? 
A.	About the contents of investigators' notes, I cannot tell much because those notes have not been read over, so in many -- on many investigators' notes maybe the witness may change some content or may confirm the whole content when it is read over to him. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Baghel, we presume that when you speak to the witness, whether it is to take the initial statement or the reconfirmation or the investigator's notes, your concern is to be as accurate as possible? 
A.	Yes, my concern, as the investigator, to put in the statement or the investigator's note or in the confirmation, the information which is received from the witness and accurately and in the same way as it was told to me or given to me. 
Q.	Okay.  But would you agree that in spite of your efforts to be accurate and to record fully a witness's statement, do you find in your experience here in the OTP over the past five years that witnesses still complain from time to time that the information is not recorded as they spoke it during the initial interviews? 
A.	Yes, I found these kinds of incidents, but I do not know the reason behind this, maybe because so many things are involved, interpretation, writing in a different language and reading again in the same language, but I found the witness later on saying that he told some other way and it is written in a different way. 
Q.	Well, besides from the issue of interpretation as you have just mentioned, what other types of things may come into play that would generate inconsistencies from one statement to the next? 
A.	Apart from interpretation issues, other kinds of things may come up.  The witness, when he is interviewed the first time, like first time out of seven, he may not recall many events, many details.  If we give, let's say, maybe four or five hours talking to him, then his memory comes up, flash backs and he starts giving more description.  When we approach him after a week then he might have thought on the incident again and again because they are all incidents and they are traumatised, then they will come up again with more details.  Apart from that, even the cultural factors play in Rwanda; some witness who was not revealing few information like in the year 2000, because I'm limiting myself to year 2000, after that when he was interviewed in 2002 maybe the political situation, social situation changed in Rwanda and he is able to give more information about a certain incident.  That is how they come up with more and more information every time. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Baghel, Mr. Hooper asked you questions about witnesses who had provided information against Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda, for example, so they may have the one statement or the initial statement against Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda.  That same witness may be asked the same statement about André Rwamakuba, that same witness may be asked a statement against a third or a fourth or a fifth person.  In that context, do you think the fact that the witness is being interviewed about different targets may contribute to each statement not being complete at the time it was recorded?
A.	Yes.  These kinds of instances I found the last five and a half years that when we go to the witness then we asked some incident and (unintelligible) for a particular incident, when it is a target or (unintelligible) approach, then we asked about a certain target and he comes up immediately, because in his memory and then all of the facts related to the target, come up.  So when this witness, like the witness which was there who said they were interviewed for the Kamuhanda case, in the matter for information of Kamuhanda, after certain -- after like two years or something, they are interviewed in the Rwamakuba case, they will give information about Rwamakuba then even on the third target, so no statement can be taken as complete of all of the events of 1994.  It is not possible at all from one statement, one person, and he can't narrate all the incident day-to-day or time to time, minute to minute in one statement.  So these kinds of incidents happen again and again.  

But as an investigator myself, my job is to interview him in detail in such a way, to find out the truth, the story which is coming up from his side - incident.  That is what we do during the investigation process.  
Q.	Well, on that issue, Mr. Baghel, the target focused nature of your investigations, I would like you to reflect a bit on your own affiliation with this case insofar as the Butare aspect of this case is concerned, when did you first become assigned to the Rwamakuba case, and when was the first time in relation to this case that you had any involvement with witnesses or crime scenes in Butare? 
A.	About this case, Rwamakuba case, this case was earlier in -- earlier was a part of the Government I case.  And my involvement in this case started a few days or a few months before the mission which I carried out to Butare and I made the sketch and photographs.  Those were in 2003, and before that, I was working on Government II files, some other minister's file, like Nadejabin (phonetic) Emmanuel and others, some of the préfet files.

But from 2003, from that time I was assigned to the team dealing with Government I.  
Q.	And when you say 2003, could you be a bit more specific because a moment ago you said months and days; and I'm trying to distinguish between the two.  So, if you are placing your involvement with the case in 2003, tell us if it was at the beginning of the year, the end of the year, or the month, if can you? 
A.	I think it was in the middle of 2003 when I was transferred from Government II case to Government I team. 
Q.	When you conducted this mission to Butare, were you given an opportunity to read any of the substantive witness statements or the substantive aspects of the investigation before you were tasked with documenting the hospital with photographs and sketches? 
A.	No, I was not given the opportunity to read through the whole case files or all of the statements.  And my mission was very specific, to go and document the Butare hospital by photographs and by sketch. 
Q.	 Is there a reason why you, in particular, were given that task, the task of documenting the hospital grounds? 
A.	In fact, I do not know the reason for which I was given, maybe because I did similar work for other cases also, but it is for the team leader to assign the task to the team members. 
Q.	When you say similar work for other cases, tell us what you mean by that? 
A.	I took photographs and developed sketches in the case of Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda, the Ndindabahizi case, and Ndindiliyimana case.  And in other cases also I did during the -- by doing the investigation; those cases might not have come for trial yet. 
Q.	Okay.  But with respect to the cases that you have just mentioned, and you've mentioned at least three so far, am I to understand that you took the photographs and drew the sketches that were used to present the evidence in those cases? 
A.	Yes, I did, with another colleague from ICTR. 
Q.	Well, in the context of OTP investigations, would it be fair to say that you have a specialty of taking photographs and drawing sketches and making maps and things of that nature within the office, I'm not talking about for general purposes, but within the investigations unit? 
A.	Yes, I'm also of the same opinion? 
Q.	What opinion, please tell us? 
A.	That I can double up the photographs; make the sketches, put them in order so that those can be presented before the Chamber.  That is why these tasks were given to me time to time. 
Q.	Now, you testified in Ndindabahizi I believe you stated, right?  
A.	Yes. 
A.	When you testified in that case, were you ever asked questions or forced to answer questions about the substantive aspect of the case? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That question is not allowed.  You cannot set up the witness as an appeal court. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, let's talk a bit more about the photographs  that we have looked at in this case, and the maps and things of that nature? 
A.	You were shown what Mr. Hooper referred to as a composite, I don't recall what ID number it had, but this is what I am referring to, the last item for identification that was handed to the witness, which was described as a composite, you recall that?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, you have been to Gikomero centre, I believe you said around half dozen times at least, right?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  Based on your recollection of standing in the centre of Gikomero centre, does this composite give someone that is not familiar with Gikomero centre a fair appreciation of what it is like to stand at the centre and look at the houses on one side of the centre? 
A.	This photograph does not give the holistic picture, it gives only one side of one road. 
Q.	Well, putting aside the question of it only being one side of one road, would you describe Gikomero centre as being a wide open field?  How would you describe it if you had to describe it to somebody who has never been there, and give them a feel for what it feels like to stand there and look at the houses that surround it, would you characterise it as a small place, a big place, a wide open field or -- 
A.	This thing, like this centre I would characterise as a place which is relatively flat but not a very large place, having houses, a small flat area maybe of the size 50-by-50 metres or so, open area where weekly market is organised, secteur office near by a church around 200 metres from the centre, and in the church complex there is a school.  So in the area we have a school, church, Gikomero secteur office, houses, a few shops and the place to have weekly markets. 
Q.	Yes, but Mr. Baghel when you look at this exhibit it seems like there is a huge expanse from one end to the other, do you agree with that or not? 
MR. HOOPER: 
I think, Mr. Webster -- I know where he is trying to go but he can't lead his witness by the nose too much, and I have sat here a bit quietly.  We know the point, and what more can I say really. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, let me have this placed before the witness please.  Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, how much longer do you anticipate, it is already 10 past 5:00 now. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I don't know.  I'm not sure if I will complete by 5:30.  I would think -- I will try to finish by 5:30 because I want to conclude today, but it depends on how fast -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
See, we had agreed to stop at 5 o'clock. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Five o'clock, well we can conclude now.  I had -- quite frankly, I thought that we would be finished with this witness on the first day, I had not anticipated being here 10 past 5:00 today, but I do have items to review with the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we think we should take the adjournment unless it is inconvenient. 
MR. WEBSTER:

Okay, we will adjourn until tomorrow morning.
