 Article
 18 ,
paragraph
 (4)
 of
 the
 Benin
 Constit.ution,
 in
fact,
 addresses
 the
 issue
 with
 respect
 to
the
 length
 of
 time
 that
 an
 individual
 can
 be
held
 without
 beinq
 brouqht
 before
 a
magistrate,
 which
 was 48 hours.
Mr.
 Kajelijeli
 was held
 in
 Benin
 from
 June
until
 August.
 And then
 he spent
 several-
more months
 here,
 amounting
 to
 a total
 of
ower
 246 days
 before
 he was actua11y
 brought
before
 the
 Tribunal
 for
 his
 first
ar.rr'\F^ fance
 .
So the
 very
 essence
 that
 we have
 asked
 this
Court
 to
 t.ake a look
 at
 is
 whether
 or
 not,
given
 this
 new information
 that
 we have
provided,
 does
 this
 Court
 now see
 a basis
for
 reviewing
 its
 decision
 that
 was taken,
because
 now we have
 newly
 admissibl-e
evidence
 that
 we are
 putting
 before
 the
Court.
 And we believe
 that
 t.hat
 evi-dence
 is
persuasive.
 We believe
 that
 that
 evidence,

when we look

 than the provisions

Now,
 I
 would
 like
 t.o go
 forward
 with
 respect
to
 why we bel-ieve
 that
 our
 challenge
 on

 is
 admissibl-e.
 The
issue
 with
 respect
 t.o temporal
 jurisdiction
obviously
 goes
 to
 the
 heart
 of
 whether
 or
not
 the
 allegati-ons
 and
 t.he charges

 are
 krewond the

 And we
be]ieve
 that
 that
 issue
 is
 relevant
 and the
motion
 is
 admissibl-e
 under
 the
 Statutes,
'1
r:ertain'lw
 . 5 and 1 of
 the
 Statutes
 of
 the
Tribunal-.
We have
 argued
 that
 the
 Prosecutor,
 in
amending
 her
 indictment,
 made allegations
going
 back
 to
 1990 and
 in
 so doing
 broadened
illegally
 the
 scope
 and the
 temporal
jurisdiction
 of
 t.his

 ,
 if
 t.his

 decides
 to

 and
 to

 that

 in

 can I

 bit,
at

 to
 remind you
 or you wiII
 recal-l-
there
 was an amendmenL to
 the

 and
that

 you that
 as from that
 amendment
you were given
 an additional
 period
 of
30 days to
 file
 any preliminary
 motions
 in
connection
 with
 the
 said
 amendment,. and it
is
 in
 that
 respect
 that
 you filed
 that
preliminary
 motion.
My question
 with
 respect
 to
 the
admissibility
 was whether
 this
 was filed
within
 the 30 days.
 I do fully
 well-
understand.

 So,
 ffiy analysis

 if

 it

 now.
It
 came down just
 before

 There
 have
 been
 a coupfe
 of
problems.
 We have

 on a disk.
We were

 and
I
 think
 I
 have
 raised
 this
 at

as the

 comment that

 out.

 the

on disk.

 a disk
 for

 here
 and we have
 from
 the
 Evidence

 now the

 pieces

 that

Now,
 there
 is
 a second
 problem.
 We had
 two

 sets
 delivered,
 over
 the
 weekend,
of
 the
 photographs.
 We got
 two
 copies;
 one
for
