MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today,      Friday the 16th of December 2005, trial day 64, in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba,        ICTR-98-44C-T.

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  The appearances are the same.  Good morning, Madam Witness - or,           Ms. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will continue this morning.  I remind you that you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began your testimony yesterday.  Now the Prosecutor will cross-examine you.

Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
If Your Honour may recall, that at quarter to 6 yesterday evening, I asked for a little time in order to be able to shorten what would otherwise be a longer exercise.  I am grateful for that time because I have been able to consult with my learned leader and others, and it may be that, for the first time in the Tribunal's history, the position will be this morning, acceptable to the Tribunal, that having heard the witness's testimony yesterday, remembering her youth at the time that she recalls events, and the number of years which have passed since, namely, she was 11 then and there has been 11 years since, the decision has been taken that we are not going to cross-examine this witness, given her position and given her situation with regard to the Defendant; I'm conscious we are in open session.  So, if it pleases Your Honour, we don't propose to cross-examine this witness.  It is a matter of comment what weight will ultimately be able to be attached to her helpful testimony.

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, after your somewhat apologetic comments, I'm sure it will be a relief to know that the Court is pleased.

Madam -- Ms. Witness, the Prosecutor has decided not to cross-examine you, and so your testimony has come to an end.  We thank you very much for coming to give evidence at the Tribunal, but now you are excused and you may leave.

Mr. Hooper.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, but I had a request to make, Mr. President.  (By order of the Court this portion of evidence was extracted and filed under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.  I should, however, redact the last comment from the record because it may reveal the identity of the witness.

Mr. Hooper, permission is granted.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That brings us to the end of our session. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any matters we have to discuss this morning?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Probably the shortest morning session at the ICTR of all time, at five past 9:00, it should be noted on the transcript.  Can I just mention one matter, and that is in the earlier part of the session, in order to cut our cloth according to the circumstances we found ourselves, I returned two witnesses to Rwanda who had been brought here but didn't bring evidence, 6/1 and 6/6.  

And the position is, as I think the Bench may know, that the registry automatically looked to me for payment of their costs and fares, and -- which is a significant amount.  But I understand that if the Court approves our action, and may I say we completed our witness list, our chosen witness list now, today, and only just, that in fact if I get, as it were, the blessing of the Tribunal for my action, that will, I understand, relieve me of my personal responsibility in terms of that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you already have your witness list for January?  

MR. HOOPER: 
No.  It is going to be discussed today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What the registry representative has indicated is that there is a procedure which requires you to initially seize the registrar of this matter and that, if necessary, the registrar will approach the Bench.  So it seems that that is a preferred method of approaching the matter than to come to us first, but that you should come to us through the registry. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  Nobody has indicated a procedure to me, but there is always a procedure. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I think Mr. Fry might be able --  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- to assist you.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, very much.  With respect to Mr. Guindo, I understand that there is an agreed statement; but perhaps we can refer to that in the next session.  

Can I pass up the Namibia letter and exhibit it, please?  It was referred to yesterday, you may recall, but we couldn't find it.  We have a copy of -- we have the Goldstone letter somewhere, but we can't find it.  But this is the ministry of home affairs letter which was referred to yesterday, dated the                       7th of February 1998, addressed to André Rwamakuba at Windhoek Central prison informing him that he was detained as per requirements of Resolution 978 of February of 1995 which requires that person's --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, slowly, sorry.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Which requires that persons implicated in the Rwandan genocide should appear before the International Tribunal for Rwanda.  We are, it says, "Pleased to inform you that, as per information received, you are acquitted from charges against you."  And it goes on to say that he is released and can go back to working in Namibia.  And that was the letter received from the ministry of home affairs, signed by the parliamentary secretary, Mr. Taapopi, T-A-A-P-O-P-I, to André Rwamakuba.  It is dated, stamped, et cetera.  

Now, there is a companion letter to that, which accompanied that letter from Mr. Justice Goldstone. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, is this going to be supporting of the (inaudible) --  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, it is not.  It was -- but may I say, you have certainly struck a nerve there.  And when                     Mr. Rwamakuba -- Dr. Rwamakuba reads the transcript of this morning's session, he will be in full agreement with you on that, because those words, I'm afraid, have become a significant word for him.  And it has been, to some extent, difficult for us to explain to him that a formal acquittal through a judicial process is different.  But those matters, may I say, have all being aired and reviewed in the Defence application, I think, of 2001 for a stay of proceedings because of abuse of procedure of the Court.  And affidavits and information, judgement and the rest of it, are all on record with respect to that.  And I say no more about it. 
MR. MORLEY:
But if I may, I would like to add something.  I could help Mr. Hooper; perhaps it doesn't help him.  I do have the supporting letter which was sent by Justice Goldstone, which, perhaps, we should add to the letter which Your Honour has just seen, which is dated the 18th of January of 1996, and which reads, perhaps predictably to the mind of a lawyer,  "At this moment, we do not process evidence which would entitle us to request the Namibian authorities to detain Dr. Rwamakuba.  18 of January 1996."  

And that is the genesis for what is, on the face of it, a response or -- the letter that Your Honour has seen, which perhaps put things in a slightly incorrect light; perhaps, if that letter might be shown to Their Honours, and can be added to the letter that you have just been given. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we have seen both of these letters already.  
MR. MORLEY:
All right. 
MR. PRESDIENT:
Because we dealt with them in an interlocutory application proceeding. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  Very well, Your Honour.  It is just in light of the conversation that I have just heard in the Court, I thought it might be right to remind everybody what was in the original letter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, do we have an exhibit number?  
MR. HOOPER: 
It would be D. 195. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And 196, right, or are they coming in together?  

MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, let's give them separate exhibit numbers; 195 would be the Taapopi letter, and D. 196 would be the letter from the Chief Prosecutor of the ICTR, saying on the 18th of January 1996 there is no reason to detain Rwamakuba. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. 195 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. 196 admitted) 
MR. HOOPER: 
Finally, we are in open session, and with the Court's leave, and very briefly, I would just indicate that the Court has heard evidence from two witnesses, all in closed session.  Witness 1/1 essentially spoke of André Rwamakuba's being in Belgium, Egypt during the period September to March 1994; spoke of the circumstances by which Rwamakuba was made a minister without consultation nor consent; that he was in Gitarama on the 12th and remained there until the 20th when he traveled to Gisenyi; remaining there until the 25th when he returned to work in Gitarama, but returned to Gisenyi each evening thereafter, certainly until the 2nd of May, with some days, again, being in Gisenyi throughout the day; and also spoke of efforts that Rwamakuba had made to flee via, first of all, Burundi and then to attempt to flee via Goma.

The second witness, 3A, gave evidence in general terms of André Rwamakuba being in Belgium and Egypt and away between September and March.  Both witnesses have spoken of his presence in Kigali throughout the day of the 4th, Monday, the 4th of April.  And 3A also spoke of the journey to Gitarama and the later traveling to Gisenyi and remaining in Gisenyi.  

And those witnesses, as I say, with other details and ancillary matters, gave evidence in closed session.  And that is, perhaps, the substance of what they have to say.

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  Yes, Mr. Hooper, we think that we ought to make a scheduling order with regard to your witness lists and the order of appearances.  We know that you are in the process of trying to shorten the number of witnesses that you are going to call, but we think that the Prosecutor should have notice of at least a week before the session commences of the order of appearance of the witnesses.

Well, I'm sorry, I didn't ask the Prosecutor.  What time would be reasonable to you?  

MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think that as far as the OTP is concerned, we will be satisfied with the week on offer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Hooper, is that all right?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, maybe I should give a date.  What date will that be?  

Mr. Hooper, will the 6th be okay?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I was hoping for the 9th, which is the week before. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay.  Yes, okay, the 9th. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, witness ordering, obviously, I mean, it's in our interest as much as for the Prosecution to know the batting order; but some of these witnesses are coming in rather more difficult circumstances than normally.  And so we can't have a firm expectation a week before that a particular witness will necessarily be brought.  The flight date for witnesses, particularly some of these witnesses, will be a Friday.  And so they will come on Friday for the subsequent week.  And they might not turn up at all, as we found from time to time happened this time.  

But I think between us, WVSS has been, may I say, extremely helpful, and Ms. Fidila Tidiani, in particular, over the last session in what I know was very difficult circumstances.  I'm sure with that assistance next year, the -- at least the Chamber should not be inconvenienced.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President, sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We think that the outstanding matter which needed to be addressed is the issue for the motion for the site visit.  It is actively being dealt with now.  Obviously the arrangements will not be completed today.  So it is absolutely essential that all parties give our trial coordinator contact information so that the matter can be concluded in an effective manner.

Is there any other business that needs to be addressed today from Madam Prosecutor?  Nothing.      Mr. Hooper -- Mr. Defence?  

In those circumstances, we take our adjournment.  I wish everybody a happy Christmas and a prosperous and enjoyable New Year.  My trial coordinator has reminded us of the very efficient, friendly and dedicated support that the session has received from all members of the Court staff, the registry, the translators and the court reporters, the security, and the other people who have been working behind the scenes to make this a sort of successful session.  So on behalf of the Court, and all of the Court users, we would like to say the special thank you to you all, and to, again, renew our wishes for a happy and enjoyable Christmas season.  

So we take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 0925H)
