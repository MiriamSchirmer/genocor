P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 5th of October -- the 5th November 2007, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Appearances?  The same.  

Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I'm back and I am apologising for the inconvenience caused by my illness, but I'm totally better and ready to go. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm pleased to hear that now.  

The appearances are the same for the Defence.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
The composition has changed.  We're interchangeable, but we are different.  So, today, I, 
Counsel Diagne is here, instead of Mr. Sow on behalf of Mr. Karemera.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the situation is about the same for Ngirumpatse's team.  We're interchangeable with Counsel Hounkpatin, whom I'm replacing today.  She was present up to the last hearing, but -- and I was absent, but now things have changed, I'm present and she's absent.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Forgive me, well, I suppose the interchangeableness to which you referred made me just think that things were as normal, but welcome back to the trial.  

Mr. Witness, after this very long break, your testimony is going to continue.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you started your testimony, and you now have to respond to questions put to you in cross-examination.  I think you'll be cross-examined first of all by counsel for Joseph Nzirorera.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS BDX (continued),
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDX, Muraho.  Amakuru ki?
A.	Good morning.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, first with the assistance of the registrar, I would like the witness to be shown a copy of his statement of May 2005, the French version.  I see that it's already there.  So I don't think it's necessary for this to be distributed since everyone already has a copy of it.  I think he can just look at it, and I want to simply ask him a few questions about it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	First of all, Witness BDX, do you see your signature on the document that's placed before you, a witness statement, dated 11 May 2005?  

Witness BDX, do you see your signature on that document? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda interpreter thinks that the witness cannot hear.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDX, do you see the signature on the witness statement that has been placed before you? 
A.	Yes, I can clearly see my signature.  
Q.	The statement is dated on the 11th of May 2005, and signed with the date of the 12th of May 2005.  
Did the investigators meet with you on the 11th and return on the 12th to obtain your signature? 
A.	I do not remember very well whether the investigators of the ICTR came to see me on two occasions; however, I can confirm that they came to see me on several occasions.  But on the basis of the document in front of me, I think that they came back to see me on the second time, and on that day I put my signature on this statement.  
Q.	And the statement indicates that the place of interview was the Hotel Ubumwe in Gisenyi, that's U-B-U-M-W-E.  Is that correct?  Is that where you met? 
A.	That is correct.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer the witness statement as Exhibit D. NZ355; A for the French, B for the English, under seal. 

The witness has already acknowledged in his direct examination at least one inconsistency, and there may be others.  But I think there's already a sufficient foundation to admit the witness statement so you can evaluate the inconsistencies. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ355A and D. NZ355B admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDX, can you tell me, was this the very first time that you had ever met or had contact with anyone from the ICTR? 
A.	That was the first time that I was meeting investigators from this Tribunal.  
Q.	Did you ever meet any person connected with the ICTR in Nairobi? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	Did you ever do any work on behalf of the ICTR to assist the ICTR prior to May 2005? 
A.	Before May 2005 and after that date, in both cases, I've never worked for or on behalf of the Tribunal.  
Q.	Have you ever received any money from anyone connected with the ICTR? 
A.	No one.  
Q.	Was there ever a period of time that you were living in Nairobi? 
A.	I've never lived in Nairobi city.  
Q.	Have you ever lived Kenya? 
A.	I've never lived in Kenya.  
Q.	Have you ever visited Kenya? 
A.	Yes, I have been to Kenya.  
Q.	And during any of those visits after 1994, did you learn that the ICTR was looking for some people who it hoped to arrest? 
A.	The last time when I was in Kenya was in '98-'99 and I went there for my business with regard to information related to the person presumed to be responsible for the Rwandan genocide.  I heard such information on the radio.  
Q.	And did you yourself ever assist in any way persons who were gathering information on behalf of the ICTR while you were in Kenya? 
A.	Never.  
Q.	Okay.  We're now going to speak about your case in Rwanda.  We're going to -- I'm going to ask the Trial Chamber to move into closed session in a few minutes when we discuss the details of your case, but I want to ask you some general questions first.  

You will agree, will you not, that you have been convicted in Rwanda of forgery and misappropriation, and have been sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I'm aware of that.  
Q.	And are you also aware that at the conclusion of the proceedings in your case, it was ordered that you be immediately arrested? 
MR. N'DOW:  
Sorry, Mr. Robinson.  

I would think that this question should be asked in closed session, given that the witness was led in direct examination on these questions.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, these particular questions don't assist in revealing his identity in any way, and when we do get into the details, I would ask that it be in closed session.  But I think it's a matter of public interest with respect to the credibility of this witness.  And since the questions can be asked and answered without revealing his identity, I don't see the need for a closed session for these questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think this question does not reveal the identity of the witness, and it can be answered.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, perhaps I could remind the Court that Mr. Robinson made a very extensive application before this witness started his testimony.  And part of that application was the suggestion that he should be sent back to Rwanda.  And given the way his question has started out, I'm sure we're returning to that issue right now.  

So, on that basis, I would ask the Court to -- to look at the issue once again from another perspective.  This is an issue that should be dealt with in closed session.  All this witness's Rwandan judicial antecedents were dealt with in closed session. 

Mr. Robinson has his own personal philosophy on what should be in --
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible) 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  Mr. Robinson has clearly articulated his personal philosophy on what materials should be in open session.  We tend to disagree, and I would suggest to the Court that he is about to embarrass the witness, and embarrass this Tribunal by suggesting somehow that the Rwandan government, who is listening to this open session, should come and pick him up.

Now, we need not address it.  In fact, I shouldn't have to make this application in open session.  So, I'm asking the Court to reconsider and make a ruling that anything dealing with this witness's judicial antecedents be dealt with in closed session.  The only way we can effectively protect his rights is by ensuring that his answers to questions are not revealed publicly in regard to this issue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't think that this particular question and this particular answer is capable of revealing the identity of the witness, but, Mr. Robinson, we don't -- we will be looking at this carefully, and any question which has the capacity of revealing the witness's identity will not be permitted in open session.
MR. ROBINSON:
Understood, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDX, my question to you is whether or not you were aware that upon your sentence, it was ordered that you be immediately arrested.
A.	Yes, I'm aware of that.
Q.	And since that time, have you ever surrendered yourself to the Rwandan authorities?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry -- 
THE WITNESS:
No, I've not done that simply because I've appealed against the judgement, so I'm awaiting for the appeal to take place in my presence, and I'm looking for money in order to pay my advocate.  And since my appeal has been lodged successfully, when I'm summoned, I'll go there and I'll be present there.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you believe that you are now, at this time, subject to arrest based upon that case?
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, this is exactly what I was alluding to earlier, and I would ask the Court to interrupt the questioning at this point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. Robinson, this is going too -- too specific.  We have to stop this in open session.  I -- I don't think there could be many people in this position.
MR. ROBINSON:
People who are wanted and haven't surrendered?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I think it's got to a stage where it's better to be careful -- just the factual content now is capable of revealing the identity. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I withdraw that question, Mr. President.  I'll ask another question.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	My question to you, Witness BDX, is whether you would have any objection to the representative of the government of Rwanda here in Arusha being notified of your identity, so that he could check and determine whether or not -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, Mr. Robinson, we -- we don't -- we can't have this. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, if the witness -- if the witness has no objection, then it seems to me that that's something that should be done.  If the witness has an objection, then you've already ruled on the matter.  

But if the witness is claiming and, I believe, falsely, that he can go and come to Rwanda freely, I think I'm entitled to put to him whether or not he's willing to have the Rwandan authorities informed of his identity and presence here.  And if he is, we can so inform them; and if he's not, you can make that judgement -- and in terms of the credibility of his answer to the Prosecutor on direct examination -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but we have already addressed the issue of his protection order.  I think it is -- we don't think we should allow that question at this stage.  

What -- what -- how many answers can he give to this in light of the fact that we've already made a -- we've already examined the issue of his protection.  I don't think it's fair. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I could add?  It goes beyond the issue of protecting the witness's identity, because the witness has rights as well, and we've come across this very issue with regard to other witnesses.  

He has a right to invoke the provision of Rule 90(G), I believe it is.  He's not in a position to protect his rights.  The Court has to protect his rights.  He hasn't consulted with an attorney.  The registry doesn't make an attorney available to this witness.  

So, unless the Court aggressively looks at the issue and proactively protects his rights, he's being put at a disadvantage.  So it's not just an issue of concealing his identity, it's a question of protecting his rights as a witness.  

The Accused are not the only person -- persons in the courtroom that have rights that need to be protected. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we have already ruled that it was not fair.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand that, Your Honour, but my request was that Mr. Robinson be directed to pursue this line of questioning in closed session.  His next question is going to go back to this very issue in a different way. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, the next thing I was going to do was ask for a closed session, so I'll do that now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the public, the witness has been the beneficiary of a protection order, one element of which is that his identity should not be revealed to the public.  We will go into closed session now as an element of that order. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 8 to 15] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 7 by Jean Baigent)




















BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDX, can I just ask you, is that a habit that you have of clutching your chest or are you under some distress because I don't want you to have a heart attack here in this courtroom?  Are you doing that by habit or are you just -- are you feeling under stress here? 
A.	I don't feel well, but it's not serious, you can proceed.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  I'm mean, but I'm not that mean.  

I want to ask you now about the rally that you claim to have attended at the Nyamirambo stadium.  In your statement, you said that in around July of 1993, you attended a rally of political parties at Nyamirambo stadium, and that you had seen Ngirumpatse, Karemera, Mugenzi and 
Hyacinthe Bicamumupaka speak.  

Now, you've told us in your direct testimony that you believe that that rally took place later in 1993; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Now, with whom did you go to this rally? 
A.	I went there with a certain*********************. 
Q.	I believe that's ***********, number 8 on our spelling list.  

It's ******, correct? 
A.	Yes, it is, indeed, ********i.  
Q.	And did you get there before the speeches began? 
A.	Several people spoke.  Ngirumpatse found me there.  I listened to the various speeches which were delivered by leaders who spoke at that rally.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, my question, though, was:  Did you get there before the speeches started? 
A.	I got there before the speeches started.  
Q.	And can you remember, who was the first person to take the floor and speak? 
A.	You see, that was a long time ago, so it is difficult for me to remember the order in which people spoke; however, I would like to tell you that the theme of the speeches was the same for the various speakers.  
Q.	Now, are you sure that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present and made a speech? 
A.	I confirm that, because, if he remembers, he was wearing a boubou, like a Senegalese boubou.  And on that boubou, there was an MRND flag.  He arrived there in a Mercedes Benz.  At that time, Robert Kajuga, the Interahamwe national president, welcomed him and showed him -- took him 
to -- ushered him to his place.  
Q.	Did Kajuga make a speech also at that meeting? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And what about Édouard Karemera, did he make a speech? 
A.	I remember that he spoke and thanked the Irindiro troupe, which belonged to Bikindi.  He said that that dancing troupe had come there in order to entertain people at the rally.  
Q.	Did an individual by the name of Froduald Karamira make a speech at that rally? 
A.	I'd like to emphasise that he was to talk about Hutu Power.  Froduald Karamira talked normally about Hutu Power, but I do not remember whether, on that day, Froduald Karamira spoke.  The reason I mentioned Froduald Karamira is because investigators asked me to talk about 
Froduald Karamira, and that is why I talked about the notion of the Hutu Power.  But I do not remember whether, on that day, Karamira spoke about Hutu Power or not. 
Q.	There's a famous rally at Nyamirambo stadium where it's said that at the end of his speech, Froduald Karamira called with the crowd and chanted, "MDR Power, MRND Power, PSD Power, Hutu Power", and the crowd was chanting back.  Was that the rally at which you attended?  
A.	No, it was not that rally.  I explained to you that I attended the meetings where Ngirumpatse was guest of honour, and the reason why I talked about Hutu Power, and the reason why I said that Froduald Karamira talked about it, it was not to say that he said those words at that rally.  I just wanted to say that Froduald Karamira always spoke about Hutu Power, but I did not say that he talked about Hutu Power at the rally which I attended at the Nyamirambo stadium.  
Q.	Okay, that's helpful, thank you.  Now, did Justin Mugenzi attend this rally and make a speech? 
A.	Yes, he attended the rally, and as I've already said, I do not remember the comments made by each one of them.  But all of them said that Ndadaye had been killed, and everyone knew the circumstances under which Ndadaye had been killed.  Therefore, all Hutus should be united.  
Q.	And how long after the death of Ndadaye did this rally take place? 
A.	I've already said that I do not remember the exact date on which the meeting was held.  But I met a Mr. -- it is possible that the rally was held prior to the date which I mentioned.  I think that the rally was held in the middle of November -- or, in December, or at the beginning of 1994.  So, the date which I gave earlier was not correct.  
Q.	Okay.  I'm -- actually, I'm trying to figure which rally it is that you're talking about myself and there was one rally at which Justin Mugenzi made a somewhat famous speech in which he invoked the Bible, and said something like, "Woe to those who are opposed to -- to us."  Do you remember a speech being made, something to that effect, at the rally that you attended? 
A.	I listened to what he said on the radio.  I told you that I did not participate at that rally.  The rally which I referred to was the rally which I attended.  
Q.	Okay.  So, you did not personally attend the rally in which Justin Mugenzi made a speech in which he referred to the Bible, correct? 
A.	It was not easy to attend all rallies, and it is difficult for me to remember all the meetings which I attended, because they were held a long time ago.  It's not that I don't want to answer your question.  It's simply that -- due to the fact that those events took place a long time ago.  
Q.	But, were you personally present at the rally at which Mugenzi invoked the Bible? 
A.	I have already told you that I do not remember that very well.  I simply confirm to you that I attended the rally where Ngirumpatse was.  I remember the attire in which he was in -- in which he was.  And if there's a video that was taken on that day, you can watch that video in order for you to be able to confirm whether what I'm telling you is true or not.  
Q.	Now, Witness BDX, I want to direct your attention to what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said in his speech.  Can you tell us to the best of your recollection what it is that he said during this rally that you personally attended? 
A.	I do not remember the words which were used by Ngirumpatse.  I told you that the themes of the speeches were the same.  He thanked members of the political parties who had come there in order to support the MRND.  He reminded the people that they should all unite in order to fight against the enemy who had attacked the country.  I'd like to reiterate that the theme was the same for all the speakers.  
(Pages 16 to 18 by Jean Baigent)
























1030H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And in his speech, did Mr. Ngirumpatse mention the word "Tutsi"? 
A.	MRND people did not use the word "Tutsi".  They used the word "Inyenzi".  And when they talked about Inyenzi, everyone knew that they wanted to talk about Tutsis.  
Q.	Now, during the time that you attended that rally, where did you spend the night? 
A.	I spent the night at ********'s house. 
Q.	Now, I want to direct your attention to the events of the 6th of April 1994.  Now, you have told us that you were in Kigali when -- on the evening of the 6th of April; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And did you spend the evening of the 6th of April at the house of **********? 
A.	Yes, I was at his house. 
Q.	Now, when was it -- how many days after was it that you first left that house? 
A.	I'm not sure, but I think I left his house after three or four days, but I'm not very sure about that. 
Q.	And directing your attention to the time that you did -- the time that you stayed at his house, was there anyone else staying there besides you and *****************? 
A.	His home help was there, but there was no one else there.  
Q.	And the first time that you did go out, where did you go? 
A.	I've already said that I left his house with him.  He was going to the Remera petrol station in order to get fuel.  We were with Major Ntabakuze, who had come to get him at the house.  I did not want to go with them, but I -- after that, I went with them, and he gave fuel to the people who needed fuel.  And we got to Kicukiro Sonabeti (sic), but we could not continue further because Inkotanyi had taken over that area.  So we turned around and went towards the president's residence.  And Major Ntabakuze was in charge of funeral arrangements at the president's residence.  We left the president's residence at around 10 in the evening and we tried to find a way which we could use in order to go to Nyamirambo.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we didn't get the name of one of the places mentioned at Kicukiro or Kacyiru. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	When you mentioned a place in Kicukiro, were you speaking of the Sonatube? 
A.	Yes, I was talking about Sonatube. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I believe that's S-O-N-A-T-U-B-E. 

Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, let's take the mid-morning recess now. 

How is your progress going?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very quickly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1112H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDX, we're speaking of the first day that you left the house of *************, and you told us that at some point in that day you arrived at the residence of President Habyarimana in Kanombe; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And about what -- about what time or what part of the day did you first arrive there in Kanombe? 
A.	I do not remember the exact time, but it must have been around 1 in the afternoon.  
Q.	And can you tell us who were the people who you found at the president's residence when you first arrived? 
A.	There I found Protais Zigiranyirazo, Charles Nzebagerageza and his wife Marguerite.  There was Sèraphin Bararengana, younger brother to President Habyarimana.  There was the widow of 
	Colonel Mayuya and her children.  There was Mathias Nyagasaza and the father of Janvier Busugi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness BDX.
MR. ROBINSON:
And each of those names is on the spelling list. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, did you find the wife of President Habyarimana there. 
A.	No, she was not there.  People said that she had been evacuated by the French -- she and her children had been evacuated by the French.  
Q.	And how long before you got there had that evacuation taken place? 
A.	I think that she had left on the previous day. 
Q.	Now, you've told us also that when you were at the president's residence, you observed the wreckage of the presidential plane, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that you saw a leg that you believed belonged to Colonel Sagatwa; is that correct? 
A.	I did not see the leg.  It was **************** who saw the leg. 
Q.	And did you -- did he bury the leg by -- in your presence? 
A.	Yes, I was standing next to him. 
Q.	And who else was present at this time when the leg was being buried? 
A.	Nyagasaza was there as well. 
Q.	Anyone else? 
A.	No one else. 
Q.	Now, did you spend that night at the residence of President Habyarimana in Kanombe? 
A.	Yes, we spent the night there. 
Q.	Now, directing your attention to the next morning, did there come a time when you left that residence? 
A.	We left at around 10. 
Q.	And in which vehicle did you leave? 
A.	We left in a Hilux pickup truck which belonged to Major Ntabakuze -- Colonel Ntabakuze. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the Kinyarwanda interpreter. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Who was driving? 
A.	A military driver.  We left, and when we got to -- we got to the station, and I got on to a Mercedes, normally known as Trapèze, which belonged to Nyagasaza, and we left in that vehicle. 
Q.	Now, in the vehicle that left the house of the president, the Hilux, who was the passengers in that vehicle? 
A.	In the Hilux pickup truck, I was with **************, and other soldiers were in the rear part of the pickup.  Those soldiers accompanied us so as to get us a safe passage.  And when we got to the Bralirwa, that is, the national Rwanda breweries, they left us there, and the soldiers went away. 
Q.	And when you drove away in the Mercedes Trapèze, who was driving? 
A.	I was driving it. 
Q.	And who were the passengers? 
A.	I was with************8.  We went up to Sagatwa's house in the Kiyovu neighbourhood. 
Q.	And was it only you and *********** in that vehicle at that time? 
A.	If my memory serves me well, I would say yes, we were the only ones.  
Q.	Now, when you arrived at the residence of Colonel Sagatwa in Kiyovu, did you go inside? 
A.	No.  *********** showed me that house.  I did not know it.  There were many people who were in their vehicle -- in their vehicles, and those people were getting ready to leave town. 
Q.	So you never went inside Colonel Sagatwa's house; is that correct? 
A.	I did not go inside it.  
Q.	Now, when you arrived in -- at the outside of Sagatwa's house, can you tell us who were the people who you observed there? 
A.	I recognised Zigiranyirazo's wife, whose name is Emma.  And outside the -- Sagatwa's house I saw Nzirorera.  So those were the two people whom I -- who I was able to identify on that day there.  
Q.	Now, did you see Colonel Setako there? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, he was there. 
Q.	And what about François Ngirabatware?  That's N-G-I-R -- 
A.	Yes, he was there.  And Zigiranyirazo's wife actually went into his car or was in his car. 
Q.	Now, when you arrived at Colonel Sagatwa's house and you saw Nzirorera, what was he doing? 
A.	He was not doing anything special.  He was standing there.  He was getting ready to leave.  
Q.	Did you recognise any of the people that were with him? 
A.	I do not remember the people who were with him. 
Q.	Did you have a conversation with Mr. Nzirorera at the house of Colonel Sagatwa? 
A.	People told me that people who were there were getting ready to leave and that soldiers were there in order to assist them get through roadblocks.  I went to him and introduced myself to him.  I told him who my father was.  And he told me, "You are my supporter."  And he said, "Well, come with me.  There's no problem at all."  And he told me that, "You're going to leave with me.  And there are two people for whom we have not been able to find a seat in other vehicles, so you're going to take those two people in your vehicle and leave with them." 
Q.	Now, after this conversation, what did you do? 
A.	People were still getting ready.  I went to Nyamirambo in order to get my luggage, my bag or suitcase, from **********s house.  When I got near Camp Kigali, I saw a gathering of people, people had gathered around a pickup truck in which Ntibitura's son was -- or, daughter was, and that person said the Inyenzis were in Rebero and that in five minutes they were going to come and capture the town.  So I went to join Sagatwa in Kiyovu so that I would not be left behind by the rest of the group.  In other words, I wanted to leave with everybody else.  
Q.	And that first time when you left from Sagatwa's house, what vehicle were you driving? 
A.	I was still driving the Mercedes Benz, which was yellow in colour.  
Q.	And did you have any passengers with you as you went to Nyamirambo? 
A.	No.  I was alone.  
Q.	And what had happened to************ and his father, Mathias Nyagasaza? 
A.	I remember that Nyagasaza came to see us at his son's place in Nyamirambo.  He then said, "I'm going to our home in Gisenyi."  I explained to him the difficult situation, and he did not want me to abandon his son.  He said that we should not leave the town, although the Inyenzi would come there.  So, in any case, he said if there was any problem, then he would help my wife and children.  In any case, we left and met in Gisenyi.  
Q.	So you didn't see Mathias Nyagasaza after you left the president's residence, is that correct, until you got -- 
A.	Nyagasaza left immediately.  I did not see him again after leaving the president's residence.  
Q.	Now, you had driven with Janvier Busugi to the residence of Colonel Sagatwa, and you told us that you left, yourself, alone to go to Nyamirambo.  What happened to *************? 
A.	Sagatwa was the father-in-law of the younger brother of *************, and he remained there.  There was a soldier called Zaïrois, Seyoboka's son.  He remained with Janvier.  That was also Sagatwa's son-in-law.  So those two people took a white Benz, and they went in that vehicle up to Gisenyi.  When I saw them in Gisenyi, they were still driving that car.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, can you give us the full name of the soldier that you just mentioned?  
A.	He was called Zaïre.  He was sub-lieutenant of the former Rwandan army. 
Q.	And he was the son of who?
A.	He was the son of Seyoboka. 
Q.	Is that S-E-Y-O-B-O-K-A? 
A.	Seyoboka is spelt S-E-Y-O-B-O-K-A, Seyoboka. 
Q.	And how old was this son? 
A.	It would be difficult for me to give you his precise age because I don't know it, but I believe he was aged between 28 and 30 years. 
Q.	Now, when you returned to Colonel Sagatwa's residence from attempting to go to Nyamirambo, was Busugi still present? 
A.	I have stated that I left him in Sagatwa's house, and he stayed there.  I had just decided to leave, and I left him there.  
Q.	And it's your testimony that he later returned to Gisenyi, driving a white Mercedes Benz and with the son of Seyoboka as his passenger, correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And whose white Mercedes Benz was that? 
A.	It belonged to Sagatwa. 
Q.	Now, when you returned to the residence of Colonel Sagatwa, after having tried to go to Nyamirambo, did you see any other people there that you had not seen at your earlier visit? 
A.	You know, that was a long time ago, and it's very difficult for me to remember everything.  I met some other persons I had not seen before.  
Q.	When you returned to Sagatwa's residence, what did you do? 
A.	I did nothing special.  I simply waited for the convoy to leave so I could leave at the same time with the others.  
Q.	And approximately what time did the convoy depart from Colonel Sagatwa's residence? 
A.	I did not remember the precise time of the departure of the convoy, but I believe it was towards 2 p.m. 
Q.	At some point were there some people who joined you in your vehicle? 
A.	The persons I took in my vehicle were right there.  They were -- there was an adult and two children. 
Q.	And who was the adult?  
A.	I know him at sight.  I was told that one was director or general manager of OPROVIA.  He was there with his wife and child.  But I don't know his name. 
Q.	Was he there with his wife and child or with two children? 
A.	He had just one child with him.  
Q.	Was it a boy or a girl? 
A.	I cannot remember.  Maybe it was a boy.  
Q.	Can you remember the approximate age of the child?  
A.	He was very young.  I believe between 8 and 10 years old.  
Q.	Now, did there come a time, then, when a group of cars departed from the residence of 
	Colonel Sagatwa, including your car? 
A.	We stopped at the roadblock erected at the traffic signal in Nyabugogo.  
Q.	When you left Colonel Sagatwa's house, approximately how many cars was in the convoy? 
A.	I did not recall exactly, but I believe the convoy had six vehicles.  
Q.	And do you remember who was in the first vehicle in the convoy? 
A.	Those things happened a long while ago, but I know that there was Colonel Setako and two other soldiers, if my -- if I remember correctly, but I do not recall their names.  And so, if I remember correctly, there was Colonel Setako, who was accompanied by two soldiers. 
Q.	And what was the vehicle that they were driving in? 
A.	I remember that there was a Mercedes jeep in the convoy belonging to Nzirorera.  I remember that in the convoy there was a Mercedes jeep belonging to Joseph Nzirorera, and then there was also a Pajero belonging to François Ngirabatware, and then there was also a Golf.  I don't know if Setako got on board that vehicle, a Golf Mark. 
Q.	So the first vehicle in the convoy was occupied by Colonel Setako and two other soldiers.  Do you recall who was the occupants of the second vehicle in the convoy? 
A.	I remember that the second vehicle belonged to Nzirorera, but, as I have said, those things happened a long while ago, and I cannot recall everything that happened.  I cannot give you the exact number of vehicles that made up the convoy and the occupants of the various vehicles.  I find it very hard to do so, because all those things happened a long while ago. 
Q.	You testified in your direct examination that your vehicle was the third in line; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And was Mr. Nzirorera travelling in front of you or behind you in the convoy? 
A.	I have said that it is difficult for me to remember all those details, but logically, Nzirorera's vehicle was before my vehicle because he was the leader of the convoy.  
Q.	And in what vehicle was Mr. Nzirorera travelling? 
A.	It was a -- he was travelling in a Mercedes jeep cross country, green coloured. 
Q.	And who was travelling in that vehicle with him? 
A.	I did not pay attention to the persons who were with Nzirorera. 
Q.	Okay.  So there's one vehicle with Colonel Setako, there is one vehicle with Mr. Nzirorera, one vehicle with you.  Can you tell us if you know of any of the other occupants of any of the other vehicles in this convoy? 
A.	I have said that I remember Françoise Ngirabatware and Colonel Setako.  I can't remember the names of the other occupants of the vehicles. 
Q.	And was François Ngirabatware the occupant of the Pajero? 
A.	He was the one driving that vehicle.  
Q.	And was the wife of Zigiranyirazo, named Emma, a passenger in his vehicle? 
A.	Yes.  She got on board Ngirabatware's Pajero. 
Q.	And do you know any of the other people who were part of that convoy? 
A.	I do not want to lie by citing names of persons who made up the convoy, and I cannot give you other vehicle marks that made up the convoy.  It would be difficult for me to tell you. 
Q.	Now, you've told us that the convoy left Sagatwa's house in Kiyovu and proceeded to Nyabugogo junction, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And how many roadblocks did you encounter before leaving -- well, on the road on -- towards Nyabugogo?  
A.	I remember there were three roadblocks. 
Q.	Where was the first roadblock located that you encountered? 
A.	The first roadblock was situated around the offices of the ministry of finance.  
Q.	And who were manning that roadblock, soldiers or Interahamwe? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness says he did not hear the interpretation of that question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Who were manning that roadblock, the soldiers or Interahamwe, the one in front of the ministry of finance?  
A.	Most roadblocks were manned by the Interahamwe and members of the population that carried on like -- like members of the Interahamwe, and others were armed with spears.  
Q.	What happened when the convoy arrived at this first roadblock in front of the ministry of finance? 
A.	When we got to that roadblock, they opened the roadblock and we continued on our way.  We had no difficulty crossing that roadblock.  
Q.	Where was the second roadblock located that you came to? 
A.	The second roadblock was found a few metres after the Yamaha building. 
Q.	Was that before or after you came to the Kabuga building? 
A.	I do not recall precisely, but I believe that the roadblock was found a few metres before the Kabuga building. 
Q.	What happened when you arrived at that roadblock? 
A.	I have told you that each time we got to roadblock, they would immediately remove the pieces of wood that made up the roadblock, so we had no difficulty crossing them. 
Q.	Where was the third roadblock that you encountered? 
A.	It was the roadblock I mentioned at the Nyabugogo crossroads where there were traffic lights. 
Q.	And what happened when you reached that roadblock? 
A.	When we got to the Nyabugogo roadblock, the convoy stopped, and the Interahamwe who manned that roadblock moved close to our vehicles.  They moved notably to Nzirorera's vehicle.  It was a beautiful car, very strong.  And the Interahamwe told him, "Mr. President, Mr. President, you are leaving us alone in the city, and you are even leaving with soldiers.  Do you think that all alone we'll be able to cope with the Inyenzi?"  And Nzirorera was bound to uplift their spirits a bit, and so he told the Interahamwe that he would ask the soldiers to come back.  And he asked them to -- to be careful, to be vigilant so that no Inyenzi should escape.  After those words, they opened the roadblock and let us through.  
Q.	And do you know why the Interahamwe were addressing Nzirorera as "Mr. President"?  
A.	I do not know why the Interahamwe called Nzirorera "President, president," but everyone knew that Nzirorera was a major personality, an influential member within their party, and I believe the Interahamwe called him president as a form of honour.  
Q.	Now, when Mr. Nzirorera spoke to the Interahamwe, did he remain seated in his vehicle or did he leave his vehicle? 
A.	I remember very well that he opened the door of his car and stood up close to the door of the vehicle, and the Interahamwe moved up to him, and he stood there speaking to them. 
Q.	And where were you when you heard this? 
A.	I was behind the steering wheel of my own vehicle.  I was at the wheel of my own vehicle. 
Q.	And how many vehicles were between your vehicle and that of Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	There was just one vehicle.  
Q.	Does that mean that your vehicle was directly behind that of Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	I have just said that between Nzirorera's vehicle and my vehicle there was another vehicle.  
Q.	Which vehicle was that? 
A.	I have said that it is very difficult for me to remember all these details.  
Q.	Now, after the roadblock at the Nyabugogo traffic light, did you encounter any other roadblocks before leaving Kigali? 
A.	There was a roadblock at Gitikinyoni, there was a roadblock at Ruyenzi, and another one at Kamonyi.  
Q.	At the roadblock at Gitikinyoni, what happened when you arrived at that roadblock? 
A.	The other roadblocks that we had crossed were not very tough.  I've told you that we were accompanied by soldiers, and each time we got to the roadblock, they opened up and let us through.  
Q.	Now, when you got to Ruyenzi, what happened at that roadblock? 
A.	If I remember correctly, when we got to the Kamonyi roadblock, there were a lot of people.  Some persons were carrying their mattresses and other personal belongings, and the Interahamwe were asking for identity cards from passersby, and some of those cards were lying on the ground.  We spent some time at that roadblock, but later on, they opened up and they let us through. 
Q.	Now, did all six vehicles continue out beyond Kigali? 
A.	I was taking care of my own job.  I cannot tell you if all the vehicles that made up the convoy got to Gitarama. 
Q.	Well, as you were driving towards Gitarama, once you left Kigali, did you notice whether or not the soldiers were still with you? 
A.	Not at all.  The soldiers returned to Kigali.  
Q.	Did that include Colonel Setako, who you said was in the lead vehicle with two other soldiers? 
A.	I do not recall very well, but I believe that he continued.  
Q.	Now, when you got to Gitarama, did you stop anywhere? 
A.	We stopped at the filling station before getting to the downtown area.  There were many vehicles at that point, and we were told that the vehicles belonged to members of government, the government known as the government of saviors.  It is at that point that I saw Mathieu Ngirumpatse with a notepad in his hand, and they asked that we should be supplied -- should be given some fuel, and actually fuel was being distributed, and so we received some fuel.  As I said, the vehicles that were said to belong to members of government headed towards Murambi, because it was said that the government would set up at Murambi, but we continued on our way to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi. 
Q.	So was this the same day that the government itself had left Kigali? 
A.	Yes, it was on that same day that the government left Kigali.  
Q.	And the filling station where you saw Mr. Ngirumpatse, was it before or after the road that turns off to Murambi? 
A.	After moving -- moving -- after the road that leads to Murambi, you get to the filling station, and there I saw Mathieu Ngirumpatse and not Nzirorera because Nzirorera was in the same convoy as I.  
Q.	And did you receive gas for your own vehicle at that time? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then from Gitarama, where did you proceed, in which direction? 
A.	After Gitarama, we moved to Gatumba right up to Mukamira. 
Q.	And as you were driving then from Gitarama towards Gisenyi préfecture, how many vehicles remained in the convoy? 
A.	I have stated before that it is very difficult to remember all what happened.  I was worried about my own safety, and so I did not take time to count the vehicles that made up the convoy, but I believe that all the vehicles that made up the convoy were there.  
Q.	Now, when you stopped in Gitarama, did you take on any additional passengers? 
A.	No.  
Q.	So when you left Gitarama, you were still with the couple and their one child that you had taken from Sagatwa's house, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is true, but I remember that the man stopped at the OPROVIA office in Gitarama.  I don't know what he went to do at that Gitarama office.  I do not remember whether I parted company with that man in Gitarama or at some other point, for instance, at Kabaya.  I remember that we stopped for some time in Kabaya.  I don't recall under what circumstances and where I parted company with that man.  But I remember that on the way to Gisenyi I was alone.  
Q.	Well, were you alone when you left Gitarama? 
A.	I have said that I travelled with that man from Kigali to Gitarama, and then he stopped at the OPROVIA branch office in Gitarama.  And right up until Mukamira, I believe that I parted ways with that man, and he boarded another vehicle moving towards Ruhengeri.  But these are details on which I cannot be specific because I am not very sure of what really happened.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that after leaving Gitarama, you stopped at Kabaya, correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Did the entire convoy stop?  
A.	All the vehicles stopped at the Kabgayi (sic) centre.  
Q.	And at Kabaya, approximately what time of day did you arrive there? 
A.	We arrived there in the evening, and we were there for about 30 to 40 minutes, but I cannot give you the exact time of our arrival at Kabaya.  
Q.	Was it dark?  
A.	When we got to Mukamira, it was already evening. 
Q.	From Kabaya, do you recall whether you were alone or whether you still had the couple and their child with you when you left Kabaya? 
A.	I have already told you that I do not remember the circumstances under which I got away from that gentleman.  It's possible that when I left Mukamira, he remained there in order for him to go to Byangabo (phonetic).  But what I know is that from Mukamira to Gisenyi, I was alone.  I did not have any passenger with me.  
Q.	So when you arrived at the Mukamira junction, this is a place where you turn left to go to Gisenyi or you can turn right to go to Mukingo commune, correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And you're telling us that the remainder of the convoy turned right and went to Mukingo, while you yourself turned left and went to Gisenyi; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And did you go directly to Gisenyi by yourself? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And you were -- about what time of day did you arrive in Gisenyi? 
A.	I think that I arrived in Gisenyi at around 8 in the evening. 
Q.	Now, after you arrived in Gisenyi, did you have a conversation with a person by the name of Jean-Baptiste Nemeyabahizi, N-E-M-E-Y-A -- 
A.	*************************************************************************. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And the spelling is N-E-M-E-Y-A-B-A-H-I-Z-I.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did you tell Mr. Nemeyabahizi that you had travelled with the convoy of Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, Witness BDX, I put it to you that you never travelled in the convoy of Mr. Nzirorera, that, in fact, you travelled from Kigali in a vehicle driven by ***********, and you had as your passengers the children of Damien Seyoboka -- that's S-E-Y-O-B-O-K-A -- and that the only convoy that you encountered on that trip was the convoy of Augustin Iyamuremye, I-Y-A-M-U-R-E-M-Y-E.  Would you like to comment on that?  
A.	I'm not crazy, Counsel.  I was not so traumatised as to forget such an event, even ten years later.  What I'm telling you is the truth.  It's not in my interest at all to invent a story to the effect that I travelled in a convoy in which Nzirorera was.  In other words, what I'm telling you here is the truth. 
Q.	Well, Witness BDX, since you gave your direct testimony, I have spoken with ********, and he has told us that -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, is there an objection?  
MR. N'DOW:
Yes.  Your Honour, the reference to *********, I'm not sure -- he's not a witness in -- he's not testified, and Mr. Robinson is just referring to an unsworn statement, and I would object to that line of questioning.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I'm putting my case to the witness.  What I say is not evidence, and it will be up to us to bring ******* to testify before any such information could become part of the evidence in the case, but I'm entitled to confront the witness with that.  That's what I would like to do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness BDX, I was saying that I have spoken with *********** in the United States, and he's told me that you left with him and that you were transporting the children of Damien Seyoboka and that you were not part of Mr. Nzirorera's convoy.  Do you know of any interest from ************to falsely state the circumstances in which you left Kigali? 
A.	That's surprising.  I have the feeling that everybody implicated in the events in question, all those people do not want to admit the truth.  You see, *********** had my money in the night where I spent the night.  You see, the room was not locked.  I did not want to leave him alone with my money.  I don't know why he told you what he told you, but people in exile tend to conduct themselves in that way.  He came with Zaïre in Sagatwa's vehicle, and he came to Gisenyi three days later.  I did not travel with him.  
Q.	And are you saying that he stole some money from you? 
A.	No.  He was keeping my money.  I told him, "Give me my money," but he did not want to give me my money back to me.  I don't think that he actually wanted to steal the money.  He did not want me to abandon him, to leave him behind.  And he knew that I could not leave without my money, that's why he did not want to give me my money so as I should not -- or could not leave without him. 
Q.	But did he give you your money? 
A.	The -- out of $7,500 he gave me back only $7,000.  He had used $500, and I think that he used that amount because banks were closed.  But prior to leaving Gisenyi in order to go to Kenya, he gave me the remaining $500.  
Q.	Now, you have told us that*****************, Jean-Baptiste Nemeyabahizi, that you had come to Kigali as part of Nzirorera's convoy.  Now, you know that Mr. Nemeyabahizi is not in exile, he remains in Rwanda, correct? 
A.	That's right, Counsel. 
Q.	And I had the opportunity to meet him when I was in Rwanda, after you gave your direct testimony, and I represent to you that he told me that when you came from Kigali, you told him that you had travelled with the son of Nyagasaza and that you never told him that you had travelled in Mr. Nzirorera's convoy.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	I do not know why he told you so.  He must have a reason for doing that.  But if he actually told you that, then I would be surprised.  I would be surprised.  ****************************************************
************************************
You see, one cannot explain the conduct of behaviour of some people.  ************************, I could not have hidden anything from him.  I told him that I stayed at Nyagasaza's son's place and he had kept my money from me.  And I told him that I had come there in Nzirorera's convoy.  And I knew very well that he and Nzirorera knew each other very well.  
Q.	And finally, Witness BDX, I put it to you that Mr. Nzirorera travelled from Kigali in a convoy with many people and that not a single one of those people have told us that you were part of that convoy.  Do you have any comment to that?  
A.	Maybe those people do not know me, but I know one thing:  At my age, I cannot afford to fabricate such stories.  And the reason I gave those details is because investigators put specific questions to me.  If I really wanted to lie, why, then, did I not say that when we arrived in Gitarama, he did not continue travelling with us; rather, he remained there and continued attending and taking part in meetings with other government leaders?  Why didn't I say that?  I'm telling you the truth.  I have no reason at all to lie.  No one told me to lie.  What I'm telling you is the truth, and I have nothing else to add.  
Q.	Well, Witness BDX, as we saw from your fraud case, your version of the truth is often at odds with the versions of other people, and it will be up to the Judges in this case as well as in your other case to determine whether you're telling the truth.  But I thank you for answering my questions, and I have concluded my cross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you're going to have to respond to questions from the lawyers representing the other Accused persons, and I think the next person to cross-examine you will be the lawyer representing Mr. Karemera. 

Mr. Registrar, could you just update us?  How much time has been used and what's the status of the time allocated for cross-examination?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Two hours 30 minutes for Mr. Peter Robinson.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The total allocation for the Defence in this case for this witness is how much?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
The total time the Prosecutor spent in examination-in-chief is 2 hours 10 minutes, so for the Defence it's 6 hours 30 minutes.  So we are left with -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no, no.  We had made a -- okay, I think I'll send another note to you.  It was not a three-hour -- it was not just a simple three-hour calculation -- it was not a multiple by three.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, according to your scheduling order, we had 10 hours total for this examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you. 

Yes.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours. 


CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	My name is Dior Diagne.  I'm Mr. Édouard Karemera's advocate.  I have some short questions to ask you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, without wasting any time, I would like to apply for a closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How about -- approximately how long will this last, Ms. Diagne?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
It really depends on the witness, Mr. President, rather than us.  But I would like to tell you that I have very few questions for this witness.  I know we have only a few minutes before the lunch break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

For the information of the public, the Chamber made an order for the protection of this witness, and one of the elements of the order is that his identity should not be revealed to the public.  The questions that are about to be put to him may reveal his identity, and for that reason, we'll go into a short closed session for the duration of that portion of his testimony which has that characteristic. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 33 to 38] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, to everybody.  

Good afternoon, Madam Registrar.  

Mr. Witness, Counsel Weyl will now commence his cross-examination of you. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. BDX, my name is Frédéric Weyl, an advocate with the Paris Bar.  I am one of the counsel for Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And may I request you to shut your microphone when you stop speaking and to turn it on when you start speaking again.  Otherwise, it will pose problems for the interpreters and stenographers.  I am saying this in answer to a request made by the interpreters.  

I find that you probably did not understand since your microphone was not turned off.  Thank you.  For the same reasons, may I request you to observe a pause before answering my questions?  I, myself, will observe a pause before asking my next question.  Have you understood me? 

But you would have to turn on your microphone.  It is a difficult exercise.  We ourselves had a hard time getting used to it.  
A.	Properly understood, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  I was saying that I was one of the counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I haven't many questions to put to you because you did not mention Mathieu Ngirumpatse in your testimony earlier on.  So I will content myself with putting some questions to you on issues raised in examination-in-chief.  And as my colleagues state, I will put some questions to you in closed session, in order not to elicit certain types of information from you. 

Mr. BDX, my first line of questioning has to do with MRND rallies held in Nyamirambo which you said you attended on a date you do not quite remember.  Do you remember the rally you referred to? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	You stated that after the assassination of President Ndadaye, you attended a rally organised by the MRND at Nyamirambo stadium, and that, according to you, that meeting was attended by the following persons:  Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Mr. Mugenzi and Mr. Froduald Karamira.  Do you stand by your testimony? 
A.	Yes.  However, let me make the following clarification:  Regarding Karamira, I am not sure that he attended that rally.  I quite simply mentioned Karamira's name because he was one of the persons who spoke about Hutu Power.  I know that he used that expression, "Hutu Power", during a rally, but I am not sure he used that expression at the rally I attended. 
Q.	Mr. BDX, you must have the gift of divination since that was one of the questions I was going to come to in order to express my surprise, because, to my knowledge, Froduald Karamira did not attend any rallies organised by the MRND in Nyamirambo, and the situation was such that he could not take the floor at such a rally.  So do you confirm that you did not hear Froduald Karamira take the floor at an MRND rally; do you confirm that? 
A.	I would like once more to be clear and specific.  I attended a rally that was attended or got -- brought together political parties that had decided to join forces with the MRND.  If I said that Karamira attended that rally, it is because I was asked the question regarding Hutu Power.  And in answer to that question, I said that it was Froduald Karamira who used that expression, "Hutu Power", and that Froduald Karamira, who was a member of the Hutu Power wing of the MRND, used that term.  But I did not say that at that MRND rally that I attended, Karamira took the floor.  I am sorry if you understood my testimony as you did. 
Q.	We indeed understand your testimony as we can, but that is not what transpired from your examination-in-chief on Wednesday, the 10th of October.  But it is possible that your memory would fail you shortly more than three weeks after your examination-in-chief.  

	Mr. BDX, in answer to a question put to you my learned colleague, Robinson, this morning, you stated that during that period the word, "Inyenzi" signified the Tutsi.  Do you stand by that assertion? 
A.	Indeed, when people used that expression "Inyenzi", they meant the Tutsi.  
Q.	You, nevertheless, are not aware of the fact that during that period the term "Inyenzi" stood for the RPF, and that the RPF itself called itself by that name; isn't that correct? 
A.	It was said that the Inyenzi had attacked Rwanda in 1963 and in 1972, and at the time it was said that the same Inyenzi were known as Inyenzi-Inkotanyi.  But we were aware that when the term "Inyenzi" was used, reference was being made to the Tutsi. 
Q.	Mr. BDX, you see this morning you said that you left Colonel Segatwa's home.  Do you remember that testimony?  You said it in answer to a question put to you by my learned colleague, Robinson, this morning.  
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	At a point in time you stated, and let me quote the record of the hearing:  "People had gathered around a pickup.  Those people included Nkubitura's daughter -- K-N-U-B-I-T-U-R-A (sic) -- she said that the Inyenzi were in Rebero, and that they were going to invade the town in five minutes."  Do you remember that statement you made? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	The Inyenzi who were at Rebero, were they indeed the RPF-Inkotanyi? 
A.	When people talked of the Inyenzi who had attacked the country, they indeed meant the RPF.  But during the war when the term "Inyenzi" was used, they were referring to all Tutsis, and that is public knowledge. 
Q.	But you would agree with me that when they talked of the Inyenzi, they meant the enemy, the RPF, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, indeed, they meant the RPF.  But allow me to provide the following explanation:  The RPF consisted of soldiers.  The Inyenzi, or members of the civilian population who were Tutsi, were also referred to as the Inyenzi. 
Q.	Mr. BDX, again this morning -- and let me again quote your answer to a question put to you by my learned colleague, Robinson.  This is what you said.  

You said: "Nyagasaza --" N-Y-A-G-A-S-A-Z-A -- that that person came and said  "'Don't leave.  The Inyenzi cannot take this town.'"  He was the person who used the word "Inyenzi" or you were the one who used the word "Inyenzi" to designate the RPF that was poised to take the town? 
A.	It was Nyagasaza himself who used the term. 
Q.	And when you were talking about the events of 1993 to 1994, did you yourself not use the term "Inyenzi" to refer to the RPF? 
A.	I would like to recall that the persons who used that term "Inyenzi" were often extremists, but I was not an extremist so I could not refer to a member of the population as an Inyenzi. 
Q.	In your opinion, was the daughter of Ntibitura an extremist? 
A.	All the persons who used that term were extremists.  And you realise that at the time there were a lot of extremists, and extremists exist everywhere in the world. 
Q.	Mr. BDX, I would like us to discuss very briefly another issue regarding your presence in Gitarama the day you saw Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Could you tell the Chamber the date on which you saw Mathieu Ngirumpatse in Gitarama? 
A.	I have explained at length that I cannot remember dates, and I craved your indulgence.  I left Gitarama and headed for my home, and it was when I was in Gitarama that I saw Ngirumpatse.  I believe it was some three days after the death of the president. 
Q.	Mr. BDX, that information is of great help to me.  But maybe with regard to such exceptional circumstances you may have some factors or elements that will help you to establish your timetable from the death of the president to your presence in Gitarama.  So you say the time frame, the interval, was about three days.  
A.	Three or four days, between the 11th and the 12th.  But as I have said before, I cannot be specific about the dates.  
Q.	What date would you say the attack on President Habyarimana was carried out? 
A.	It was on the 6th. 
Q.	So to go by your explanation, on the 7th you went to Kanombe; is that correct? 
A.	I am not sure about that date.  I believe it was the 7th or the 8th. 
Q.	The day after, did you go to Colonel Segatwa's house?  Is that correct? 
A.	I was in the home of Colonel Segatwa two days after. 
Q.	And for how long did you stay there? 
A.	I have explained that I did not stay in the home of Segatwa for long.  I also said that I went to Nyamirambo, but I was forced to go back and so I went back to Segatwa's home, and a short while after the convoy took off. 
Q.	And you went directly to Gitarama? 
A.	I have already explained the itinerary I followed to get to Gitarama. 
Q.	How long did you take to cover that itinerary? 
A.	As you know, there were roadblocks on our way, and so each time we were forced to stop at the roadblocks.  I can't give you the specific time frame that the journey took, but I would say it was between two hours and two hours and 30 minutes. 
Q.	If you say that the government set up in Gitarama on 12th April, it meant that you left Colonel Segatwa's house at (sic) about 12th April? 
A.	Actually, I have said that I cannot remember the dates.  Frankly, I did not know that questions would be put to me on dates.  But I do confirm that when we got to Gitarama, members of government were at the filling station of Gitarama. 
Q.	Witness BDX, the Chamber has to put up with those inadequacies.  You said you did not come to answer those kinds of questions but to explain to the Chamber what you witnessed, your account of the facts, but still feel some want on such inconsistencies, but I feel the Chamber will appreciate.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would now want us to get into closed session to ensure the protection of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how long do you think that will last? 
MR. WEYL:
I think it would not go beyond half an hour.  Half an hour should be too much.  But as my colleague, Madam Diagne, mentioned this morning, and to actually demonstrate it, it would all depend on how the witness answers the questions put to him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, for the benefit of the public, the Chamber has made an order for the protection of this witness, and one of the elements of that order is that his identity should not be revealed to the public.  The questions that are about to be put to him might reveal his identity, and in those circumstances, we have to go into a closed session for approximately half an hour.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 43 to 53] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 39 to 42 by Eleanor Bastian)

	(Court resumed at 1636H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, Witness, the Prosecutor will ask a few questions and that will complete your cross-examination. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that you were with the son of Mathias Nyagasaza.  Can you clarify for this Court how many sons you know Mathias Nyagasaza to have? 
A.	Nyagasaza has a son called Janvier and another one, Victor Mukuza, the son-in-law of 
	Colonel Sagatwa -- another son by the name of Dieudonné.  Those are the three sons of Nyagasaza.  They have the same father and mother.  He had other sons called Kahudo (phonetic) and Kiniga Mazi (phonetic) born of Nyagasaza's second wife.  The mother of Janvier and Victor died a very long time ago.  I believe those are the sons of Mathias Nyagasaza. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Between the 6th and the 12th, that is when you left Kigali, how many of Nyagasaza's sons, to your recollection, would have been in Kigali? 
A.	Only Janvier Busogi and Mukusa were in the United States and Dieudonné is in Switzerland.  Whereas, Gabunzi (phonetic) and Kininga Mazi (phonetic) also lived in Switzerland. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the night of the 6th April, did you see Mathias Nyagasaza anywhere else in Kigali? 
A.	Nyagasaza joined us in his son's home.  Nyagasaza's home was in Kigaruso (phonetic).  I would say that he joined us on the 8th of April, if I remember correctly.  When he contacted us, he told us that he was going to Gisenyi and we had to stay in town, because he didn't think the town would be invaded.  That is why he left us in Kigali.  I again saw him at the president's residence.  He subsequently returned to Gisenyi before us.  That is what happened. 
Q.	Can you tell us why he was concerned about the safety of his son?  Can you just explain that to the Court, please.  
A.	Let me tell you that Nyagasaza was not concerned about his son's security.  He was a very important and influential man.  All soldiers knew him.  Nyagasaza was a very influential person in Rwanda.  He was one of the heavyweights in Rwanda.  All high-ranking officers knew him.  He was 
	Bagosora's brother-in-law.  The two children, Kahudo (phonetic) and (unintelligible), were children born of his second wife.  To sum up, Nyagasaza was not concerned, or had no fears regarding the security of his son.  As you know, even members of the Presidential Guard visited him.  And when he was in his son's home, members of the Presidential Guard came to see him.  That is why I say he could not have had any fears regarding the safety of his son. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, moving to your case in Rwanda, Mr. Witness, you were jointly charged with****************, (unintelligible)? 

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to say that after you urged us to be very cautious, for which reason we went into closed session -- I do not quite understand why the Prosecutor is opening up these issues without requesting a closed session. 
MR. N'DOW: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  Mr. President, I would reserve this to the last, and then I would ask for us to go into closed session for two minutes just to clarify this issue.  So I'll proceed with another line of questioning. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were cross-examined to a very good extent by the Defence in relation to crimes that were alleged to have been committed in Rwanda.  Does this alleged offence have anything to do with the observations of Mr. Nzirorera at the roadblock in (unintelligible)? 
A.	No connection. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have any reason to give false testimony against the Accused in this case? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda interpreter would like the Prosecutor to repeat his question, Mr. President. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you, for any reason, have cause to give false testimony against the Accused persons? 
A.	I have already stated that I had no reason to give false evidence against the Accused.  Let me remind the Chamber, that investigators of the Tribunal contacted me to ask me to come and tell the truth about the matter which I know.  And they put questions to me regarding Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and I told them under what circumstances I had seen Ngirumpatse.  I told them that I was in a convoy in which Nzirorera was.  And I pointed out that we met Mathieu Ngirumpatse at the petrol station.  

But as far as I'm concerned, it was not prosecution evidence as such.  All I said was that I saw 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse at the petrol station.  I did not say that Ngirumpatse had incited people to kill others.  All I have come to tell this Chamber is that I saw him at a petrol station.  I did not say that Ngirumpatse instigated members of the population to kill others. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, you have, both in direct examination and in cross-examination, given graphic and specific details about the car that Mr. Nzirorera was in and the convoy.  Did you speak to anyone or did you have cause to speak to anyone who may have travelled with Nzirorera to know these specific details? 
A.	I did not have a conversation with any member of the convoy.  I could not have gone to look inside Nzirorera's vehicle.  He was an authority.  Perhaps he was transporting friends of his in his car.  I could not have approached his vehicle to see who was in the vehicle.  As you know, he was an important figure. 

MR. N'DOW: 
I wonder if I could permit the Court to go into closed session to permit us -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  For the benefit of the public, the witness is a protected witness and, as such, the identity cannot be revealed.  We have to go into closed session so questions can be permitted which may reveal his identity.  It will last for about five minutes.  But we need to go into closed session now.

(Pages 54 to 56 by Melissa Hook)





























MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, after the long delay, we now have you back before us for the completion of your testimony.  You are going to have to be cross-examined, and the lawyer who will be doing this first, will be the attorney representing Édouard Karemera.  

I remind you of the oath that you took to tell the truth when you first gave evidence in this case, and to remind you that you still remain under that oath.  

Ms. Diagne will now cross-examine you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, for the reminder.  
WITNESS AMB (continued),
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	My name is Dior Diagne.  I am a lawyer with the Dakar Bar Association, and I'm here to defend 
Mr. Édouard Karemera, and it is in that context that I'll put a few questions to you.  

Witness AMB, the President reminded you when we began of the solemn declaration you took before the Chamber on the 1st of October, when you testified in the direct examination of counsel for the Prosecution.  So, Witness AMB, I am reminding you of that solemn declaration, because at some point, you went back home -- or, maybe, I should say you vanished as if by magic.  Where did you go when you left here on the 1st of October? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It is true that I was here on the date you mentioned, but at some point I had a problem in my family.  That is why I went back home.  I thank you.  
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  And since we are amongst ourselves here, I would like you to explain to the Chamber the nature of the problem that prompted you to leave so quickly. 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  My mother-in-law died, and I was informed of it when I was in Arusha.  So, I sought permission to go back home and participate in the funeral.  
Q.	So, how did the information get to you?  That is the first question; and secondly, who gave you permission to go? 

MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, I'm going to interrupt at this point.  This is not the line of questioning that goes to any issue of credibility for this witness.  

Clearly, this witness is not in control of his own movements, and I'm wondering if this is really a relevant line of questioning for us.  So perhaps the Chamber could advise us or Ms. Dior Diagne can -- can let us know how this pertains to his testimony in this case.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, what I have to say is that I'm mentioning facts that moved on us here, and it is obvious that, in the presence of this witness, we should talk about it.  

I do not concern -- I do not understand the concern or the sudden nervousness of counsel for the Prosecution with respect to relevance.  Maybe, if he let me move on a bit more, then he may judge it for himself.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Diagne, we agree that it is not really relevant.  We -- we -- as I indicated to you, the Chamber had made enquiries and we had a report from the registry of the involvement of the witness protection section as to his movements back to Rwanda, so we think you should move on. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, actually, I was trying to lay the foundation for another line of questioning, and at this time, I'd like to ask the witness to take off his ear -- his headphones, because I would like to consult with the -- the Bench for a while.  

Witness, can you please take off your earphones? 

Witness, do you understand English? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
No, his headphones are off.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I'll now turn to you.  In actual fact, you conducted an investigation, and the registry submitted a report to you.  Unfortunately, each time you insist with the witnesses and ask them not to discuss the contents of their testimony with anybody -- as long as they are not through with their testimony before the Chamber.  However, it so happens that this witness had a time lapse; he left here.  He met people in Rwanda, and what the report did not mention is the question I raised to the (unintelligible)...while he was in Rwanda, he discussed his testimony with other people.  That was the purport of the line of questioning I was following.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we will permit that question to be asked, we permit you to ask those questions.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness AMB, I'd like to ask you:  Do you understand English? 
A.	No, I do not understand English.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, I'll come back to my first two questions.  The first one:  Who informed you of the death of your mother-in-law; second question, who gave you permission to attend the funeral? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I don't think I am empowered to answer those two questions.  You know that before I returned to Rwanda, there were services that assisted me in taking the plane.  I did not take the initiative of going back to Rwanda personally.  You should, rather, ask the services of this Tribunal to tell you under what circumstances I returned to Rwanda.  When I'm here, I'm at the disposal of this Tribunal.  So you should, rather, put that question to the services of the Tribunal that assisted me in returning to Rwanda.  
Q.	Witness, that was not the meaning of my question, the circumstances of your going back to Rwanda.  My question was:  Who informed you of the death of your mother-in-law? 
A.	Well, if you want to know, it was my wife who gave me that piece of information.  
Q.	And who gave you the permission to attend the funeral? 
A.	You know, I don't know how this Tribunal operates.  I'm here simply as a witness.  I simply said that my mother-in-law had died, and I was authorised to go back to Rwanda.  And since the Prosecutor and the President had stated there was a report on that subject and the report has been submitted to you, I don't know why you're insisting on this point.  
Q.	Witness, I'd like you to limit yourself to the question that I put to you.  Questions that I don't ask or answers that you don't need to give me, the Chamber will tell you.  But, as long as I am not forbidden from asking you questions, you have to answer them.  When you say, "I was authorised, I was given permission", who did? 
A.	Counsel, I have the feeling that you are seeking to intimidate me.  A misfortune occurred in my family, and when I disclosed that information, my return to Rwanda was facilitated.  There was a report to that effect.  

Unless you're asking me for news from my country, but, as far as the workings of this Tribunal are concerned, I -- that is not my business.  I simply disclosed the information to the relevant services that there was a death in my family and I was authorised to return home.  That is all. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, maybe I could assist.  The question is more simple than you think it is.  You see, when you made the report to the relevant authority, and the relevant authority told you you could -- you could return to Rwanda -- all the question is, is who was it that you reported to, and who told you you could go to Rwanda?  That's all the question is:  Who was the relevant authority to whom you reported, and who gave you permission to go to Rwanda? 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  When I received information on the death of my mother-in-law, I went to the person who gave me the telephone.  It was on a Sunday, and the next Monday I came here and my colleague testified before me.  And we telephoned from here, and I was told that I was authorised to prepare and return to Rwanda for the funeral.  Somebody took me in a car and we went to the airport.  I got on board the aircraft and got back to Rwanda.  
Those are the circumstances of my return to Rwanda.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	How many days did you spend in Rwanda before coming back here? 
A.	I do not remember very well, but, I believe, that I returned on the 19th of this month.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	So, a quick calculation would show us that you spent 19 days? 
A.	Yes.  No, I believe, I left either on the 10th, or, on the 9th, or thereabouts.  
Q.	Witness AMB, during your stay in Rwanda, did you have occasion to discuss with any member of your family, or with some authority, or with a friend?  In short, did you discuss with anybody whatsoever of your stay here before this Tribunal? 
A.	No.  One cannot discuss such a topic; it is a personal matter.  I did not discuss it with anybody whatsoever.  
Q.	Thank you.  Secondly, I would like us to move to examine closely your testimony from the 
1st of October before this Chamber.  In fact, I would like you to shed some more light before the Chamber on what I consider as a -- grey areas.  The first question I would like to put to you, is this:  When did you go to Kibuye for the first time? 
A.	Thank you.  The first time I went to Kibuye was in the month of June -- well, it was towards the end of the month of June.  I cannot be specific on the date, but it was the last days of the month of June.  
Q.	You actually mean the last days of June, or the last week of June, what exactly did you mean? 
A.	It was during the last days of June -- and to me, days are actually like dates and it was after the 20th of June.  
Q.	Are we talking about 1994? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So, you had not gone there before the month of April? 
A.	No.  
Q.	And after June 1994, how many more times did you go there? 
A.	On that occasion, we went to Kibuye and we spent three days there.  And on the fourth day, we returned and I did not go back there again.  
Q.	I believe there was a small interpretation problem, because I heard, "On that occasion, I was there four times," but on what occasion are you talking about? 
A.	I am talking about the dates on which we discussed when I said I went to Kibuye.  On those dates, we went to Kibuye, but we did not come back, we stayed there.  
Q.	Could you come back on the circumstances of your visit, so to speak, to Kibuye? 
A.	Thank you.  I went to Kibuye because I was transporting Interahamwe who were accompanied by members of the CDR, and they were going to kill Tutsi in Kibuye.  If you want, I can tell you how those events started, but the objective was to seek out Tutsis in Kibuye and kill them.  
Q.	So, you were transporting persons who were going to kill Tutsi in Bisesero; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	They -- were they members of the CDR or the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Sorry? 
A.	They were Interahamwe and members of the CDR.  In fact, there was no major difference between the Interahamwe and members of the CDR.  On one day, they would sport the Interahamwe uniform; and the next day, they would wear the CDR party uniform.  So these people were like, mixed up.  
	(Pages 60 to 64 by Jean Baigent)

















1725H
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Q.	All right.  And why did you agree to play that tragic role? 
A.	Thank you.  It is maybe because you were not in Rwanda.  Your clients can explain it to you.  We were compelled to do the things we did so as not to have trouble; we agreed.  We agreed that, do what those people ordered us to do.  So it is in that context that we transported the Interamahwe wherever they wanted to go, and they showed us -- they showed me where they wanted to go, and I transported them to save my life knowing that anybody who failed, who refused to obey their orders, was killed. 
Q.	And for how long did you do it? 
A.	I did that from the month of May until we left the country.  I believe we went to exile on 17 July.  I took them wherever they went -- wherever they wanted to go.  Not only in Kibuye, had I transported them wherever had they wanted to go.  
Q.	Is it correct to say that when -- state that you did so during the day, and in the night you went to bed as normally, as naturally as possible, and the next morning you resumed the same activity? 
A.	That's true.  They came and took me whenever they wanted.
Q.	And, of course, you, you worked under duress.  If you did not obey them, you would be killed. 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Who owned the vehicle in which you transported CDR militants and Interahamwe? 
A.	It was a pickup truck which had the number -- a number beginning with "AT" and a blue background. "IT".  It belonged to a Burundian who worked in a company -- a company that constructed the brewery road.  Actually, the vehicle had been requisitioned -- or, rather, it had been commandeered. 
Q.	Was it seized from the Burundian? 
A.	No, it was not a Burundian.  I don't know if I understood properly how the vehicle was -- was taken away. 
Q.	Actually, you are the one who said before the Chamber, here, that the vehicle was a pickup with the registration number IT, with a blue background, belonging to a Burundian.  Did I understand you well there? 
A.	No, the vehicle did not belong to the Burundian.  The vehicle belonged to a company that constructed the brewery road. 
Q.	And under what circumstances did you mention a "Burundian" a while ago? 
A.	I did not mention a "Burundian".  Maybe you did not understand me.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the apologies of the translators in the Kinyarwanda booth.  We made a mistake.  We thought we heard a Burundian.  We apologise.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
I hope the apologies are directed to the counsel for the Defence.  In any case, you are all forgiven. 

BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Q.	Witness AMB, the vehicle in question, was it different from the Toyota Mac vehicle (inaudible) type, IB1475 registration number, dark in colour, that you drove during those events? 
A.	Thank you.  I did not drive any other vehicle apart from the pickup that I mentioned.  Now, regarding the blue coloured vehicle, it belonged to a certain Tomas.  It was a vehicle belonging to the nuns that Tomas had impounded, and I'd never driven that vehicle.  
Q.	During the events, did you own a vehicle?  Did you have a vehicle to yourself? 
A.	No, I did not. 
Q.	So when you finished your work in the evening, what vehicle did you use to get home? 
A.	They drove me home and then they went back. 
Q.	So, I'll put this question to you:  You are threatened by Interahamwe who tell you that if you don't drive them, to get them to do their dirty business of killing the Tutsis, you would be the one that would be killed.  So, you are under maximum duress.  In the evening they drop you off at home and you do not escape; you do not try to seek refuge, you stay there.  And every morning they come to look for you to do exactly the same dirty business.  Witness AMB, did I understand you correctly? 
A.	Thank you.  I don't think we should dwell too much on that aspect.  Transporting people and continuing to collaborate with them does not mean that I was not prosecuted.  I am here, but I was charged.  I pleaded guilty and I was punished for the crime.  So I committed a crime in transporting them.  I did not escape because I was afraid for my family that could be exterminated by those people.  And I was punished for not having refused.  And I spent six years and four months in jail.  And I still have a sentence that consists in general interest or community work.  I committed that crime.  I asked for forgiveness.  I was punished for it.  And the reason for my presence is to tell the truth before the Chamber.
Q.	You say that you did not escape because you wanted to protect your family.  Yet, if I have my facts correct, your mother as well as your entire family were exterminated during that period, and your own father, who was Hutu, was greatly threatened; do you confirm that?  
A.	Well, since my mother was Tutsi, it was normal that her family be exterminated.  And my father, a Hutu, had problems.  We were not trusted.  We were not considered as full-fledged Hutus; that is why we were afraid.  We could not act freely.  Whoever was not a purebred Hutu had no rights in Rwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, it is just past 5:30.  How do you want to proceed now?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
From the beginning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  Do we take the adjournment now or you are thinking you might be able to wind up?  It is just past 5:30 already.  

MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
No, I don't intend to conclude.  

I think it would be wiser, Mr. President, to adjourn.  We have taken some precious minutes, and as you said, each minute counts, and then we will continue tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, we are about to take the afternoon's adjournment.  It is already 5:30, and we resume tomorrow morning at quarter to nine.  As I told you the last time, you are not to discuss your case or the testimony with anybody during the adjournment, and you have to return to give evidence for 
quarter to nine tomorrow morning.  

We take our afternoon adjournment now.  
 (Court adjourned at 1740H)
