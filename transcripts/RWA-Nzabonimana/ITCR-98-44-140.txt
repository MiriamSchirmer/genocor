 CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When you were asked in-chief by the Prosecution why the investigators had come to see you in November of 2004, you said you didn't know that they had come to your home in order to see you; is that right?  
A.	I answered the Prosecutor by telling him that I saw investigators come to my home and they asked me if I knew something concerning Rwamakuba.  He therefore asked me how they came to my home and I said that they came to ask me if I knew anything about Rwamakuba.  
Q.	And you have no idea what brought them there?  
A.	I saw a vehicle parked in front of my home.  You know, vehicles go this way and that way in our area.  I don't know how they came.  
Q.	Did you make a statement on that day?  What happened?  
A.	I gave them a statement on that day, a statement which they took down.  
Q.	And when did you sign that?  
A.	Soon after I made my statement, I signed it.  
Q.	It would appear from my statement that it was a statement that was, in any event, signed not at your home but in Kigali at the prosecutor's office.  How did that come about?  
A.	In my part of town there was no typing machine where my statement could be typed, so the investigators had to go back to their offices in order to draft the statement or to type the statement.  So they captured the purport of my statement in writing and mentioned the date of the statement on the document and I signed it.  
Q.	This was a Mr. Baghel, who we understand takes his portable printing press with him.  Are you sure that's how this came about?  
A.	I did not see the machine you are referring to.  What is important to me is that the statement was typed or drafted as I gave it and I signed it.  If you have -- you must have noticed that there was no change in date.  I do not quite recall the date, but the date wasn't changed.  
Q.	Now, can we go back to the cows?  How far from your home was the pasture?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence counsel dwelt at length on that question and I tried to tell him that I did not take any specific measurements to be able to tell him that there was this difference or that separating the two points.  But if I can make an estimate, I would say that the pasture was on my father's land.  The Defence counsel has come back on that issue on several occasions whereas I had given him enough explanations.  
Q.	I thought yesterday -- perhaps it was a cultural stag or problem here, but I have been talking to Rwandese since questioning you.  Why can't you tell us how far away it was?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, before we adjourned yesterday evening, the Defence counsel had promised not to come back on this issue.  I thought he had understood.  I don't know why he is insisting on the issue.  
Q.	Let me ask you this:  Was the pasture in your cellule, the same cellule as your home?  
A.	I clearly explained to you that the cattle or the cows were on the family property in the same secteur and in the same cellule, and I am referring to the cellule where my parents lived -- I think you, therefore, have the explanations that you require.
Q.	So this pasture -- is the family home and the family land -- or, let me put it like this.  Is the family home -- does it stand on the family land and is it on the family land that the cows are pastured, and I put it like that, or is it all in one unit? 
A.	That's how it is.  
Q.	Right.  So, in another words, the cows were very close to home, weren't they?  
A.	I explained to you that the cows were on the family property not far from where our home was -- our house was.  
Q.	Perhaps we got the impression it was on a separate pasturage, a separate field, perhaps even some distance away, but that's not the position.  So you are looking after the cattle, this is the 13th of April; it's the day the massacres start.  Your father comes to see you and he tells you that the massacres have started in your secteur and that everyone -- you said he told you -- must seek refuge and be strong, and you stayed with the cattle.  Is this right?  Until the afternoon, when an Interahamwe called Frédéric arrives and you explain that he said to you that, "It was all over now for the Tutsis, we are going to kill you now and eat your livestock," and it was thanks to the good Lord you said that you survived.  In fact, in your statement, Frédéric appears to give you advice.  He advises you to flee; is that right? 
A.	No, he did not give me advice to go and seek refuge.  I think it is simply that the good Lord was protecting me.  It is only God who protected me, otherwise, Frédéric did not give me advice to the effect that I go and look for refuge.  
Q.	Well, in your statement you say that he told me that it would be better for me to flee, is that right or not?  
A.	No, did he not tell me that it would be better for me to flee.  He merely told me that the fate of the Tutsis was sealed and this meant that I had to try to escape.  That person was an Interahamwe.  I think you understand what the term "Interahamwe" means.  
Q.	Now, in answer to questions from me yesterday, you said that you were not sure when you got to the health centre -- it was between the 13th and the 15th.  So I just want to come back to your statement where you say, "In the evening, that is the evening of the 13th, when I herded the cattle back home" -- just pausing there -- is that right, you herded the cattle back home that day?  
A.	I left the cattle on the pasture land.  I was scared.  I didn't have to be concerned about the cows.  Cows are only animals that can be killed and eaten, but when you lose your life, you can't get it back.  If that is what you wrote down, then you had misunderstood what I told you.  
Q.	What I am reading is your statement that you made just in November of last year.  It reads:  "In the evening, when I herded the cattle back home, I didn't see my father.  So I decided also to take refuge in the Kayanga health centre."  That's what you have written before and -- and that is not right what you are telling us.  Is that the position?  
A.	You are going besides the point.  You have just said from what you have read that my father came and saw me and that he told me that the massacres had begun.  Why, therefore, did I have to go and look for him, whereas he had told me that the massacres had begun?  So I had to bear myself like a man and try to see what I could do.  I think you are inventing things.  
Q.	Well, it seems, in any event, both the pasture and your home are in the same place.  So, any way, you decided to go to the Kayanga health centre.  How far is that from your home, the Kayanga health centre, or is that something you can't help me with?  
A.	The distance between my house and the health centre -- well, I think we will find ourselves talking about -- I think we will find ourselves in the same situation whereby you asked me to tell you the distance between my home and the pasture land.  

Your Honours, that health centre is built in my secteur, but it is not built in my cellule.  I, therefore, I am not in a position to tell you the distance in terms of metres between my house and the health centre.  I have avoided to make such an estimate, and I think that if the Defence counsel wants to know the truth about what happened, he should just make do with my answer.  
Q.	Well, it looks like I am going to have to make do with your answer.  It's a 10 minute walk with moderate pace, isn't it?  That's how long it takes to get to your home to the health centre, 10 minutes.  Do you agree?  
A.	I never calculated how much time it would take.  If I had known that someone was going to ask me such a question, I would have been prepared.  I would have tried to cover the distance to see how much time can be taken to cover it or to find out what was the distance in metres between my house and various locations.  The health centre is built in my secteur, but not in my cellule.  Please, just take that as the truth.  
Q.	This is the place that you have lived for over 25 years and you can't even estimate the distance between your home and the health centre.  Because you see, in your statement, you say that you went to the health centre.  You got there that night, didn't you, the night of the 13th?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I am going to explain.  I told the Defence counsel because I am under the impression that he is insisting on that issue.  If the counsel really wants to know that distance, I can go back home where I feel at ease, if it's fine with him, he can come with me and we can measure that distance.  We will calculate the minutes or hours that it takes to cover the distance.  And I think the counsel -- Defence counsel therefore can be clear as to the information that he is seeking because, apparently, he doesn't want to understand what I am telling him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, many people come to give evidence, some without the benefit of the high standard of education that you have, and many of them have found it possible to answer questions of this nature.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  The truth be told.  I am trying not to confuse things so that later it is said that it is an intellectual who made this or that estimate, and that is the reason where I am avoiding to say that this distance represents this number of metres, and that is why I am saying that the health centre is located in my secteur, but not in my cellule.  Between my cellule and the site of the health centre, there are about two -- there are two other cellule or so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You just described yourself as an intellectual.  You are asked whether walking at a moderate pace, it would take more or less than 10 minutes, and you can't answer the question?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, it would take more than 10 minutes.  You will understand that the distance between two cellules is long.  You know, cellules in Rwanda are pretty big, and this would be a distance that would take a lot of time to cover it, and if this has to be done in a time of war -- 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, let me step over then.  You see, in your statement -- and listen carefully, these are your words in your statement as you told us, carefully -- first of all, you tried to read it yourself as best you could, and then it was carefully read to you and then you signed it and you acknowledged that it was correct and you have had the opportunity to alter things.  Since then, you've met with the Prosecutor several times.  You've been here, quite a time in Arusha.  This is your statement and it reads:  

	"In the evening when I herded the cattle back home, I didn't see my father, so I decided also to take refuge in the Kayanga health centre.  I went there through farms, in the company of two boys," you name them.  "When I arrived at the health centre, there were already very many refugees who had come from the entire region with whom we spent the night.  The next day "-and, we will come to the next day -- the events that concern the Accused in this case, Rwamakuba.  

Now, it is plain as day, isn't it, reading your statement that what you are saying there, whether it is right or whether it's wrong now, what you are saying there is that you got to the centre on the night of the 13th?  Do you agree with that?  That is what your statement says.  
A.	I don't agree with you.  I don't think you are reading my statement faithfully.  I know that after leaving behind the cattle, which I left on the pasture land, I explained to you that life -- my life is more important than cattle.  I passed through sorghum farms in order to look for a hiding place.  It was between the 13th and 15th that I got to that location.  I have never said that I got to the health centre during the night of the 13th, that is written nowhere. 
Q.	I suggest it is plain on the face of your statement that that is what you are saying.  Now, let me ask you this then.  According to your evidence, are you saying that having left the cattle, which now we discover is more or less at home, you didn't get -- you spent the night in the fields, is that what you are saying?  And then the next day, you are hiding again, and you didn't get to the health centre till the next night, is that what you are now saying?  
A.	Is what I am telling written in the statement?  What I am telling you is the following:  You are lucky that you didn't live through the war.  If somebody is hunting you down, seeking to kill you, you cannot reveal yourself on the roads.  You will try to go through fields and that would take a long time, and this is not something that you can do that easily when you are being hunted down.  Please try to understand it as I have explained to you.  Do not try to fabricate things please, Counsel.  
Q.	All right.  So, whatever it says in your statement, it is quite plain that you are saying now that you don't know whether you got to the health centre on the night of the 13th or the night of the 14th.  And that's, of course, quite important because it means that Rwamakuba no longer comes, as you say in your statement, on the 14th, but he comes on the 15th.  Is that because you have learnt or heard that the killings at the health centre were on the 15th, that you've had to shuffle and change your evidence in order to put yourself there?  Is that what this is all about, the problems of the pasture, the problems with the distance, the problems with how long it would take you to get there?  Is this what it is all about?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I gave a statement, I signed this statement.  Defence counsel had ample time to read it.  As someone who was being hunted to be killed during that war, I know that on the morning of the 13th, my father told me that the massacres had begun.  He immediately went to seek refuge; he did not come back.  

	In the afternoon, as I did not know where to go, the Interahamwe, whose name I have mentioned in my statement, told me and I tried to seek refuge.  It's very difficult to find refuge during war time.  So I do not really remember the time, the date on which I arrived at the health centre, which is why I estimated that I got there between the 13th and the 15th.  I did not say that I spent the night of the 14th or the 16th there.  If someone told you that the massacres at the health centre occurred on the 15th, perhaps they have their own information.  But, I, for my part, say that this event occurred between the 13th and 
	the 15th.  
Q.	Yesterday, you were telling us, because of the dramatic nature of the events you couldn't forget the date.  Do you remember saying that?

Well, let me move on.  You spent a night at the Kayanga health centre, and the next morning -- you spent the time -- you were there, inside or outside, sir?  
A.	When I got to the health centre it was night.  I found other refugees there, as well as patients who were receiving treatment at the health centre.  The next morning, the deputy director of the health centre came with the Interahamwe to get people out.  That is when we were placed in the courtyard and they told us not to leave that place, telling us that we were forbidden to leave that place.  Towards 
	10 o'clock, I realised that the situation was becoming increasingly complicated, and I understood that there would be no safety at that place.  I sidled along the wall of the house and I tried to hide in the sorghum farm that was not far from the health centre.  So it is in the sorghum farm that I hid.  You will find the development of events in my statement.  

Mr. President, this is what happened.  I was not in the house.  I think this is what is set down in my statement.  
Q.	Very well.  Can I just come back to the question.  Did you spend the night at the Kayanga health centre, indoors or out of doors?  
A.	Counsel, you don't want to understand what I am explaining to you, or you are doing this deliberately.
Mr. President, Your Honours, I have explained -- 
Q.	Could you just answer the question?  It is a very simple question.  Did you spend the night at the health centre inside, indoors, or did you spend it out of doors?  It is a simple question.  Can you give me a simple answer, please?  
A.	When I arrived at the health centre, I found many refugees there.  There could not be any space inside the house.  Within the health centre perimeter, there is a courtyard, and it is in this courtyard that we spent the night.  
Q.	Thank you.  So, "I spent my time on that night at the health centre outside with other refugees in the courtyard."  And where is that courtyard?  Is it between the health centre and the road or is it somewhere else?  I hope that's not too difficult a question for you.  
A.	It is not a difficult question.  I am going to give you a good explanation and that is why I am here.  Next to the road, there is a courtyard where people were placed in the morning.  When you get into the health centre, there is another courtyard which separates the health centre and the wards where the patients are.  So, we were in this courtyard between the rooms, the open space at the health centre.  
Q.	The man, Etienne Kamanzi, who you talked about, he was never a director and he wasn't ever a deputy director; he was just a nurse who hadn't been working there very long; isn't that correct?  
A.	To the best of my knowledge, I know that he was assistant to the director of the health centre.  There was a director who had an assistant.  This is what happens everywhere, even in a classroom there is a head of the class and someone who assists him.  So I know that he was the assistant to the director.  
Q.	Now, you told us yesterday it was about 8:00 in the morning that he, accompanied by Interahamwe, Interahamwe who were carrying weapons -- such as, clubs that were dripping with blood and spears, that they began by going to all the wards, and they took us out."  But they didn't take you out because you were already outside, you tell us; is that right?  It was the others, presumably, that they had to take out.  
A.	I explained to you that we were in a place that was surrounded by wards.  The patients came out.  Those who were in the small courtyard also got out and we went and gathered in a big courtyard that was outside.  I think you can understand what I am trying to explain to you.  We all went out into the big courtyard, which is near the main road.  That is where people were killed afterwards.  
Q.	And you went out there with them and you told us that at about 10 o'clock something happened that made you leave the courtyard and go and hide yourself in the sorghum field; is that right?  And what was it that made you do that?  
A.	When you take a decision as to where you are fleeing, it is because the situation is deteriorating.  I was informed that my mother and my younger brothers had been killed on the 12th.  It was shocking information that remained forever etched in my memory.  So when I saw Rwamakuba arrive with other Interahamwe personalities, I decided to flee in order to save myself.  
Q.	This is the point, isn't it -- one of the points that you made yesterday; that obviously learning about your mother and your brothers was a terrible thing.  You told us that you learnt of that when you got to the health centre.  You learnt that they had been killed on the 12th, and that was the day you got to the health centre, wasn't it?  
A.	Yes, I found out that my mother and my younger brothers had been killed on the 13th.  It is when I met the survivors of that massacre that they told me about it.  So I decided to leave my home when my father informed me that the killings had already begun in our secteur, and I saw houses burning.  The scene was already -- the stage was already set.  The problem is that I didn't know where to go.  
Q.	Let's go back to the morning, Mr. Witness.  8 o'clock you are outside, other refugees are brought out of the wards, you tell us, and you congregated in the courtyard in the front of the health centre, between the health centre and the road.  And you said yesterday, that about 10 o'clock, four vehicles arrived, and you described that one of them was a military vehicle.  You described seeing Rwamakuba and other people and, "When I saw these people, I tried to run away.  I went down to the side of the building to try and find a hiding place and I hid in a sorghum field."  Is that correct?  That you saw the vehicles come and then you thought, obviously, knowing everything else, the danger that was confronting you, you left the health centre.  That is what you told us yesterday.  It's your words; I am not putting words into your mouth.  
A.	The cars arrived.  On board the vehicles, there were other people, amongst them Rwamakuba.  You might ask him.  After the death of President Habyarimana, Tutsis were attacked.  So when he came in the company of Interahamwe and the soldiers, I told myself that it was the end for the refugees; that is why I decided to leave that place without further delay.  
Q.	So I want to come back to your statement that you made in November last year, where you say how Kamanzi came at about 8 o'clock with Interahamwe; they manhandled people to go out and Kamanzi said that, "Henceforth we were bound to remain in the courtyard."  And then you say, "Immediately I heard that, I lagged behind the rest of the people by creeping.  I was able to reach the rear of the building where I hid in a joining sorghum farm."  And then later you say this:  "Towards 10 a.m. I saw about four vehicles come to the health centre from the direction of Rutonga."  

	So in your statement, by the time you see the vehicles, you have already been in hiding for the best part of two hours, and now you tell us it was only when you saw the vehicles at 10 o'clock that you went away to hide yourself and that then the events followed on more or less straightaway.  There was no period of almost two hours hiding in the sorghum field waiting.  So why is there this change in your recollection of what happened?  
A.	Counsel, I am here to answer your questions.  If your objective is to find out the truth, apart from the fact that you are doing your best to defend your client, if you wish to know the truth then, Counsel, you must bring your client here to the courtroom so that we can talk face to face.  There is a statement in which I said that at 8 o'clock people came and got the refugees and the patients out and gathered them in a courtyard.  It is from that courtyard that I left to go and hide to save my life, and Rwamakuba came there in the company of Interahamwe.  I think this is information that is contained in my statement.  
Q.	I am going to pass you up a sketch of Kayanga secteur with the health centre, and I am going to invite you, please, to just mark it to indicate something, and this is our page 26 from the bundle of sketch plans that we have.  And if you can be given a pen, and if you have no difficulty with the sketch -- and it is just a sketch, the Prosecution knows what it is.  
A.	I don't have a problem.  If I find that the sketch is accurate, I shall show you what you wish me to -- you shall tell me what you wish me to indicate on the sketch and I shall do so.  But if I am not able to understand the sketch, then I am afraid I wouldn't be able to help you with that.  
Q.	That is fair enough.  So are you happy with the sketch?  It's not my sketch; it is the Prosecution's sketch, which might help you.  The words "Kayanga health centre" are in English, I hope that doesn't pose a problem for you.  Can you see where that is indicated?  
A.	Counsel, yes, I can see that.  
Q.	Is it possible for you on that sketch to put a cross where the refugees and the occupants of the health centre were led by Kamanzi, where the courtyard is?  Would you put a cross there.  Have you got a pen?  If you haven't got a pen, someone will provide you with a pen.
MR. HOOPER:
Can someone provide -- Mr. Fry?  Oh, he's got a pen.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you just put a cross where the people were collected -- where you were before you left?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I don't agree with this sketch.  It is not very clear to me. 
Q.	Then put it away, please.
MR. HOOPER:
Does anyone have an unmarked copy of Prosecution Exhibit P. 2 or of photograph from page 37, Prosecution bundle?  I am asking the Prosecution.  Well, mine is marked, but I will pass this up to the witness, please.  Can this be shown to the witness? 

The registrar is going to show you the photograph, the bottom of that page, which is the front of the Kayanga health centre.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that the courtyard you are talking about? 
A.	Yes, that is right.  I agree with you that this is the courtyard where people were gathered.  
Q.	All right.  And for the record, that is photo 16 of the Kayanga health centre main building, buildings one and six which is on Exhibit P. 2, page 37, the lower picture.  Thank you.  

Well, you told us how you went away and hid in a sorghum field and you told us that, from that position, you were able to see and hear everything, which included the terrible killings that took place when those people arrived in the vehicles.  As I understand it, that your hiding place was behind the health centre, wasn't it, in the sorghum field behind the centre; is that right?  
A.	I was not hiding behind the health centre building.  It was next to the health centre, next to the building that you can see in this courtyard, so there was a sorghum farm where I was hiding.  
Q.	It is in your statement.  You say, "I was able to reach to the rear of the building, where I hid in a joining sorghum farm."  And now you are saying the sorghum farm you were hiding in was to one side of the health centre, not behind it, but the side of it; is that right?  
A.	Counsel, please, I said that I went round the corner of the building.  I never said that I went to hide behind the health centre; it is in a farm which is off to the side.  I think, Counsel, that you have added something.  You added something when you read out what you did read out.  
Q.	Well, you gave us your distance, which was from where you sit now to the man in front of you, the registrar, Mr. Fry -- oh, no, it was to me, wasn't it?  I was the man you related to it was 10 metres, you decided, it was 10 metres away.  

Well, as you face the health centre from the road -- 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that the transcript ought to be reread here.  I do not think that the witness said that the distance was the one that separated him from Mr. Fry.  I think there should be a reading -- a rereading of his answer.  
MR. HOOPER:  
No, I corrected it.  I corrected it, you didn't listen to the end of what was being said, to the distance between you and me, which was decided to be 10 metres.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, let me just renew the question.  As you face the health centre from the road -- so you are in the road looking at the health centre.  Was your hiding place to your left or to your right as you face the centre?  
A.	I realise that we are lucky to have a photograph, which shows the health centre.  If you were to give me that photograph, I would be able to indicate the direction on the photograph.  It would be easier and we would spend less time on this matter.  
(Pages 1 to 10 by Sithembiso Moyo)







1000H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, let's just do it my way at the moment.  As you face the building, are you to your right or to your left?  Right or left, which is it? 
A.	If I look at the photograph, I will be able to tell you the direction leading to the place where I was hiding. It would be easier for me to indicate this place for you instead of delaying matters by asking me a question that is difficult for me to answer.  I know that there is a photograph that would ease my indication of the direction; it would make it easier for everyone. 
Q.	I'll pass the photo up to you again.
MR. HOOPER:
	Mr. Fry or Mr. Mjui please. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	No, you can't mark it.  Can you show Mr. Mjui  please, what the position is.  Is it to the right of the page or to the left of the page or -- your hiding place? 
A.	I am not going to put any marks on it.  If you trust the person who is standing besides me, I can point the direction to you.  Probably, it would be better that way because you'll (sic) be in a better position to explain to you what I'm talking about.

	You can see there is a road here that comes up from Rutunga and it is here, in this courtyard, where we were.  And I went around this angle and nearby, a little further, there was a sorghum field and the small house that you are seeing, the small structure you are seeing here, was built after the war. 
Q.	Turn over the page, please.  There are some other photographs.  Does that help -- do those -- do those other photographs help you? 
A.	The photograph that seems to be clearer to me is the one that we were using. 
Q.	Well, I'm not sure that -- well, I'm -- I'm no clearer, but perhaps if the book is brought back to me and as you trust this gentleman.  What I'm going to ask you to do, sir, I think is can you just hold it up -- hold the book up and just point to the direction so that the Judges can see.  They're the people who need to see.  If the witness can hold the book up, just so that we can get it and put your finger -- point to the direction your -- your hiding place is.  Which way is it? 
A.	Mr. President, amongst all the pictures that were shown to me, this is the one that is clearest to me.  There is a door indicating the entrance towards the inner courtyard.  After we came out to gather and, this is a big courtyard, as far as I was concerned, I took this direction.  There was a small structure at the end here, which was only built after the war. 

Behind this building, there was a sorghum farm as everyone can note for himself.  This is a plane area and you see that this structure that we see at the far end here was built after the war.  Thank you. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much, Witness GAB.  I just failed to see where this hiding place is just 
	10 metres away, the distance between me and you.  The distance between where you were and where you could see Rwamakuba and the others being that distance.  The distance between me and you. There's no sorghum field, is there, that way that's that distance.  In fact, we can see distant fields in  photograph 17, a photograph that didn't help you, you say. 

So -- so where was this hiding place that you're only the distance from me to you from hearing and seeing Rwamakuba? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, in my statement I gave the same -- I gave information -- the same information was given to the Defence counsel.  And in that connection, I said that with regards to the distance between my hiding place and the courtyard, I tried to make an estimate of the distance and I stated that I could compare it to the distance between the Defence counsel and the Prosecutor.  I don't think I said that the distance was between myself and the Defence counsel. 
Q.	"I hid in a sorghum field near the health centre.  I was the equivalent to the distance between me and that man."  And you were asked "Which man?" And you said, "It's the man for the Defence."  I mean, see, when you're talking about that kind of distance, you're talking about a picture you've got in your head.  There you are, hidden in the sorghum trees.  There's Rwamakuba talking, saying these things.  Then you give your distance. "The distance between me and you."  So are you saying it was a much greater distance than that? 
A.	I believe you are thinking in terms of scale.  You are thinking of a map that is drawn on scale.  I've explained to you that I was hiding in a sorghum field and I had just left another location where people had gathered, and I estimated the distance between the courtyard where those refugees were and the hiding place, and I estimated a distance and said that it -- it could be equal to the distance between the Prosecutor's vicinity and yourself.  This is only an estimate that I gave. 

Now, given the circumstances at the time, I think it's only an estimate.  The place is -- is still there and you can go and measure the distance. 

Mr. President, I think I have given the information that I had and I don't have any further information to give to him on that subject. 
Q.	All right.  So let's move on to the events that you told us about that you witnessed and, this you say, word for word, and I don't hold you to that for a moment, but -- after all these years -- but you said that Rwamakuba said, "Everywhere I've been they've begun to work, so what are you waiting for?"  

You could hear that and Nyarwaya, the brigadier, when asked why they hadn't started he -- he said that they hadn't got sufficient material.  That little exchange took place.  Do you remember telling us about that? 
A.	There is part of -- that you attribute to me, but which is not mine.  You have just said that Rwamakuba had left.  Where -- well, he said, wherever he had been, people had started work.  I don't know if there was an error that was made, but I can repeat to you the statements that he made.  He said, "Wherever I have been, I've realised that people have started working.  And, what about you, what are you waiting for?"  These are the statements that he made to the group of persons. 
Q.	In the Kamuhanda trial when you gave evidence of Kamuhanda arriving on the 12th, the day before the massacre started with the vehicle full of grenades and guns, you say that he said that "Everywhere I went, even in Kigali, the Interahamwe and CDR" -- this is at page 66, of the ******************.  I'll start again.

	"Everywhere I went, even in Kigali, the Interahamwe and CDR have been killing people.  What are you doing?"  And Nyarwaya was there and Rubanguka was there.  And they say, "What we are doing at this time is detailing them and when we get the necessary instruments to accomplish our task, we shall accomplish our task."  Words rather familiar to what you're saying you heard Rwamakuba and Nyarwaya saying on that -- on this day.  A very similar situation, is it not?  Did you hear those words said on either occasion? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I am trying to explain to the Defence counsel and to yourselves the following.  Yesterday, the Defence counsel talked to me about Kamuhanda and I told him that the information was given a long time ago and I gave the statement in the Kamuhanda trial and it's been a long time, so I can't remember what I stated in that trial.  If the Defence counsel does not have that document that he's consulting, he wouldn't be in a position to ask me that question.  As far as I am concerned, I realise that the Defence counsel is trying to confuse my mind with respect to my previous positions, and I don't think I can help him there. 

When I came here, I did not know that I was going to be asked questions on the Kamuhanda trial.  If I had known that, I would have prepared myself to -- for possible questions.  I therefore conclude by saying that it's been a long time since I gave evidence in the Kamuhanda case and that I no longer quite recall the contents or the purport of my evidence in that trial. 
Q.	But from your hiding place, you told us how you had to watch or watch the killings that continued.  The killings of your aunties and cousins amongst them -- about 100 people were killed; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is what happened. 
Q.	You told us that by the time Rwamakuba left everyone had been killed.  Killed in his presence; is that right? 
A.	No, I think you are attributing to me words that I did not pronounce.  I said Rwamakuba came and launched the massacres.  Thereafter, the Interahamwe and the soldiers started killing and he left and when he left, the people were still killing.  So the massacres ended after he had left. 

You should understand that and, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Defence counsel asked me the same question some 15 times yesterday and I think I have given him the necessary explanations. 
Q.	Well, I correct myself because you did, in fact, say after he left the Interahamwe and soldiers went on killing people.  But at an earlier point, just shortly before, you said, "The people were being killed.  At one point he got in his vehicle and left, but the people were already killed."  

So you -- you gave two different accounts yesterday.  But I take it your evidence is that the killing continued after he left.  And in your statement you say that it continued until 3:00 in the afternoon.  

Again, not holding you to a specific time, that's about right, is it?  That they were killing there for -- for five hours and you were watching all this; is that right? 
A.	We don't agree on one point, Mr. Defence counsel.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I have almost repeated verbatim my written statement to the Defence counsel and the Defence counsel is trying to confuse my mind by these repeated questions.  

I stated that the Accused put up -- who held up a pistol, which means that he was there at the beginning of the massacres.  He stayed there for some time after the massacre had begun and then he left, leaving behind him the Interahamwe and the soldiers who continued with the massacres.  In other words, when he left, the massacres had begun but then continued. 

The Defence counsel is not saying the truth.  He changes my statements when he says that I said that Rwamakuba left at the end of the massacre.  My statement was that he initiated the massacres; he launched the massacres, and then he left while the massacres were going on.  He had a program -- that is, in the same way that he came and launched the massacres at that location, he probably went elsewhere to launch the massacres as well in those other locations -- or at those other locations. 
Q.	After the genocide, fairly recently, there was, you told us, an exhumation and a reburial ceremony there and you said that was on the 13th of April 2004.  Was there a particular reason for choosing that date, the 13th of April? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, in Rwanda -- I believe you have been monitoring what is happening in Rwanda.  On the day that the genocide was triggered off is a day that has been set aside as a day of commemoration.  And -- and every 8th of April in Rwanda, there are ceremonies organised there in memory of the victims of the genocide.  And when there are remains of the victims of genocide, the various authorities -- the various local authorities set aside a date on which the reburial can take place.  It's not the central government that takes the decision as to the date.  And for us, the period of mourning ends on the 3rd of July of every year. 

If we, therefore, choose that date for the reburial of the remains of the victims, it is the authorities of the district that took that decision insofar as that date is concerned.  It is not the central government that took the decision.  I think the Defence counsel should take my word for it and understand that that is the context in which the things happen. 
Q.	Well, was it that the 13th was chosen because that was the day of the massacre? 
A.	I could give you reasons where for the district authorities have decided to bury the remains of the victims on the 13th.  That is known only to the authorities in question.  I did not question those competent authorities as to their choice of that date.  That is a choice that has been made by the competent authorities and that does not concern me. 
Q.	Well, finally, I just want to ask you about -- in -- in very brief, your previous accounts of -- of what happened and happened afterwards. 

Yesterday, in evidence, just so that we have a recollection, you told us how you -- you left after staying in the sorghum fields and eating cassava and that you went and passed by the bodies that were piled up in a hole. 

As I understand it, you're saying that you went, in fact, towards the road and then -- and then made your way on to Rutare where the RPF had secured it; is that right?  And how long did it take you after the massacre to get to Rutare and to the RPF? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, it would appear to me that the Defence counsel has never had to flee or has no experience in war.  What happened to me could happen to anyone during war.  As far as I am concerned, I survived, thanks to the Devine mercy, and not by the intervention of human beings.  I remained in the sorghum fields and I was hungry.  And I tried to look for something to eat in order to survive -- like everyone else was doing. 

I therefore left my hiding place to go and look for something to eat and I was looking for something to eat on the road -- or in the road, as the Defence counsel tends to say.  I didn't remain on the same spot, but since -- but as the Defence counsel said, there were corpses in a hole, which we exhumed later.  

In order to go to -- from where I was to the secure zone, it took quite a while, and in my written statement I did not give any precise date on which I reached the RPF secured zones. 
God alone knows what happened to me and it is impossible for me to tell everything, because if I had to tell you everything, it would take days on end. 
Q.	Well, anyway, the question was:  How long did it take you to reach the security of the RPF at Rutare?  Can you give a short one-sentence answer to that?  I don't know, one day, two days, three days, four days -- whatever it was, can you help me with that? 
A.	No, I'm going to give you an explanation in order for the Defence counsel to better understand my statement or my evidence.  During those events, one day could be the equivalent of 20 days.  I couldn't have a recollection of dates or, rather, I was not minded to count days.  God helped me.  He's the one who gave me the strength.  He protected me and I travelled on until I reached an area where there was security. 
Q.	Very well, let me come to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I think I should make a comment.  Yesterday I indicated to you that even though the questions are being put to you by the lawyer, you're actually giving your evidence for the benefit of the Chamber, the Judges.  

We are the ones, in the end, who have to understand your evidence and decide its quality.  So you are really giving the answers to us.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I have understood. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I -- I took your last answer to be -- "I don't know how long it took."

In your statement of 1998 to the Prosecution, having described how you witnessed, when playing football, all the guns and the machetes and the grenades in Kamuhanda's vehicle and its distribution, you said this -- and I'll read the passage to you so that I don't take things out of context.  

"Two days after their visit, people embarked on the massacre of Tutsis, as was the case in Kayanga secteur, in Rutunga, Gikomero secteur, in Gishyaka, and in Shango secteur. 

"The killers came to our house on the 13th of April 1994 and were supervised by the communal accountant, the communal policeman -- policeman named Nyarwaya; the conseiller of Kayanga, named Thomas Mbango, M-B-A-N-G-O -- all who were under the orders of bourgmestre Rutaganira, R-U-T-A-G-A-N-I-R-A.  

"I am the only survivor in my family of nine.  Thousands of Tutsis were killed.  I escaped death by hiding in a sorghum plantation.  The RPF soldiers then arrived a week later and assembled us and took us all the way to Rutare." 

Now, is that what happened or not? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, in my statement I gave explanations concerning the questions of the Defence counsel and concerning the Kamuhanda case and my testimony in that case. 

It has been a long time since I appeared as a witness in that case -- in that trial and my statement -- my evidence was long.  I cannot recall the contents of all my evidence and since I do not trust the Defence counsel, who seems to me to be trying to trap me, my conclusion is that all that he is saying is a snare meant to destabilise me and defend the interests of his client in order to exculpate him.  Thank you. 
Q.	All right.  And now, just briefly, I'm going to read a passage of your evidence from the transcript for the ******************** 2001 to the Chamber in the case of Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda.  At page 72 in the English, at the very bottom.
MR. HOOPER:
	I -- I see the time, but I won't be that very much longer, if that's  satisfactory, unless you want to -- right. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	"On the 13th of April 1994 at 8 o'clock a.m. an attack was launched.  It was led by the accountant, Mathias Rubanguka.  The conseiller for the secteur, Mbango, Thomas together with the bourgmestre, they were leading the Interahamwe who came to kill the Tutsis. 

"They attacked us at our home and started to shoot at us and each and every one of us looked for some place seeking refuge.  We were rushing towards the sorghum plantations.  At about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, my father was arrested and killed and it's from then that I never saw him again, because all the members of my family also ran away in various directions.  Later on, members of my family were killed and I continued to stay in -- in hiding. 

"I cannot give the figure of the casualties of those who died on that day.  I can only just say that on the 13th -- that is, on the 13th my father was killed, and in his extended family, some other people were killed.  In my own immediate family, nobody else was killed; they were killed subsequently in the days that followed. 

"On that 13th of April, I lost about 20 members of my family.  In other words, all my paternal uncles, aunts and some of my elder brothers. 

"As I testified earlier, I stayed in hiding.  I moved from one hiding place to another, and around the 15th, we were discovered by the attackers.  In fact, I surrendered to the attackers personally, so that they could kill me.  But they didn't.  Subsequently, they killed five of my family members; I succeeded in escaping."

And -- and those five family members, I suggest, were your mum and your father, brothers, weren't they, that you're  talking about there?  Immediate family who were killed.  

But, you see, that's a different account and I'm not trying to put down snares and traps for you.  These are, if you like, deep contradictions that you've -- in this case -- told the Chamber on a previous occasion, and you should have an opportunity to deal with it in fairness to you as a witness. 
So do you have any comment to make on the passages that I've just read from your own transcript of your own evidence just two years ago -- three years ago, sorry?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to tell you that in my testimony here, I have answered all the questions put to me by Defence counsel to the best of my ability.  But unfortunately, Defence counsel did not understand the context of what happened.

In regard to the Kamuhanda trial, I told you that if I had known the various people who are employed by the Office of the Prosecutor should have explained this to me to refresh my memory.  

I do not remember what I said in my testimony before the Kamuhanda -- in the Kamuhanda trial.  You know that there are a lot of things that go on in one's head and things happen on a daily basis.  Many things happened and so Defence counsel should have put questions to me about Rwamakuba, which is why I'm here today, to give testimony.  

When I gave testimony about Kamuhanda, I did not mention Rwamakuba in my written testimony -- statement and Defence counsel knows this very well. If he does not agree with me, then he should read my statement about Kamuhanda.  So I should not -- I did not mention Rwamakuba in Kamuhanda's trial.  Similarly, I should not be made to mention Kamuhanda in Rwamakuba's trial.  Thank you.
Q.	I think, as I said at the beginning, you're -- you're a young man who's suffered much -- beyond imagination, and I've no more questions and I wish you all the best. 
A.	I thank you.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to say something, with your leave. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may say something. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to tell Defence counsel and the Trial Chamber -- rather, I would like to give him some more information about this Rwamakuba trial. 

Defence counsel seems to suggest that Rwamakuba is innocent, but I think that he does not know Rwamakuba.  He met him here in a professional setting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, if that is the type of statement that you wish to make, then I think I won't permit it. The Prosecutor will have an opportunity to question you again on re-examination and, if it is appropriate, legally appropriate, they will ask you questions, which will permit you to make any necessary clarifications to your evidence. 

But you have to rely on the discretion of the Prosecuting counsel to determine what appropriate clarifications are to be made. 

And at this stage, we will take a short break. 
	(Court recessed from 1042H to 1106H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume now. 

Now, Witness, your testimony will continue but you will now be asked some questions by the Prosecutor.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, as the President has stated, I am going to do a re-examination.
MS. FALL:
	And for starters, Mr. President, I would like to give the document that was shown by the Defence to the witness, which is found on tab  P. 2, number 007855 and which is found on page 37.  Please, can you show that to the Defence and to the Bench. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, a while ago you were shown that document, but you were unable to put any marks on it.  So I would like us to look at that document again.  Now that you have it, it's a copy of the said document, can you indicate to us the precise spot at which the refugees were found when they were massacred. 
A.	It's done, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	I think we may proceed.  Now, can you indicate approximately if you can, the spot at which you were hiding and where you stated that there was a sorghum field?
A.	That's been done. 
Q.	May I see the documents, please.  Mr. Witness, you told us a while ago when the Defence showed you the picture that the building besides which you have put a cross was built well after the events; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say that it was at that location that the sorghum field was found? 
A.	It was behind the small structure.  There was a sorghum farm, but the sorghum farm extended right to the place where the small structure is built. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, the Prosecution would like that document to be entered as an exhibit.  For the Prosecution, I think that will be reference number P. 52, and it should be under seal.  

And that it should be mentioned in the transcripts that the witness recognised that photograph and that he has shown the spot at which the refugees were when they were massacred.  And that he has also marked with a cross -- that is, behind the building that is situated left when you are in the centre of the centre (sic), the spot at which he was hiding in the sorghum farm. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, Exhibit P. 52, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 52 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
For the record, would it be appropriate to indicate at this stage that the cross that he's indicated where the people were was in front of the secteur build- -- the Kayanga health centre building and that the cross where he indicated the direction of the sorghum field was in the direction on our page-26 map of the secteur office.  It was to that side of the -- in that direction, towards -- and beyond, as I understand it, where house number 6 is indicated on the -- on the sketch, for the record.  Thank you. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think Counsel Hooper had the possibility of making clarifications of the document that he presented to the witness; he didn't do that.  

As far as I'm concerned, I took the document that he showed him, which is a document on which the witness has made some marks.  So I will like that we limit ourselves to the -- to the document that we have just produced to the extent that Counsel Hooper had the possibility of doing so, but didn't do so. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You haven't completed?  Have -- have you completed? 
MS. FALL:
No, Mr. President, I just started.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we will very quickly take up certain issues again. 

On many occasions you were asked or, rather, contradictions were pointed out that existed between your testimony before the Chamber and the statements that you made and the evidence you gave during the Kamuhanda trial.  And consistently, you answered that during the Kamuhanda trial you only addressed issues concerning Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda; is that correct? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	You were then asked why during Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda's trial you did not talk about the Kayanga health centre and the events that took place there; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, the Defence counsel asked me that question. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your answer you talked about the events that took place at the Kayanga health centre when you saw Rwamakuba, André, came, and you gave a list of names of people who came along with him.  Did you mention Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda's name? 
A.	In my statement -- in my written statement, I did not mention Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda's name because those are two distinct cases.  There is the Kamuhanda case and the case that is at hand now. 
(Pages 11 to 21 by Jean Baigent)






























1115H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we came back several times on the rally that took place in 1993 in your secteur.  And still in that connection, besides that rally where you saw André Rwamakuba, did you attend any other meetings organised by politicians or -- and where Rwamakuba, André was present? 
A.	Besides the rally I talked about where Rwamakuba was, in other rallies where I -- which I attended, even if I didn't stay there right up to the end, I did not attend any other rally that was organised by politicians, given the fact that I was not politically active. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, now, to go back to the events that took place at the Gishyaka parish, where you subsequently learnt that your mother died, as well as your four brothers and your neighbours and other refugees, were you also informed about the perpetrators of the massacre? 
A.	We didn't talk about it at length, but the people who told me about it told me that it was the Interahamwe who had attacked the refugees during the night and that they had been accompanied by certain officials.  Those names were not mentioned by the people who gave me the information.  It is, therefore, that night when those persons, including members of my family, were massacred.  
Q.	If I understand you well, therefore, from the answer you have given me, you did not know who were the real -- the people who were really responsible, apart from the Interahamwe, for the massacres at the Gishyaka parish? 
A.	To tell you the truth, since I wasn't at the parish, it would be impossible for me to give you the names of the persons who took part at that massacre.  However, my informants told me that they were the Interahamwe.  Personally, I wasn't there and so I'm in no position to give you the names of persons who were involved in the massacre. 
Q.	Now, if you tell us that you weren't given names concerning that massacre, this means that Rwamakuba's name was not mentioned too? 
A.	I met Rwamakuba at the health centre when I took refuge there, but I do not know whether, indeed, he went to the Gishyaka parish.  I confirm that I saw him personally at the health centre of Kayanga. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Thank you, as well. 
Q.	A while ago, a portion of your statement in the Kamuhanda case was read out to you and where it was claimed that you lent the same words to Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda and to Rwamakuba.  I will not come back to that.  That is in the transcript.  The Defence told you -- or asked you why we find the same words, which are -- were pronounced both by Rwamakuba and Kamuhanda; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, he asked me the question. 
Q.	When you gave evidence against Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda, which is the context in which your evidence was given? 
A.	Concerning the evidence of framework of my testimony in the Kamuhanda trial, the Prosecutor's representative asked me what Kamuhanda had done and I answered to that question, and that is what I came to explain during the trial to the Chamber -- to the Trial Chamber. 
Q.	Can you clarify to us why Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda was being prosecuted? 
A.	Kamuhanda was prosecuted as a person who had incited Rwandans and the Interahamwes in general, to perpetrate massacres.  He was also prosecuted for distributing weapons.  Those are the two key points I talked on during my testimony. 
Q.	Today, you have come to give testimony against André Rwamakuba, can you tell us why he is being prosecuted? 
A.	I'm here to give testimony against André Rwamakuba because he worked with the killers -- he worked together with killers to trigger off the massacres.  I am here as a prosecution witness because he killed in front of me.  As concerns Kamuhanda, this is a person who distributed the tools or weapons that were used for perpetrating the massacres. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, from your answers, is it therefore possible that at one time or another concerning two persons pursuing the same objective, is it therefore possible that you might have heard them say or do the same thing more or less? 
A.	As concerns the words that were used, they used almost the same words because these were statements that had the same logic.  But these are two distinct persons.  And when I saw Kamuhanda, he was not in the company of Rwamakuba.  And this also applies to Rwamakuba, when I saw him he was not with Kamuhanda.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you were questioned during the re-examination (sic), there is a date that was a date on which you supposedly came to the Kayanga health centre.  Can you confirm this?  Can we confirm in the transcripts that you did not give a specific date or a precise date on which you came to the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	I do confirm that.  And, besides, I have consistently answered in the negative to the Defence counsel insofar as my date of my arrival at the health centre is concerned.  I gave him a time frame, which was between the 13th and the 15th, without giving him a precise or specific date. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when the question was put to you as to whether you had stated that you hid yourself at different locations, those different locations, do they include the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	Quite correct.  Since I -- I got there -- I went to that centre and I cannot tell you that it was a safe haven.  I went there to try to hide and to save my life. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. Witness -- I have no further questions for the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you've -- you've now come to end of your testimony, and I would like to thank you for coming and giving evidence and you are now excused and you may leave.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I have just got some exhibits, but unless you feel it's necessary, you needn't detain the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think his presence is necessary.  He can leave.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  It will behove you to decide on the matter at your own discretion.  Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, have you got your exhibits ready?  
MR. HOOPER: 
We had, but unfortunately, I've scribbled on one of them.  And so, can I put the statements that I want to put in at a later point?  But I do have a CD -- five CDs with the transcripts of both GAB and GAC, this witness and the previous witness, from the Kamuhanda case.  Can I formally exhibit that as exhibit -- Defence exhibit, will it be 47?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, 47, D. 47.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, D. 47.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, they need to be under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 47 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, are we ready with the new witness?  Is your witness available?  
MS. FALL: 
He is ready, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar will now give you an oath to tell the truth. 
(Declaration made by Witness ALV in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, the Prosecutor will now ask you some questions which you will have to answer.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Thank you, Your Honours.  I would like to commence, if possible, with leave from Your Honours, by submitting the protected witness information sheet so that the witness can verify this and sign it and date it, with the assistance of the registrar.
WITNESS ALV
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Have you finished reading the witness -- the protected witness information sheet?  Can you confirm that all the information on this sheet is correct and accurate? 
A.	Yes, I have finished reading the document, and the information indicated in the document is correct. 
Q.	Perhaps we can be assisted with a pen so that you may sign and date it.  Today is the 6th of July, I believe.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
With Your Honours' leave, we would like that this be exhibited --- be submitted, rather, as Prosecution Exhibit No. 53, and be kept under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, P. 53, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. P. 53 admitted, under seal)
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Witness, I'm going to start the examination-in-chief.  I'm going to try and not be very -- straightforward and clear questions, and I would like to invite that you give me short and clear and concise answers, if possible.  Thank you.  

Witness, have you ever before testified -- have you ever testified before the international criminal tribunal? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you testified before any national jurisdiction in Rwanda? 
A.	No. 
Q.	What about the Gacaca proceedings, have you testified before any of those? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Witness, have you ever met the ICTR investigators before? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Can you recall how many times you've met them? 
A.	I met them twice. 
Q.	Can you recall whether you gave any statements on these occasions? 
A.	Yes, I made a statement. 
Q.	How many statements did you make? 
A.	Two statements. 
Q.	Now, were these statements read over to you after you had made them? 
A.	Yes, they were read back to me. 
Q.	Did you sign them as being true and accurate accounts of what you had said? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you recall the dates that you made these statements? 
A.	I only remember the years.  For the first statement it was in 2000, and the second statement was in 2003. 
Q.	Have you subsequently met with any members of the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	I don't understand your question. 
Q.	Have you met with anyone else from the ICTR after these investigators? 
A.	Yes, after I made these statements, I met other people working for the Office of the Prosecutor. 
Q.	Now, the first statement you made, can you remember who or what it was concerning? 
A.	In my first statement, I talked about a group of people who took part in the massacres at the university hospital. 
Q.	Can you recall any of the names of these people that you talked about in your first statement? 
A.	I remember some names.  For example, Dr. Gatera, Colonel Muvunyi, Sister Theopiste, Dr. Jotham.  These are the people whose names I mentioned in my first statement. 
Q.	And your second statement, who did you speak about in your second statement? 
A.	Once again, I talked about these people whose names I have given you.  I also talked about Rwamakuba in the second statement. 
Q.	Since you met the investigators on the second occasion which, I believe you say, was 2003, have you made any changes to these statements? 
A.	Yes, I changed something. 
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell the Court where you lived in April 1994? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Your Honour, apologies, my mistake.  I should have asked the witness to simply state the commune.  Can we please ask that be struck off -- for that to be struck from the record.  Thank you.

MR. PRESIDENT:
So ordered.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, I'm going to continue.  Bear in mind that you are a protected witness.  As such, if there is information that you think would reveal your identity, please do not disclose it.  

Now, you stated that your second -- in your second statement you mentioned a man named 
	André Rwamakuba; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Have you ever seen André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I saw him. 
Q.	Now, I'd like to take you back to April 1994.  Can you tell the Court whether any killings took place in your secteur? 
A.	Yes, there were killings in my secteur. 
Q.	Can you recall the date they started? 
A.	I remember that the killings began on the 19th. 
Q.	Witness, what did you do after the killings started on the 19th of April in your secteur? 
A.	When the massacres began on the 19th, we ran away in different directions.  I went with my father.  We headed towards Mpare forest where we spent the night.  The next day, we went to Ngoma; the following day we went to the hospital. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings -- 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, you stated that when you left your secteur you went to Ngoma, and then the following day, is that correct, you went to the hospital.  Which hospital are we talking about? 
A.	It is Butare university hospital. 
Q.	Now, Witness, I have the benefit of a calendar of April 1994, which I understand -- I know you don't.  If you went to Ngoma on the day that the killings started, which is the 19th, then went to Butare hospital the following day, that would mean that you went to Butare on Wednesday, the 20th of April.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Can you recall the first time you saw André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, I remember well. 
Q.	Can you tell us when that was? 
A.	It was on the 21st. 
Q.	Would that be the day -- sorry.  Would that be the day after you got to the hospital? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, how did you know that he was André Rwamakuba, Witness? 
A.	It is other refugees who said his name.  I saw him as I can see you here.  I did not know his name.  It is the other refugees who pointed him out to me because he had studied in this university.  He had done his internship at that hospital and people knew him.  
Q.	Who were these refugees?  How did they know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	These refugees knew André Rwamakuba.  Some of the refugees were workers at the university hospital.  This -- the refugees knew him while I was a student, while he was doing his internship.  Also, they knew him from outside the university hospital. 
Q.	When you saw André Rwamakuba, was he alone? 
A.	He was with other people. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court who these other people were? 
A.	Dr. Gatera, Colonel Muvunyi, Sister Theopiste and Dr. Jotham were with him. 
Q.	Did you know these people, Dr. Gatera, Muvunyi, Sister Theopiste, did you know them? 
A.	I knew them.  I knew them well before. 
Q.	How did you know them, can you tell the Court? 
A.	**************************************************************************************************************
	***************. 
Q.	Where were you, Witness, when you saw André Rwamakuba accompanied by Dr. Gatera, 
	Colonel Muvunyi, Sister Theopiste and Dr. Jotham?
A.	I was between the pediatric ward and the intensive care ward.  These are two services of the university hospital, and the refugees were standing at that place. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court where -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Jotham is spelt --
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Sorry.  

I'm sorry, am I getting a spelling?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes.  Jotham is J-O-T-H-A-M. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, can you tell the Court where they were, Dr. Rwamakuba and his company -- his companions? 
A.	They were moving about inside the hospital to commit atrocities. 
Q.	Now, what was the approximate distance between where you were and where they were? 
A.	I would say 20 metres. 
Q.	Is it possible for you to give us an example of the distance in this courtroom?  Between yourself and who, would you say? 
A.	For example, it is the distance between me and the back wall. 
Q.	What did André Rwamakuba do at this place where you saw him? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings, could you agree the distance in metres between the witness and the back wall?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
I -- well, the witness started off, Your Honour, by saying 20 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, she gave -- yes, but do we now have this in the courtroom?
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you and Defence counsel agree, at least, as to the distance.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Okay.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I'm willing to agree it conforms with her estimate, if that's satisfactory, 20 metres -- about.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Thank you, Defence.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, I was about to ask you, when you saw Dr. André Rwamakuba, what was he doing?  Was he doing anything when you saw him? 
A.	I don't know whether you followed me clearly.  I had just left the courtyard where I was.  Ask me this:  "When you left the courtyard where did you go?"  You didn't put that question to me. 
Q.	I stand corrected.  When you left the place you described as between the pediatric ward and the intensive care ward, where did you go? 
A.	I left the courtyard because we had just been driven out and I went into the intensive care ward. 
Q.	When you were in the intensive care ward, what did you observe, if anything? 
A.	I saw André Rwamakuba there. 
Q.	You saw André Rwamakuba in the intensive care ward.  Is that what your testimony is? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	What was André Rwamakuba doing there? 
A.	What was -- André Rwamakuba arrived.  He was accompanied by the team of other doctors whose names I have mentioned to you, and it is he who was encouraging these people.  He was pulling off the drips of the patients who had been attacked by Interahamwe, either with machetes or with knives.  He pulled off the drips of some patients, and he delivered them over to the assailants.  And I was standing there -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John -- 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Yes, Your Honour 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to control the pace of the testimony.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
I am trying.  The difficulty, Your Honour, is that whilst the witness is talking I don't know what's being said because I don't understand -- I don't master Kinyarwanda, so I have to wait for the translation to come in, in order to determine whether the witness is speaking about the same subject and perhaps repeating or whether they are going into new areas.  But I will do my best, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you hear me?  Madam Witness -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam Prosecutor, it is indicated by the French booth that you should slow down somewhat for the French interpreters. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you hear me?  Yes, when you are -- 
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you are making your statement, you should pause briefly at the end of each sentence so that what you are saying could be recorded.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS: 
All right, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Witness, you stated that in the intensive care ward where you were, Rwamakuba was removing -- pulling off drips from patients who had been attacked by the Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Who -- can you tell the Court who these patients were? 
A.	They were Tutsi patients. 
Q.	Did you know any of their names? 
A.	I remember that amongst them was a young man called Sibomana. 
Q.	Are you aware of what was wrong with this young man, why he was at the Butare university hospital? 
A.	He had been attacked by a machete -- with a machete not far from the hospital and he rushed to the hospital with the hope that he was going to be treated. 
Q.	If you can, can you tell the Court how long you were at this location for? 
A.	I spent about 20 minutes there. 
Q.	Do you know how long André Rwamakuba and his companions stayed there for? 
A.	We went out before them. 
Q.	Where did you go when you left this place? 
A.	I went back to the courtyard with those who were with me. 
Q.	Who were the people with you, Witness? 
A.	Actually, I am the one who returned to the courtyard. 
Q.	Did you meet anyone when you got to the courtyard? 
A.	Yes, I met people there. 
Q.	Can you tell us who these people were? 
A.	They were refugees who were at that location, but I do not know their names. 
Q.	Witness, after this first occasion, did you have the opportunity to see André Rwamakuba again? 
A.	I saw him again the following day. 
Q.	Can you recall the time? 
A.	The time was about 11 o'clock. 
Q.	Now, how can you be sure of this day? 
A.	Yes, I do remember very well that it was the following day that I saw him again. 
Q.	Will that have been the Friday? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Again, looking at the calendar, I would -- I would conclude that would be Friday, the 22nd of April.  Does that sound right to you? 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry to interrupt, but the witness was led to the day.  And one can look at her statement and see that that is potentially a contentious matter.  However logical it might be in terms of the steps of her evidence, it would be better not to lead on dates and days, however difficult that may be.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Your Honour, with all due respect, it's not my intention to lead the witness.  However, as Defence recognised, it is logical that if you arrive somewhere on Wednesday, you see something the following day, that would make it Thursday; the day after, that would make it Friday.  I don't believe that's any leading.  And I think the witness actually gave the day herself, so I did no leading on that part; I  was just giving the date that it would have been from her evidence.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  Well, as my friend knows from this witness's statements, she stated previously and consistently it was the Saturday, so I think, with respect, it's not right to say to the witness that was the Friday.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Your Honour, I -- I've noted Defence's objection and I do not wish to pursue the matter further.  I believe the witness's testimony and her statements will speak for themselves.  

May I continue?  
THE WITNESS: 
I also have a problem, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Witness, I will hear you.  
THE WITNESS: 
I am saying that in my statement I think I made a mistake of the day.  I think I spoke about that period and I think there is something concerning that information where I made a mistake in a day or two.  I think you should take that into account, Mr. President.  That's all I had to say.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, I don't think that's something you should worry about because we are interested in your testimony.  The discussion between counsel was the method in which questions should be put to you, and there are legal rules governing the way in which the questions should be asked.  So the discussion was a matter about a legal issue and not the content of your testimony.  That we'll come to in due course.  

Ms. Cummings-John, I don't expect that I should have normally to explain to you what our (unintelligible).  I expect you to know that and to stick with the rules.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Noted.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, on this second occasion when you saw André Rwamakuba, can you tell us what happened? 
A.	When I saw Rwamakuba for the second time, he was in the company of people who were leading my father somewhere.  I'm talking about my own father. 
Q.	Can you tell us where your father was before he was being led by these people? 
A.	He had hidden himself in a kitchen at a place where the supplies of the hospital were stocked.  They called soldiers, and other people who were there, and that group of people who took him away with them. 
Q.	Why, Witness, was your father being led away from this store? 
A.	He had hidden himself there.  And because of his ethnic origin, they came and took him away. 
Q.	Can you tell us who took your father away? 
A.	My father was taken away by a soldier in the company of Rwamakuba and this group of people that I had mentioned earlier. 
Q.	I know you had mentioned it earlier, Witness, but for the clarity of the records, can you just tell us the names of these people again? 
A.	They were André Rwamakuba, Dr. Gatera, Dr. Jotham, Theopiste and Colonel Muvunyi. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court where you were at this time? 
A.	Are you talking of the time at which he was taken away?  
Q.	Yes.  When he was at the store, where were you? 
A.	I was on the spot. 
Q.	And what did you do when your father was being taken away? 
A.	I did nothing.  I tried to follow them closely to know exactly where they had taken him. 
Q.	And did you succeed in following them to see where they were taking him to? 
A.	Yes, but at a certain point in time, I stopped. 
Q.	Can you tell us why you stopped? 
A.	I stopped because at a certain point, a -- someone hit me with an object.  I could not identify the object that was used to give me a blow with, but I was told later it had been Rwamakuba.  And my father could do nothing because he was under the control of those people. 
Q.	So, let me try and take this in stages.  You stopped because someone hit you, and you state that you were told later that it was Rwamakuba; is that correct? 
A.	No, it is not later; it was at that very moment.  You know, I did not know that person before.  People used to talk about him, I had seen him the previous day, and on the day in question, you would understand that we are talking about a group of persons.  When I was given the blow with the certain object, I lost consciousness, but a few moments later, I saw and realised that he was the one. 
Q.	When you say you lost consciousness, are you saying that you fainted? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Can you explain to the Court what you mean by you lost consciousness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John?
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You understand the difference between the questions you should have asked?  You made an assumption about the concept of fainting --
MR. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- which was leading.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
I'm sorry, I didn't actually understand the answer.  Perhaps I should have simply said the --   
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the point.  The question you ask him now is the correct way to make that enquiry.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Okay, thank you.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, if you remember the question, can you go ahead and answer it?  
A.	To speak the truth, I did not actually lose consciousness.  All I had was fright.  I was scared tremendously, but I was conscious of what was happening. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you had also stated that you found out -- or you found out that it was André Rwamakuba who hit you, but you did not know him before.  How did you know that it was André Rwamakuba who hit you? 
A.	He is the one who gave me the blow. 
Q.	Did you recognise him?  Did you know him? 
A.	Apart from the two occasions under which I'd seen him, I believe that I -- I remembered his physical description.  His image remained engraved in my memory because of that incident. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court, if you know, what he hit you with? 
A.	He hit me with an object that looked like a hoe -- or like an axe. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court which part of the axe he hit you with? 
A.	You see the form of an axe, the axe had the sharp end but he hit me with the handle of the axe.  But I don't have a clear recollection, but the fact is that I saw the axe that he used. 
Q.	Do you recollect what material the handle of this axe was made out of? 
A.	I don't quite recall because I didn't pay that much attention to be able to see that. 
Q.	Witness, do you know what happened to your father after he was taken away? 
A.	Actually, everything stopped at that precise moment as far as I was concerned.  As for my father, he was taken towards the maternity and, normally, that is where people gathered.  And that is the place from where they were later taken away to be killed. 
Q.	And what did you do after -- what did you do after your father had been taken away? 
A.	I went back to the courtyard we talked about earlier. 
Q.	Can you tell us how long you remained at the courtyard? 
A.	The events I talked about took place at about 11:00 a.m. right up to - and, about 3:00 p.m., we were sent away from that courtyard.  And I'm just giving an approximate time frame, that is insofar as the hours are concerned, the hours I talked about. 
Q.	You said you were sent away.  Who were you sent by? 
A.	Those people who had taken away my father returned to the location and they asked the refugees to leave the area; that is, Gatera, the soldiers, were the ones who gave orders to the civilians who were there, including the driver.  So they gave them the orders to drive us away from that courtyard. 
Q.	Can you tell us where you went? 
A.	From that courtyard I went to the office of the Butare préfecture. 
Q.	Witness, I'd like to take you back to the two events that you witnessed, which you have told the Court that you witnessed very clearly.  Can you tell us what ethnicity you are? 
A.	I am Tutsi. 
Q.	Do you have any idea how come you were able to witness these events, first in the intensive care ward, and then secondly, when your father was being taken away without any harm coming to you? 
A.	I was not assaulted at that time because the killers were concerned, first of all, with young men and -- the men. 
Q.	Perhaps you can pour yourself some water.  There is a jug just there on the table, Witness.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	Now, when you got to the préfecture office, who did you find there? 
A.	I found my elder sister, my younger sister, as well as many other refugees who were found there. 
Q.	Can you tell us how long you remained at the préfecture office? 
A.	I remained there for two days. 
Q.	And where did you go after two days? 
A.	After those two days, I tried to get to my grandmother's house. 
Q.	Were you alone when you went to your grandmother's house? 
A.	No, I was in the company of my two sisters whom I just mentioned. 
Q.	How long did you remain at your grandmother's house for? 
A.	We stayed there for about an hour.  When we got to her house, she kept us in her house, but a few moments later, there was an assault that was launched and whereby they were looking for us, and our grandmother was able to help us to flee.  But the assailants -- when the assailants got to the location and when they didn't find any other person there, they killed our grandmother. 
Q.	And where did you go when you fled from your grandmother's house? 
A.	We moved up to our aunt's house.  We only passed by there because we went back to the office of the préfecture. 
Q.	And can you tell us what happened when you got back to the office of the préfecture? 
A.	When we got to the préfectural office, there were many vehicles, which came and we were asked to get into the vehicles.  Some refugees did, indeed, get into the cars, but others refused to do so.  Some refugees felt that they were going to be killed, others didn't think that was the case.  And during the first trip -- when the first round of refugees were taken away, we then accepted to get into the second car. 
Q.	And where did you go? 
A.	We were taken to a centre -- to Rango centre near Kanyabashi's residence, and we were gathered at that location and they were telling us that we were going to be killed on the day of the burial of Habyarimana. 
Q.	Can you tell us how long you remained at that residence for -- sorry, at a location at Rango? 
A.	We remained there for about a month and a half. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us where Sister Theopiste is today? 
A.	She is in Ruhengeri with the Benebikira sisters.  That is her congregation.  But I know that she must -- she must go to answer the call of the Gacaca courts because, I think, last Wednesday she was supposed to have appeared before the Gacaca court in Butare; ***********. 
Q.	What about Dr. Jotham, do you know where he is today? 
A.	No, I am not aware. 
Q.	And, finally, Dr. Gatera, do you know of his whereabouts? 
A.	Gatera was put in prison, but he is no longer alive today. 
Q.	My final question, Witness, can you tell the Court why you did not mention André Rwamakuba when you gave your first statement? 
A.	I did not mention Rwamakuba's name when I gave my first statement.  I believe that I was suffering from amnesia.  But when I was no longer suffering from it, I had the opportunity of mentioning Rwamakuba's name. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
I have no further questions, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Madam Witness, we are going to take a break for lunch.  We resume at two o'clock, and at that time your testimony will continue.  During this adjournment, as any other during the time that you are a witness here, you are not to discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we'll now break for lunch and resume at 2:00.  

Yes, I think I should just do a small bit of housekeeping and confirm, as we'd discussed earlier in the week, that we will not be sitting on Thursday or Friday.  So today, really, we -- is the last day of sitting for this week.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.

	(Court resumed at 1420H)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, Mr. President, a small linguistics problem.  My colleagues have pointed out that this morning before the lunch break the witness mentioned something about amnesia of a certain type, or with another word, a qualifier, which my colleagues weren't sure was correct, they interpreted correctly, so I don't know if you wanted that matter elucidated. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there something that needs to be elucidated through the witness -- through the witness?  Does she have to be asked to repeat what she said?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, I don't know -- well, I think maybe that is up to you to decide, sir, excuse me.  I don't know.  Were you satisfied with what she said this morning or not?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I heard what I heard through my microphone -- through my earpiece. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	I'll tell you, I wasn't plugged in so I missed what was just said and we all were, except for                Ms. Pouplard -- if it could be summarised or repeated for our benefit. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Should I go ahead, sir?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, what happened was just before the break the witness had been asked about not mentioning Rwamakuba's name when she gave the first statement.  And she said she believed that she was suffering from amnesia at the time.  The interpreter has said that there is a question mark about the accuracy of the translation.  So -- it can be addressed in two ways:  The registry can have the tapes reviewed, and in that way the accuracy of the interpretation can be verified, or if a correction is necessary it can be made; the witness can also be asked to repeat what she said. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Thank you.  Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So I would -- Mr. Fry, I would suggest that the registry make the check to verify the accuracy of what was transmitted this morning.   And I would ask Madam Prosecutor if she would just ask the question again, we could have opportunity for it to be said and retranslated.

	Madam Witness, Madam Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I can hear you. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be resuming your evidence now.  You will be giving evidence under the same oath to tell the truth that you took this morning when your testimony began.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, just before the lunch break the Prosecutor asked you a question, and I'm going to ask her to ask you the same question again just to verify that we got your answer correctly; do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

	For the accuracy of the record, I'm referring to the draft transcript --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no -- 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
The question that I asked the witness, I would like to repeat the question verbatim so we that don't have any problems later, Your Honour.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court why you did not mention André Rwamakuba's name when you gave your first statement? 
A.	I answered that I was suffering from anterograde amnesia, not total amnesia, that is to say that I can remember the events, but I held back from mentioning the name for a further occasion because I had a conflict, if I can put like that, with that person. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  And thank you, Mr. Interpreter, for bringing this to our attention.

	Now, Madam Witness, your evidence will continue.  At this time you will be asked questions by the lawyer representing the Accused and you will have to answer his questions.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
	You may proceed, Mr. Hooper. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	As His Honour the Judge President has just told you, I'm now going to ask you questions because that is the system in which we operate.  And I'm going to ask you questions on behalf of                   Dr. André Rwamakuba, whose interest I represent in this trial together with my colleagues here.  Now, are your eyes giving you difficulty this afternoon? 
A.	Well, I have a problem with the lights, it is too bright. 
Q.	Well if -- if you are more comfortable in dark glasses, then so be it.  Now, I'm going to ask you a question --  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you questions.  And if you don't understand anything what I say, don't you hesitate to tell me and let me know that, all right?  And if you are uncomfortable at any time, you let us know, all right?  
A.	Very well, I understood, I agree. 
Q.	Now, we all know that at the time that we are concerned with in this trial, the period of the genocide, that you were just a young girl.  And at that time you lost -- well, your father was taken from you and probably murdered.  And we know that you also lost, I think, two brothers; that is right, isn't it?  And a younger brother two older brothers and a younger brother in the genocide; I think I am right in saying that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And so we can appreciate that you have been grievously hurt, and at a very young age, and we are very sorry for that.  And I want you to remember that throughout my questions this afternoon, that we do have that in mind.  I have that in mind certainly, and I know everyone else does.

	Now I'm going to ask you, if you will, to help me, and I hope that nothing I say will compromise your identity or make you feel uncomfortable.  If you think it does, you let me know.  But I'm going to provide you now with a list of names.  And I'm going to ask you to look at that list without speaking the names out loud, and put a cross against any person who you know, who you know today or think you know.  And copies of this list have been distributed to everyone who I think requires them.  

	And if you, Madam, just look at that list, you Madam, just look at that list, and if you recognise a name, or you think you do, could you just put a cross in the box to the right of the name and then let me have the list back.  Can you do that for me, please?  

	Yes, I'm sorry, I didn't -- you put a cross against number 1, which is you, of course.  So I meant to cross that out so that you wouldn't be distracted by that name.  I'm not asking you to tell us who you are.  I'm asking you to put a cross against anyone you know whose name appears on that list.  Can you do that for me, please?  
A.	I have finished.  I note that I know no one on your list. 
Q.	Just give me one moment, I have just lost something I need to know.

	Now, that is a full and truthful answer, is it?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How long have you been working at the institution that currently employs you? 
A.	Five years. 
Q.	And we can look at your personal details and remind ourselves of the capacity that you work therein, what your job is.  Don't say it out loud.  We have the documents; we can look at it and we can see what you do.  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And we also know where you lived, and we know where you live in the sense of the town you live in.  So coming back to that list of names that I have placed in front of you, my understanding is -- just look at that list again, please.  And I know you have no trouble with reading.  Just look at that list again, perhaps with just a moment's more care and tell me if you think you know anyone whose name appears on that list.
A.	I do know no one on this list.  I'm not in the habit of meeting many people or frequenting -- or meeting many people ***********. 
Q.	All right.  Well, let me have the list back.  And we will take it back, we don't need to trouble you with it if you don't know anyone on it.  But before it goes, or just for a moment just before it goes, I understand that all of those people work at (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).  Do you want to reconsider your answer to me? 
A.	I don't know anything about that. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Then please remove the list.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you see, I suggest that there is a group of people at the institution where you work that have put their heads together in order to make up a story that concerns André Rwamakuba, and most of the names on that list are people in that group.  But you don't know any of them, that is right, isn't it?  That is your answer in any event? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So, let me ask you this:  Have you discussed any details of -- about André Rwamakuba with anybody else at the institution where you work? 
A.	No, it is a secret to me and I haven't discussed it with anyone.  I don't speak to people in that sense, where I work. 
Q.	In your details you gave -- in your statement you gave the telephone number of someone.  I'm not going to read that telephone number out, but you describe that person as a friend.  Might I invite you to tell us who that friend is, and if you don't want to say it out loud you can write it down? 
A.	I don't quite understand your question. 
Q.	Well, fair enough -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me, could I just intervene a minute.  Was there reference to the area connected with the name of the type of institution?  I think something slipped out like that just now and I would like to order that it be redacted. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Yes.  It is going to pose a difficulty in the case, and as we are sort of permanently in closed session, and my argument might be --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The use of the phrase "the institution where you work," would that not be appropriate? 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, I think eventually it is going to be a mere window dressing because of the context in which we are talking.  So in order to just seize the ladle, if this witness is right and doesn't know these people, it indicates what a large and expansive community it must be there.  So, I would argue the fact, if that is arguable, the fact that one is employed there -- well, may be employed there or was employed there, isn't a strong enough indication of person, perhaps, to fall within the area that we are in.  Otherwise, we are going to have to go into closed session because it is absolutely inevitable we are going to stumble on this again and again because that is the nature of the evidence.  So, ************************* and the fact that someone is associated with that doesn't identify them, in my argument, anyway.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I wouldn't want to go into closed session at this stage.  I would prefer to be in open session as long as it is reasonable.  But I would invite counsel to assist me, if there is a time when it would be more appropriate to move into closed session. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, let me approach things, in this manner.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm going to show you page -- our page ALV 3, and I have circled in it the name that appears at item 14.  And I would just ask you to look at that and to acknowledge that person at that time, and this is the first statement that you made back in November 2000, that was someone that you knew there and described as a friend there.  All right, can you see that?
A.	Yes, I have seen the name. 
Q.	And you have described that person as your friend at that time in the context of these statements being taken, in the way in which they are taken.  And she -- that lady worked ********, is that right?  Still does, is that right? 
A.	As far as I know it is this person who distributes ************************************* before they start work.  This is this person's job, so far as I know, I do not know that she has any other job. 
Q.	She is *************; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Well, that way because we know the relationship on these statements isn't necessary one of amenity, it is just a reference.  Can I hand you up another, a page ALV 19 of our bundle where, again, I circled a number on here.  And just look at that, and it is that telephone number I was asking you about as to who, whose number that is.  Is that the same person or relates to the same person or is it somebody else? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness spoke the French. 
THE WITNESS:
It is my personal number. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Merci.  I think your French is a lot better than mine. 
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	I wasn't after your telephone number, but can I have your -- the pieces of paper back, please.  Thank you for that.  And now you spoke this morning about not having been a witness before, in any case, here or in Rwanda, and that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Have you ever provided any information, though, in respect of people involved in the genocide to any authority or prosecutor or Gacaca court in Rwanda? 
A.	No, I have never done that. 
Q.	I mean, for example, Sister Théopiste, have you provided any information about her to any authority? 
A.	No, I have never given any such information. 
Q.	Do you know someone called Rose Burizahiza?  I will spell that so that the Kinyarwanda interpreter can put the correct pronunciation to it.  Rose, and then B-U-R-I-Z-A-H-I-Z-A. 
A.	I do not know her. 
Q.	Now, on the 29th of November 2000, you provided a statement and you have spoken about that already today.  What I want to ask you is this, have you any idea why the investigators came to speak to you on that occasion? 
A.	I do not know why. 
Q.	But on that occasion, as you have indicated this morning, you gave the investigators information.  You later read through or had -- did you read through the statement yourself in French perhaps or was it read to you, which was it, do you remember? 
A.	They reread, they read back the statement to me. 
Q.	And when you were satisfied that it reflected accurately what you had said to them and what you wanted to say to them, you signed the statement as being true.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And I'm going to read the beginnings of this statement to the point where you get to the hospital, because it takes us through your story and puts it in context, and it will save me asking you questions about that.  And I will omit in the statement where you refer to particular places.  So if it sounds a little disjointed from time to time, it is because I am trying to step over perhaps what might be sensitive matters.

	You start off by saying, that this is your first meeting with the investigators, and that you are willing to testify before the Tribunal here about what you know.  And I'm looking at -- this is page ALV 4 of the bundle.  You say, "On the 6th of April 1994, I was living at -- " and you give your address, "with my brothers and sisters.  My father had -- " it goes on -- "for a long time worked -- " and you specify his function *************************.  "We learned of the death of President Habyarimana on the radio in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April 1994.  After the 6th of April, the atmosphere in the commune was very tense.  There was a lot of tension between the Tutsi and the Hutu, groups were formed along political lines.  The Hutus joined the MRND and the CDR, while the Tutsis joined the 
	Parti Libéral.  Some Tutsis had forged Hutu identity cards and joined the MDR.  There were no killing following the 6th of April.  My father went to work ******************** but came straight back home.  He told us that his colleagues at work had given him some bad news.  He was worried, and we knew that he was not telling us everything.  There were night patrols.  The Hutus said, quote, it is you the Inkotanyi who killed the president, unquote.  People were scared.  We knew that something was going to happen soon.  We took turns to perform guard duty in front of our house in order to warn the others if someone was coming to attack.  The situation remained like that until around the 19th of April.  The killings commenced that day.  We dispersed.  I left with my eldest sister and my father for the bush -- " and you name somewhere near your home.  "We spent the night there.  The following day we went to Ngoma," which is the central part of Butare, as I understand it.  And you went into the bush there near the cemetery.  You remained there until, you said 10, in the morning.  "At that point my father said we would be safe at the teaching hospital" ******************************.  "We separated from my eldest sister and my father and I left for the teaching hospital, arriving there at 11 am."

	Now, just pausing there, or stopping there; is all of that so far correct?  
A.	It is correct. 
Q.	All right.  And then it goes on, "At the hospital we met Sister Théopiste.  My father asked if she could help -- if we could help her.  She responded in the affirmative and added, quote, whether you help us or not, you are going to die.  That was around the 20th of April.  I remained with my father in the days that followed.  There were some soldiers at the hospital, some were on guard duty and were always there.  Others came from time to time to fetch refugees.  There were tents used by Médecins sans frontières.  All of the soldiers wore camouflage uniforms; some were wearing metal helmets while other were wearing berets with cords.   The first day we arrived at that hospital around 11 a.m., we spent the entire day and night there.  The following day we spent the entire day and night there."  

	And on your statement that brings you to the third day, the Saturday.  And I won't go into events then.  And suffice it to say that today you are suggesting that that was the Friday, in your statement it is the Saturday, and perhaps the position is that you are not too sure which day it was, would that be --  would that be fair to say, given all of the circumstances that you were subjected to? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	Well, what you have said, I think in your statement and you said in evidence here, is that you saw André Rwamakuba the first time the day after you arrived at the hospital.  Is that correct, that is your evidence? 
A.	That is what it is, Counsel. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, before we come to events concerning André Rwamakuba, I just want to ask you some general questions.  First of all, Madam, while you were staying at the hospital.  May I ask you where you stayed?  Did you stay in a particular place?  Were you moving around?  What was the position for you? 
A.	I was in the courtyard between the pediatric ward and the ENT unit, but I was moving around from time to time. 
Q.	And what was going on in that courtyard, generally, while you were there?  What was it being used for? 
A.	The refugees had gathered in that courtyard.  There were also the tents of Médecins sans frontières.  And they came and took young men and young women -- or rather, young men, from that place. 
Q.	And on your evidence that is the period from the 20th, which on the calendar is a Wednesday, to the 21st to the 22nd, when you say in evidence here that you left in the afternoon of the 22nd, or it could be the afternoon of Saturday the 23rd, about that time.  We are talking about that period of time, that is correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	While you were there, can you remember if the prime minister came to the hospital? 
A.	I no longer remember. 
Q.	Well, you were very young and I quite accept that.  What about the president, the new president, Sindikubwabo, can you remember seeing him at all come to the hospital or anything about him? 
A.	I never saw him there, however, I knew him from before because his wife was my aunt's friend or something of the sort. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that.  So, it wasn't something that ever came to your notice or attention?  Now, while you were there, were there many soldiers at the hospital? 
A.	Yes, they were there. 
Q.	While you were there, did anything nasty ever happen at night? 
A.	Yes, something bad or dangerous happened. 
Q.	And can you tell us what that was, please? 
A.	Do you want to know what André Rwamakuba allegedly did?  
Q.	Well, I'm asking what you saw him do because, obviously, that is helpful for the Chamber.  And you have told us of your two sightings of him, the only two sightings of him that you said you had of him.  I'm going to come to those in a moment.  Do you want to add to that? 
A.	No, I have nothing more to add to what I have told you. 
Q.	Now, having given a statement back in November of 2000, four and a half years ago, or five, you made a second statement on the 13th of November 2003.  How -- do you know why it was that the investigators came to see you about André Rwamakuba in November 2003? 
A.	I do not know why the investigators came to see me. 
Q.	After all you have told us how you keep yourself to yourself, and you don't talk about the case, have you any idea how the investigators had any idea that you might be able to help them about          André Rwamakuba?  
A.	I knew something without being very sure about it.  
Q.	You see, what is strange is that you made a statement to the investigators just a few years before with no mention of him at all.  So, I'm asking you, what was it?  Can you help us as to what caused them to come back to you, who doesn't talk about it with anyone.  Have you any idea why they would do that? 
A.	To tell you the truth, I didn't talk about it with anyone.  I saw the investigators come to meet me, they put questions to me.  Then I told them what I knew about this person. 
Q.	Now, let's come to this first opportunity that you had of seeing André Rwamakuba, which you told us about this morning.  It was -- leaving the date aside and the day aside for a moment, it was the day after you got to the hospital.  And you told us that you saw him with Dr. Gatera, Colonel Muvunyi,    Dr. Jotham and Sister Théopiste, ***********************.  I think that is fair and correct.
A.	I told you ********************************************************************************************************** Théopiste.  As to Muvunyi, I knew him more or less well ************************. 
Q.	Yes, I understand that.  But your evidence is that you saw Rwamakuba with these people the first time you saw him.  That is what you told us this morning.  That is correct, is it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And when you were asked how you knew it was André Rwamakuba, you said, "It was other refugees who said his name, who pointed him out to me."  And you added, "Because he had done his internship there, he had studied there and they knew him"; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	And am I right in saying that that fact, that is, that he had done any internship there and studied there, was something that you told for the very first time in that witness box this morning, and you have never, ever mentioned that to any investigator, or anyone here for the Prosecution before giving your evidence; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And so why didn't you mention it to anyone before 12 o'clock this morning? 
A.	I didn't tell anyone else, except the investigators of this Tribunal when they put questions to me about it. 
Q.	Well, you see, if you had said that, I'm sure it would be in their statement, the statement that you signed; but it is not, you see? 
A.	I said it to the second team of investigators, and I explained to you why. 
Q.	Well, as I leave this point, it is not mentioned at all in your statement.  And more than that,              Ms. Cummings-John, who has prepared you for your evidence in this case, has served me with two will-say statements dated, respectfully, the 4th and the 5th of July, with quite a lot of material in them.  But again, no reference by you to knowing to in any way that André Rwamakuba had studied or been an intern at the Butare hospital.  

	So can I ask you this:  When did you first learn that Dr.  André Rwamakuba had been an intern at the Butare hospital?  When did you first learn that? 
A.	At the time of the events the refugees used to say this, they said many things about him. 
Q.	Well, that is what you say now.  You told us this morning that the people who were telling you this, you said, "Some were workers at the hospital and they knew him when they did -- when he did his internship.  They also knew him from outside of the hospital."  Now, are you in a position, ******************************************, are you in a position to provide this Court with any names of the people who told you this thing? 
A.	What you are saying is not correct.  I didn't discuss it with anyone.  The statement I made before is the most specific possible. 
Q.	And what I'm asking you is, you mentioned that there were workers who told you this at the time, workers at the hospital who told you this at the time.  And I'm asking you, can you provide us today with any of their names? 
A.	No one told me, informed me. 
Q.	Then you were asked, "What it was that these people were doing?"  And you said, "They were moving about inside of the buildings, committing atrocities."  And you were 20 metres away.  I know it is a long time ago and you were very young, but can I trouble you to see if you can remember what approximate time of day this was?  I'm not asking you to be very, very specific, but, generally, what time of day was this?  
A.	It was towards the end of the afternoon, about 6 p.m. 
Q.	And you told us how you happened to go into intensive care where you saw Rwamakuba with other doctors, and encouraging people, pulling the drips off of people, delivering them over to other people who were there.  Why did you go into intensive care where this was going on? 
A.	There was a government soldier who had been wounded by gunfire.  And they had begun also chasing us away from the place we were sheltering. 
Q.	Indeed, you said this morning, "I left the courtyard" because you were driven out and you went into intensive care.  In your statement, you describe how civilians arrive and soldiers arrive and you see this.  And then you say, "Like other refugees, I slipped into the intensive care room and passed myself off as a nurse", rather a different picture.  In your evidence today you are forced into there.  And in your statement you are slipping in there as a disguise when you see these people and soldiers arrive at the hospital.  So can I ask you, which of these accounts you remember to be the correct one? 
A.	I have the impression that you are making fun of me.  *******************************************.  I didn't say any such thing in my statement. 
	(Pages 37 to 47 by Donna M. Lewis) 





















1520H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I assure you that I am not here to make fun of you and I don't think that this Chamber would begin to allow me to do that and I wouldn't do it.  I am reading your statement and if you want, you can read it yourself, if you understand it in French.  But let me read it to you again.  "Like other refugees, I slipped into the intensive care room and passed myself off as a nurse looking after a sick soldier."  

What is your explanation for giving that account, as you plainly did to the investigator?  
A.	On that point, I told the investigators that I was in the intensive care ward as a visiting -- assisting someone who was a patient, and not as a nurse.  And it is true that I left with the other refugees because there was a soldier who had no visitor to assist him and we would take turns doing so.  
Q.	All right.  It is not the biggest point, but why did you just tell us in your evidence that you went there because you were chased out of the courtyard and into there?  It is a rather different picture, isn't it, being chased in or going in as a disguise, can you remember which it was?  
A.	I had heard it said that we were running the risk of a grenade been thrown into the courtyard where the refugees had gathered and which is why I tried to keep going and coming as did the other people who could do so.  
Q.	Well, one way or the other, you go into the intensive care ward.  Well, one appreciates that you had been associated with the place for several years and so it would be familiar now to you, but I am asking you to cast your mind back to 1994.  How many beds would there be in this ward -- this intensive care ward that you are talking about?  
A.	The hospital was overcrowded.  We were in the corridor where the soldiers were lying on the floor.  
Q.	So these were wounded soldiers?  
A.	Yes, wounded Habyarimana government soldiers, soldiers who had been wounded at the front.  
Q.	And in the ward itself, there were beds with other patients in them; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And it is a long time ago and, now, you were very young, but can you help me.  Approximately how many beds would there have been in that ward, in the intensive care ward?  
A.	Well, that did not concern me.  I was looking after the soldiers who were in the corridor as a visitor, assisting one of those soldiers.  Those who were in the intensive care ward were being looked after by other people.  
Q.	And in the intensive care ward, you weren't dressed up as a nurse or anything like that; is that correct?  
A.	I had disguised myself as a guard malady and not as a nurse.  Guard malady is a specific term meaning someone like a visitor who assists a sick person; not a proper nurse.  
Q.	And how long approximately were you there when you say Rwamakuba and his group were in the intensive care ward?  And, again, I appreciate it is a long time ago, but can you help me as to approximately how long you were there with that group?  
A.	I stayed there very little time, approximately 20 minutes.  
Q.	As, indeed, you told us this morning, I recall.  In your statement, you say that you were able to watch the Rwamakuba group committing atrocities.  "They removed drips from Tutsi patients and ordered stretcher bearers to take them out from the room.  I saw Rwamakuba himself remove drips from the patients.  They left the room and I remained at that location for another 20 minutes."  So which was it? You left before they did, as you gave in evidence, or they were there.  They left and you remained for 
	20 minutes yourself?  
A.	I stayed there for 20 minutes and left before them.
Q.	Because you see, your statement goes on to say, "In the evening we were chased out of the intensive care room by the soldiers who had come to know that we were not real nurses."  Is that right?  Sorry, was there a reply to that?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I haven't had one, sorry. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you repeat what you just said when I asked you whether in the evening you were chased out of the intensive care room by soldiers who had come to know that "We were not real nurses," whether that was correct or not?  
A.	That is correct; they chased us out of there.  
Q.	So had you left there that evening before being chased out or had you gone back there?  
A.	I had not left that ward.  
Q.	Well, - we have that response.  I am not going to go further into it and those were the events that you talked about.  

Just one last thing.  You refer to a man called Sibomana who had been injured just outside the hospital and who had been coming and hoping for assistance.  Is that someone you were talking to or not, or just someone you had heard about?  It is just unclear what your position was in respect of that person.  
A.	It was someone I knew, he was a neighbour.  
Q.	Thank you.  I see the time and I don't know if that is a suitable moment, but I will finish this witness today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short break now for 15 minutes.  

Madam Witness, we will have a short break for about 15 minutes and you will resume your evidence afterwards.  
(Court recessed from 1530H to 1600H)  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can resume now.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, can I just drift back to a question which I asked you before, but I am reminded -- I don't think I got an answer on -- and it was simply this:  At the time when people were telling you that it was André Rwamakuba who had come to the hospital and that he had been an intern that studied at the hospital, you said that amongst those people were workers of the hospital.  And I ask you again this question:  Do you know any of those workers's names who were there and telling you that?  
A.	All these people are dead. 
Q.	All right.  So thank you for that.  

Now, can I come to the day when -- and I know this is a very upsetting area for you, obviously, the day your father was taken from you and I am not concerned whether it was the Friday or a Saturday, whichever day it was:  You told us this morning how you had seen him taken away by a soldier and Rwamakuba and the group of people that you mentioned earlier -- that is to say, Dr. Gatera, 
	Dr. Jotham, Sister Theopista and Colonel Muvunyi - and, they took him away and you followed them where he was -- where they were taking him.  You remember telling us that this morning; am I correct?  
A.	Yes, that is what I said this morning.  
Q.	Now, I am going to pass out a piece of paper to you which is a plan of the hospital.  That one has been marked with some Kinyarwanda words on it, so for those who don't speak English or French, let me hand the document that hasn't been marked.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I don't have one and it adds nothing to the document -- show the Prosecution first.  It is just four or five words on there that had been written on it to assist witnesses who only speak Kinyarwanda.  There are words from maternity, surgery, parking, faculty of medicine, intensive care.  Otherwise, the plan is the same as we have, and I think on our page 47 in the bundle, the bundle P. 2, Prosecution exhibit.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you refer to a store that was part of the kitchen.  Can you mark that with an "X" on that sketch plan, if that's possible?  If it is of any help, according to the index, as it were, that we have, or reference number 20 there, if you can find that, just to the right, just below the middle right number 20, is nominated as the kitchen and number 21 as the laundry.  I understand that there may be -- it may not be indicated on there, 29 on the top left-hand corner, there may be a second kitchen which is used for bed helpers, people who are -- or even for patients, relatives who were at the hospital who needed to cook for them, but I understand that the main kitchen is -- we have indicated in this case is at 20.  

	Does that, as far as you can recall, does that fit in with your recollection of where the kitchen and store would have been in 1994?  Can you help us, please, Madam Witness?  
A.	I do not agree with this sketch, and I do not wish this to be considered as contempt of Court on my part.  
Q.	Well, not at all.  It is your evidence we want and if you disagree -- what do you disagree about the sketch?  Looking at number 20, for example, have you found that?  I think you have, Madam Witness.  You are saying that 20 isn't the kitchen or it wasn't the kitchen then or, and if it wasn't the kitchen then or the store where your dad was, can you help us as to where it was on this sketch, if you can?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am sorry, Mr. Hooper.  Actually what it related to was a note he had sent me concerning a possible reduction, which might be required from something that happened just before the break.  I didn't mean to interrupt you this time, but I will deal with it in a few minutes.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So can I come back, Madam Witness, to the project in hand.  Are you able to indicate at all on that sketch the approximate position of the store that you refer to in your evidence where your father had been before he was taken away?  Can you help me with that?  
A.	First, you must explain to me what number 20, number 21, 4 and 7 stand for.  If you explain to me, then I will be able to interpret the sketch.  
Q.	Well, let me help you in this way.  Can you find -- can you see -- so I understand, not everyone is good at sketches, particularly other people's.  But if you look at the bottom of the plan, can you see the parking area?  I think "parking" has been written there, which is, I understand, they are not too difficult a translation into Kinyarwanda.  Can you see that at the bottom, Madam Witness?  Can you see the parking area where it is written "parking," can you see that?  
A.	Yes, I can see the place.
Q.	Now, that is the front of the hospital where you come in obviously and you would park, and immediately in front of you, it has got the administration building that's number 1 and the reception area, which is number 1 slightly to the left.  And then you have got the beginning the corridor that runs all the way through the hospital, outdoor corridor that runs all the way down to -- on our sketch to the top of the plan, which is maternity.  To understand, it is the same word in Kinyarwanda and that is number 12.  

	So you can take yourself there and you can see, as you go in past administration and along that corridor, you will see number 9, pediatrics; you see number 8, which is surgery; and on your map it's got that, I think written in Kinyarwanda as well, as Iseta, I-S-E-T-A, and then it's got 20 and 21, which is the new or old kitchen.  And right on the right-hand column at 22 is the staff cafeteria.  

Now, are you helped by that explanation sufficient to be able to identify the approximate position? Because it is only a sketch of the kitchen store where your father was before he was taken away.  
A.	I would like to know first, what boxes number 20 and 21 stand for.  
Q.	All right.  I will tell you this isn't my plan, right?  It is the Prosecution's plan.  Number 20 is described as the kitchen.  Number 21 is described as a laundry.  Does that help you?  
A.	But you said that rectangle number 22 stood for the kitchen, it seems to me.  
Q.	22, I understand is the cafeteria or the restaurant.  May I say this, that is what it is now.  There is a note that we had earlier -- the original note -- it says earlier at number 22, this building had also been used for -- well, it's called "poultry."  I don't know whether that means as in chickens or whether they mean it was a pantry, but it has got poultry and a dormitory for nurses -- not at the same time, I hope.  

	Does that help you?  You see, all these sketches is a bird's-eye view, if you like, of looking down on the hospital and roughly where places are.  And all I want to know is, can you tell us where the store is that you referred to?  
A.	Since you said number 20 is the kitchen and number 21 is the laundry, I can say that I am able to identify the space between the two.  So I would say that I would place this stock from the right to the other side and -
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	The witness says, "In this direction," but the interpreters are not able to determine what she means.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I don't want to put words in your mouth, but roughly speaking, is the store -- is the stockroom that you talked about, is that about the position of 20, 21 on our sketch?  Is that right?  
A.	I really am not able to work with this sketch very well.  
Q.	All right.  Well, let put the sketch to one side.  You tell us, explain to us where the storeroom is, please?  You walk into the hospital from the parking area, right, and I meet you and I say, "I want to go to the storeroom," where do you send me?  
A.	You would go through here. 
Q.	All right.  You mark your plan and show us -- put a big cross where you end up, so that we know where you are. 
A.	I observed that you can get to the stock by various means, by two ways and I am going to indicate both.

1620H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, it's not the routes that I'm interested in; it's where it is, but if that helps you.  

Yes, how are we doing?  Mr. Fry, I wonder if the witness could be assisted to the point of perhaps having what -- to see whether she's just marked up the -- the store.  

Can you show this gentleman where the store is, if you've got that far yet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry again for that. 
MR. HOOPER:
I didn't notice anything.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Technical support. 
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, technical support. Right.  Yes, I could do with some. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, Madam Witness, I don't want to take too long on this because we want to finish your evidence today, and -- have you managed to put a cross where the store is approximately, or where it was, rather?  
A.	I cannot say that I succeeded in doing so, but I'll say I tried. 
Q.	Well, well done.  Let's see what you've done.  Okay, thank you very much.  So if that can be shown around and as it's being shown around, just for the record, you've indicated a couple of arrows coming out of the top and bottom of box number 20, with a cross by number 20.  And I don't think we need concern ourselves at this stage or perhaps at all any further than that.  That's the storeroom in which your poor dad was taken, and what you witnessed there.  All right, thank you very much for that.  Now, and that should be given an exhibit number, which will be D. 47 -- no, 48, I think. 
MR. FRY:
D. 48, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence, D. 48.
(Exhibit No. D. 48 admitted)
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, so at about 11 o'clock on -- whether the Friday or the Saturday, that's -- you are, you told us, on the spot at that point when you see Rwamakuba and the others that you named and the soldier taking your dad away.  And you told us how you followed but that at a certain point in time you stopped and this is when you get hit. 

Again, I'm -- I'm sorry to take you back to all that in your mind, but where were you when -- when you stopped and got -- and got hit?  Which -- can you remember where that was? 
A.	I had just got to a place between the surgery and the maternity wing. 
Q.	Was it close -- closer to the maternity wing than the surgery, can you remember? 
A.	I had already gone past the operating theatre of the surgery and I was just on the point of reaching the maternity wing. 
Q.	And -- and what exactly happened?  Can you tell us, please?  I'm sorry to trouble you with this again, but it's quite important. 
A.	I was following the people who were taking away my father and, at one point, I realised that someone had hit me with something and when I realised that it was this man who had struck the blow, I turned around and I went back into the courtyard. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you for that.  Now, so you didn't see the person strike the blow.  Did you see what it was that you had been hit with? 
A.	I saw this man and I saw what he hit me with. 
Q.	And you described it as something like a hoe or an axe?  I don't think you have told us yet in you're evidence where he hit you.  Where did he hit you? 
A.	I -- I was hit in the back. 
Q.	In your statement you say your shoulder.  Do you mean your shoulder or your back? 
A.	It is practically the same thing. It was on the shoulder, but on the side closer to the spine. It was around there.  For me, it's just about the same thing. 
Q.	Sitting there now, can you touch the point where you were hit?  Can you do that for us, if your comfortable doing that?  Can you do that?
A.	I can't take my clothes off in front of everyone, but if someone were to come, I might agree to show him the place. 
Q.	All I'm asking you to do is just put your hand up.  Can you watch me for a moment?  Can you watch me for a moment?  Is that possible?  You see, I'm touching my shoulder.  Can -- can you touch the point where you were hit? 
A.	Here. 
Q.	So you are indicating a point below or beside your right armpit towards the back; would that be right? 
A.	Actually, it is towards the back.  It's my shoulder bone, but to the back. 
Q.	All right -- 
A.	I didn't show my armpit, no. 
Q.	All right, the clavicle perhaps.  Well, anyway, that's where you were hit and I'm looking at your statement and you say, "I still bear the scar on my shoulder and I'm prepared to show it to the Court."  Now, I'm not asking you to show it to the Court.  Do you still have a scar 11 years after that blow -- from that blow? 
A.	Perhaps you are not expressing yourself sufficiently clearly.  It is not actually a scar. It is actually a kind of swelling; it's not really a scar as such.  It's a mark. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President --
MR. HOOPER:
Excuse me, you can (microphones overlapping)...
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, you described it in French as a hematome; is that right? 
A.	I'm not more educated than other people, but a haematoma is an accumulation of blood in a particular place.  If we're going to use the exact medical terms, I think there's a small problem with the interpreter. 
Q.	Well, no, in your statement concerning Rwamakuba you refer to, in French, haematom or haematoma and -- and that was written at a time when, of course, you had a particular qualification or function.  And, that is the original statement.  It's been, I concede, probably mistranslated as a scar in English, so let's forget the word scar altogether.  Do you bear a haematom or a haematoma or other mark 11 years after that blow from that blow? 
A.	Yes, quite so.  You know, when you look at the body you will find that there is a deep cavity; there is a difference in the levels -- there's a distinctive sign on one of the shoulders. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much, and I'm not going to ask you to show anyone, but I noticed that though you said in your statement, "I'm willing to show the Court" in a document called a will-say statement, which is a document furnished by the Prosecution only yesterday, you say, "I'm no longer willing to show the Court."  And I'm not going to embarrass you by asking you to show it, particularly as you've indicated the point on your body where it is.  But from what you say, this must have been a very hard and vicious blow that you were struck, to leave you 11 years later with a continuing mark on your body.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, you said this morning, you lost consciousness and then you said, "Well, no, it was more a fright" and you also said, "Well, I was told by someone that Rwamakuba had hit me."  Just on the last point, you didn't see him hit you, but what was the position?  Did you turn and see him there holding this axe or hoe having struck you?  What was the position, precisely, if you can remember? 
A.	I turned and I saw him.  I saw him opposite and today, I'm not able to recognise him (sic).  If you were to bring him as one of five -- I'm -- I'm still able to recognise him, even if you were to bring him as one of five people. 
Q.	See, in your statement you say -- the statement you made in 2003 in November, you say, "I will recognise him, I can recognise him still."  But I got a will-say statement from you and I don't need to explain what that is, it's just a note from the Prosecution who have sat down and talked about the case with you.  And just on that point, can I just pause, you've spent quite a long time with the Prosecutor here, haven't you, discussing your evidence, that's right, isn't it?  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	I'm sorry, I'm sorry -- I didn't get the translation? 
A.	I did meet them. 
Q.	And you spent quite a long time with Ms. Cummings-John, did you not?  Who is the lady who sits there, closest to you on the Prosecution bench.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	No.  Our interview did not last for hours as you claim. 
Q.	But it was over two days; is that right? 
A.	No, we were together for about an hour. 
Q.	Well, it's just I've got two will-say statements, one dated the 4th of July and the other one dated 
	the 5th of July, and I'm looking at the 4th of July one, where it says, "Contrary to what is stated in her statement of 13th of November 2003, the witness is no longer able to recognise Rwamakuba if she were to see him again."  So which is it?  You can recognise him now or you can't and why the change in just 24 hours? 
A.	I have not fully understood your question. 
Q.	I have a statement from the Prosecutor to alert me to any possible changes in your evidence and included in that is the Prosecution -- the Prosecution's note that contrary to what you said in your statement about Rwamakuba, where you said in your statement, "If shown him I will recognise him," you had now told the Prosecutor a day ago, "If I had that opportunity, I would no longer be able to recognise him."  Now, you say, "I will recognise him" or "I could recognise him."  So which is it? 
A.	I would be able to recognise him. 
Q.	So why did you tell the Prosecutor just a day ago specifically that you couldn't? 
A.	You've changed what I said.  You say that I met the Prosecutor during two days.  The purpose of these will-says is that I had additional items of information to add to my statement. I thought you said that I was with the Prosecutor for 48 hours, but I made a mistake.  It is true that the Prosecutor came to see me on two successive days, but we were together only briefly and I tried to give them in that time the items of information that came to mind. 
Q.	Yes, well, I'm -- I'm not going to spend, I hope, much longer on this.  The witness's -- I'll read what it says.  

"The witness's testimony will include the following.  Number 1.  That contrary to what is stated in her statement" of such and such a date -- "the witness is no longer able to recognise Rwamakuba if she were to see him again." 

A simple question, why did you say that to Ms. Cummings-John on one day and the next day change your mind? 
A.	I spoke -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said, "I was a witness of the genocide, I saw that man.  If you bring him here, I will point him out to you." 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you describe him to us, please, as you remember him many years ago. 
A.	At the moment of the events, he was a medium-sized man; neither too big nor too short.  And, his -- the colour of his skin was somewhere between light and dark and he had thick lips and a strong jaw.  That is what the items of information I can give you to identify him.  I could add that he has the sort of nose that Hutus generally have. 
Q.	You're speaking as a Tutsi there, is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Well, in my submission, it's not a good description of him.  But, tell me this:  Have you been talking to anyone about his description?  The thick lips, for example, is that something you've heard from somebody else -- perhaps someone who has got it wrong even? 
A.	I confirm what I have just stated and I can guarantee my statement. 
Q.	All right.  Now, we've got about just over half an hour to go today, and I'm going to try and finish your evidence, if I can. 

I'm going to go back to your first statement and we've already touched on that statement -- statement of the 29th of November 2000.  And, indeed, I've read already quite a lot of page ALV 4, which is page 3 in the English of that statement, and you may remember that I've read out the earlier events that befell you and your dad before you got to the hospital.  Starting with the 6th of April, separating from other members of your family, getting to the hospital, meeting Sister Theopista, who said that, "Whether you help us or not, you're going to die" and that was around the 20th of April.  That you remained with your father and you talked about soldiers, Médicines sans frontièrs, the uniforms the soldiers were wearing. And, I'll pick it up at our page 3 in the English, just after your reference to Médicines sans frontièrs and the soldiers.  And the passage commenced -- and I want you to listen carefully, please, as I read it slowly so that it can be translated to you.

"The first day we arrived at the hospital around 11 a.m.  We spent the entire day and night there.  The following day we spent the entire day and night there." 

Just pausing there, I asked you earlier if at all that statement that I'd read to you was correct and you said, "Yes, it was."  And now, I continue from that point where I'd earlier left off.
(Pages 53 to 57 by Jean Baigent)


1645H
MR. HOOPER: (continuing)
"The third day, a Saturday, around 11 a.m., my father was in the store in the kitchen.  I saw four soldiers head for the store.  They stopped outside the door.  Sister Theopiste, who was with them said, '*************, come out, the soldiers are looking for you.'  At first, my father refused to come out.  
Sister Theopiste then said to one of the soldiers, 'Go and get him out.'  My father was in the store but I was by the door and could see and hear everything.  One of the soldiers grabbed my father by his shirt collar, Sister Theopiste then slapped him in the face several times.  The soldiers then left with my father.

They went down the pediatrics unit -- down the pediatrics unit corridor and continued towards the maternity ward.  I followed them right up to the maternity unit, and it dawned on me at that location that if I went any further I would be killed.  I remained where I was.  My father made a sign to me with his hand, and I never saw him again.  Athanase Habimana and Diogene Halindintwara" -- that's Diogene, D-I-O-G-E-N-E, and Halindintwara, H-A-L-I-N-D-I-N-T--W-A-R-A, Halindintwara -- "who were with the soldiers, mentioned in my presence about a half an hour later that my father had been killed.  Diogene is being held at Karubanda, while Athanase is in exile."  

And I'm sorry to read this bit, but I must.  "They told me that my father received cudgel and club blows and that to finish him off, the soldiers dosed him with petrol and set him on fire.  The soldiers at the hospital were from the ESO.  I don't know their names, but recognised some of them.  When I was a student at" -- a certain place -- "I went past the ESO everyday and saw soldiers at the entrance.  I saw some of them again at the teaching hospital."  All right.  

Now, you talk of amnesia, but that was a very full and terrible account of the last moments that you saw your dad and of his being taken away.  And I'm sorry to have had to read it and take you back to that, but there is no -- and you are understandably very upset.  Would you like a break or shall I -- let me carry on and see how we are.

You see, what you witnessed there was terrible, but you gave a full account, didn't you, about what happened?  And there is no -- there is no André Rwamakuba there, is there?  There is no Dr. Gatera there.  There is no Colonel Muvunyi there.  There is no Dr. Jotan -- Jotham, sorry.  And the reason you don't mention them being there is that they weren't there but, nevertheless, you experienced a terrible moment and a terrible loss.  And you now, perhaps, will name anyone who you think is or could be the blame for the loss of your dad.  And I can, in a way, understand that, but it's not right, is it?  

I am not even sure I need an answer from you, madam, but you go on, in fact, just a few lines down, you say, "I do not know Muvunyi personally."  And at that time, unlike the later statement, you didn't know him, did you?  Later you said you do.  

And the other matter I'd draw your attention to, if it needs, really, your attention being drawn to it, there is no blow to you, you see, no blow to leave a scar, a hematome, whatever, nothing like that.  And that's not amnesia, is it, and that statement was made in 2000 -- whenever -- November 2000, right at the end of the year 2000, six years after the events.  It's all very sad.  

And even if we come to your statement about Rwamakuba, where you put him in the picture, include him in the event, there is no mention of Jotham or Gatera or Muvunyi there being present.  

Now, I want to ask you briefly about what happened after you lost your dad.  And you told us in your evidence what happened.  You told us that you had, the same day, having gone back to the courtyard, that the people who had been with your father, you said, Gatera and soldiers and the driver, gave him, the driver, "the orders to take us away from the courtyard."  And you were taken to the Butare prefecture office.  And I see you are still upset.  Are you in a position to go on and answer a few more questions?  I haven't got too many for you.  Get it over with today?  
A.	There is no problem. 
Q.	Okay, good.  
A.	I can continue testifying. 
Q.	Right.  So, now when you went to the Butare préfecture office, did you go -- did all the women who were at the hospital who were refugees like you, were they all taken to the préfecture office that day?  That's my question.  How many of you went that day? 
A.	We all left the hospital.  No one stayed behind. 
Q.	So for our purposes, because there will be other witnesses coming in this case, I'm sure, we are talking here of April, the 21st -- no, sorry, April the 22nd, the Friday, on your evidence, but you can see it, given how often you've mentioned that it was a Saturday that your father was killed but it could be the Saturday which was the 23rd, that the hospital was cleared out of refugees and women -- women refugees who were taken to the préfecture office.  And you told us that you stayed there for two days.  You tried to go to your granny's, stayed for a very short time, an hour, whatever it was or even less, fled from there to an aunt's but then went back to the préfecture.  But when you got back after a hesitation as to which bus to get on -- or whether to go, I should put it like that, you went to Rango, which is in a forest.  Is it not?  Is that right; is Rango a forest? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you were there for a month and a half.  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	I want to come back to that first statement you made.  I'm looking at page 4 in the English, paragraph starting "one week."  

	"One week after my father's death, the director of the teaching hospital named Jotham said, 'I do not want any more dirt here, leave.'  He was talking to all the Tutsi refugees.  He ordered the driver to take us to the préfecture office.  The driver, Théodore Kubwimana, who is being held at Karubanda."  Is that right, was it indeed a week after your father's death that you left the hospital and not the same day? 
A.	I left the hospital on the same day, the same day as the day that my father was killed, in the evening. 
Q.	Well, there we are, clearly written in your first statement that it was a week after your father's death and that it was the director of the teaching hospital, as perhaps one might expect, who was the foremost or the person you named, Jotham, who ordered the women to be taken to the préfecture office.  Now, you go on to say here, "There was a large crowd at the préfet -- préfecture office and I spent two weeks there."  No two weeks in your statement.  Is that right, did you spend two weeks at the préfecture office? 
A.	No, two days.  All this was corrected subsequently because that statement had never been read back to me, but I did correct all those items that you mentioned.  I corrected them. 
Q.	Well, I don't think that's quite right about it not being read back to you because you told us before you signed it, that it was read back to you and you signed it when you believed it contained what you had said, and that what you had said was correct.  I'm not talking about changes you made yesterday.  
A.	But, Counsel, you have the changes that I made to my statement. 
Q.	Well, chop and change, if you want, but it's clear and we can read it, and I'm giving you an opportunity, if you wish, to explain these considerable differences of account.  You go on to say how people would come and take men and male Tutsi boys away from the préfecture and soldiers sometimes would come.  They knew in advance who they'd come for.  "They'd go directly to some people and take them away, and we knew that those people were also taken away to be killed.  The soldiers wore camouflage uniform and black berets."

	And you go on to say -- and I'm sorry to necessarily, I'm afraid, prolong this, "While I was at the préfecture office, young men" -- it's translated into English but it's les gens whatever - "young people like me could move around town."  And you go on to describe, you say, "I had a rich brother living at Ibis," which is a hotel in the main street of Butare, that's correct, isn't it, there is a hotel there?  And you had another brother residing at Faucon, which was another little hotel not many metres away from the first one.  And you said, "The brother at Ibis knew that I was at the préfecture office and would sometimes send someone to come and fetch me.  I would go to Ibis and he would give me some money."

	So that sounds like it's more than two days, doesn't it, Madam Witness?  But let me continue:  "One Saturday, on my way to see him" -- note how you put it, "one Saturday," and you described there -- and I'm not going to go through it all -- how you saw that brother taken away by Interahamwe and then brought back, and then they made to play and bully with him and he tried to run away.  And he got as far as the garage door there and they shot him, and then they left him to bleed to death for 30 minutes.  And then you witnessed all that.  You actually saw all that, is what you say in your statement.  And you learnt -- you also learnt that your other brother who was at the Faucon was killed on a Monday -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
With reference to the brothers at the hotels, would the names to the hotels be identifying?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I don't believe so.  These are well known and still existing small hotels in the main streets of Butare and they would not be an identifying feature, in my respectful submission.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I must continue because it goes on -- you statement goes on to say this after your brothers had been murdered:  "After two weeks at the préfecture -- Habyarimana's burial was in two weeks and we were to be killed after the burial."  Now, in fact, Habyarimana's planned burial was to take place on July the 1st, wasn't it, independence day, in Rwanda.  It never happened, but you say "We remained in Rango for one and a half months until the arrival of the RPF soldiers.  Now, your statement that you have provided for this case, the first one, November 2000; this one for November 2003, you say that it was 3 o'clock the day of your father's death that "Gatera and Rwamakuba ordered the civilians with them to chase us away under the pretext that we were dirtying the place."  No mention of Jotham and it's not a week later.  You say, "That was how I got to the préfecture office with the other women and spent two days at that location.  In the night, soldiers and civilians would come and fetch the women and they never came back.  I was young at that time, but was not taken away."  And then you say, "Along with my sisters" -- and you name them -- "I left the préfecture office and took refuge, first at my grandmother's house and then with my aunt, that's" -- and you name where your aunt is -- "a place in Butare.  Now, there is no mention there of Rango.  

Well, Madam Witness, you have been grievously hurt and experienced a terrible, terrible experience, but I suggest that your evidence in particular respects that we are concerned with, is all new and is not right.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I have no other question, if that was a question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Madam Witness, your evidence will continue just a bit longer because you must now answer some questions, which will be put to you by the Prosecutor.  Do you understand?  

THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think I will be quite brief.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, do you know how many people work at Butare hospital? 
A.	I didn't understand your question, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	The question is, do you know how many people currently work at the Butare hospital, the Butare university hospital? 
A.	I do not know the number of people who work at that hospital. 
Q.	****************? 
A.	No, I do not know their names. 
Q.	Witness, in your first statement, why did you not mention the name Dr. Gatera? 
A.	Are you referring to my first or my second statement?  
Q.	In your first statement.  
A.	I did not say this because I -- it was a group of criminals, a large one.  And so, from time to time, one could forget the name of one of the people who was a member of the group. 
Q.	And in your second statement, why did you not mention the name Dr. Jotham at all? 
A.	As to Dr. Jotham, I'd say that I forgot to mention him because I shouldn't have forgotten him as he was the director of the hospital. 
Q.	Now, you stated in your evidence in-chief that the first time you saw André Rwamakuba you were in the courtyard and you were chased from the courtyard; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
(Pages 58 to 62 by Gifty C. Harding)













1717H 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	After being chased from the courtyard, where did you go? 
A.	Are you referring to the first or to the second day?  
Q.	The first day when you saw André Rwamakuba.  
A.	I went into the intensive care ward. 
Q.	Do you know the approximate distance between the courtyard from where you were chased from to the intensive care unit where you went to? 
A.	I would say about 20 metres.  That is the distance I gave you when I estimated that this distance was equivalent to that between me and the back wall of the court. 
Q.	You also stated in your evidence-in-chief that you left before André Rwamakuba and his companions left; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Yet, in the cross-examination you were asked when you were chased away -- I'm sorry, the Defence told you that in your statement you had indicated that you were chased away in the evening from the intensive care unit.  Can you explain this?  What -- is it -- did you leave before they left, or did you leave in the evening? 
A.	We were forced to go out well before.  Rwamakuba and his group stayed in the intensive care ward. 
Q.	Now, staying in the intensive care unit, the Defence stated that in your statement, the English version, you had said that you tried to pass yourself off as a nurse.  In the French statement, it is stated that you passed yourself off as a garde-malade, could you please clarify which of these two terms is accurate? 
A.	I discussed myself as a garde-malade. 
Q.	Witness, when you gave your statement, the second statement, I believe, on the 13th of 
	November 2003, in the original, which is the French version which we have, the term hematoma is used to describe the injury that you incurred.  Did you suggest this term?  Did you give this term? 
A.	I told them that I had a swelling at that place.  I do not know the term that was used in the statement. 
Q.	Thank you.  In your second statement, when you talk about your father being taken away and you mention André Rwamakuba hitting you, in that particular passage, you do not mention anybody else.  Was André Rwamakuba alone?  Did he take your father alone? 
A.	He was with other people; he was with his group. 
Q.	Now, when you were being taken to the préfecture office in the car later that day, as is your testimony, did you know any of the other people who were in the vehicle with you being taken to the préfecture office? 
A.	I knew no one else amongst those people. 
Q.	Witness, can you remember everything that you stated in both your witness statements that you have given to the ICTR investigators? 
A.	Yes, I remember everything I said in those two statements because these are events to which I was an eyewitness. 
Q.	And the Defence touched on this briefly, while we understand the suffering that you have undergone during the 1994 period, the 1994 genocide, and the people that you have lost, does this cause you to want to come and tell lies to this Court? 
A.	That cannot convince me to come and tell lies here.  I have got many things to do, but I love my country, I am a patriot.  So, I am aware that I have not wasted my time in coming to give testimony here. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I have no further questions, Your Honour.  

Thank you, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I would like to say something, with your leave. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may. 
THE WITNESS:
I realised that Defence counsel is very much in support of his client.  So that everyone may understand, and that includes you, the Judges and the Republic of Rwanda, the Defence counsel should try and put himself in my place at the time of these events.  He might give -- give better testimony than I am able to.  I think that he feels I am just telling lies.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much, Madam Witness.  You have come to the end of your evidence now, and we thank you for coming to give evidence at the Tribunal.  You are now excused and you can leave.  Thank you very much.
(Witness excused)
MR. HOOPER: 
Again, I have got some exhibits, but it need not detain this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.

Mr. Fry, it has just been referred to me that the first name of the witness's father, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) was mentioned at 1650.  Is that an issue which needs to be redacted?  
MR. FRY:
I believe so, Your Honour, just to be safe. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I make the order. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry to have done that.  Mr. O'Shea has two matters to raise with you which will take about           15 minutes, I should think, but they need to be addressed tonight, in my submission.  
But before I do that, can I tender the statement of the 29th of November 2000 of the last witness, ALV, in English and French as Exhibit 49A and B, under seal, and the statement of the 13th of 
November 2003, A and B, Exhibit 50, D. 50, under seal.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted as stated.  
(Exhibit No. D. 49A and D. 49B admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 50A and D. 50B admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, the numbers are in order? 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Mr. Hooper aptly reminded me that I might not be popular, and I am acutely aware of that, but these are, in my submission, significant matters that need to be raised now, because of where we are now in the evidence in this case.  As Your Honour is aware, we are now entering into the stage of the Butare evidence, and we are days away from Ms. Alison Des Forges arriving.  And those two issues bring to light two administrative matters.  

Let me deal with Alison Des Forges first, briefly and quickly.  I am aware that Your Honours prefer that these kinds of questions be raised out of court, but I'm in a position now, in terms of transcripts, the latest transcripts I have in relation to Alison Des Forges, the latest official transcript is the 3rd of June.  And Your Honours will be aware that her evidence goes on for some two to three weeks after that.  That puts me in quite a difficult position knowing that Alison Des Forges, Dr. Des Forges, is coming on Wednesday.  

And we have put in requests.  We have, as far as I know, been assured that, at least, we will get them sometime.  But the position is that, we need them.  And if it were possible for Your Honour to just give a direction that special measures be taken that I get them by, let us say, Monday, that would assist me greatly.  I won't say any more on that.

The second matter is slightly more delicate.  I will set out some of the chronology in open court, just so that Your Honour can see the nature of the problem.  I will then request that I continue in closed session.  The reason being, that I need to refer to the activities of a person, and in doing so, that person believes that this may cause them difficulties.  And it may, indeed, in some sense, perhaps, infringe upon the issue of good faith, if I can go that far.  But let me by begin by explaining the problem.  
The issue relates to dossiers, the issue that we have been raising repeatedly, I can say, over the last three years.  Just to contextualise very quickly, in -- somewhere in, I think, mid-2003, Mr. Hooper and I went to see the then procureur general in Rwanda and request assistance in getting access to the Rwandan court dossier and we faced a blank refusal.  On the basis of that situation, we put in a motion asking the Tribunal, the then Trial Chamber, to request assistance from Rwanda.  That motion went in on the 15th of December 2003.  That motion was refused on the basis that we had not provided adequate proof of our assertion and that we needed to ask the registry for more assistance, which we did.  

On the 1st of March 2004, we wrote a letter to the registrar requesting assistance.  We wrote another letter on the 3rd of October 2004.  In December of 2004, and this is where Your Honours begin to come into the picture of the history of events, we put in a request that this Trial Chamber exercise its good offices, say, this Chamber, you, Mr. President, plus the ad hoc judges preceding this one, this Trial Chamber exercise its good offices with the registry to give us some feedback with regard to our letters to the registry.  

Your Honours then decided that that was a moot question because we had received a letter from the Rwandan government indicating a willingness to cooperate.  And that was in March of this year, around the time of the status conference that we had together in March of this year.

Another letter was sent to -- from the ICTR to Rwanda on the 25th of April 2005.  Then we took further steps.  And just to explain those steps, I would like, with Your Honours' permission, to go into closed session for the reasons that I have explained.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, I think we will have to go into closed session.  

For the benefit of the public, we do try to do as much of our business in open session as possible, but because of the sensitive nature of these proceedings, we are obliged to take certain steps to protect the identity of people who may be in danger otherwise.  So we now go into closed session for the rest of our time this afternoon. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 67 to 77] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
