         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  Proceedings are called to order.  Will the 

         5        registry introduce that case coming before the Trial 

         6        Chamber this morning, please.

         7   MR. KIYEYEU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II, of 

         8        the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed 

         9        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston 

        10        Churchill Matanzima Maqutu, and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, 

        11        is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 

        12        26th of September 2002, for the continuation of the 

        13        Defence case, when Prosecution Counsel, Mr. Fleming will 

        14        continue the cross-examination of Witness RHU23 (DW7) in 

        15        the matter of the Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case 

        16        No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  Thank you, Mr. President.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT:   Thank you.  May we have the appearance of 

        18        the  parties, starting with the Prosecution, if we may, 

        19        for the record.

        20   MR. FLEMING:  If the Court pleases, I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        21        trial attorney.  I appear with Ms. Ojemeni, trial 

        22        attorney and Ms. Marotine, case Manager.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, learned counsel.  May we also have 

        24        the appearance of the Defence, please, for the record.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Good morning, Your Honours.  Lennox Hinds, 

        26        representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor 

        27        Bompaka, and Emilien Dusabe, who is the translator.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, learned counsel.  Yes, 

        29        Interpreter, could you, please, tell Witness RHU23, that 

        30        the Trial Chamber reminds him of the solemn declaration

         1        evidence today on that same solemn declaration.

         2   THE WITNESS:  Very well.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  We are in open session could you tell 

         4        the witness so and that he should continue to be 

         5        cautious about mentioning places which could have a 

         6        bearing on his identity.

         7        

         8        Yes, Mr. Fleming.

         9   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.  Your Honours, can we 

        10        ask that one exhibit be shown to us for a moment.  It is 

        11        not necessarily for this purpose now, but it is 

        12        Prosecution Exhibit No. 19.  It is under seal, but we 

        13        would just like to look at it for one purpose.  If that 

        14        can be dealt with, my learned junior will deal with 

        15        that, but it won't interrupt what I am doing now.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right.  Okay.  Do we have this exhibit, 

        17        Prosecution Exhibit No. 19.

        18   MR. KIYEYEU:  Yes, My Lord, we have it.

        19   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour, I wouldn't allow that 

        20        to interrupt us.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.

        23   BY MR. FLEMING:

        24   Q.   Witness, on the morning of April the 7th, you left home 

        25        at what time to go to your work?

        26   A.   That morning, I left very early; before 6 a.m.

        27   Q.   Is it daylight by then?

        28   A.   At home at 6 a.m it is already daylight, but not very 

        29        bright as such.

        30   Q.   Now, on that morning, you saw no movement of people

         1        around your place, did you?  You saw no refugees 

         2        fleeing, did you, before you left?

         3   A.   The usual movements of the refugees in the area was 

         4        always there because the refugees were outside or in 

         5        tents or in houses where they were accommodated by 

         6        people in the area, so that the refugees moved in and 

         7        out.  I didn't really observe them, but I know that the 

         8        movement was always there, sir.

         9   Q.   Let's be specific.  On the morning of April the 7th, you 

        10        did not see the Muyemvano family going to the church, 

        11        compound, did you, the Parish?

        12   A.   Well, they left before I woke up, so I did not see them.

        13   Q.   Yes, you see, that is the problem.  You assume they left 

        14        before you woke up; don't you?

        15   A.   When I woke up I did not see them, they were not there.  

        16        But upon my return I learnt that they had moved before I 

        17        came before -- this is what I was told by the refugees.

        18   Q.   You said, and you agree that you said that; "All Tutsis 

        19        in the area left their homes and took refuge in the 

        20        church".  You didn't see a single Tutsi leaving their 

        21        homes and taking refuge in the church; did you, you 

        22        personally?

        23   A.   That is correct, sir.

        24   Q.   So, when you set out on your travels on the morning of 

        25        the 7th, you didn't know that all the Tutsis in the 

        26        area, including the Muyemvano family had left their 

        27        homes and took refuge at the church; did you?

        28   A.   Yes.  When I left home I did not know that the Tutsi 

        29        went to the church, sir.

        30   Q.   Now, you have agreed with me that you saw the soldiers

         1        and the civilians closing in on the church as you were 

         2        returning to where you were going.  So, the attack 

         3        started virtually soon after you arrived at your 

         4        destination; didn't it?

         5   A.   That is also correct.

         6   Q.   It was just as you were arriving that you heard guns and 

         7        explosions and people crying; wasn't it?

         8   A.   That incident happened just as I arrived, but a little 

         9        bit after my arrival I saw those people arriving and 

        10        several moments afterwards people started screaming and 

        11        there were explosions, sir.

        12   Q.   How did you know that they were cries of Tutsis -- how 

        13        did you then know that they were cries of Tutsis at that 

        14        point?

        15   A.   As a matter of fact, Prosecutor, I told you what 

        16        happened in Busogo, I told you that I saw everything 

        17        that happened.  I remember Tutsi being attacked, and  

        18        the number of Tutsis attacked, and probably, if I make a 

        19        mistake about their numbers it may well be two or more 

        20        or less, because I do remember the Tutsi taking refuge 

        21        because they were neighbours and some of them went to 

        22        the same church, and Gateyiteyi was in the same 

        23        association as myself and he had certain 

        24        responsibilities.  So, I was worried about the 

        25        responsibilities, I mean, about those people, and people 

        26        in my association.  And all that I am saying here is 

        27        true, and this could be corroborated by some of the 

        28        survivors, sir.

        29   Q.   I am sure.  Now, you might like to answer the question 

        30        that I asked you, please.   You said, in your statement,

         1        these words; "I saw the soldiers and civilians around 

         2        8:00 to 8:30 a.m. going towards the church.  Afterwards 

         3        I began to hear guns and explosions and people crying".  

         4        You have agreed you said that.  Your next sentence is; 

         5        "I then knew that the cries were of Tutsis who sought 

         6        refuge at the Parish".  Now, please tell me how at 8:00 

         7        to 8:30 in the morning on the 7th of April you knew that 

         8        the cries coming from the church or from the parish were 

         9        those of Tutsi?  Do you understand the question?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS:  He should wait for the translation, Your 

        11        Honour.

        12   THE WITNESS:  Let me remind you, sir, that when I saw those 

        13        people attack all the Tutsi before the events of the 

        14        parish I knew that they were also perhaps to attack 

        15        other people, because when I saw them going towards the 

        16        church, I remembered that they had massacred Tutsi 

        17        before and they were going to that location to look for 

        18        the Tutsi, and that morning refugees said that there 

        19        were refugee Tutsis at the parish.

        20   Q.   So, is it your evidence now that you were told by the 

        21        others that Tutsi were at the parish; is that what you 

        22        are saying?

        23   A.   When we heard gunfire in the direction of Ruhengeri, 

        24        people were saying Tutsi were being attacked.  They said 

        25        that all the Tutsi left their homes to take refuge at 

        26        the convents, and the local population knew that in such  

        27        circumstances they knew where Tutsi ran to take their 

        28        refuge.  The refugees also said that the Tutsi had found 

        29        refuge at the convent, so there was no doubt.  Everybody 

        30        was talking about it, and I myself knew, sir.

         1   Q.   So, you have told us that you we were frightened and 

         2        that you headed for home.  You have told us how you 

         3        passed groups of people speaking.  You didn't speak to 

         4        any refugees that morning at all; did you?  You were 

         5        intent on getting home?

         6   A.   I believe that even if I was frightened and I was going 

         7        home and I meet people on the way, we talk.  There has 

         8        been war in Rwanda since 1994, 1997, 1998, and people 

         9        were running around and even under such circumstances 

        10        they talked to each other and exchanged information.

        11   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honours, as an aside, I have noticed with 

        12        some consternation people coming into the public gallery 

        13        and picking up the headphones and juggling them around 

        14        because they think there is something wrong with the 

        15        headphones as a result of the voice recognition.  

        16        Perhaps the attendant can be told that there is voice 

        17        recognition because they are going in and out changing 

        18        pieces all the time.  That is on the side, I have sort 

        19        of watched this going on for two days.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT:  Registry, maybe you can tell the people, 

        21        those, of course, that are listening particularly in 

        22        Kinyarwanda, there is nothing wrong except that the 

        23        voice has been scrambled.

        24   MR. KIYEYEU:  We have taken note, Your Honour, we are going 

        25        to do so.

        26   BY MR. FLEMING:

        27   Q.   Witness, however, on that morning because of the news 

        28        that you heard, because you saw the many, many youths 

        29        that you have described and then because of what you saw 

        30        in Busogo secteur, you went straight home, you didn't

         1        talk to anybody, did you?

         2   A.   Prosecutor, I do not understand how you can say that I 

         3        didn't talk to anybody.  But I told you that I stopped 

         4        at my work place where the military or some soldiers 

         5        were talking.  I told you that there people along the 

         6        road, and they were talking to each other,  As I also 

         7        said that as I went home, there were people around and 

         8        they were observing what was happening in Ruhengeri.  

         9        You see that when you go through people you will have to 

        10        greet them and you will have to talk to them.  And, that 

        11        means on that day I did meet some people and we talked 

        12        to each other, sir.

        13   Q.   Did you just forgot to tell us that in your 

        14        evidence-in-chief?  But let me put this to you.  In your 

        15        statement of the 23rd of September 2001, you said this, 

        16        that you were unable to travel to the maize factory, 

        17        "And I turned around and went back home near the 

        18        Muyemvano compound.  On my way home I passed near the 

        19        ISAE institute, and the soldiers who were at the main 

        20        gate, together with the civilians followed me, and they 

        21        were travelling towards the residences of Tutsis in 

        22        Rwankeli cellule in Busogo secteur at Rudatinya's 

        23        locality.  As I was travelling I heard behind me guns 

        24        and explosions, and I went immediately home".  You said 

        25        those words, didn't you, in your statement?

        26   A.   Prosecutor, let me point out to you that the path that I 

        27        followed coming from Maizeri -- or that path -- in going 

        28        to my place I did not go through Muyemvano.  So, to 

        29        leave the Maizeri to go to my place we did not go 

        30        through Muyemvano.  However, to go from my place you

         1        will have got to go through Muyemvano.  That is just to 

         2        say that in my written statement and in my testimony I 

         3        made no mention of Muyemvano while on that path.

         4   Q.   Sir, I can read it to you again if you wish.  The 

         5        proposition is, that you said the words that I read to 

         6        you, that are recorded in your statement; isn't that the 

         7        case?

         8   A.   That statement is not correct and it does not appear in 

         9        my written statement.  Because I said, when I got here, 

        10        and the statement was shown to me.  Some corrections 

        11        were made, for instance, in connection with the times.  

        12        There is someone here who speaks good Kinyarwanda who 

        13        could assist me.  Can I ask you to give me my written 

        14        statement and my companion here would assist me in 

        15        showing you that that statement does not appear there.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.

        17   MR. FLEMING:  I would be delighted if they produce the 

        18        original, otherwise we have copies of it, Your Honours. 

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, the witness has asked for a 

        20        copy of his statement --

        21   MR. FLEMING:  Of course, I am finding one for him.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  He is entitled to one.  We just want to be 

        23        sure of the answer given by the witness.  Is he saying 

        24        that the portion read out and which he has been asked to 

        25        say whether it is correct or not, oh, whether he said 

        26        those words or not; what is the answer of the witness?  

        27        That he never said those words?  Is that the answer?

        28   MR. FLEMING:  That was his answer, Your Honour.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.

        30   THE WITNESS:  When -- the section read out is not the same as 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        what appears on the statement.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  Do you have the Kinyarwanda --

         3   MR. FLEMING:  I can hand him the original statement that he 

         4        signed, Your Honour, it bears his signature.

         5   BY MR. FLEMING:  Now, witness, let's do this carefully.  

         6        Let's go to the back page, please.  That is your 

         7        signature there isn't it, on the back page?

         8   A.   Yes, I can see my signature here.  In fact, I signed in 

         9        two places.

        10   Q.   And that was after that statement was read back to you 

        11        and you signed it acknowledging that that is what you 

        12        said; isn't that the case?

        13   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        14   Q.   Would you go to the second page, please, it is the page 

        15        with the number 2013 at the top right-hand corner.  

        16        Could I just have a look at that for a moment?  There 

        17        are, apparently, two sets of numberings, copies that we 

        18        have here have both 2013 and 2023 on them.  Okay, okay.  

        19        We were given two copies of the same thing by the 

        20        registry which were numbered consecutively, so if I can 

        21        get this right. 

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, I don't have the document that 

        23        they are showing to the witness.  I assume that it is 

        24        the same document that we have.  I have no documents 

        25        that have any numbers on the pages, but I am just 

        26        assuming it is an internal matter in the Prosecutor's 

        27        office the way they document their records.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  You can compare the notes if you will, you 

        29        have the document as well?

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Oh, yes, I have it, but I am just assuming

         1        that when he says it is -- to turn to the second page 

         2        with the pseudo number, it is the second page of the 

         3        handwritten document.  I am assuming that we are dealing 

         4        with the same thing, Your Honour.

         5   MR. FLEMING:  Yes, I did ask my learned friend to produce the 

         6        original but he won't just do it.  So, we are producing 

         7        copies.  And what we have is, in fact, the material that 

         8        was provided by him numbered by the registry, and no 

         9        doubt he has a copy of it as well.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, we have the original, and as 

        11        you recall, the original was given to the witness when 

        12        the witness began.  And the witness -- I took the 

        13        process of trying to correct two dates -- two times that 

        14        the witness told us were incorrect.  The Court said, no, 

        15        let's not deal with it that way, take the documents back 

        16        from him.  We did.  The Prosecutor is certainly entitled 

        17        to the original if he wants the original.  The only 

        18        issue here is whether or not the document he has given 

        19        to the witness, is it really -- the only difference is 

        20        that they have now put some internal numbering for 

        21        administrative purposes.  It is the only issue here.

        22   MR. FLEMING:  For the third time I will ask for the original.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS:  This is just nonsense.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can he use the original?

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, here is the original.  He wants it, he 

        26        can have it.

        27   MR. FLEMING:  I am asking for it for the third time.

        28   BY MR. FLEMING:

        29   Q.   Witness, if you give me that back, and please now have a 

        30        look at this document which is the original.  Please get

         1        to page two, the second page of that original.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, I want us to be very careful 

         3        with respect to what is being read out here, and it may 

         4        reflect -- I mean there is the question of proximity 

         5        to -- there is a proximity issue here, I just want all 

         6        of to be careful about this.  I don't want us to be like 

         7        bulls in a china store.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  We take note of that.  We will see how 

         9        it develops.  If it goes beyond that we can always go 

        10        into closed session.

        11   BY MR. FLEMING:

        12   Q.   Are you now at the second page?

        13   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:  The witness says he notices 

        14        that the pages are not numbered.

        15   BY MR. FLEMING:

        16   Q.   It is quite an easy task to turn the page to the second 

        17        page.  If you like give it back to me and I will turn it 

        18        for you, please?

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  I think he understands.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Why the condensation?  This is a serious 

        21        matter we are dealing with.

        22   MR. FLEMING:  Yes, it is indeed.

        23   BY MR. FLEMING:  Now, have you got the second page of that 

        24        statement?

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Does the witness understand?  Okay.

        26   THE WITNESS:  Let me point out that I have before me a 

        27        document in English.  I don't know how to spell English, 

        28        I don't know how to write English.  I would ask you to 

        29        give me the original in Kinyarwanda, because when I was 

        30        making the amendments or corrections, I relied on the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        11



          KAJELIJELI                                     26 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        Kinyarwanda version and the one that I certified was in 

         2        Kinyarwanda not in English.  So, what I have before me 

         3        is in English, so I cannot even talk about anything 

         4        relying on the English version.

         5   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, can I ask for the production of 

         6        the original certified Kinyarwanda copies, Your Honour?

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, we have the translation of the 

         8        document that is in Kinyarwanda.  We have it in 

         9        Kinyarwandan, we have it in French, and we have the 

        10        original that is in English.  I think the Prosecutor has 

        11        been provided with it, printed in English, French -- not 

        12        in Kinyarwanda.  We have the Kinyarwandan here.  We used 

        13        the Kinyarwandan when we translated it, read and gave it 

        14        -- first we read the statement to the witness when I was 

        15        in Rwanda --

        16   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, can I interrupt learned counsel, 

        17        because he has started to give evidence, because I am 

        18        going to be cross-examining with effect to these 

        19        matters.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Well, fine, we can give you, Counsel, the 

        21        Kinyarwandan --

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  Just a minute, the English text that you have 

        23        before the witness, is also signed and verified by the 

        24        witness; is that so?

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That is correct, Your Honour.  The 

        26        Kinyarwandan text is not.  The Kinyarwandan text is not 

        27        signed, it is not certified.  The Kinyarwandan text was 

        28        read -- when it was given to the witness it was 

        29        translated from the English, but the witness has not 

        30        certified -- has not signed the Kinyarwandan, nor has he

         1        signed the french.  We simply translated into the two 

         2        working languages.  That is it.  It was originally taken 

         3        -- the witness was interviewed in English, was written, 

         4        he signed it after it was read back to him, we 

         5        subsequently translated it into two languages, and the 

         6        witness was then given a copy of the Kinyarwandan which 

         7        he went over and said that there were corrections in it, 

         8        and that is why he perhaps thinks it was certified or 

         9        something.

        10   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, what my learned friend has just 

        11        said, of course, contradicts what the witness said just 

        12        a moment ago in the witness box.  He said that he 

        13        certified the Kinyarwandan, and I then asked for the 

        14        certified Kinyarwandan version.  Now, apparently, my 

        15        learned friend is contradicting his witness in the 

        16        witness box, but we will leave that for addressing 

        17        subsequently.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

        19   BY MR. FLEMING:

        20   Q.   The fact is, witness, that you certified the English 

        21        version, didn't' you?

        22   A.   That is true.  I certified the statement taken down in 

        23        English, and I signed it.  I subsequently asked for a 

        24        translation into Kinyarwanda, and so I was given a 

        25        statement in Kinyarwanda, and I was given a copy of that 

        26        statement in Kinyarwanda.

        27   Q.   Do you have that copy with you here?

        28   A.   Since I didn't know that questions were going to be put 

        29        to me with respect to that statement, I did not bring it 

        30        with me.  But, if it is necessary I can get it, because

         1        I have it at the home where I am staying here.

         2   Q.   Your Honour, I don't know why it is so hard to get 

         3        copies of documents.  I asked for the Kinyarwanda, my 

         4        learned friend stood up and addressed you at great 

         5        length on the document in Kinyarwanda.  We still don't 

         6        have the version of the Kinyarwanda document, we still 

         7        don't have it.  May we have one, for the second time?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, I said that we had a copy -- I 

         9        mean, we should not be playing games here.  If Counsel 

        10        wants a copy of the Kinyarwandan, it is here, please.

        11   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, twice, I have asked.  It is not me 

        12        playing games, with the greatest respect.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Here it is.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can you hand that document to the Prosecutor?

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Absolutely.  Should I walk over and give it 

        16        to him?

        17   MR. PRESIDENT:  No.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Please.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I have indicated we have it here.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right, Counsel, we will proceed.

        22   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you.

        23   BY MR. FLEMING:  Witness, look at this document, please?  

        24        This is Kinyarwanda document at the top it says, RHU23.  

        25        It then has the date all in typed form, 23/9/2001.  I 

        26        have put an X on the side of that document.  Please read 

        27        from that X down to the end of that paragraph.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, I don't know what he has put 

        29        before that witness and what the X designates.  Can we 

        30        see the document and where he has put his X, please?

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, you can show the document to Counsel.  

         2        You can switch off the microphone when you are 

         3        consulting, Counsel, if you wish.

         4        

         5        Is it all right?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Is the witness to read it to himself, 

         7        because again, we have the same concern.  Is the witness 

         8        to read it to himself, because, again we have the same 

         9        concern.  Is the witness to read it to himself and then 

        10        answer the question or a question will be put to him and 

        11        then he will read it aloud?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  It depends on the content of the area.  But I 

        13        think -- Counsel, I think you want it to be read out?

        14   MR. FLEMING:  Yes, Your Honour, I want it read into the 

        15        transcript.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  You want it read into the record.

        17   MR. FLEMING:  And it means then, that perhaps then, if my 

        18        learned friend is so concerned about it, I think we 

        19        should go in closed session for a period.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour I have raised this issue, okay, 

        21        the statement -- the portion that the Prosecutor wants 

        22        read places proximity, I have said several times.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT:  We don't have the document.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS:  The Prosecutor has it.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay, for the fear of the identity of the 

        26        witness, we will go into closed session for a short 

        27        while to deal with this aspect of the cross-examination.  

        28        Registry can that be done?

        29   MR. KIYEYEU:  Yes, My Lord we are in the process.

        30   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, my learned friend said that the

         1        prosecutor has the document, we don't have the 

         2        documents.  The Kinyarwanda document which my learned 

         3        friend just provided to us which I have given back to 

         4        the witness which he has just read.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS:  He knows the content, he may not be 

         6        concerned about the safety of this witness, but we are. 

         7   MR. FLEMING:  With respect, I was the one who asked that we 

         8        go into closed session before you stood to your feet.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes counsel.

         2   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honours.  So, when you were 

         3        speaking with those who interviewed you, you told them 

         4        what you knew about the incidents; didn't you?

         5   A.   That is correct.

         6   Q.   They recorded what you said and you signed it as 

         7        correct; didn't you?

         8   A.   The document in Kinyarwanda, that is, my statement, is 

         9        acceptable, and it is reflective of what I said, sir.

        10   Q.   You didn't tell them that you saw anything as a result 

        11        of those explosions, did you?

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour.  What explosions 

        13        are we talking about.  Can he please -- we are dealing 

        14        with two locations, so I don't know what explosions he 

        15        is talking about in terms of explosions.  I think he 

        16        should be explicit with respect to the place he is 

        17        talking about.

        18   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honours, for the last 15 minutes we have 

        19        been on one locality.  I shall read the statement to 

        20        him, again, which he has just verified, if he wishes.

        21   BY MR. FLEMING:

        22   Q.   But you did not tell the people who took the statement 

        23        from you that you saw anything in Rudatinya's locality, 

        24        did you?

        25   A.   Well, let me come back to what I said to you yesterday.  

        26        I have the impression that you find it difficult to 

        27        understand Kinyarwanda.  I said that on my way I saw 

        28        houses burning at around one kilometer.  Now, I don't 

        29        know why you are still asking me questions on that 

        30        issue, while as I have already said that to you.  I said

         1        to you that over one kilometer you have a bird's 

         2        eye-view and you can see what was happening from my 

         3        house.  I saw houses burning and I heard explosions, 

         4        sir.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  Listen to counsel's questions.  Yes, that may 

         6        be so but can you listen to the question put to you by 

         7        counsel and see what answer you can give.

         8   BY MR. FLEMING:

         9   Q.   Witness, you have told this Court, that you have 

        10        described to the Defence counsel and the people who 

        11        interviewed you, that you told them what you knew about 

        12        this incident, and let me read to you again what you 

        13        said.  Again, I read from your statement.  "As I  was 

        14        travelling, I heard behind me guns and explosions, and I 

        15        went immediately home".  That is what you told counsel 

        16        about this incident; didn't you, when they took the 

        17        statement?

        18   A.   That is correct.

        19   Q.   You did not tell them, did you, that you saw the houses 

        20        burning?

        21   A.   No, I didn't tell them so.  But Prosecutor, yesterday 

        22        you asked me the number of victims that fell in Busogo.  

        23        I gave you the number, and even now I am quite ready to 

        24        give you the number.  But Defence investigators did not 

        25        ask me that question.

        26   Q.   Did you ever tell Defence counsel that you saw houses 

        27        burning?

        28   A.   Prosecutor, can I say to you that I was witness to 

        29        various things.  I cannot forget the events to which I 

        30        bore witness.  When the investigators of the Defence 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        26



          KAJELIJELI                                     26 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        came to see me.  I met them on the road, they didn't 

         2        find me at my home.  We didn't have enough time to talk 

         3        about all these things.  I think on the whole we spent 

         4        one and half hours.  And if I had to tell you all that I 

         5        know about these events it would take an entire day.

         6   Q.   Witness, let's go over this carefully again, and please 

         7        answer the question.  Have you ever told Defence 

         8        counsel, Defence investigators, that you saw houses 

         9        burning?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection.  Your Honour this has been asked 

        11        and answered.  The witness, in fact, had said just 

        12        before he explained it, he said I did not say that.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT:  He hasn't said that, he has given 

        14        explanation.  We take note of the explanation.  Can he 

        15        -- I don't know, would it be possible to -- continue.

        16   THE WITNESS:  I want to tell you that I didn't have enough 

        17        time to talk to them about all those things, even here 

        18        before the Court, I won't be able to talk about all the 

        19        events which I experienced or witnessed.  There are 

        20        certain things that you asked me, or often there were 

        21        certain things that you didn't put questions to me 

        22        about.  So, I was witness to a number of events in 

        23        Rwanda.  I was witness to the wars in Rwanda.  And I 

        24        myself personally as you see me here I am a survivor, 

        25        because in Rwanda the Hutus and Tutsis were killed.  I 

        26        went on exile, and I went back home from exile, I know a 

        27        lot of things regarding the events that took place in 

        28        Rwanda, so much so that I would be able the write a 

        29        voluminous book all about the events.  Let me conclude 

        30        by saying that I did not spend enough time with the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        27



          KAJELIJELI                                     26 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        investigators of Defence, so that I would be able to 

         2        tell them all the things that took place in Rwanda.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, I know that you can give an account, and 

         4        that may be your account.  Now, could you, please, 

         5        answer the question and it might help us to move 

         6        forward.  And we think you can understand and answer 

         7        questions.

         8        

         9        Counsel wants to know; did you tell the Defence team -- 

        10        the Defence lawyers, or the investigators, whether or 

        11        not you saw houses burning.  That's the question.

        12   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, it is at any time, not only at the 

        13        beginning, and he is concentrating at the beginning.  I 

        14        broaden the time; at any time.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  What answer do you give to that question?

        16   THE WITNESS:  I did not say to the investigators of the 

        17        Defence that I saw houses burning.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  That was the answer that was expected.  

        19        Either yes, or no.  Not the whole story that you might 

        20        have.  Can you stick to that, please.  Okay?  Thank you.  

        21        Counsel.

        22   BY MR. FLEMING:

        23   Q.   So, the first time that that proposition was mentioned 

        24        was here in Court yesterday; is that right?

        25   A.   That is correct.

        26   Q.   Witness, you went home yesterday to talk about the 

        27        evening of the 7th of April, going back to a ISAE, do 

        28        you remember talking about that?

        29   A.   Yes, I remember having made reference to that.

        30   Q.   Had you told Defence counsel or Defence investigators 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        28



          KAJELIJELI                                     26 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        about that before yesterday?

         2   A.   I do not remember having made mention in my discussions 

         3        with the investigators of the Defence or Counsel for the 

         4        Defence.  If they had put questions to me in that 

         5        respect, I must have talked to them about it, but if no 

         6        questions were put to me in that regard, I made no 

         7        mention of it.

         8   Q.   You didn't make mention of it in your statement then, 

         9        did you?

        10   A.   Before I answer that question, maybe I start by reading 

        11        this statement -- looking through this statement.  If it 

        12        does not appear in this statement that means I made no 

        13        mention of it.

        14   Q.   I doesn't appear, so, therefore, we assume that you made 

        15        no mention about it; is that right?

        16   A.   That is correct.

        17   Q.   You remember yesterday you went home to talk about the 

        18        8th of April and the events -- and some events of the 

        19        8th of April.  Do you recall talking about that in your 

        20        evidence yesterday?

        21   A.   Yes, I remember.

        22   Q.   Had you discussed that matter with Defence counsel or 

        23        Defence investigators before yesterday?

        24   A.   I didn't have enough time to tell them all that I knew 

        25        of.

        26   Q.   Had you ever discussed that issue before yesterday with 

        27        Defence investigators or Defence Counsel?

        28   A.   I remember that we did not talk about this matter.

        29   Q.   So, the first time that they heard about it was 

        30        yesterday when you raised it in Court; is that what you

         1        are saying?

         2   A.   There are certain matters which counsel for the Defence 

         3        heard for the first time before the Court.  There were 

         4        some other things that I told them that do not appear in 

         5        my written statement.  So, I may talk about a particular 

         6        event at some or at some other point in time.

         7   Q.   Sir, would you answer the question, please.  Was 

         8        yesterday in Court the first occasion when Defence 

         9        Counsel or Defence investigators heard of the incidence 

        10        about which you spoke in Court of the 8th of April 1994?

        11   A.   No, I think I told them something about the day of the 

        12        8th of April.

        13   Q.   When do you think you told them something about the day 

        14        of the 8th of April?

        15   A.   I informed them of some events that occurred while we 

        16        were in Rwanda.  I talked about some of the events that 

        17        occurred on the 8th of April.  And when I got here they 

        18        showed me my written statement for me to check, and that 

        19        time again I made mention of some events.  This is just 

        20        to tell you that I met them on two occasions when we 

        21        were in Rwanda.  But since we didn't have enough time to 

        22        put down all that I had to say, I asked them to indicate 

        23        in summarised form what I said.  It was when I got here 

        24        that I had the opportunity to talk to them again about 

        25        some events that occurred on the 8th.

        26   Q.   And when was it that you spoke with them about the 

        27        events that occurred on the 8th?

        28   A.   I remember that we met on the 23rd of September 2001, I 

        29        think it was in the evening, and on that day I talked to  

        30        them about the events we are referring to here.  When

         1        they showed me my statement for me to check, I again 

         2        repeated those same events.  That stated, it is 

         3        difficult for me to remember the dates here in Arusha 

         4        because we are locked up -- and where we are locked up 

         5        it is difficult to remember the days and the dates.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel.

         7   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.

         8   BY MR. FLEMING:

         9   Q.   Are you now telling us that you discussed the events of 

        10        the 8th of April on the 23rd of September 2001?

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour.  That is not what 

        12        the witness has said.  The witness said he discussed it 

        13        when he got here in Rwanda (sic).  The witness said he, 

        14        in fact, discussed that when he got here in Rwanda(sic).

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  In Rwanda or in Arusha?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I am sorry, in Arusha.  That is what he 

        17        said.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  No, that's not very clear, Counsel.  There is 

        19        no definite position, yes.

        20   BY MR. FLEMING:

        21   Q.   Are you now saying that you did not discuss the events 

        22        of the 8th of April 1994 when you met with investigators 

        23        and counsel in Rwanda on the 23rd September 2001?

        24   A.   As I told you, he put a lot of questions to me on that 

        25        occasion, but since I didn't have enough time, I said he 

        26        should take it down as it were, shorthand, and when I 

        27        got here when I was shown the statement we did discuss 

        28        this matter again.

        29   Q.   Sir, it is a simple proposition.  Did you, or did you 

        30        not talk about the events of the 8th of April when they

          KAJELIJELI                                     26 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        visited you in September 2001?

         2   A.   Thank you, Prosecutor.  You showed me the statement for 

         3        me to check on what I said on all the statements I made 

         4        on that occasion.  What does not appear in that 

         5        statement may have been said by myself but was not duly 

         6        noted.  Now, I am sure you have not finished the 

         7        questions that you want to put to me.  Clearly there are 

         8        some matters on which you have not put questions to me.

         9   Q.   Witness, you still haven't answered that question.  Did 

        10        you or did you not discuss the events of the 8th of 

        11        April 1994 with Defence counsel, with Defence 

        12        investigators when they saw you in September of 2001?

        13   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can you translate slowly that question, again 

        14        and for the witness to understand and answer it 

        15        accordingly, we want to move forward.

        16   A.   In actual fact I am telling you that I do not remember 

        17        all the events I talked about when I met them.  What I 

        18        can tell you is that when we had to meet I was in a 

        19        hurry, and I asked them to put down, in a few words, 

        20        what I said since I was in a hurry.  But when I got here 

        21        in Arusha, we met, he showed me my written statement and 

        22        at that time he asked me whether I knew something about 

        23        of happened on the 8th of April 1994 and I said that I 

        24        knew what had happened on that day, and we had an 

        25        opportunity to talk about it.

        26   Q.   Thank you.

        27   MR. FLEMING:  It is an appropriate time to take the break, 

        28        Your Honour?

        29   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  How long do you still have to go?

        30   MR. FLEMING:  I don't want to be too much longer, Your

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  All right.  We will take a break for

         4        eleven.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  The proceedings are resumed.  We 

         3        continue with the cross-examination of the witness.  

         4        Mr. Fleming, and we are in open session.

         5        

         6        Yes, Mr. Fleming.

         7   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

         8   BY MR. FLEMING:

         9   Q.   Witness, this morning in response to one question, you 

        10        told us that yesterday you described how you saw the 

        11        houses burning.  And you said -- yesterday, you said 

        12        that you were one kilometre away.  Now, do you remember 

        13        saying that first, this morning?

        14   A.   I did not say that I was one kilometre away.  I said 

        15        even at one kilometre away, one could see what was 

        16        happening.  From my house, I could observe what was 

        17        happening at that location because I had an oversight 

        18        over that expanse.

        19   Q.   So, when we were talking about the events --

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21        Your Honour, Your Honour, we all have a responsibility 

        22        to protect this witness, not just me.  

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: No, it's exactly -- my god.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Let me put it on the record, please.  The 

        25        Prosecutor knows what area he is going into.  We all 

        26        have a responsibility here.  The witness now is trying 

        27        to testify as honestly as he can, which may, in fact, 

        28        imperil him.  We can't all be sitting like logs on a -- 

        29        like nuts on a log and let him do that.

        30   MR. FLEMING: I'm not quite sure what my learned friend is

         1        taking about.  I asked the -- 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: I'm objecting, Counsel, to the witness 

         3        making a statement which very well could imperil him.

         4   MR. FLEMING: Oh, you mean a statement which doesn't answer 

         5        the question?

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Wait a minute.  Professor, sit down.   

         7        Professor Hinds, we took note of your observation, but 

         8        by your observation, we were trying to find a way of 

         9        dealing with that situation, because in doing what you 

        10        are doing you are not helping.  We'll go in closed 

        11        session and be able to explain exactly what we mean.  

        12        Okay.  We'll go in closed session.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Are we there?

        14   MR. KIYEYEU: Not yet, My Lord, we are just evacuating some.  

        15        Now, we are ready, My Lord.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: We are in open session now.

         2   MR. FLEMING: Forgive me Your Honours, if I do not see nor 

         3        understand the rising of the raised finger.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  That is why we say normally you can follow it 

         5        by raising the issue that the matter concerning the 

         6        identity of the witness that should be discussed in 

         7        closed session.

         8   MR. FLEMING:  The moment I see my learned friend rise, I will 

         9        sit down.  Witness --

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe it might be for something else other 

        11        than that.

        12   MR. FLEMING:  I will still sit down, Your Honour.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.

        14   BY MR. FLEMING:

        15   Q.   Witness, I want you to go, please, back to Nkuli where 

        16        you were on the morning of the 7th of April.  You 

        17        remember you told this to us, that you cycled past the 

        18        place where 

        19        Mr. Kajelijeli's compound is; do you remember that?  You 

        20        were on the main Gisenyi highway -- I am sorry.

        21   A.   I remember telling you that I went close to Nkuli 

        22        commune office and the commune office is close to 

        23        Kajelijeli's house.

        24   Q.   You were on the road, weren't you, the main 

        25        Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road?

        26   A.   That's correct.

        27   Q.   And from the road to Kajelijeli's compound, it is about 

        28        two and fifty metres, isn't it?

        29   A.   That is an approximation.  It is between 200 and 300 

        30        metres.  It may be less than that.  You know yourself

         1        where the commune office is and Kajelijeli's compound is 

         2        next to the commune office.

         3   Q.   Please, sir, there is no need to add what I know or do 

         4        not know.  It is you who is answering the question.  

         5        Now, you say his gate was open, the gate to his 

         6        compound; is that right?

         7   A.   That's correct.

         8   Q.   And you say you identified his car there.  How did you 

         9        identify the car?

        10   A.   His vehicle was parked in front of the door and it was 

        11        between the two houses because he had two houses on that 

        12        compound.

        13   Q.   So, how didn't -- identify it if it was his car?  Please 

        14        tell me that.

        15   A.   I was used to the vehicle, I could recognise it whether 

        16        I was far away or close by because I could see him carry 

        17        wood or food products for students from where he was 

        18        working at the STB.

        19   Q.   So did you recognise the letters STD on the side of the 

        20        vehicle?

        21   A.   Prosecutor, it was not easy to read these letters from 

        22        where I was.  However, one could read those letters if 

        23        one is opposite the gate because the letters were also  

        24        on the gate, but I am saying that I was able recognise 

        25        that car because I was used to seeing it.

        26   Q.   So your evidence of identification is that you were used 

        27        to that car and you saw it from between 200 and 300  

        28        metres away; that is your evidence of identification?

        29   A.   You know, for us drivers, even if a car is 500 metres 

        30        away and one is familiar with this car, one would be in

         1        a position to recognise it.

         2   Q.   You only saw the back of the vehicle, didn't you?

         3   A.   The vehicle was visible except on the side.

         4   Q.   Were you looking at it from the rear?

         5   A.   I was able to see the car.  I was used to seeing the car 

         6        from outside, but I was not able to see the inside of 

         7        the car.

         8   Q.   Were you observing the car from the rear of the car?

         9   A.   Well, I don't know what you want to look for.  When you 

        10        say "rear", did you say "rear" comparing to the front, 

        11        or   what do you mean, sir?

        12   Q.   Precisely?

        13   A.   What I do recall, sir, is that I saw the car.  In the 

        14        compound, however, I do not know its position nor 

        15        whether the car is turned this way or that way.  

        16        However, what I do know is that I was not able to see 

        17        the sideways of the  vehicle.

        18   Q.   Thank you, Witness.  Now I want to take you back to some 

        19        of the things you have said in evidence-in-chief about 

        20        the young people that you identified.  First, around 

        21        about 8 o'clock you said you decided to go home from the 

        22        ISAE because you couldn't work.  Now, that is the time 

        23        and that is what you did, isn't it?

        24   A.   I do recall what I said.  Yes, I said around 8:00.

        25   Q.   Now, you didn't have a conversation with anybody around 

        26        you, did you?

        27   A.   I decided to return to my house whilst I was close to 

        28        two soldiers who were found at the entrance.  Now, I 

        29        decided to go home when I saw that some young people  

        30        were crying and screaming towards me and let me add that

         1        the soldiers were talking about the death of the 

         2        president.

         3   Q.   Sir, you say you saw those young people as you have just 

         4        said again, screaming, you were frightened, weren't you, 

         5        and ran away from them to get home; isn't that right?

         6   A.   Yes, because I did not want these young people to meet 

         7        me at that place, at that particular point.

         8   Q.   You described these young people as displaced people, 

         9        don't you?

        10   A.   Yes, these were displaced young people.  However, it is   

        11        also possible that these young people had originated 

        12        from that area.

        13   Q.   Yes, you had young people who could well have come from 

        14        Byangabo there, couldn't you?

        15   A.   Yes, that's correct, sir.

        16   Q.   So, now, there might have been a combination of 

        17        displaced people and also some of the local people in 

        18        this group who were screaming; is that right?

        19   A.   Yes, that's correct, sir.

        20   Q.   And these are some local young people who might have or 

        21        might not have belonged to a political party?

        22   A.   Yes, that's correct.

        23   Q.   And these young men were armed, weren't they?

        24   A.   If they were armed, they would be armed with traditional 

        25        weapons, but I just saw cudgels.

        26   Q.   Sir, so let's at the Busogo parish, a large number of 

        27        people were murdered and you said you heard gunshots and 

        28        explosions.  I am suggesting to you, sir, that these 

        29        people were armed with more than traditional weapons, 

        30        but rather they had firearms with them.

         1   A.   That incident, I will never forget, Prosecutor, because 

         2        that incident made me sad, and let me add that I saw 

         3        guns but that gun was held by Nzabendora and his 

         4        companion. So when I saw these young men for the second 

         5        time, they were still with the same soldiers and it is 

         6        they whomever following the soldiers.  The soldiers were 

         7        in front of  them.

         8   MR. KIYEYEU:  I am sorry, My Lords.  I don't know whether 

         9        that name has been pronounced before, Nzabendora.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT:  Can you spell it?  It may have, I mean, been 

        11        pronounced before.  That, again, for avoidance of doubt, 

        12        it can be spelt out.

        13   MR. KEYEYEU: All right, My Lords.

        14   THE WITNESS: Let me spell Nzabendora, N-Z-A-B-E-N-D-O-R-A, 

        15        Nzbendora.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        17   MR. FLEMING: Is Your Honour going to take a mid-afternoon 

        18        break?  If you are, that would be -- if you are, I won't 

        19        be too much longer.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: We heard that yesterday.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: How much is too much longer, any idea, 

        22        Mr. Fleming?

        23   BY MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, the problem is, I ask one line 

        24        question and get a half page answer.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: In your estimation?

        26   MR. FLEMING: In my estimation, about half an hour.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Oh, then in that case we have to take a break 

        28        and, Professor Hinds, the Defence, do you have an idea 

        29        of your re-examination thereafter?

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't know.  I was thinking of half an

         1        hour at the most.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: In terms of re-examination, but you know, I 

         4        know this Court does not want any down time, but in 

         5        fairness to next witness who is sitting down, what is 

         6        your pleasure?

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: I think we can't take that witness today.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: We can or we cannot?

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  We cannot because -- but we would like to see 

        10        if possible the completion of the testimony of this 

        11        witness?

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: This one?

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Right.  So will adjourn for fifteen 

        14        minutes and come back at 16:15, because of the time 

        15        constraints we have.  

        16        Until then, these proceedings stand adjourned.

        17             (Court recessed at 1600H) 

        18             (Court resumed at 1615H)

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are resumed.  Mr. Fleming, 

        20        could you continue your cross-examination of the witness 

        21        please?  Yes, Counsel?

        22   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.

        23   BY MR. FLEMING: 

        24   Q.   Witness, I suggest to you that the attack on the Tutsis 

        25        at the Rwankeli cellule, Busogo secteur, at Rusizaga's 

        26        locality was not an attack at all by a group of lawless 

        27        youths, that it was, rather, an orchestrated attack 

        28        where people were armed with both traditional weapons 

        29        and also rifles.  What do you say to that suggestion?

        30   A.   That's correct.

         1   Q.   So I suggest to you that the attack at the Busogo parish 

         2        was also well ochestrated and not just with a group of 

         3        lawless youths with youths who were armed both with 

         4        traditional weapons and with rifles; what do you say to 

         5        that suggestion?

         6   A.   You will forgive me, but I will not find the exact word 

         7        in Kinyarwanda which one refers to one's personal life, 

         8        and I therefore would not like to speak about such 

         9        personal matters, and so I would not be able to say 

        10        whether these young people participated on ochestrated 

        11        movement because I would not know who had ochestrated 

        12        the movement.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: I don't know whether that is how the question 

        14        is fully understood.  Could you rephrase it?

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the witness has said he does 

        16        not know who would have ochestrated it.  I mean, the 

        17        suggestion is made who ochestrated it.  And he is -- I 

        18        mean his answer is very clear.  He does not know who 

        19        could have ochestrated it.

        20   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, I didn't ask who ochestrated it, I 

        21        can ask the question again.

        22   BY MR. FLEMING: 

        23   Q.   Witness, the question is this:  He attack on the Busogo 

        24        parish was effective and ochestrated I am not asking you 

        25        to speculate by whom.  It might have been ochestrated, 

        26        but it was ochestrated in that there were young people 

        27        there who were armed by rifles and traditional weapons; 

        28        isn't that the case?

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  He is now asking 

        30        him to speculate as to the orchestration.  There is no

         1        foundation as laid to that in terms of whether or not 

         2        there was an orchestration.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: I think, Counsel, he can answer that question 

         4        as he understands it.

         5   THE WITNESS: I will not be able to say whether the attack had 

         6        been ochestrated or not but I do that the attackers were 

         7        carrying weapons.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         9   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        10   BY MR. FLEMING:  

        11   Q.   Witness, the attack was both very efficient and deadly, 

        12        wasn't it?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  What does he mean 

        14        by "efficient"?

        15   MR. FLEMING: Well, I can fill that for my learned friend.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Not for me.  Don't be making assumptions.

        17   MR. FLEMING: Assumptions, being it was for you for the 

        18        witness.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: The assumptions for counsel.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: The witness has not said that counsel does not 

        21        understand the question, unless you want to say that you 

        22        may be in a better position to answer that question.  If 

        23        he says he does not understand that question, then he 

        24        will ask counsel and I think that is the procedure.  And 

        25        if you remember in our directions at the beginning of 

        26        the evidence of each every witness, we tell them in case 

        27        one does not understand the question, he can say so and 

        28        it can be repeated or explained.  Can that question be 

        29        answered, please?

        30   THE WITNESS: Yes, the attack was quite strong because it took

         1        human life.

         2   BY MR. FLEMING:  

         3   Q.   Witness, I just want to give a summary of your evidence.  

         4        This is what you say your evidence is:  In the course of 

         5        your travels that morning you went past Byangabo fairly 

         6        early in the morning and you didn't see Kajelijeli 

         7        there.  

         8   A.   That is correct.

         9   Q.   Then you went past his compound at Nkuli and you saw his 

        10        car there.

        11   A.   That's correct.

        12   Q.   Then you saw events occur at Rusizaga's location -- I am 

        13        sorry, I got the wrong point.  And you saw the place 

        14        where the Tutsis were killed in Rwankeli cellule in 

        15        Busogo secteur at Rudatinya's locality?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  That was not the 

        17        sequence of the events.  The witness went to Byangabo 

        18        and then Nkuli and then in front of the institution.  

        19        That was not the sequence of the events.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Is counsel asking about sequence?

        21   MR. FLEMING: No, Your Honours.  I am asking are the -- are 

        22        these the summary of some of his evidence?

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: But he is putting them in a particular 

        24        framework.  The witness testified with respect to a 

        25        sequence on his way to the men's factory and from the 

        26        men's factory and it is in that context that he says he 

        27        made certain statements.  He has put it in out of 

        28        sequence and I don't want the witness to be, in fact, 

        29        confused by that -- by that stand point.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Can we have the question?  Can we hear the

         1        question please, counsel?

         2   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         3   Q.   You were, Witness, weren't you, a witness to what 

         4        occurred at the residence of the Tutsis in Rwankeli  

         5        cellule, in secteur, at Rusizaga's locality?

         6   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Could counsel repeat the question 

         7        slowly please?

         8   THE WITNESS: That's correct.

         9   BY MR. FLEMING:

        10   Q.   And did you see Kajelijeli there?

        11   A.   I did not see him.

        12   Q.   I take it you understood him when I said this in 

        13        English, didn't you?

        14   A.   I am sorry, I heard the voice of interpreter from the 

        15        French booth through my headphones.  That is why I 

        16        answered the question immediately before the interpreter 

        17        siting next to me had interpreted what had been said and 

        18        therefore apologised because I do understand French.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Oh, that speeds up matters.  So there is no 

        20        need to apologise.

        21   BY MR. FLEMING:

        22   Q.   And then, Witness, you witnessed some events in Busogo 

        23        parish and you didn't see Kajelijeli there.

        24   A.   That's correct.

        25   Q.   And then, Witness, you went back to ISAE that evening 

        26        and you didn't see Kajelijeli there.

        27   A.   That's absolutely true.

        28   Q.   And then, Witness, when you were looking at bodies the 

        29        following day you didn't see Kajelijeli there.

        30   A.   Absolutely true.

         1   Q.   So, Witness, it comes down to this, you saw or you 

         2        happened to be over in two days in every place or most 

         3        places where we say Kajelijeli was, at the same time we 

         4        say Kajelijeli was there, it's just pure coincidence, is 

         5        it?

         6   A.   That's correct.

         7   Q.   And you happened to be in the one place where Defence 

         8        say Kajelijeli was that morning.  That was coincidence 

         9        too, was it?

        10   A.   That's true. 

        11   Q.   By sheer coincidence you happened to be in precisely the 

        12        same places, in precisely the time that Defence say he 

        13        was and also precisely the time and precisely the places 

        14        we say he was and that all of that is pure coincidence, 

        15        is it?

        16   A.   In truth this was in coincidence and I did not know that 

        17        I was going to testify about these events.

        18   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Witness.  Thank you, Your Honour.  

        19        That is the end of the cross-examination.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Re-examination, 

        21        Professor Hinds?

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honours.  

        23                         RE-EXAMINATION 

        24   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        25   Q.   Witness, I noticed when you came in the Court today you 

        26        had black zipped bag.  What did you bring in that bag?

        27   A.   I would like to say that the only things that were in 

        28        the bag were a book that has the word of God; in other 

        29        words, the Bible, and I thought that maybe I would be 

        30        writing, in which I was making notes of what was said in 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        89


                  KAJELIJELI                             26 SEPTEMBER 2002




         1        the statement, to see if it was said in the statement 

         2        that it was in conformity with what I have said.  It is 

         3        not true that I did not have a notebook with me and it 

         4        is true take I do have a notebook at home, but I did not 

         5        take it -- bring it with me today.  You will remember 

         6        that I asked you to give me a copy, of my statement and 

         7        you refused to give me a copy and it was only in the 

         8        notebook that I made notes to verify if the statement 

         9        was correct, but did not bring it with me this morning.

        10   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, I object to the answers.  First, 

        11        it doesn't arise out of cross-examination and, second, 

        12        if there is an allegation that he is an honest man 

        13        because he has his Bible this something akin to lifting 

        14        himself up by his own boot traps, and that if course is 

        15        something that someone is entitled to do in this court 

        16        to say,   I am an honest man and because I say I am an 

        17        honest man  because I read the Bible.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: We take note of that.  The Trial Chamber is 

        19        capable and will have the opportunity to look into all 

        20        these matters touching on all aspects of the witness, 

        21        including this witness, as to credibility what it is?

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Thank you, Your Honour. 

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: It is a good thing this trial is not conducted 

        24        with the assistance of juries and assessors.  We should 

        25        be able to handle it but of course the proceedings must 

        26        be done in accordance with the rules as well.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Correct, Your Honour. 

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   Sir, are the Gacaca trials scheduled in Rwanda ?

        30   THE INTERPRETER: MR. President, the witness had shown me the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        90

         1        book that is in front of him.  I think he wanted to 

         2        specify or add additional details about, the book if you 

         3        wish him to speak on the matter.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: There is no question before the witness 

         6        except the one --

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Are the Gacaca trials scheduled in Rwanda?

        10   A.   Yes, that is true.  The Gacaca trials are to take place 

        11        in Rwanda and they have actually begun.

        12   Q.   Do you intend to testify at these trials?

        13   A.   I am very impatient to go and testify in these Gacaca 

        14        trials because I know a lot of what happened in our 

        15        country, and let me add that when I return to my country 

        16        if I find that in my cellule the Gacaca trials have 

        17        ended I would request to give testimony, I would request 

        18        for my testimony to be heard.

        19   MR. FLEMING: I continue to object in respect of this.  It 

        20        doesn't arise out of cross-examination and it is 

        21        precisely the same sort of allegation, "I am an honest 

        22        man because I am prepared to go back testify in Gacaca".

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this is a Prosecutor who 

        24        accuses this man of murder and he has the audacity to 

        25        stand up and say this man does not have a right to say 

        26        he is prepared to go back to Rwanda and face his 

        27        accusers.  How can he stand there and do this?

        28   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, I don't accuse the man of murder.  

        29        I put to --

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: You accused him of -- the murder of

         1        Mumyemvano.

         2   MR. KIYEYEU: I am sorry, My Lords.  I do intend to interfere 

         3        in those matters.  I think the Chamber was clear on that 

         4        point.  You may go too far.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel, what do you want to say? 

         6   MR. FLEMING:  I didn't accuse him of murder.  I put to him my 

         7        instructions.  I didn't accused him of murder at all.  

         8        My learned friend should understand the distinction 

         9        between putting instructions and my making accusations, 

        10        and he should understand what my role is as the 

        11        Prosecution.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS:  That is precisely the point I am 

        14        suggesting, that he is in fact abusing the discretion 

        15        and in the manner that I have raised and put in put in 

        16        record here on three or four occasions with respect to 

        17        this particular witness.  Now, the issue that we are 

        18        dealing with is a question I put to the witness with 

        19        respect to his testimony before local trials in Rwanda.  

        20        He says it is improper because it was not raised on 

        21        cross, and I am saying based upon what he put to the 

        22        witness, it is proper for this Tribunal to hear what 

        23        this witness with respect to any allegations back in 

        24        Rwanda, what he intends to do, and you can look at his 

        25        demeanour, and you as fact finders can make your own 

        26        determination, and it is a proper question.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: In our view in the light of what was said 

        28        before, I think this question can be answered by the 

        29        witness.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: It is not to be made an issue but in that 

         2        context.  Witness, go ahead.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Has the witness answered the question?

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: He has, he has.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Okay, now, Witness, in coming to this Tribunal, did you 

         7        receive from the Rwandan authorities a certification of  

         8        good conduct and manners?

         9   A.   That's correct, Counsel, my coming was issued with a 

        10        certificate of good conduct, life and manners, and in 

        11        Kigali all the documents, all the similar documents, 

        12        were given to me, and in Kigali I was also given a 

        13        Lazier passer, and let me state that all these documents 

        14        are in the bags and one of the Tribunal officials has 

        15        kept it.  So I do not know if you had the opportunity of 

        16        looking at this document.  I do not know whether you 

        17        will be making use of those in dues course.

        18   Q.   Sir, have you ever been arrested in your life in Rwanda.  

        19        Other than being arrested by Juvenal Kajelijeli?  Have 

        20        you ever been arrested?

        21   A.   No, I have never been arrested except from that man.

        22   Q.   Have you, sir,  ever been accused by anyone concerning  

        23        acts that were related to events of 1994?

        24   A.   Sorry, before responding to the question I would like to 

        25        know whether we are in closed session because my 

        26        response may have a bearing on my identity; it might  

        27        reveal my identity.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, I have no problem with that if 

        29        it is going into closed session.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  We don't see how -- what is your question,

         1        Counsel? 

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

         3   Q.   Have you ever been accused by anyone concerning the 

         4        events that occurred in 1994?

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't know what he is going to say whether 

         6        he is going to name someone, an accused, then whatever.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: We don't know what he could do, but we don't 

         8        know what answer he can give.  It is rather a general 

         9        question.  Registry?

        10   THE WITNESS: I have seen that somebody in the Court asked me 

        11        to stop.  That is the reason why I stopped.  That is the 

        12        reason why I stopped.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Unless it is something that has a bearing to 

        14        his identity then we can go to closed session, but if  

        15        he going to answer the question in general terms as 

        16        asked, and as we understand it, we do not know how you 

        17        will understand it, then it can be answered.

        18   THE WITNESS: Thank you, Mr. President.  Whether I respond in 

        19        a general manner or otherwise, all this will reveal my 

        20        identity whatever response I give, sir.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: We will go to closed session -- sorry to 

        22        members of the public -- for a short while to have this 

        23        question and any other subsequent answer of this kind of 

        24        bearing to be answered and come back to open session.
