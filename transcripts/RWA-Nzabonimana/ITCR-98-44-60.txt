MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order. We apologise.  We are late.  We had to finalise the deliberation on the motion that has been pending, which has a bearing on the testimony of the witness that should have testified this week.  

That having been said, can you please introduce the matter coming before the Trial Chamber this morning, registry?
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 7th of April 2003, for the continuation of the Defence case in the matter of the Prosecutor V Juvenal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registry.  May we have the appearance for the parties starting with the Prosecution for the record, please, this morning?
MS. OJEMENI:
With due respect, Your Honour, Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial attorney, appearing with Dorothy Marotine, case manager for the Prosecution.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  
May we also have the appearance of the Defence, please, for the record?
MR. HINDS:
Good morning, Your Honour.  Lennox Hinds representing Mr. Juvenal Kajelijeli; assisted by Professor Nkeyi Bompaka; and Mr. Emilien Dusabe, interpreter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  

Yes, the Trial Chamber will start off, first of all, by giving the oral decision on the two motions, that is the Prosecution's motion we had on the 26th of March 2003.  

Yes, oral ruling on expert testimony in Kajelijeli case.  

We'll start with the motion for extension.  On the 26th March 2003 the Prosecution filed a motion pursuant to Rules 54, 94bis seeking an extension of the time limits within which to file her notice to challenge the proposed expert report from a defence witness, Professor François X. Bangamwabo.  Attached to this request for an extension, the Prosecution filed a extensive motion challenging the expert report of Professor François X. Bangamwabo. 

Ruling:  The Chamber notes that this motion, seeking an extension, was filed three days out of the fourteen-day time prescribed under Rule 94bis(B).  

The Chamber has considered the reason advanced by the Prosecution and it is the opinion that it has not shown just cause for the extension sought, particularly as the request was not made in order to give the required notice under Rule 94bis (B)(i), (ii).  There are no time limits prescribed under the Rules within which to challenge the expert testimony of a witness.  Accordingly, the Chamber denies the Prosecution request. 

3.  Nevertheless, the Chamber recalls that under Rule 94bis (c) the Chamber has the discretion to admit or not into evidence the statement of an expert without calling him to testify in person.  

Motion to challenge the proposed expert report of Professor François X. Bangamwabo. 

4.  With regard to the motion to challenge the proposed expert report of Professor François X. Bangamwabo, the Chamber notes that the Prosecution brought the said motion pursuant to Rules 54, 89(c), and 94bis.  In arguing that Professor is not an expert, the Prosecution relied on the definition of an expert as defined in Black's Law Dictionary, as well as on the opinion of Trial Chamber I in the case of the Prosecutor v Akayesu in its decision on a defence motion for the appearance of an expert -- for the appearance of an accused as an expert witness of 9th March 1998. 

5.  In discounting the expertise of Professor François X. Bangamwabo the Prosecution argued that whereas the professor is a linguist, by education, as borne out in his curriculum vitae, the report the professor has submitted is filled with a historical and political analysis of Rwanda.  The Prosecution argues that although the knowledge of the linguist -- of linguistics is a vast domain in that the professor may analyse terms used by the Prosecutor in a contextual sense, i.e. such as terms as Interahamwe, Inkotanyi, Inyenzi, this does not make him an expert in history and politics. 

6.  The Prosecution further argues that in his report Professor François X. Bangamwabo is partial.  At the hearing Prosecution identifies what she considers glaring instances of partiality found within the report of the Professor, i.e. when at page 52 of the French text of the report he limits discussion of Interahamwe, Inkotanyi and Inyenzi to history and the dictionary meaning but does not interpret the use of these words in 1993 and 1994. 

7.  Furthermore, the Prosecution argued that parts of the report are irrelevant; for example, neither is a historical origin of Rwanda nor the myth of Kahigi dwelt upon in the indictment against the accused.  In objection to the Prosecution motion, the Defence draws the attention to the Chamber to the affidavit of Professor François X. Bangamwabo, signed on 31 March 2003, which indicates that linguistics is a vast domain.  The Defence indicated that the Professor, in addition to having taken courses in general and applied linguistics and African linguistics, he started at the graduate level, among others social linguistics, anthropology, and the history of Rwanda.  The Defence does not take issue with Prosecution's submissions with the definition of an expert as outlined in Akayesu and, in fact, argues that Professor François X. Bangamwabo does qualify to be called an expert within the meaning of this definition.

9.  The Defence argues that terms used by the Prosecution in this case, that is Interahamwe, Inkotanyi and Inyenzi, have been given a particular meaning by the Prosecution but that that these were not put in context.  The Defence argues that the political events that formed the events at the time when they were used have to be analysed and discussed by an expert such as Professor François Bangamwabo.  Because the professor is not a factual witness, he will inform the Chamber, based upon his opinion as a social linguist, about the attitude of the people at the time of the events. 

10.  Regarding Prosecution's submission that certain parts of the report are irrelevant, the Defence argues that in dealing with the events of 1994 a historical perspective is necessary, particularly as the Prosecutor's case is that genocide was planned and systematic.  

Regarding Prosecution's submission that the report is biased, the Defence argue that this is the Prosecution's view and that through cross-examination she can bear this out. 

11.  As a rejoinder, the Prosecution points out that the professor has never been an expert in any national or international court and, in fact, was a mere defence witness in the trial of Nahimana, Ngeze, Baragwiza, that disqualify him as an expert. 

And, 12, the Chamber has considered the submissions of the parties, as well as the report of Professor François X. Bangamwabo entitled "Interethnic Relations in Rwanda, The Armed Conflict of October 1990, March Party Politics and the Implication on the 1994 Events", filed in French on the 10th of March 2003. 

13.  The Chamber notes that there is no dispute that an expert is, following the definition in Black's Law Dictionary, "One whose testimony is intended to enlighten the judges on specific issues of a technical nature requiring special knowledge in a specific field."  And, as judge in Akayesu -- and as the Judges in Akayesu opined that this knowledge is obtained from either education or personal experience.  The Chamber notes that Trial Chamber III, in Prosecutor v Bagosora and others, indicated that it was not necessary for Dr. Des Forges to be trained as a human rights lawyer in order to qualify as an expert in human rights observations and breaches in Rwanda.  Trial Chamber III was persuaded that Dr. Des Forges' experience in the area of human rights in Rwanda qualified her to render an expert opinion in that field. 

The Chamber does not agree with the Prosecution that because Professor X. Bangamwabo was educated as a social linguist he cannot be an expert in history and politics. 

14.  In the instant case, the Chamber notes that not only does Professor François X. Bangamwabo explain his affidavit to have post-graduate training in area of history and politics in Rwanda but also as an intellectual, he explains that he has lived through the era which he talks about in his report. 

15.  Regarding allegations of partiality on the part of the proposed testimony and expert report, the Chamber notes that this is an issue that may be followed up in cross-examination.  In any case, the Chamber shall make an assessment, evaluation and determination of all the issues concerning this testimony. 

16.  Accordingly, the Chamber denies the Prosecution motion in its entirely and finds that Professor François X. Bangamwabo may testify as an expert witness in accordance with his report.  Part 1 through 94bis(c), the Chamber will allow the Prosecution to cross-examine the witness, if it so wishes.  

This is the oral ruling of the Trial Chamber in this matter.  

Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, a housekeeping matter before we proceed.  After Professor Bangamwabo testifies we intend to put on Mr. Kajelijeli.  This weekend the Prosecutor presented the Defence with copies -- well, originals of documents and items that were seized from Mr. Kajelijeli at the time of his arrest.  In addition to that, the Prosecutor provided us with a CD-ROM of all of the items that they had returned and also that they had kept in their custody.  We have not opened the CD-ROM and the Prosecutor today have informed us that they would make a copy of the CD-ROM for us, since the client has now had the one copy of the CD-ROM and Defence team requested a copy, and they have graciously indicated that they would provide it to us.  

Pursuant to Rule 66(b), since Mr. Kajelijeli intends to take the stand and we do not know whether or not the Prosecutor intends to use any of the items that were not returned, by way of cross-examining Mr. Kajelijeli, we don't know, but I just want to make the request, prior to putting Mr. Kajelijeli on the stand, that we are requesting any documents that the Prosecutor intends to use.  in fact, we should have got it way before now.  But on the eve of Mr. Kajelijeli taking the stand, if they intend to use any documents which they seized from him, for purposes of cross-examination, we are requesting, pursuant to Rule 66(b), that it be provided to us.  That is just by way of a housekeeping matter.  I don't know if they intend to do any of that.  If they tell us they don't intend to use it, then that is the end of the issue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Ojemeni, counsel for the Prosecution on this issue.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  Firstly, my colleague has just informed me that she didn't actually promise to make copies of the CD, because we already -- the whole essence is for them to have everything on the CD and I'm sure my learned friend can just print out what he has on the CD.  She -- when the Defence asked her if it's possible to get that done she said she will enquire, and there's just two of us on this case and, to facilitate matters, that's why we made the CD available to them, and everything is on the CD, so all they have to do is just print. 

Secondly, we also attached to the CD a list of all the documents that are on that CD or all the documents we seized from the Accused and we indicated the documents we are retaining, and those documents were from the Accused, so it presupposes -- we don't know what the Accused will be testifying on, but we've indicated to the Defence that we are keeping some documents.  So if, while testifying, and we consider that is necessary to use some of the documents we have in our possession to cross-examine him, we will bring it to the attention of the Defence at the close of the testimony. 

But we have -- all those documents that are retained are documents that we intend to cross-examine the Accused on and we've indicated and the Defence has all the copies of these documents.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, now --
MR. HINDS:
Now that we know that they intend to use these documents, it creates great prejudice to us.  We intend to put Mr. Kajelijeli on immediately.  We were given this list, we have a list of documents, we now have to study these documents, go over them with Mr. Kajelijeli before putting him on the stand. 

It is unfair for the Prosecutor, the weekend -- just the weekend before the witness is to go on the stand to give us this list and the documents on the CD-ROM.  We will print them out.  We indicated that we only have one copy of the CD-ROM, if they are not able to give us another copy.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, I think you can further study the situation, Counsel, and see all that -- we can invite the parties to try to do all they can to move forward, but if there are specific issues that need to be raised before the Trial Chamber, that can be done.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will have the next witness and, according to Professor Hinds, learned counsel for the Defence of Kajelijeli, you had indicated in your summary with regard to the testimony of this witness you need four days?
MR. HINDS:
That is my plan, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you can make it shorter, because we really want to move forward, if you can make it shorter that -- we'll have some time to look carefully at the report that this witness is going to talk about, and so we really like to invite both of you to see that we can move fast.
MR. HINDS:
We are going to do everything within our power to move it as expeditiously as possible.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  If you can make less of the time than you indicated, that would be much better, so you can deal with all the issues that may be developing in the course of this week so far as we go.
MR. HINDS:
All right. 

Your Honour, the Defence calls expert witness, FXB, as our next witness.  I understand he is with witness and victim protection, so I don't know where they have him.
MR. KIYEYEU:
It could be between witness (unintelligible), My Lord.  (Microphone off)
MR. PRESIDENT:
	What's the name?
MR. HINDS:
The pseudonym is FXB, but his actual name --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- is François Xavier Bangamwabo.  But, Your Honour, we are going to show him this document, have him sign it, then we are going to have that introduced.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Thanks.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, my learned colleague, when he is making references to the report, to move this proceeding forward, it would be advisable to have him refer to the correspondence part.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that might help us, particularly in both texts, so we can come back at a later stage.  Is it possible to do that, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
I am operating in English..
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So we are also operating in English, but you can use for reference, for the purposes of Judge Ramaroson, some of the reference in French is also important, if you can work together with your learned colleague.
MR. HINDS:
Very good.  I am going to, if the witness is -- I'm going to have the witness identify the French portion because he will be working with the French portion.  I'm working with English.  So I'm going to ask him to find the reference in the French portion, he'll put it in the record, so Judge Arlette Ramaroson will be on page with him in the French and you and Judge Maqutu would be on line with me in the English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The CV has been translated into English as well?
MR. HINDS:
The CV that he has is in English.  I'm going to just take him through his particulars but I do not intend, quite frankly, to -- I was not planning to have him read portions because the report is there.  I was going to ask him questions to have him expand upon it rather than just reading.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are talking about the initial beginning about the CV and the rest of it, not the report.  
(Declaration made by Witness FXB in French) (Not interpreted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose he should be familiar with the --
MR. HINDS:
I don't know, Your Honour, if you want to make any introductory remarks or do you want me to go right into the witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
The status of the witness, you can simply go ahead.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
WITNESS FXB
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Good morning, Professor Bangamwabo.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Professor, I'm going to show you a document, which has your particulars on it.  What we would like you to do is review the document and, if the information on there is correct, you would simply sign it and date it.  If there are any corrections, you can make the corrections and initial where you have made the corrections.  Do you understand this?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No English interpretation coming through the --
MR. HINDS:
We're not hearing any witness.
MS. OJEMENI:
The witness said that he understood what was said by counsel.
THE INTERPRETER:
Testing, one, two, three, four.  This is the English booth, am I coming out loud and clear?  Thank you.
THE WITNESS:
I have read the document and it is correct.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Would you please date it and sign it, please?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we would move this document to be marked as Defendant's Exhibit 50 and to be admitted into evidence.  It does not have to be sealed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any objection, counsel for the Prosecution?
MS. OJEMENI:
No objection.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So let the document containing the personal particulars of this witness be admitted as Defence Exhibit number five-zero.  
(Defence Exhibit No. 50 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we have a look at the document now that it is an exhibit?

Yes, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, Professor Bangamwabo, can you tell the Trial Chamber the date and place of your birth?
A.	I was born on the 23rd of October 1953 on a hill known as Kimiryi.  It was known as a village at that time and it's in Byumba in Rwanda.
Q.	Is Byumba a commune or is that a secteur?
A.	Byumba is a préfecture.  Maybe, if I need to specify the commune, I would say it's the village Kimiryi, the commune is Cyungo in Byumba préfecture.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell out those names, please, for the -- all of us, actually?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Kimiryi is spelt K-I-M-I-R-Y-I, Kimiryi.  Now Cyungo is spelt C-Y-U-N-G-O, Cyungo, and Byumba is spelt B-Y-U-M-B-A, that's for Byumba.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Professor, what is your nationality?
A.	I am Rwandan.
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber whether you are married -- what your marital status is?
A.	I am married.
Q.	Do you have any children?
A.	I have five children.
Q.	And where do you presently reside?
A.	Presently I'm living in South Africa.
Q.	Where in South Africa?
A.	I am living in Kwasaluna town province in a small town known as Melmoth, it's spelt M-E-L-M-O-T-H, Melmoth, M-E-L-L-M-O-T-H (sic). The name of the town is spelt M-E-L-M-O-T-H.
Q.	Now, Witness, are you in exile in South Africa?
A.	Yes, I'm in exile there.  I'm a refugee.
Q.	Can you give the Tribunal information concerning your educational background?  First, what is the primary school that you attended and where was that located?
A.	May I consult my CV so that I do not --
Q.	Yes?
A.	-- make any mistakes, because that can happen.  I began my primary school education in 1960 in a small school known as Rugundu, which is spelt R-U-G-U-N-D-U, Rugundu, that was in 1960.  I was in Rugundu for one year and up until 1966 I moved to Kinihira, which is spelled K-I-N-I-H-I-R-A.  So, from 1961 to 1966 I went to Kinihira.  In 1967 I went to the pre-seminary, it's a preparatory year for the seminary from '67 -- '66 to '67 and that was in Byumba.  From 1967 to 1973 I went to the Rwesero minor seminary.  Rwesero is spelt R-W-E-S-E-R-O, Rwesero.  That's also in Byumba préfecture. 

From 1973 to 1976 I went to the National University of Rwanda at the faculty of arts. 

From 1973 to 1976 in National University of Rwanda. 

From 1976 to 1978, I studied for my degree at the Louvain Catholic University.  Louvain is spelt 
L-O-U-V-A-I-N  and it's in Belgium.
Q.	Professor --
A.	I haven't finished yet.  So, from 1985 to 1989 I did my doctorate studies at the University of Rouen in France.  Rouen is spelt --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  We went on up to 1978, so you are saying from which year to 1980?
THE WITNESS:
In between I worked.  I worked at the National University of Rwanda and then from 1985 I continued with my doctoral studies.
MR. PRESIDENT:
From 1985 to which year?
THE WITNESS:
To 1989.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Continue, that's where you had reached -- you did your what?
A.	I did linguistics major with specialisation in social linguistics, that was my specialisation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What university you say he was?
MR. HINDS:
It was in France, but he should tell us what was the university and what degree he did obtain.
THE WITNESS:
It was the university of Rouen.  Rouen is spelled R-O-U-E-N, Rouen.  And from there I obtained a doctorate of the new regime, which is as opposed to the doctorate of the third cycle of university studies.
Q.	Witness, what do you mean by doctorate of the new regime?
A.	Well, it's a pathmark which is specific to France, because France had what was known as doctorat de troisiéme cycle, which was a three year study course, and then there was a state doctorate, which culminated university studies, and in 1980 to 1985 they had a reform, the two degrees or diplomas were fused or merged and they lasted four years to five years maximum.  So it's a degree that followed the new formula, which replaced two former degrees which existed at the third cycle in university studies.
Q.	Now, Professor, what was your area of specialisation when you were at the seminary in Rwanda?  What was your speciality, if any?
A.	At the minor seminary, this is what was called the Latin science option.  The latin science included the two fields, languages, Latin, French, English in a French speaking country, obviously, and on the other side you had the sciences, natural science, mathematics and things like that.  This is what was known as general humanities, and the option was latin/sciences.
Q.	Now, Professor, concerning your attendance at the University of Rwanda, can you tell us what degree, if any, you attained there and what was your specialisation at the University of Rwanda -- National University of Rwanda?
A.	At the National University of Rwanda I obtained a baccalaureate arts degree in the French section and the baccalaureate in the arts is the equivalent of a bachelor of arts, as is to be found in the English speaking countries.  It's a three-year course, at that time.
Q.	And can you share with the Tribunal, concerning the degree, if any, that you obtained at Catholic university and what your specialisation was, that is Catholic university in Belgium?
A.	At the Louvain Catholic University diplomas that we had had or degrees which we had obtained were not accepted, so there were a certain number of courses which were admitted or accepted for the completion of the programme.  So there was the candidature degree, which was the equivalent of the baccalaureate; and then the second cycle diploma was the licence or the degree.  So I obtained a diploma in linguistics and for the second cycle I obtained a licence in linguistics.
Q.	Professor, can you share with the Tribunal your professional background employment, starting in 1976?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before that, Counsel, during the second -- at the Catholic university you obtained a diploma in linguistics and then during the second study you received what?  It's not clear.  What would that be?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, what degree did you obtain at Catholic university?
A.	It was a degree in linguistics.  It's the equivalent of a bachelors degree in linguistics.
MR. PRESIDENT:
During the second cycle, as you call it.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the second cycle.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	And was that in Belgium?
A.	Yes, it was in Belgium.
Q.	Did you ever obtain a master's degree?
A.	In the Belgium system the diplome de licence is equivalent of a master's degree.  I was faced with this problem when I had to study in France, they did not recognise or acknowledge my diplome de licence.  In Belgium there is no masters degree, there is a post-graduate degree, if you will.  So the Belgian system and the French system are different.  The French system has a master's possibility, but in Belgium one speaks of a licence.  Obviously, when I went to France I had licence but it was not equivalent to the Belgian licence.
Q.	Witness, can you share with the Tribunal your professional background, that is employment, beginning in 1976?
A.	In 1976, when I finished my baccalaureate at the National University of Rwanda, I was assigned to the Ministry of Interior, but I remained there for only two months before I went on to continue with my studies in Belgium.  When I came back from Belgium in 1978, I was assigned to what was then known as the Institute Pedagogic Nationale.  This was an institution, a university institution which dealt with the training of teachers.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Slowly, to enable the translation to come out.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  The Institute Pedagogic Nationale, National Teacher Training Institute and the abbreviation for it was IPN, it was located in Butare.  Butare is spelt B-U-T-A-R-E, Butare.  So I was assigned to that institution on the 13th of December 1978. 

In 1981 the IPN institute that I was with, national, was merged with what had been the National University of Rwanda, at the time, in order to form what became the new university, the new National University of Rwanda.  The first academic year was 1981-82.  So from 1981 I was at the National University of Rwanda and I remained there until the events of 1994.  But in the interim the university had developed two campuses, and I was at the Ruhengeri campus.  

While I was teaching at the National University of Rwanda I was also a visiting professor in an institution of higher learning that was the Institute Superior La Catholic Pedagogic Afrique, it's a Catholic institution for applied pedagogue.  That was at Nkumba, which is spelled N-K-U-M-B-A, Nkumba.  This is in the Ruhengeri region.  

After 1994, I found myself in Kenya, where I was able to teach as a part-time lecturer at the Kenyatta University, that was 1995-1996, November 1996 -- November 1995 to July 1996, and this was at the Kenyatta University.  I think that is a name which is well-known. 

From 1996 to 1998 I obtained a post at Moi University, this is a university which is in Eldorat town or near Eldorat town.  It's still in Kenya, and Moi university my is spelt M-O-I. 

From September '98 to December 1999 I obtained a temporary appointment at a university in South Africa, Zululand University, and I stayed there up until the end of 1999.  After that time I did not have any formal employment, as such.  I became self employed.  There you are.
Q.	Witness, can you share with the Tribunal conferences, workshops and seminaries that you have attended which has prepared you for your work as an expert witness?
A.	Yes, thank you.  Most of the conferences, seminars or workshops that I attended were seminars which are linked to my area of my professionalism, in other words, the teaching of French and Kinyarwanda, also.  Later on I attended conferences on social linguistics, and afterwards I'll mention other elements which are outside my professional domain, which deal with extra-academic fields. 

I participated in a seminar, which I hosted with biography, that was in 1999, a seminar on the teaching of French organised by the Minister of Education, national education at the time, for teachers. 

In 1983 I participated in a seminar on the teaching of Kinyarwanda at secondary school level. 

In January 1994 there was an international symposium, a colloquium on terminology in Rwanda and for which I presented a paper, which was published later, on the issue of bilingualism. 

I participated or attended a conference which was organised by LOPELF (phonetic), it is the association of universities which are partially or entirely French speaking.  This was a conference organised in Kigali, which was similar -- which brought together departments of applied linguistics from universities.  There were about twenty universities attending. 

In January 1997 I presented a paper at a conference or seminar on the teaching of Kinyarwanda as a national language.  Here we are dealing with issues which deal with political linguistics, and this was organised by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.
(Pages 1 to 13 by R. Lear)








	1030H
A.	In 1990, February 1990, I presented a paper on socio-linguistics on the contact of languages.  This was a conference which was -- which took place at the university within the framework of research which existed at our faculty and this department regularly organised conferences on various subjects.

In 1991, I was contacted by the ministry of higher education and scientific research.  I gave a lecture to the Franco-Rwandan exchange centre on the generation of conflicts and their prevention, with particular emphasis on cultural aspects.

In September-October 1991, I participated in a -- in the Francophone university in the Limages, a conference which takes over 10 to 15 days period on various subjects.  Generally, the participants come from universities in the field.

In July-August 1992, I was approached by the Ruhengeri Catholic diocese to give lectures for teachers in primary schools within the diocese.  This was what was known as a round table conference and I was supposed to go to various places.  There were seven places I was supposed to visit.  There was one at Musanze.  Must I spell all these names?  I don't think -- is it necessary?  Well, the first was at Musanze.  Musanze is spelt, M-U-S-A-N-Z-E.  It was a school which was in Ruhengeri town itself.   

Then I went to Nyakinama for the teachers of the Nyakinama education secteur.  Nyakinama is spelt, N-Y-A-K-I-N-A-M-A.  Nyakinama is to the south of Ruhengeri town.  Then I went to Kinoni. This is towards the border with Rwanda to the north of Ruhengeri town.  Kinoni is spelt K-I-N-O-N-I, Kinoni.  

And then I went on to Busogo.  Busogo is on the road towards Gisenyi.  Busogo is spelt 
B-U-S-O-G-O.  

At another time, I went to Rwaza.  Rwaza is spelt R-W-A-Z-A.  At the Rwaza parish, that is on the other side of the Mukungwa River.  And then at Nemba.  Nemba is N-E-M-B-A.  Nemba is on the road towards Kigali, a few kilometres from the Kigali territorial préfecture.  

And then the Janja préfecture, that is G-A-N.  It's "J" sorry, J-A-N-J-A.    

The other seminaries in Kenya that was part of the programme, the French teaching programme.  

Now to come back to the expertise that we are referring to, the lecture given in the Franco-Rwandan exchange conference in 1991 and this revolving conference of 1992 enhanced my knowledge in social linguistic area and my knowledge on Rwandan problems.  Thank you.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Witness, with respect to your publications, could you share with the Tribunal the publications that you have either authored or co-authored which has prepared you with respect to your expertise?
A.	Thank you.  Publications that I have made -- of course, I will leave out publications that I did not complete because of events, but my first publication is bilingualism and linguistic interference.  This was an article that was published in a scientific journal of the ministry titled, "Science and Education."  In Kinyarwanda it is as I have just said.  I think the title in French.  To be complete, should be "Science, Education and Culture."  This was published in 1994.  

In 1985, I published an article a linguistics article.  Again that is a specialised article on Kinyarwanda syntax, an article that was published in a collective journal on grammatical information at the "CELAF" in Paris. 

Another journal was the list of work and of my academic which was done and which I had published, I drafted together with my colleague Laurent Musi, which was not extensively disseminated.  It was disseminated mainly in the universities. 

In 1986, there was the publication of an article presented at the seminar on terminology which was titled, "Problems of Bilingualism in Rwanda, Current situation."  It was a journal on the document of the colloquium which was published in Quebec and Kigali in Rwanda in 1987.  This article was not published as a result of the irregularity, irregular nature the publication of journals in -- irregular nature of the publication of the journals. 

There was a document which was -- which I submitted at the Lille University which was on microfilm.  I haven't had an opportunity to have it published in a book form so that it could available outside the university.  

And then finally in 1991, I co-published with other colleagues, the book on:  Inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda, the conflict, taking into account the conflict of October 1990, its beginning.  It was published in Rwanda.  I published it with other colleagues and I don't know if it is really necessary for me to give their names.  If it is, then I will give their names.
Q.	Witness, it is not necessary for you to give the names of the co-authors.  Witness --
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, to move the process forwards, rather than having Professor Bangamwabo go through the list of the scientific commissions he attended, the memberships of professional associations and university courses that he has taught, I would like to make a proffer of introducing his CV.  If there is objection to it, then we will just simply have him put it in into the record.  But in order to move the process forward at this stage I would like to move the professor's CV into evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Any objection, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  I think for the benefit of the Court and the parties, it will be necessary for the professor to run through it quickly at least draw so that he can make reference to the CV itself.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	But ultimately, of course, the CV will have to be produced.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, because what I have is not legible. So I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, I see.
MR. HINDS:
I mean, we could make copies, Your Honour, through the registry that is legible.  Certainly in enough time for the Prosecutor to use it, if she wants to, on cross-examination, but I was just trying to save a little time, but I could proceed in either way Court wishes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am sure it won't take the witness 10 minutes if he can just make references to where they are in the CV, I mean, because I don't even know -- looking at this, it is not very clear what the topics are.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  You can make reference to the topics and then we can have the CV produced and the learned counsel for the Prosecution can locate them.
MR. HINDS:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS: 
Q.	Witness, referring to your CV, could you indicate the page number --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, is the copy you have, Professor, does it have pages? 
MR. HINDS:
Yes, it has page numbers and paragraphs. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you can refer to those and then during the break you can make copies that are correct with pages and what have you, to the Prosecutor but also to the Trial Chamber.
MR. HINDS:
That's correct, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not -- the copies that we have do not have the pages as you --
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So --
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can highlight the topics.
MR. HINDS:
All right.  Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, with respect to scientific commissions that you have attended, can you indicate just the number of scientific commissions that you have attended and where does that, where are the particulars of that on CV, giving us the page number and the paragraph number.
A.	Well, on page 3, item 7, there is the Twa commission.  There are three commissions.  And on the same page, the scientific commissions which worked mainly at the university, and on the same page, regarding membership of associations, that is under item 8; there is membership of research, scientific research group which is called GERLA, Acronym, is G-E-R-L-A. That's the study and research group in applied research at the University of Rwanda.  And there is another commission, association of university teachers, which I put there in its acronym; I was a member of that association.  

I was also a founding member of a certain number of associations of parents in education because I was interested in educational issues and I contributed to the founding of a number of associations to set up secondary schools because secondary schools were a problem at the time.  

And there is another cultural association, French cultural association, intended mainly to facilitate contact between French and Rwandan cultures.  

Now, for courses taught at the universities, that can be found under item 9 and there I have listed all the courses that I have taught at the universities.  Maybe I overlooked some but definitely I have not added on others, at the National University of Rwanda and then at the Kenyatta University, that is on page 4, and then Moi University in Kenya, that is also on page 4.
Finally, the courses that I taught at the various universities, it's also on page 4.  And there you have the lists for whoever might be interested in the CV, particularly in the professional field.
Q.	And the list of courses that you have taught at various universities, what pages are they shown on with respect to the CV?
A.	It starts on three with two courses and continues on page 4.
Q.	And can you give us the universities where you have listed the courses which have been taught?
A.	Between the National Paedological Institute and National University of Rwanda, I made no distinction because it was not easy; some titles courses because these were two institutions that had the same programmes, particularly in my field.  That is why on page 3, at the bottom of the page, I just said the courses given at the National University of Rwanda and the National Pedagogical Institute.  And then on page 4, I am giving the courses that I have given at the Kenyatta University.  There are four courses there.  These were at the level of master's programme except for one.  

And on the same page 4, there are courses given at the Moi University.  There as well, I have given the lists.  

And then, finally, courses given at the University of Zululand.  So I presented such that the courses be visible and also possible to verify from the various universities.
Q.	Now, Professor Bangamwabo, were you requested to prepare an expert report on inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda, the armed conflict of October 1990, multi-party politics and implications of the events of 1994?
MR. PRESIDENT:
	 Are you through with the CV?
MR. HINDS:
Yes, Your Honour.  Now, I am just laying the foundation; the last question is laying the foundation for - admitting him as an expert.
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, I was contacted.  I believe it was by one of your investigators who proposed the topic to me and organised a meeting with the counsel.  We discussed this and I agreed to prepare this paper on inter-ethnic relations, multi-party system and implications on events of 1994.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Did you in fact prepare such a report?
A.	I did.
Q.	And was the original of that report in French?
A.	It was in French.
Q.	Do you have a copy of that report in French, with you?
A.	Yes, I have that copy.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the Defence offers Professor Francois Xavier Bangamwabo, as an expert with respect to the background that he has testified about and, in particular, with respect to the report that he has prepared.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, learned counsel, for the Prosecution?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, you have ruled on this matter --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MS. OJEMENI:
And I do not see why we have to go through it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.  All right.  He can testify as an expert as indicated in the oral ruling.  But, of course, you have to have the -- put the CV --
MR. HINDS:
I am now about to do that.  Your Honour, pursuant to the Court's decision that 
Professor Bangamwabo is qualified as an expert; we now would like to tender his CV as 
Defendant's Exhibit 51.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Any objection, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI: 
	No objection.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No objection.  Okay. So let the CV of the witness Professor Bagamwabo be admitted as Defence Exhibit No. 51.
	(Defence Exhibit No. 51 admitted)
MR. HINDS:
And his report entitled, "Inter-ethnic Relations In Rwanda, the Armed Conflict of 1990, Multi-party Politics and Implications on the 1994 Events," be admitted as Defendant's Exhibit 52.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.  Any objections?
MS. OJEMENI:
No objections.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No objections, no.  Let the report be admitted as Defence Exhibit No. 52.
	(Defence Exhibit No. 52 admitted) 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.   Can you please, maybe -- the original report, I suppose.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, Your Honour. We are now tendering the original report which is in French, which is Exhibit 52, and the CV.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Fifty-one.
MR. HINDS:
As 51.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, and make the copies available that -- with regard to the CV, make sufficient copies available for the Prosecution with -- which are readable, with the relevant pages and paragraphs.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I have turned in my - the only copy I have to the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. HINDS:
So I suppose the registry will make copies for all parties.
MR. KIYEYEU: 
	We shall do so, My Lord.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Professor Bangamwabo, you seem to want to make a comment.  Just hold it until the Chamber is ready.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	This is translation is English, CV is in English.
MR. HINDS:
The CV is in English.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	All right.  In that case, we will do the following:  The CV of the witness in the English text shall be, Defence Exhibit No.  51(A) and when we have had an official translated certified -- an official translation in French and that certified copy will be Defence 51(B). Likewise, the original report of the witness which is in French shall be Defence Exhibit No. 52(A) and we direct that it be translated into English and when the translation is made, and the certified copy of the same, that is the version in English, shall be Defence Exhibit No. 52(B) so that we have both reports into languages.
(Defence Exhibit Nos. 51(A) and (B) admitted)
(Defence Exhibit Nos. 52(A) and (B) admitted)
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think just for the record, there was already a certified translation of the original report.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	No, we haven't seen -- the copy we had, I think, is indicated as draft.
MR. HINDS:
Oh I see. Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I think, is it not so, learned counsel for the Prosecution?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, it is still a draft.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	It is a draft.
MR. HINDS:
Okay. Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, at least the version that we have is indicated as draft.
MR. HINDS: 
	Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on.
MR. HINDS:
I think the witness was about to ask a question.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, first, of all I'd like to apologise because I realise that I have forgotten the copy, the copy of the report at the hotel.  

And another comment is that I realise that in the Annexures, there is one annex that is missing from among those that were supplied, that is the Annexures on the Kinigi poems and their translations. I don't know if that is missing only from one document or if it is also missing elsewhere.  But it is this document; it's missing from pages 35 to 48.  So there are documents which are missing all the way to page 48.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, we have submitted that the report in French in the 52 pages are the annex, I do not know whether the annex was in fact received by the registry, but I have seen no translation of the annex which are the appendices and authorities that the professor uses as part of his report.  And I think he is now referring to the annexes and appendices.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	But the report we have just that has just been received is complete.
MR. HINDS:
The report that we have is complete with the exception of the annexes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Counsel, for the Prosecution, do you understand?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, if I understood my learned friend correctly, he said the report is 52 pages.  I have 58; the one you disclosed to the Prosecution is 58 pages.
MR. HINDS:
I may have misspoken.  We can just look at report to see how many pages there are.  If they are 58 in the French, then that is what it is.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	This one is 60.  It has all the annexes, I suppose.  There is the conclusion, references, annexes, then you have, what do you call this one - yes, please.
MS. OJEMENI: 
	Yes, I have 58.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Fifty-nine.
MS. OJEMENI:
Fifty-eight we have here, and even while moving our motion, we referred to 58 pages as well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because here on page 59, 59, we have the annexes.  Can you show, counsels, please, we start with --
MR. HINDS:
Come, and let me see first.
Your Honour, what we -- in the French, Your Honour, in the French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS: 
	The conclusions to the report, expert report, is at page 57.  Then starting on page 58 are references, and on 59, there is a list of five appendices or annexes as indicated here.  And then there are terms, acronyms as such and their meanings that are also on that page, and going over on page 60.  That is the complete report.  Now, as far as the appendices are, concerned, the appendices are listed as 1 through 5 which are the references that the professor has used.  That was submitted as a separate document and given to the Prosecutor, and it is that separate document that the professor now is making references to.  Those are the appendices.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I would them tendered.  Are they part of the report?
MR. HINDS:
Yes, they are being tendered as part of the report.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Where are they?  Can you show the report to the counsel?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the witness has all of the appendices.  We gave those to the Prosecutor.  What I have here are a list of the appendices and we are missing appendix 2, but Professor Bangamwabo has all files and we wait -- we would like to tender those at this time.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Are you aware of those?
MS. OJEMENI:
We do have the appendices, Your Honour.  We do not know -- since they are not part of our records, we didn't know whether it was complete or not.  But we can resolve this during break --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Okay. 
MS. OJEMENI:
-- instead of wasting valuable time of the Court.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, so does he have those --
MR. HINDS:
He has the appendices, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right now?
MR. HINDS:
Right now.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Professor, do you have the appendices with you?
A.	Yes, that is precisely the problem that I was making reference to.  There is an annex which is missing and there is another document that is a document on the association which is missing from page 35 to 48.  So there is a portion which is missing.  So there are three annexes which are complete.  There is one which is incomplete and there is one which is missing. I was saying that it is missing here, that probably in other documents it is complete.  That is why I was raising the issue.
MR. HINDS:
We will sort out this during break because --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	But from what we have, the report is complete.
MR. HINDS:
The report itself is complete.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Let's be very clear about that.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, the report is complete.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Good.  So if there are other matters that are not complete and you want to address, it will be matters other than the report?
MR. HINDS:
That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, likewise, we will resolve whatever missing pages that we have with the Defence during the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So we adjourn for -- where does he want you to go, to the hotel?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, do you want to go back to the hotel to get your report or what are you requesting?
A.	No, the report itself, I forgot it. I just took what I needed, and it is the report itself that I have forgotten.  I don't know if you have a copy or if I need to go back and fetch it but otherwise the way -- the one that was given to me was complete.
MR. HINDS:
He doesn't have to go back to the hotel.  We have copies of the report we can provide to the professor and we can proceed right after the break.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, because we really want to have this witness, at least part of his evidence done today.  We will adjourn for -- to enable even counsel to sort out some of the problems which are coming up, we adjourn for 20 minutes. So we will resume our work at half past 11.  
	(Court recessed between 1110H and 1135H)


MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Yes, learned counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, with the indulgence of the Court, I would like the witness to be shown Exhibit 52(A).
MR. PRESIDENT: (A). Okay.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Professor Bangamwabo, I have now shown you what has been introduced in evidence as Defendant's Exhibit 52(A). Can you identify that document?
A.	Yes I can recognise it.
Q.	Did you author that document?
A.	It is mine.
Q.	And what is the title of that document?
A.	"Inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda, The Armed Conflict of October 1990, Multi-Party Politics and The Implications on the Events of 1994". This is the title.
Q.	Witness, I will ask a series of questions.  And if you need to refer to the document in giving any of your answers, I would like you to refer to the page in the French and I will try to find it in the English so that the Judges would be able to follow along with you.  Do you understand that?  
A.	Yes, yes, I understand.
Q.	Now Professor, can you share with the Chamber the historical background of the inter-ethnic relations that existed in Rwanda in 1994, the historical background?
A.	Thank you.  First of all, I wish to say that this background has been complicated by recent events.  When one refers to inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda, what we are dealing with are relationships between Tutsis and Hutus, and sometimes the Twa are added, but generally they are marginalised. Basically, we are dealing with the two main groups, these two human groups which have been noticed to exist in Rwanda.  Before I go into the historical background, I wish to say that, as has often been emphasised by many, the definitions of these two groups are definitions -- I am talking about boundaries or limits, are often referred to as artificial limits, that there are no ethnic groups, that there is no real difference between these two ethnic groups.  That is one, one position adopted by a certain number of specialists.  

On the other hand one notices that the there are recurrent conflicts, conflicts which recur and can take indefinite scope because of their dramatic and tragic nature.  And to go into the historic background, this is done in an effort to try and understand what is at the basis of the various conflicts, the various tensions, and they try to explain the fact that people -- sometimes Westerners do not understand this, but it explains that people who speak one and the same language and live on the same hill and people who share the same culture, how can they reach the level that they did reach in 1994 and even earlier than 1994?  Now these inter-ethnic relations, when you are looking at the historical background, you have to go back to the beginning.  But at the beginning, as in all history regarding Rwanda, it is not very clear; in other words, there is no written evidence or written history of Rwanda and that means that one has to depend on rural -- oral traditions which explain to us and expose to us the relationships existing between the two groups and this is quite particular because all cultures are expressed through myths in order to have one understand their origins.  

Now, in the case of Rwanda, the history which has been written down by the first Europeans, these Europeans have noted certain things, certain aspects of relationships between the human beings.  But before their arrival, there were no written documents.  The Rwandans didn't write, but they spoke.  They expressed themselves; they expressed their origins, their relations, through stories, through tales, fables, through proverbs and through a whole series of things one refers to as the oral tradition.  Oral traditions which speak of human relations were collected by missionaries, Catholic or Protestant missionaries, and these were traditions that each connected -- collected in the areas where they worked and lived.  I would mention, for instance, the case of a German missionary, Vilien Menschj was the name.  Let me spell his name, M-E-N-S-C-H-J.   This missionary who worked in Rwanda in 1910, 1912, 1916, he collected oral traditions concerning the relations between the ethnic components of Rwanda.  

Another missionary who collected these traditions was Monsignor Aloys Bigirunwani.   Bigirunwani, spelt, B-I-G-I-R-U-N-W-A-N-I.  He collected a series of social cultural data on Rwanda and also on the relationship between Hutus, Twas and Tutsis.  

What is common to all these elements, to all these traditions, is the following point of view:  It's the presentation of the social structures, the presentation of relationships which existed between the ethnic components.  What is this presentation?  How are these relationships presented?
	(Pages 14 to 26 by Petrus Chijarira)












1145H
It is said that from time immemorial there was a father, and this father sometimes he's known as Gihanga, sometimes he's known as Kanyarwanda; his name varies depending on the variables of the myth.  So this gentleman existed; let's call him Gihanga.  He was the predominant parent -- that is, G-I-H-A-N-G-A, Gihanga -- and he had three sons.  One was called Gatwa, which is spelt G-A-T-W-A, and he had another son known as Gahutu, spelt G-A Hutu, and Gatutsi. 

The versions change, but basically what we need to retain is that he sent them to find the origin of fire -- sometimes it's fire, and sometimes it's the agricultural season.  So he sends Gahutu and Gatutsi -- in fact, this myth doesn't even refer to Gatwa.  So he sent his two sons to another man, living at some distance away, to ask him -- this is, Bigirumwami, mainly -- to ask him to explain to them the succession of cultural seasons so that they can cultivate and produce foods which they need. 

So they get ,there and what happens?  They arrive at Kibariro's home -- Kibariro is K-I-B-A-R-I-R-O -- and so since Gahutu is the elder of the two -- he's older than Gatwa -- Gahutu says, "Our father has sent us to ask you to tell us about the succession of cultural seasons".  The other says that if -- "Right now I'm busy working with my workers, so come back later.  Rather, go and have yourselves fed and I'll speak to you later".  

So they are given food to eat and Gahutu drinks; Gatutsi doesn't.  So he doesn't eat nor does he drink with these people.  So, obviously, Gahutu, who drank, he forgets.  And when night came, where he went to sleep, because they were given a house to the side, he sleeps and he vomits; he ate too much, he drank too much, and all that.  And Gahutu -- Gatutsi, who was next to him, moves away and he goes to the house where Kibariro and his wife is, and Kibariro is complaining, saying, "These children of Gihanga, they're really stupid.  They're coming to me asking many questions", and so on and so forth.  So he goes to sleep. 

Now, the woman says, "Well, September, which is the first season, you do this", and so she recounts the whole events.  Now, Gatutsi who left his brother, who had done all those indescriptive things, he is listening, he is listening.  And in the morning Gahutu asks Kibariro, and says, "Our father asked us to come to ask you this and that".  And Kibariro says, "Yes, yes, the first month" -- I don't know what he said exactly, but he didn't say September.  He, each time, gave things which were not in conformity with the reality.  So when they -- he went back home he repeated what Kibariro told him the following day.  And then he goes on to add, "Furthermore, he was speaking much too fast and in a complicated language I didn't understand, and so I have the impression that he didn't tell me the truth". 

Now, Gahutu (sic) takes his father to the side and says what he actually heard.  I mean, Gatutsi.  Gatutsi says what he really said and when Gihanga hears this he gets angry, and he says, "Gahutu, you went and did these abominable things.  You do not know what you were supposed to go and do that.  So now, from today onwards, you will be the servant of your brother.  In fact, I'm going to disinherit you and you will from henceforth be the servant of your brother".  

In reality, all the variants of the myth explain things in this manner.  Sometimes he's asking for fire, this or that, but, in fact, what happens is that Gahutu misbehaves and he acts in an unworthy manner, he's stupid, he doesn't pay attention, whereas Gatutsi, he takes over and he is responsible for the mission and reports back to his father the proper and correct answer. 

In other variants of the tale, it's said, that imana, "imana" is God -- imana is spelt I-M-A-N-A.  And in other versions it's God who condemns them, after having put them through tests.  He condemns Gahutu to being the servant of his brother, his brother to whom he says, "You will have the cattle.  You will have the cattle and you will never find anything wanting in your homestead".  

So, generally, this is the series of myths which explain or founded -- explain the inequalities.  I say that the missionaries collected these myths, and each one did that in his location.  I mentioned two missionaries, and one missionary, for instance, Pastor Menschig collected at least six variants, or maybe more. 

The same myth in the area of Gikongoro, which is to the south-east -- south-west.  Gikongoro is spelt G-I-K-O-N-G-O-R-O, Gikongoro.  So this myth would be translated orally.  I learnt it when I was young.  When I started to read, I read it.  There were bits and pieces here until Bigirumwami published works. I think this was in 1990.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I believe the witness said. 
THE WITNESS:
But this is what we have.  But when you have uneducated people, people who do not have any analytic capabilities, everyone accepts this, that these things must have happened. 

But when this was written down, it obtains a specific format, and that is what is seen as inequalities being explained away and ideologised.  It is explained as to how this event happened in the various parts of the country. 

According to the history which depends on oral traditions, obviously, the Tutsis had cattle and it was said that they were grazers (sic) and the Hutus were agriculturalists, or farmers, and so this is quite evident in the Tutsi kingdom. 

When the missionaries arrived -- not only the missionaries but the colonialists -- in the years 1890 to 1900, they set up a site -- a kind of classification of the Hutus, who were scattered more or less throughout the country, and the Tutsis, who were more -- were less numerous, they were fewer in number, but they were more imposing.  I would mention the name of Richard Kandt, who was the first administrator, who was German, in Rwanda, and with the Balkanisation of Africa during the Berlin Conference -- I think it was in 1886, or something like that -- Rwanda fell in the camp of the Rwandans (sic).  So Dr. Kandt, K-A-N-D-T, is the name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to what, what group?  You said Rwandan, English interpretation. 
THE WITNESS:
Of the Germans.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
And Rwanda, Burundi and Tanganyika, whereas Congo fell into the hands of the Belgians, and Uganda and Kenya into the hands of the British. 

Now, when the Germans arrived -- this is Dr. Richard Kandt's impression; it's at page 5 in the French version.  This is the first -- it's point 2 -- it's point (1) under point 2, under the Germans.  He says the Wahutus had a strange behaviour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, one second. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think that in the English we are starting with page 8 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- "Under the Germans".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
And then it will go to the Belgians, under page 10.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mm.  Yes, and learned counsel, in French? 

MR. HINDS:
The French, I think he has given the reference.
THE WITNESS:
Page 5.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe, learned counsel, you know, when you are dealing with the oral history, there is a lot of words.  If the witness can be precise, so that we can, you know, follow him and, of course, as we said, we'll get back to these records later.
MR. HINDS:
Yeah, Your Honour, I think that he is summarising as opposed to reading.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, that should be borne in mind, because we would like to get whatever he wants to say.
MR. HINDS:
Right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll come back to it so that you can move fast.  That is number one.  

Number two, if he can slow down a bit for the purposes of the translation in English and the various recorders, particularly those who are doing it through the other language.  It's a bit fast; just a bit; slow down a bit.
MR. HINDS:
Yep.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, as you give your testimony, we would like you to summarise, bearing in mind that the Court has the actual copy of the report.  So if you can summarise and explain which items that are not necessarily written already, that would be extremely helpful.  And in your presentation, do not move so fast so that at least the translators can keep up.

Okay, you were now at page 5 in the French, dealing with the -- what roles the colonialists played, and, in particular, the Germans.
A.	Yes, that's correct.  But before that quotation, you're right in reminding me to be specific as to certain aspects.  So the Hutus and Tutsis, it is said by some that there were social references, that they had a certain amount of mobility:  they could become Tutsi or Hutu; because if you were a Tutsi, you would lose your cattle and you become a Hutu; if you were Hutu, you would acquire many cattle and you would become a Tutsi. 

This is a notion which is debatable and it changes in time.  There was, in fact, this phenomenon of being able to change -- come from the Hutu group to join the Tutsi group -- and this is what was kwihutura, changing one's condition.  Kwihutura is maintained as it is, and it's spelt K-W-I-H-U-T-U-R-A, kwihutura.  This means to leave one's condition of being Hutu, that group of Hutus, to move to the Tutsi group.  The person who did that would be referred to as an "icyihuture".  Icyihutre is spelt I-C-Y-I-H-U-T-U-R-E.  So, the Hutu who were talking about conditions -- so you have someone from the Hutu group who went to the Tutsi group, one was not automatically referred to as Tutsi; he would be referred to as a icyihuture.  This means that he continued to remain a Hutu despite his new situation.  So the Hutu label would remain with that person

Having said that, another item I wish to stress, because this will come later on, is that the Hutu -- the Tutsi who lost his cattle -- the Tutsi who lost his cattle would become poor like many Hutus, but he did not become a Hutu; in other words, rich Hutus would fight in order to marry his daughters.  

Now, when we look at the position of the first Europeans who came to Rwanda, looking at the relationships of Hutus and Tutsis, I selected this passage from Dr. Kandt, which I have said appears in the French version at page 5, and he writes the following, this is obviously a translation:  "That the Wahutu had a strange behaviour.  In the presence of their masters they are serious and reserved and avoided questions, but immediately the Hutus (sic) backs are turned to our side -- Watutsis backs are turned to our side and we are alone with them, they told us virtually everything we wanted to know, and even what we did not want to know, because I was helpless before their requests and their problems when they complained about the oppression they have been subjected to and the complete deprivation of all their rights.  On several occasions, I told them to manage by themselves".  This is a passage which I'm quoting from Maniragaba. 

So this is the first impression of Dr. Kandt to the effect that there is a relationship of domination, this master/servant relationship.  Some -- one group is identified as being the masters; that is, the Watutsis, as masters, and the others are the Wahutus. 

Another German, he was an acting administrator who replaced Dr. Kandt, he raised a number of questions, taking into account what he was observing regarding the relationship between the Tutsi and the Hutu, and these are a number of questions.  I have noted them the way they are, and that starts from page 5 to 6 in the French version.  I would think that would be on pages 8 and 9 of the English version. 

The Germans, the colonialists, he wondered whether they had to continue to play the games -- the game of the Watutsi by supporting them in their claim to be paid tribute.  The Tutsi were being paid taxes by the Hutus, and they were preaching against the apparent domination of the Tutsi over the Hutus across the country.  So what we need to keep in mind is that there was a profound bitterness against this domination across the whole country. 

He also asked questions in the current system in which -- in which we are playing the unpopular game of allowing that 97 per cent of the population remain deprived of all rights to the benefit of a dominant caste.  That is another observation he made during that period, which underpinned the tension. 

In 1914, because in the interim the King Musinga, who replaced his step-brother Rutalindwa, had become a major -- and in 1914 he wrote to the residents.  The Germans had imposed themselves; they had been able to impose a central administration.  So the king wrote to the residents -- to the president and asked him, because there was problem (sic) in requesting citizens to work.  He was asking him -- he wrote the following:  "As far as I'm concerned, I feel that what could prevent these problems is that I should inform the prominent personalities that each time a man refuses to accomplish a service as before, he arrests him and sends him to me so I can throw him into prison and give him 25 lashes.  The same treatment will be given to those who refuse to pay tax.  If you find that the measure is good, then you should put an additional prison at my disposal, since the prisoners will be many and we'll also need canes".  That is another testimony to the relationship between the two groups, a testimony from the top, where the king makes reference to the Wahutus who have to undertake forced labour.  This was forced labour and not paid for.  What I note from this is that this tension, or this domination -- there was this domination of one group of the other. 

Now, on the Belgians, what happened?  Because in the interim, the First World War had taken place, the Germans had been sacked from Rwanda, Burundi and Tanganyika.  After the First World War, Rwanda and Burundi had become Belgian colonies and the Belgians added them to the Congo. 

Now, under the Belgians, things did not change, because, meanwhile, there are the Catholic missionaries who have also come; they know the people, they know what is happening; and the Belgians also needed a very rapid control of the country.  So they consulted the missionaries.  The European missionaries, the Catholics, who were mainly French and Belgian, said "Well, if you want the welfare of this country and that of your government, you have an appropriate staff, or manpower, made up of intelligent people who have a tradition of nobility, of blood and governance.  These are the Tutsi.  They are the Tutsi.  And you cannot do without them, because they are intelligent".  And on page 8 of the French version there is a reference to one Bishop Classe who was a top clergyman of the Catholic Church at the time and another one to the Governor Mortehan, who said, "Now, if you want to be practical, the --
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, this is page --
THE WITNESS:
-- quotation of Bishop Classe.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, this is page 11 in the English.
THE WITNESS:
Let me -- I'd like to emphasise this passage to indicate that compared with what we saw in our mythology and how the French see the relationship and how they are going to make use of this mythology, and also to say that it is not the missionaries who decide that you are Hutus and you are Tutsis.  These are structures that existed and which they found. 

Bishop Classe wrote the following.  On behalf of the Catholic hierarchy, he said, "If you want to place --  if we want to place on the practical point of view, and think about the real interests of the country, we have in the Mututsi youth an incomparable element of progress that all who know Rwanda cannot underestimate" -- I would like to emphasis "incomparable elements"and "Mututsi" - "Eager to learn and willing to know about what comes from Europe, as well as imitating the Europeans, enterprising, sufficiently aware that ancestral customs no longer have reason for being, retaining, nonetheless, the political meaning of old and the tact of their race in order to lead men, these young people are a force for the well-being and the economic future of the country".  

He continues as follows:  "When the Bahutu are asked whether they prefer to be commanded by people of common birth or by nobles, the response is unquestionable; they prefer the Batutsi, and for good reason.  Born leaders, these people have a sense of command." 

Well, this is a quotation from which we can highlight a number of things.  First of all, the batutsi who were born leaders and also the fact that they are willing to learn, to know what is coming from Europe, to imitate Europeans, enterprising -- well, at that stage I don't know if the Hutus were fleeing, but I think that they were the first to embrace the Catholic -- the Catholic Church.  

But there is another fact, which is a play on words, to the effect that the Bahutu prefer to be commanded by people of noble birth and the price, or the consequence, for not obeying the Batutsi is the prison or lashes. 

So Bishop Classe would advise the colonialists to maintain the status quo; that is, the domination of the Tutsi over the Tutsi (sic).

But I'm going to quote -- give you another quotation which indicates the experience of the Hutus who were given orders -- who were given positions of responsibility at the time.  And what is said, it is written that the Bahutus promoted to chiefdom lacked prestige and authority.  "They were a sorry sight in the presence of the great feudal lords, whom they seemed to be displacing.  They were not able to acquire this fascinating influence, which the humble, instinctively as traditionalists, put up with defenceless -- put up with defencelessly in the presence of a superior in a hereditary situation with a typical statutory physique, manners, fortune". 

So these people did not have the appropriate stature, physical stature, and they did not have the tradition of being in authority, and they did not have the background to go with it.  Obviously, he was familiar with the Hutu, and this did not make it possible for them to take positions of authority. 

This background of authority is this capacity to be able to dominate somebody and get him to obey your orders, and that was lacking -- that was lacking in the Hutu.  It's not the competence, it's not the moral or physical or intellectual integrity.  These are inborn values which are linked up to certain traditions and which they did not have.  So the experiment was stopped and that is how come they maintained the -- did not promote Hutus to positions of chiefdom. 

So this went on until the '50s, the 1950s.  And around the 1929-1930 the last Hutu chiefs in the peripheral regions were eliminated and replaced by Tutsis. 

Another factor in the Hutu-Tutsi relationship, and Twa if you wish, is the role of schools, schools as we know them today.  In traditions we need to describe them, but the formal type of school as introduced by the Europeans participated in the culture of the development of this philosophy of inequality, this, because the first schools were reserved for the Tutsi.  The first school was a school for children of chiefs, children of the noble, which was established in Nyanza.  Nyanza is N-Y-A-N-Z-A. 

Other schools which were established would take in Hutus, except for the seminaries, because in the beginning they were not accepting Hutus.  But with time, even in the seminary there was going to be a lot of Tutsi.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"A lot of Hutu", sorry. 
THE WITNESS:
On this issue, there are some indications on schools in 1928 known.  Never was reference made to Hutus, apart from negative references: "exclusive", "marginalise" and so on.  There was a school which was set up later on which became the Astrida school complex.  I think Astrida is known, and this is in Butare. 

That school was a model school intended to train civil servants, administrators, doctors, secretaries, agronomists.  It was a government school which in principle took in everybody, but on account of the requirements of possible payment, only the bourgeoisie could attend the school, because the fee was 500 Belgian francs a year -- 700 Belgian francs a year, which was a fortune at the time. 

I looked for figures and I found figures between -- figures of between 1947 and 1944 from Linda Melvern.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, sorry.  Did you say, interpreter, from 1940 -- it seems to be the reverse?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I thought so, Your Honour, but the witness did say 1947 to 1944.
MR. PRESIDENT:
From 1947 to 1994 or is it -- 
THE WITNESS:
No, no, no. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what came through in English.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is what came through the French, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you ask the witness to verify that?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, could you just verify the years you were referring to?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
The period that I'm referring to, from my memory, was 1944 to 1947.  That is to give you an idea of composition of schools at the time.  Linda Melvern recorded that, during that period, there were 447 Tutsi pupils and 16 Hutu pupils.  That gives you an idea of what the composition of schools -- the composition of schools was at the time of the Astrida school complex, at that time. 

Now, to give an idea of the situation in '56, I have given a table on page 15 -- page 15 of the English version, and that gives you the situation as at 1956.  This was a study that was conducted by Hanf --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's page 15 in the English.  And what would be the page in the French?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. HINDS:
It's page 10 in the French text. 
THE WITNESS:
Page 10.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
There we see, in that table, the first column shows the ethnic composition.  The second column shows the percentage of population: the Hutus 82.74, Tutsis 16.59, and the Twa, 0.67.  Now the intake at the primary school, the Hutus made up 67.70 per cent -- the Hutus were 67.70, whereas the Tutsi, 32.10.  Now, when you look at these figures, it shows some imbalance, but, as far as I'm concerned, that is okay.  

Now, when you get to the secondary school, you see that the Hutus are 39.10 per cent and the Tutsis, 60.90 per cent.  There, as well, there's a big imbalance.  And the last column shows the index of disparity -- that is, the relationship between the ethnic group and the population.  And there I would think that there is a mathematical imbalance, and that is rare.  So here we see that the Hutus are 0.82, whereas the Tutsis are up to 1.93, which clearly indicates an imbalance. 

This imbalance is reflected not only in the schools, it's reflected in employment.  And with the new -- given the new dimension -- that is, the degrees and the certificates -- one cannot employ people who do not have certificates and degrees.  So this inequality was reflected in employment. 

I did not make reference to this, but this can be seen in a chapter presented by Jean Rumiya.  In 1959 there were 43 Tutsi chiefs and two Hutu chiefs.  There were 549 Tutsi sub-chiefs and ten Hutu sub-chiefs.  And in other sectors of employment, Tutsis had the virtual monopoly, more than 80 per cent, 88 per cent to be more specific, and 12 per cent, Hutus. 

So, briefly, this is to show the inequalities linked up to the Tutsi-Hutu relationship; that is to say, that the Tutsi right from the beginning, on account of the economic factor that cattle represented - add schooling to cattle and that gave it -- gave the Tutsi the possibility to dominate the socio-economic life of Rwanda. 

Around 1940, the intelligencia, the Tutsi intelligencia started working with the Belgian colonialists.  There was a strong, identifiable structure of the Tutsi, because before the colonisation the Tutsi families were fighting among them (sic), and when there was peace they were no longer fighting among themselves, there was no competition, and they became more homogeneous than in the beginning. 

In 1940 this trend was reinforced, and it was around that period that Alexi Kagamé, the great Rwandan philosopher and historian, wrote his book Inganji Kalinga.  That is on page 11 of the French version and page 16 of the English version. 

There was, at that stage, a view taken about what should be the official history of Rwanda, because up until that time the Europeans had a certain view of the history of Rwanda, and in that book, Inganji Kalinga, I took note of this because it's an ideological work which presents an ideological view of Rwanda.  Rwanda was dominated by the Tutsi dynasty and it is said that there was never a Hutu king, which is referred to as a uwami -- that is U-M-W-A -- it is U, U-M-W-A-M-I, uwami. 

In Ingani Kalinga, with the succession of various kings and so on and so forth, the Tutsis had kings and kingdoms that were not dominated by kings -- by the -- Tutsi had no kings, whereas this historian makes reference to Hutu kings which were referred to as sub-kings. 

Now, in that book, Kagamé said that country Hutu, country in quotes, did not have kings which were referred to as abahinza.  The abahinza is the plural of umuhinza, umuhinza is U-M-U  --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, counsel (sic).  Please go on. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, for the English, the reference is at page 16 .
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have it.
MR. HINDS:
Oh, okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, witness.  Sorry for the interruption.  I don't know if they will be able to pick up where you stopped. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  There's no problem. 

So, in that book, why is that book important from the ideological standpoint?  Because Kagamé said that only the Tutsis had kings -- it is because only the Hutus had kings and the Tutsis had no kings that they had the abahinza, and I was trying to spell that word, the umuhinza, U-M-U-H-I-N-Z-A. 

That is to say that in Kagamé's opinion, when you have a country or a territory governed by a Hutu, he could be referred to as a umwami, but he's not a umwami, he's a umuhinza.  Whereas, other historians, particularly Pauwels, RJ, said that the Tutsis had adopted administrative-political structures and had adopted these institutions.  I'm emphasising this point because of the ideological dimension:  the negation that a Tutsi can be a king -- the negation that a Hutu can be a king, because they did not have that capability, which only the Tutsis had. 

But what I've noticed in the paragraph of interest is that with the development, with the revolution of 1959, or other researchers, in reality Kagamé ended up recognising, acknowledging, that there were abami, not abahinza but abami Hutu kings.  He acknowledges that the abahinza were indeed Hutu kings who were subjected to others, because one couldn't have two kings.  So they were called abahinza, and they were given some responsibility, be it magic -- magical or religious. 

So there, the ideological affirmation of 1940 is questioned, or challenged in the book published in 1972, An Abbreviated History of Rwanda, where Kagamé indeed recognised the fact that there were Hutu kings. 

Now, why am I emphasising this?  It's because I noticed the negation of the title, the modification, the change of the name of the titles of Hutu dignitaries which no longer existed.  When at the time they were referred to as kings, but now we want to de-baptise them.  There are no longer kings, they no longer exist; but they're abahinza.  There's something which is very important and very serious for me, ideologically speaking, and when we look at inter-ethnic relations, and I'm saying this because this aspect will come back later on in the 1990s when some written works will refer to this type of Rwanda which maintained an ideology coming from the Kiranga (sic) myth, the way the people evolved, how they were blessed by the missionaries, and so on and so forth, and also taking into account the monarchical modern Rwanda. 

So this situation of the domination of Hutus under the Tutsis -- and they were servants.  This is not a term that I'm inventing, because it is written in historical works that chiefs, or Tutsi dignitaries, had their own servants and worked under their mercy.  

So this situation is going to change because with time men are men.  At a given point in time they realise that things are not working, especially with these religions which preach love and equality, with these things that we hear about in Europe, elections, democracy and all that.  So now we have witnesses.  Even these Europeans who were instruments of this domination, they are now witnesses, and some are going to express their unease, their social unease with oppression under which the Hutus were complaining, including a few Tutsis, because there were some Tutsis who complained.  And this unease is going to develop and will express itself, because, you see, this is from the post-Second World War era.  All these winds of change reached Rwanda and Burundi.  

So it's in this atmosphere that there will be a development of this awareness of possibilities for change in the situation or the social condition; possibilities for change in the relationship of oppression and domination which existed.  

There will be an expression of this unease in a document which was baptised the social manifesto of the Bahutu.  This document is going to divulge the departure -- point of departure in the political race towards the domination of the country, because in the meantime there will have been the political developments; in other words, the birth of political parties, and so on and so forth. 

Another aspect which I underscore is that this awareness, once it is publicly expressed by certain Hutus, and also by some Tutsis, the church will officially acknowledge that the problem exists.  The church, which for a long time, during a period of 50 years, had said, yes, we can live with this situation, people are intelligent and everything is going very well and we have never heard the Tutsis (sic) complain -- but the church is going to admit that there is a problem.  And this is what we have in a letter by Bishop Perraudin in 1956.  It's at page 12 in the French version.  

Maybe before that quotation, there's another quotation at page 12, above.  Yes, we were speaking about the myth on page 12 in the French version.  When some Hutus publicly explained, or expressed their complaints, their social complaints, they were referred to as "abagaragu b'iibwami", in Kinyarwanda.  And in French these would be the feudals of the court, the loyalists of the court.  It wasn't just anybody, or the general people, it would be these --
MR. KIYEYEU:
To have the record clear, if he could spell out what he has spoken in Kinyarwanda so that the records are clear on that?  Thanks for that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And slow down a bit, and make, you know, make references, to the -- you know, where you think references are necessary, you make that kind of reference, and accurately, so that we can look them up at a later stage.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us whom you are quoting, and so that we can locate it in the English version? 
A.	Thank you.  It's at page 12 in the French, page 17 in the English.  In the French version, this is the quotation which is in bold-type.  So this is the reaction of what I referred to as the abagaragu.  I will spell this later.  It's spelt A-B-A-G-A-R-A-G-U, abagaragu, and b'iigwami, B, apostrophe, I-I-B-W-A-M-I.  This means the court loyalists.  These were traditionalist, dignitaries, generally speaking. 

Now, they responded because those who were complaining had spoken about injustice, the need for social justice, which would take into account all the children, all the sons of Gihanga, our common father as he was known. 

So they were answered in the following manner:  "People who call for the sharing of the common heritage are people who have a fraternal relationship between them.  However, the relationship between us", in parenthesis, "(Batutsi)" -- and I'm not the one who is putting in parentheses -- "and them", in brackets, "(Bahutu) has always been and is still based on serfdom.  There is, therefore, no basis whatsoever for fraternity..."  I left out a whole lot because I have just included what is interesting.  "And the history of Ruganzu" -- this is a great king of the Rwandans -- "History says that Ruganzu killed many Bahinza" -- we have seen the Bahinza with Kagamé -- and in brackets there's the term "petty kings".  "He and our other kings conquered the country of the Bahutu, whose kings were the Bahinzas."  All the details are in Inganji Kalinga.  So, since our kings conquered the country of the Bahutu, how can they now claim that they are our brothers?"  How can they now claim that they are our brothers?  This is to give you a kind of view of the certain categories of brothers -- of people or the sons of Gihanga, because in the interim there were myths dealing with fraternity, who said that Gahutu had been found there by the Mututsi who fell from the sky. 

So that is the position.  There's, on the one hand, those who were looking for social justice, and the other side which is rejecting all possibility of sharing, because relations had from old been based on the cattle that the kings of the Hutus (sic) had obtained from the Hutu kings which they had killed, and, therefore, there were no -- they had no rights to sharing the common heritage. 

So these kinds of relations are said by some that we are nonetheless sons of Gihanga.  At other times people accept this; others say at times that this is not possible. 

Now, to move on to another quotation in relation to the social inequalities through the Catholic Church, these inequalities were not new.  They were there when the Europeans first came.  We saw this with Dr. Kandt.  We saw this with the other administrator, the interim administrator.  But here we see that the Catholic Church is recognising this, acknowledging this under the pen of Bishop André Perraudin.  I'm reading this part of the history to see -- to show you the contradiction that the two positions presented.  

I don't think that it's necessary to read the whole passage, but what I would like to do is the following.  Up until the end of the colonial period there had been tension between the two components.  What I mean is that there were social tensions.  The Hutus rejected the domination under -- which they had been subjected to for a long time, and the ruling class, the nobles, the higher classes generally were not ready because the most extremist of them say that there was no possible sharing, no possible fraternity between them.  

So I moved quickly then to the revolution, because what is of interest to me is the dynamics of these relationships, how they appear at the end of the 1950s, at the eve of the 1959 revolution.  This is one of the relationships which shows the tension because of these two positions adopted, will become one of the elements leading to the violence of 1959, because effectively there was intransigence on both parts, and people refused to come to a compromise.  So there is no possible compromise for some, and this, evidently, creates a situation of cleavage which ends up with the situation of violence in 1959. 

After 1959, the '59 revolution, what does that mean?  It's the overthrow of the established order.  The Tutsi dynasty is conquered and there is the birth of the republic.  And what are the relationships that obtain under the republic?  

The principle of the parties which set up the republic to which a certain Tutsi political class belonged to, it was that citizens are equal before the law, in the eyes of the law.  They are equal within the law.  There's no ethnic group which is superior or inferior.  This makes it that in the new perspective, the term "Tutsi", which meant "noble" in the beginning, which in the beginning meant "beautiful", "intelligent", "capable of leadership", and so on and so forth, and the Hutu who from the outset meant someone who was in conditions which were inferior, obviously, there's the Hutu ethnic group, someone who is ignorant, an idiot, disgusting, and so on and so forth.  With the arrival of the principle of equality, justice, these concepts will be removed from that aspect.  In other words, after 1959 a Tutsi could no longer meet a Hutu and ask him to carry this baggage for me, go and fetch me a drink, take this baggage from me.  He could no longer do that because the conditions were no longer the same.  So what I'm saying is that the ideology contained in the terms "Hutu" and "Tutsi" are going to change completely. 

What is of interest is that you see all these changes will later on cause problems of adaptation.  But the Hutu never arrived at the level where he could meet a Tutsi and say, "Well, you, now it's we who have the power.  Go and do this or that for me".  There was no longer that possibility for the Hutu to do so.  There was -- there were these inequalities in the transition that took place, and that's what I would like to stress.  There could have been friction between individuals, but that would be considered an individual problem and not an ideological problem. 

Under the first republic, what I mention there is that the relationships between Hutus and Tutsis, despite this principle of equality and so on, was threatened, I would say, by the fact that the Tutsi monarchy, or even Hutu monarchists -- because there were some -- those of them who did not accept the principle of autonomy, independence, the results -- the results of the referendum organised by the United Nations, and so on, they went into exile and they began a guerrilla movement which attacked Rwanda either from Uganda or from Congo, or even from Burundi. 

So this led to the fact that since the aggressors were Tutsis, the monarchists, this led to the fact that there were suspicions.  This is why I am saying that the relationships were not always comfortable, despite the principles, the democratic law, social democracy and so on and so forth.  So these incursions brought about distrust, and there were sometimes reprisals, depending on the scope of the invasion or incursion in question.  But, nonetheless, it remained that after the incursions of these persons who were referred to as "Inyenzi".  If you wish I will spell it, I-N-Y-E-N-Z-I, Inyenzi.  That is how the attackers were referred to.  

So, in the year '67-68 they stopped these incursions, there was a calm, but this calm was immediately disturbed in 1972-73, and this is basically following the events which occurred in Burundi where there were Hutu-Tutsi tensions and massacres and exiles involving 300,000 refugees from Burundi to Rwanda. 

Now, in 1972 there occurred in Rwanda a kind of crisis.  Not only was it ethnic in nature, but there was a beginning of a regional aspect in it at the administrative level.  There was a kind of political crisis which will coincide with the events in Burundi and which reaches a peak in 1973.  There was a coup d'état on the 5th of July 1973, but this coup d'état took place in a situation of political crisis, following, in particular, the efforts made by President Kayibanda to change.  Shall I spell Kayibanda?  It's spelt K-A-Y-I-B-A-N-D-A.  He was president until 1973.  So there were some changes --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Learned counsel for the Defence, we'll be stopping at the usual time at one.
MR. HINDS:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, take the lunch break as usual, so you can advise the witness accordingly.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, can you sum up in the next few minutes -- we're stopping at one -- of events that you are describing under the first republic, so we can start after lunch dealing with the inter-ethnic relations thereafter; that is, under the second republic.
A.	Yes.  So there was this tension which led up to attacks by Tutsis who were attacked and chased from civil service, from schools, and also some Hutus, because this was an ethnic and regional crisis at the same time.  So with the coup d'état, the situation changed -- and I'm making a brief summary.  The situation changed because what the new regime was blaming on President Kayibanda was his marginalisation or discrimination on a regional and ethnic basis.  

To summarise, I would say that there was a real peace between the Hutus and the Tutsis.  What I mean is an understanding, a kind of cordiality.  I don't know whether one can refer to that, but there was some kind of mutual tolerance, and I use, in order to illustrate this, the book by Antoine Nyetera. Nyetera is spelled, N-Y-E-T-E-R-A, Nyetera, Antoine.  I chose him because he's a Tutsi who, through these situations, speaks about relationships between Hutus and Tutsis. 

He also explains the socio-economic situation of Tutsis as they were in the years from 1973 to 1990.  So there was a real peace.  But at an individual level, I believe that one cannot go into that.  What is interesting is to see that the powers that be preached.  I wasn't able to obtain the book with Habyarimana's speeches.  I could have used it; it's about 300 pages.  But it's interesting.  I've read it sometimes and it speaks of the inter-ethnic relations, and you see somewhere that he minimises Tutsis and magnifies Hutus.  That's my impression.  So I conclude with a passage dealing with the armed conflict, where we see the attackers when they are looking for agents within the country.  How they can proceed in the recruitment of Tutsis and having men married to Tutsi women, how they exert pressure, because that was my conclusion, because people were believing in the peace which was obtaining in the country. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think you are addressing Nyetera on pages 22 and 23 in the English version; is that correct, counsel? 
MR. HINDS:
No -- well, I think he is referring to Nyetera.  He's also at 22 and 23, but right now he's at page 21, and ending just before addressing the second republic. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, all right. 
MR. HINDS:
In the English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the English.
MR. HINDS:
And I think in the French, it is at page 15.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  I think we'll stop here.  Maybe you can still -- we can still advise the witness to be short in his summary, particularly with a view of making his presentation with a view of helping the Trial Chamber to be able to follow up some of the issues that he would like us to follow. 
MR. HINDS:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because he should not make a new element, unless it is very necessary, because that might amount to presenting two reports, one orally and one -- the written report.  We would like to follow what he wants to say and to demonstrate --
MR. HINDS:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- based on the report.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I'm trying to have the witness not necessarily just rereading the report, which is now in evidence --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
-- but only to explain and summarise --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Highlighting is important.
MR. HINDS:
-- and highlight aspects for the Trial Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because we expect, learned counsel for the Defence, that at least his examination-in-chief should be completed by the end of the day today.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, we expect that today, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All right.  We'll stop here and please, witness, be so advised.  We resume our work at twenty-five to three this afternoon; twenty-five to three.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned.  
(Court recessed at 1305H) 
(Pages 27 to 44 by Geraldine O'Loughlin)







	1430H
MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  Sorry, we are a bit late.  Can you please continue the 
	examination-in-chief of the witness. 
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, just before the lunch break, you were testifying concerning events that took place under the first republic, 1961 to 1973.  We would like you now to -- draw your attention to the inter-ethnic conflict in Rwanda under the second republic, 1973 to 1990. 
A.	Thank you.  In 1973 to 1990, that is on page 21 in the English version, it is a division that I adopted myself, but I am not too sure if I know exactly what you want me to do.  You mean --
Q.	Witness, you were describing previously the history of inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda.  You started with an analysis, which took us into the pre-colonial period, and then you took us to the colonial period beginning with the Germans.  You then gave us an analysis with respect to the Belgians.  And then you proceeded to give us the period of -- you dealt with the impact and effect of schooling and education.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, is my learned friend testifying?
MR. HINDS:
The witness asked counsel that he did not know what I wanted by the mere fact that I directed him to the section in his report dealing with -- entitled "The Second Republic", and I was just going through with him without any elaboration, just what he was testifying about under the various titles, to tell him I wanted him to continue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	You gave us some insight with respect to social unrest and then just before the break, you were dealing with inter-ethnic relations after 1959, but under the first republic.  I am now asking you to continue and share with the Chamber those aspects of inter-ethnic relations under the second republic, bearing in mind that the Chamber has the report in front of them.  So, therefore, we are asking you to highlight, summarise, capsulate your analysis. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because this is the report, it is not a summary, so you just -- as counsel is saying, highlight whatever issues that you think are pertinent for the Trial Chamber to understand and to help it when it comes to read the report, if you feel there is that kind of emphasis to be made.  So I think that is the kind of scope in your testimony that we expect.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Further to what I said this morning, and before I move onto this item, I would like to point out certain things, particularly with regard to the colonial period.  What I want to point out is the feeling of frustration.  I didn't highlight this sufficiently, because this is going to have important consequences later on in future, because as we saw in the letter of Musinga, the caning was a very common occurrence.  It was very common to whip people.  The unit was eight lashes and that could be multiplied.  

Another thing I wanted to point out is the tax, and sometimes somebody's property was taken by force, and sometimes destroy his property and even be sent out, these were very common occurrences.  It was in this kind of atmosphere that some -- a lot of Rwandans went into exile in neighbouring countries, Uganda, Congo, a few of them to Tanganyika, but basically Uganda and Congo.  So that is another phenomenon because people were fleeing from this persecution.  

Yet another aspect which I didn't mention was the distribution of the population.  You will realise that there is no area for Hutus, there is no area for Tutsis, they intermingled with a predominance of Hutus and less Tutsis in the peripheral region as they started dispersing, looking for -- in search of grazing land.  

Now, to come back to the second republic, I already introduced that because the reasons or the pretext, it is up to history to judge that, not me.  But the reason put forward for the coup d'état was to put a stop to the chaos that prevailed at the time, a chaos which was flowing from ethnic, regional, political problems, such that the speech made by President Habyarimana, the authorities of the second republic, was that peace and national unity were the watchwords that came up again and again in a speech, the fact of preaching equality among the citizens be it for ethnic or regional reasons.  He -- let me say that he never stopped preaching peace and national unity, this kept on coming up again an again in all his speeches.  I also mentioned that Mr. Nyetera -- I refer to 
	Mr. Antoine Nyetera, in his testimony before the Belgian parliament, the condition of the Tutsis as it was under the second republic, and he concluded by saying that there was real peace and by saying, particularly after the 5th of July, that the situation improved considerably and that they developed growing enterprises.  I do not list the companies of the Tutsis that he listed, but he did list these.  

He also made reference to inter-ethnic marriages which had become more current while pointing out that it was normal, generally, the Hutu men who married Tutsi women rather than Tutsi men marrying Hutu women.  

I also made reference to the resistance which the Tutsis or people married to the Tutsis -- expressing relations to the advent of the RPF, which was calling upon them to work with them before starting off the war or even at the beginning of the conflict.  I concluded on this point by also pointing out that there was peace as far as inter-ethnic relations were concerned.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you share with the Tribunal what impact, if any, the armed conflict had on inter-ethnic relations?
A.	We have just seen that the atmosphere was peaceful.  It was the period during which there was the least tension amongst the various human groups in Rwanda, that is, from 1973 to 1990, still particularly from the ethnic standpoint.  Now when the conflict started in 1990, 1st October 1990, as it was presented by the media, national media as well as international media, which were accessible at the time, it was a conflict started by former exiles coming from the Ugandan army, because the invasions started from Uganda, and it so happened according to the media and this was confirmed that the invaders were -- the majority of the invaders were members of the regular Rwandan armed forces, and that the majority, the great majority of them were Tutsis.  So --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  You said the majority -- the invaders were from the Rwandan armed forces?  You know, something like that came through the English translation. 
MR. HINDS:
Yes, he said from the regular, there were regular Ugandan armed forces.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did I hear Ugandan or --
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Okay.  Witness, could you just begin your testimony again so that we can clarify that issue. 
A.	What I just said was that the invaders who invaded Rwanda on 1st October 1990, that they were members of the regular Ugandan army, and the members of this army were in the majority former Tutsi exiles who were enlisted in the Ugandan army.  When the media presented a situation as such, the Rwandan population started having an idea of this army and those who lived in the regions that were neighbouring to the conflict zone, their first reaction was a reaction of shock, concern and fear, fear if what was being said happened to be true, because for a long time, the Rwandans have not known war and disturbances.  

The attackers progressively indicated their grievances and progressively indicated the purpose of their war, the objectives of their war, and the first one was to fight against the dictatorship to return democracy, the installation of democracy, the rule of law, the return of refugees and so on and so forth.  

The media as I said, national as well as international media, particularly international media, in this media the Tutsi element came up again and again in most statements, particularly in most statements which are on the conflict, and the conflict started taking an ethnic undertone very vaguely, it came through in that manner.  And once the conflict takes an ethnic undertone, it raised a number of questions, particularly since they have been the first victims of the conflict who were fleeing, and questions that people were posing themselves, particularly when the RPF was saying that it was supported or that the problems in such conditions were that people were afraid.  I just, as is the case in the beginning of such -- every conflict, the first reaction is to know who these people are.  Who are these people who are saying that they are with them?  So these are questions of doubts and I also said of fear.  

The first indications of weariness because we should remember that there was also panic that was setting in it.  It was said that the RPF had taken Kigali.  The media was also saying that they were 100 kilometres or 50 kilometres from the capital and so on and so forth.  So, there was a feeling of panic which I myself observed in Kigali.  So the first effect of the conflict on inter-ethnic relationship is to remind people that there are Hutus and Tutsis.  We had before then started minimising this ethnic division, but now there is a conflict which has an ethnic character, and this is going to raise feelings of doubt and suspicion, and that will lead, for example, to a massive arrests of people in the nights of 4th to the 5th in Kigali, because officially, it appeared that they were shooting during that night, that there was fighting and it was an issue that had never been clarified.  I wouldn't know exactly what happened, but what is certain is that there was a feeling of panic.  

In relation to inter-ethnic relationships, there is another quotation that the Tutsis were afraid about the general feeling of hostility towards them.  Well, these are things that need to be verified but which, nonetheless, portray certain things.  The conflict then quickly - slowly, insidiously led to this Hutu-Tutsi problem because the Tutsi-Hutu problem was mentioned among the objectives of the war.  And when that is put side by side with the Hutu-Tutsi relationship during the colonial period, during the period of the monarchy with everything that recalls the deprivation, the flogging and so on and so forth.  There was unease particularly among the population who suffered those things, there was also unease among the Tutsis who believed in peace, but who saw people who were coming and saying that they were going to take the country back to the situation as it was previously prior to the conflict.  

What I can conclude is that progressively with time, as the conflict progressed towards the -- progressed into the country, into the hinterland of the country, the bulk of the population started fleeing before these people who were called the liberators, and there was a tension, an unease which started -- which was installed.  In general, this is how I look at the evolution of the conflict.  But if you allow me, I can deal with the other points without going into detail.
Q.	Well, Professor, could you just on this one point in summary, if you have to summarise.  How would you describe the reasons being advanced beyond, I would say return on democracy and fighting against discrimination of the attacking forces and what was the perception on the ground by Tutsis on the one hand, and Hutus on the other hand? 
A.	When we go through the literature, when I say literature, I mean the whole body of writings that went round before the outbreak of the war.  It is said that the war was, or the conflict meant for power to reconquer power that was lost in 1959, because as you can see further on, those writings say that we are going to change things as to go back to the situation as it was prior to the revolution.  Others were saying that we need to restore the monarchy.  It is claimed that we have stopped fighting, we are not fighting any longer because there is no king, there is no monarchy, it is now that we are going to do it.  There are a whole number of assertions in that vein to the effect that there was need to change the regime, to replace the regime, the current republican regime with the kind of regime that was in place before 1959, which is called a counter-revolution in relation to the revolution of 1959 or the disorder or the massacre.  

It is obvious that the knowledge of such a speech can only scare the Tutsi -- I mean Hutu, and that can only bring about panic and fear to the Hutus who knew about this pre-1959 regime.  In any case, if it did not create hatred, at least, it created doubts; the young people, you don't need to be born, before 1959 to know what happened, because those who lived those events were still alive and could talk about them.  

So I would say that in general, what they were aiming at was power.  It  was a change of regime,  it was clear and it was obvious.  And then, since things were presented in that manner, it became obvious that people were reacting differently depending on whether you considered yourself as a future beneficiary of the projected institutions or whether you considered yourself as a possible victim of such a projection.  That is how I can answer to that question. 
Q.	Can you share with the Chamber the composition of the democratic forces for change and what role they placed or that body played in the period between 1990 and 1994? 
A.	What is referred to as Democratic Forces for Change, FDC, was a coalition of parties because in an interim, multiparty system had come.  It was a coalition formed by the MDR, the Republican Democratic Movement, the PSD, the Social Democratic Party and the PL, the Liberal Party.  These parties formed the coalition.
MR. HINDS:
Let me just give a reference for the Court.  In the French, it is at page 19 and in the English, reference is on page 27.  Okay.  I am sorry, Witness.  Go ahead.
THE WITNESS:
These three parties formed the coalition in their political struggle against President Habyarimana and his party, the MRND.  Subsequently, and that is in June 1992, they met the RPF in Brussels and came to form an alliance to fight the MRND and what was referred to as Habyarimana's regime, but as at that time, it was no longer Habyarimana regime because there was already a government made up of these three parties, the MRND and the Christian Democratic Party.  So they had formed a government together with the MRND, but during that period of June 1992, I think it was 2nd June 1992, they concluded an alliance with the RPF, an agreement with the RPF and declared that they supported the RPF in its war.  I think that compounded a further -- further compounded a situation, in the sense that it was more difficult to see clearly through the various parties, because on the one hand, there were the belligerents, the RPF, that had attacked Habyarimana's government, and on the other hand, there were certain movements and a number of agreements among parties within the movement.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Professor, can you share with the Chamber whether or not -- if a policy of recruitment by the RPF existed among the youths within Rwanda and what, if any, impact that might have had with respect to inter-ethnic tensions, fears and anxieties? 
A.	I must say that before the outset of the conflict, RPF activities were clandestine activities, and after the advent of the  multiparty system, the RPF operated as a guerrilla movement.  In any event, within the Rwandan political landscape, it was not operating as a political party, because you had an army which was fighting the government party, so its recruitment had always been clandestine, but there were testimonies, revelations by RPF within Rwanda about RPF recruiting mainly, if not exclusively, from the Tutsi and possibly the Hutu, but to operate -- to recruit in that kind of situation, the RPF could not recruit openly in the areas that it did not control, and that is why it had cells within Rwanda.  These were facts that were revealed -- Retemera revealed these facts.  Other witnesses also revealed these facts.  They continued recruiting even when the peace accords had been signed.  They continued recruiting either through its officers who were in Rwanda as part of some missions or through sympathisers who were within the country. 
Q.	What impact, if any, did that have, that as you described clandestine recruitment and the maintenance of cells within Rwanda?  What impact did that have to the ethnic groups on the ground on the 
first-hand, the Tutsis and then the Hutus? 
A.	These recruitments could only have a negative impact because that confirmed the opinion of the population that the RPF was a Tutsi movement, in spite of the denials that it was a Tutsi movement, that was attempting to recruit a Tutsi army, and given that situation in the areas where this recruitments were being carried out, there was some unease, because if someone is fighting your country and he is recruiting from your neighbour's house, you start wondering if that young recruit is -- you wonder since he knows you, that the day they are going to come back whether he is going to leave you, and this is occurring within the context which prevailed in Rwanda not like the one in Iraq, where there is war.  So this situation fuelled the tension and can only bring about mutual unease in relation to each other, such that if a neighbour -- if two neighbouring families, Hutu, Tutsi, the Hutu has his child in the army and the Tutsi has his son with the RPF, there is an unease that is established between those two families even if in the beginning they had good relationships. 
Q.	Now, I would like to bring your attention, Professor, to the events of 1993 and ask you whether you could share with the Chamber the events that took place beginning in February of 1993, and how that may have impacted on the situation on the ground as it were, in terms of the inter-ethnic relations.  
A.	I must say that the attack took place on 8th February, it was not 23rd, sometimes there were typographical areas.  That attack occurred during the negotiation of the Arusha Accords.  There was a negotiation in Arusha, peace negotiations between the RPF, the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Rwandan government, which was a coalition government, a coalition on transition, democratic transition, but a government made up of five parties which I have already mentioned.  So negotiations were going on and the government was led by a Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  Am I to spell the name?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
THE WITNESS:
Nsengiyaremye -- Dismas is not a problem.  Nsengiyaremye is N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  So there were peace negotiations going on between the RPF and the government led by Dr. Dismas Nsengiyaremye.  And here, let me say that the prime minister Nsengiyaremye was a member of the MDR party, the Republican Movement and a member of the FDC; so he was leading the government.  FDC signed an agreement with the MDR, and this attack was a very extensive one, because it started from Ruhengeri, the volcano region.  There is no map here, but I think it is easy to imagine, that is the other side of the préfecture of Kibungo.  

So from east to west, it was an extensive attack on the Byumba and Ruhengeri préfectures.  Those who compiled the figures, and here I referred to Dr. James Gasana.  Gasana is G-A-S-A-N-A.  This attack made 40,000 civilian victims.  It lasted for about eight days, it caused a lot of emotion across the country because it brought about a million displaced people, and indications were everywhere in the country, particularly in Kigali because some of the displaced people found themselves on the outskirts of Kigali, Kigali the capital.  There was a big camp, I think 12 or 15 kilometres from Kigali, a huge camp of displaced people who were living in miserable conditions.  So the attack caused about 40,000 deaths and about a million displaced persons.  These are estimates and obviously, from the political standpoint, it created a confusion because people were wondering how this attack would take place at a time that negotiations were going on.  

In actual fact, the reasons put forward by the RPF or pretext, depending on how you view it, the killings of Tutsi civilians in the Gisenyi region and they claim it was to stop these killings that the RPF attacked.  

Politically therefore, there was this confusion and some people were wondering how an ally of the FDC could attack a territory controlled by an FDC prime minister, so that created a social political unease.  

Another factor which I would like to emphasise, is that, generally, the Byumba and Ruhengeri préfectures, particularly the Ruhengeri préfecture, is a préfecture where you have very few Tutsis, I mean Tutsi citizens.  In Byumba, the east part, they had some Tutsis, but the north-east portion had very few Tutsis and in those regions, it was realised that these were just wanton murders because these were civilian population of farmers, whoever or let me say, not however, but those who were killed, there was no reason that could explain those actions because these were civilians, women, children, elderly persons and so on and so forth.  

There were testimonies on these massacres, distress calls from missionaries and also some associations, I have mentioned, for example, a short passage from what the Ruhengeri préfecture committee wrote, just one aspect of the massacre that took place, and that is the quotation that we have on page 20 of the English portion, but that is just a small portion of what happened.  In that passage the committee said -- it is on page 20 of the French version. 
MR. HINDS:
I think, Your Honour, it is on page 27 in the English version. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, the passage which I have reproduced here at the time I saw the letter, but I didn't have it in hand, but I found a passage in one of the annexes.  In the annexure, it is annex 4, you can refer to that if you so wish. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is he reading from the report or --
MR. HINDS:
He is reporting from the report, which is at page 27. 
THE WITNESS:
It is a passage from the report. 
MR. HINDS:
He is also saying that if you want to fully read the whole letter, it is in the appendix, Appendix 4, which is a separate document we talked about, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't have that in the record.
MR. HINDS:
Well, you don't have it, but it would be made available.  The Prosecutor has it, we have it, but we have not yet submitted it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So let's deal with what we have, so that we don't mix it up.
MR. HINDS:
So he is now just referring to that passage that he has quoted in the report, but he is telling you the source of the full letter. 
(Pages 45 to 53 by Sithembiso Moyo)
































	1530H
MS. OJEMENI:
The witness had testified in the morning to the fact that the appendix is not complete, and I brought it to the attention of the Defence and she said we have to get it from the registry.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the appendix is complete.  The appendix was filed -- was filed with the registry and a copy was, in fact, made for the Prosecution.  I am understanding that in copying, the registry may have copied two pages of one appendix or one of another, or something of that nature, and that, I understand, is being sorted out.  But the full appendix, which are five documents appended to the report, which is now in the English as 52(A) and in the French -- I'm sorry, in the French 52(A) and in the English, 52(B).  That's complete.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
And the witness is now referring to that portion.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So we would like that he makes reference to what is already on record as part of the evidence, so that if you need to follow it up with an extract, then you can round it up at some stage.
MR. HINDS:
Correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that we have something that is -- is on record, is complete and can be ascertained, and if we need to follow it up later, we can do so.
MR. HINDS:
Correct, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, could you tell the witness to --
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, simply refer to what now is before you as your report, and if there is a need later on to deal with appendices, the Court would make the necessary instructions.  Do you understand that? 
A.	Yes, I understand that very well.  That's what I'm going to do. 

Now, in this short passage, it is said:  "After cramming them in abandoned houses or classrooms and torturing them by gouging out their eyes or mutilating them, the RPF kills its victims either with grenades or bullets or chemical weapons, and only the Inkotanyi keep the macabre secret.  Everywhere the RPF went or were stationed, there were lamentations, wailings and desolation.  The people of Ruhengeri and Byumba are currently experiencing a real genocide.  As a matter of fact, pregnant women are being disembowelled, children and women are being stabbed to death, men are being mutilated and bleed to death."

So this is a short passage which shows the horrors or the horrible conditions under which some of the victims died.  

Obviously there were victims.  There were censuses made, there were reports which mentioned some persons, but generally speaking authorities who are known are cited, such as the bourgmestres and so on.  Well, there is also the general populace, as you can see, and many civilian victims, especially people who were unable to flee because, as I have said, there were almost one million displaced persons, people who had fled or people who said to themselves that, "Well, these people are saying they are our liberators, but I have nothing to fear," and they were taken unawares, given the situation that subsequently obtained.

So this is the attack of 8th February 1993 which had an enormous impact, given -- a negative impact, given the number of victims involved, civilian victims.  These were not soldiers.  Soldiers would never reveal the victims they suffered.  And the number of displaced persons are also indicated. 

Now, from the volcanoes -- from the volcanoes, Karisimbi volcano in particular, you go through Ruhengeri south, you go through Kigali prefecture, and in Byumba there was no longer anyone except maybe towards the east.  So all this area, this whole line, had displaced persons' camps.  

So the consequence, obviously, is that -- how were people going to die whilst negotiations were ongoing? That was a question raised.  And the lack of an answer to that question made it that there was a socio-political unease that reigned.
Q.	Now, just a clarification, Witness.  The events that you say that unfolded, called attack of February 8, 1993, was the initiation of that in Kigali or Ruhengeri?
A.	Can I ask -- are you talking about the attack, or which events exactly are you referring to, Counsel?  I'm not quite with you.
Q.	We are talking about the attack of February 8 of 1993 that you have just described.  The question is whether or not that attack initiated -- was initiated in Ruhengeri or was it in Kigali; just for clarification. 
A.	It's an RPF attack which involved attacking from the border area which was already under its control and towards the interior.  It was not from Kigali or Ruhengeri; rather, it was directed towards the interior, in other words, the towns of Ruhengeri, Gisenyi, Kigali and Kibungo to the east of the country.
Q.	Now -- does the Court --

MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no; go on, Counsel, please. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, from the standpoint of the people on the ground, based upon what you've testified concerning what was happening, how did that attack, based upon all of the research that you have done, how did that impact people ultimately on the ground, both Hutus and Tutsis, including those people who were displaced, in terms of their state of mind, their mental state?
A.	I must say that the displaced persons moved of their own free will.  What I mean is that between life and death, they were choosing life.  And life -- since they already knew of the existence of some victims, some were members of their families; there were acquaintances, neighbours.  So when they saw what was coming, they fled.  And when they fled, I am saying that they went into displaced persons' camps without adequate assistance provided to them, assistance in the form of food, water, shelter, and so on and so forth.  

So it's quite clear that they were very angry.  They were angry with those who, in their eyes, were responsible for the conditions under which they were living.  And when they arrived -- and you mustn't lose sight of this -- when they arrived, the people were no longer able to remain calm.  

Why did they lose their tranquility?  These were people who were not assisted and they couldn't die of hunger when they could see banana plantations across; they could see fields of sweet potatoes; they couldn't die of hunger when they were seeing fields of beans.  They couldn't go without wood for them to use in building a makeshift shelter when there were private forest lands nearby.  

What I mean is, when they got to these places, they had to manage in order to make do, and people who saw them arrive could not say, "Don't touch my bananas, don't touch my trees, don't touch my potatoes" because these people were dying of hunger. 

So you will understand that the people at the places where they reached also had reasons to be troubled and unhappy because it was the fruit of their labour which they were losing.  

The consequence of all this is that there was this feeling of hostility towards the RPF and what it was seen to represent, what it was supposed to represent, the anger, the anger of the displaced persons themselves, as well as the anger of the populations which had received the displaced persons.  

We have spoken about recruitment of young Tutsis by the RPF.  So it's obvious that Tutsis, for instance, who lived in this area, were right in being disturbed because they say these people who are being sent away by the RPF, the RPF which is seen as a Tutsi movement, they are going to believe that we are laughing in their faces, that we are accomplices of the RPF.  
So there is this situation of unease amongst all these people and this is automatically leading to serious unease, and even amongst people who needn't have been afraid.  They became afraid because they were wondering what these people were going to eat once they had finished destroying what was in the fields. 

So, you see, this is a situation which led to the fact that the Tutsis, when they saw what -- once they saw what the supposed RPF brothers had done and then they see children who were responsible, and even if sometimes -- what I mean is it was not automatic because amongst the displaced persons there were also Tutsis; there were also Tutsis who had fled to where they felt they could continue living in safety. 

I would, therefore, like to conclude by saying that this situation, of necessity, created frustration, feelings of anger and mistrust.  And when one is seen as belonging to one or the other of the groups, it is obvious then that one is not in a comfortable situation. 
Q.	Witness, did these attacks result in reprisals, and reprisals by whom, against whom?
A.	In actual fact, there were no reprisals.  There was this unease, as I said, in the region of Gisenyi which was used as a pretext by the RPF to attack.  And following that attack, what was done is that the authorities tried, as well as the political parties, they tried to contain the situation for it not to deteriorate, because even the people in Kigali, even the members of the coalition government, the famous five political parties, they did not know what the result of all this might be, an advance of the RPF on Kigali, because the attack of the 8th February pushed the RPF to about 40 or so kilometres from the city of Kigali.  

So, there was this sudden feeling of disquiet and people wanted to stop the war and proceed with the negotiations because a certain number of people in Kigali, when the war is being waged, apparently far away, because in Rwanda 40 kilometres is quite far -- it's not the same thing as in the United States or in Russia -- forty kilometres is a long way away.  And these were people who, seeing how the refugees were living 12 kilometres away from the camps around Kigali, they would go and beg in the towns and come back in the evenings.  

Everybody was, therefore, concerned, and the main concern was how to stop this bloody war.  How was one going to ensure that the negotiations proceed?  And there was pressure exerted on the government and accusations leveled at the RPF because one wanted the negotiations to conclude and to avoid the misery and poor conditions that followed. 
Q.	Now, Professor, during this time period that you are now testifying about, can you share your insights based upon your research with the Tribunal as to whether or not there was a policy of politically motivated, selected assassinations of political figures and, if so, what evidence do you have to support that?
MR. PRESIDENT:
He did touch on that, has he, when he talked about bourgmestres?  We know the specific terms, yes.
MR. HINDS:
I don't think he -- I wanted him to focus on it in terms of what specific evidence does he have to support that, if it, in fact, occurred.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he did mention, if he can do so.  If he can do it in a summary form, Counsel, because we really want to move forward.  We will read his report.
MR. HINDS:
We will finish today, Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are on page 20, 30.
MR. HINDS:
Page 30 of the English, Your Honour, and page --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 20 of the French.
MR. HINDS:
Page 20 of the French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So there's a need to move reasonably fast.
MR. HINDS:
Yes. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Yes, Witness, can you share with us what information do you have as to whether or not there were politically motivated assassinations directed towards political figures? 
A.	Specifically, during this attack, I spoke of some authorities who were killed.  Obviously, I also mentioned the population which fell victim.  But what I can say, what I have observed from the ground, because I was in Ruhengeri at the time, is that, generally speaking, no local authority -- and here I'm referring to the préfet, sous-préfet, subprefect, bourgmestre, and what was known as the conseiller de secteur, those at a lower level, and possibly the responsable du cellule, cellule officials.  Maybe this would be 50 or so families; I'm not sure of the exact figure.  People of this category who were captured would never survive.  They would be assassinated.  

The same thing applied to civil servants.  And in the case of Byumba, I don't have any data.  What I know is that the préfet had to run into the fields; he was evacuated by someone who was passing by.  But in Ruhengeri, the authorities which were captured would be, for instance, the bourgmestre of Kinigi commune.  He was known as Thadée Gasana.  Gasana is spelled G-A-S-A-N-A, Gasana.  He was bourgmestre of Kinigi.  He was unable to flee and he was killed, together with others.

Now, in Ruhengeri town, the civil servants who were unable to flee in the initial stages of the attack were assassinated, and this was the case of the vice-president of the court of appeal.  I remember his name.  He was named as Barengayabo.  He is mentioned in the annex, but we may as well mention his name here: François Barengayabo.  His last name is spelt B-A-R-E-N-G-A-Y-A-B-O, Barengayabo.  And he was killed with some of his family.  

The president of the court of appeal was able to flee.  There was also one Munyaneza, Bosco.  Munyaneza is spelt M-U-N-Y-A-N-E-Z-A, Munyaneza, Bosco.  He was the trial attorney for the prosecution, prosecutor's office.  

There was also another Ntibiringanira.  It is spelt N-T -- N-T-E -- I'm sorry,
 N-T-I-B-I-R-I-N-G-A-N-I-R-A.  He was also deputy prosecutor.  He was also assassinated.  From my memory, this is what I can give you as names. 

But in other communes, there were other victims, local officials who were caught unawares, and this supposed that they had political affiliations which were different from that of the RPF.  In that region, there were very few adherents of the RPF.  

Have I answered the whole question? 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  Now, I'd like to ask you just to give us your analysis of the Arusha Peace Accords in terms of whether or not -- withdraw -- the Arusha Peace Accords in terms of how that process and result was seen from the standpoint of the two major ethnic groups on the ground; that is Tutsis and Hutus, what were they looking for or forward to from the accord and whether or not it was realised. 
A.	I must say that the Arusha Accords had a lot of expectations from everyone because, in actual fact, except for a few politicians I don't know, but the Rwandan people did not want anything which -- anything which could stop this war was welcome, especially given that, contrary to other cases, this war -- I don't know, you could see women, children, people who had absolutely nothing to do with the war, who were killed as that war raged.  So the Rwandan people expected a great deal from the Arusha Accords because the war had already caused tens of thousands of victims; some go as far as saying that there were up to a hundred thousand victims before 1994.

Now, as to the conditions under which these accords were negotiated, these conditions raised a certain number of problems or difficulties because the conflict itself, at least in the perception of the ordinary Rwandan, was one which was not understood in its entire scope.  What I mean is that it wasn't a secret that the attackers, although they were of Rwandan origin, the attackers were part of a regular army which was foreign, the Ugandan army.  So the Rwandan people had followed with a great deal of disquiet the development of this war which involved part of the Ugandan army and possibly elements which were not of the RPF but belonged to the Ugandan army and Rwanda.  So, generally, people were asking why one was not simply talking about a war between Rwanda and Uganda.  That's one point. 

But from the point in time that the Rwandan government of the time was not able to admit to that reality, the next phase was at least to stop the war and find a solution. The conditions under which these agreements were signed, there were other delegations: the RPF delegation which was a solid delegation, and then there was the Rwandan delegation, which was divided.  It was divided because there were the democratic forces for change, some of which were favourable to the RPF, and others were somewhat cold.  But there was that force, and within that force there was no cohesion at all times; another part of that government delegation which was mainly the MRND and then there was the Christian Democrat Party which was somewhat to the side because this was part of the small party.  

So when these negotiations were ongoing, the conditions were rather chaotic because often members of these delegations would fight one another and they would rarely present a unanimous, concerted and uniform stand, opposition, and this made it that the Rwandan people were wondering about the end of the negotiations, given the conditions under which the negotiations were taking place; and the government delegation was not unanimous. 

Later on, one was to hear one of the political parties state -- and I think this was before the French parliamentary commission; I think it was Twagiramungu, and he was saying that there was a monopoly of the Arusha negotiations by the opposition parties, one party, in fact, the FDC.  So one can understand, because he says this as an afterthought, but it was understood at the time that it was not difficult when someone is involved and he was unable to say so at the time. 

So what I would say is that these negotiations, as they were carried out, there was a lot of chaos and the public opinion learned that there was often pressure exerted on one or the other negotiators so that the negotiations could move on, and so on and so forth.  And the result was, I think, within the level of the troops.  

First of all, these were discussions on the political modalities, the management of the transitional phase, and so on and so forth and, obviously, the army.  But, generally speaking, the result was considered as somewhat unbalanced, and this was the general opinion of the people.  And, therefore, the accords were criticised; there were sometimes demonstrations against those accords.  But at the time it was being said that one part of the government, the government delegation, was intransigent, and so on and so forth, but the result was seen as being -- was considered as being imbalanced and not realistic.  

I'm saying all this because much later, after 1994, members of the international community, especially amongst those who were in the observer delegations observing these negotiations -- I'm speaking, for instance, of Herman Cohen, the Secretary of State of the United States of America -- he followed these agreements and he said that these -- the results were unrealistic, and he was shocked when he got to learn of the results of the accords.  

Other diplomats said that the accords were so much more advantageous for the RPF that the extremists of the other side would never accept them.  So everyone, in fact -- if I'm saying everybody I'm maybe exaggerating a bit, but there were -- amongst those people who were observing these negotiations from close quarters, it was said that pressure was being exerted upon the participants so that there could be a compromise.  And there were people who, in the final analysis, said that the negotiation -- the results of the negotiations were unrealistic or, at least, unimplementable, therefore, difficult to put into practice, which means that they were inappropriate for bringing about a real peace.

When I'm talking about realistic, the battalion of the RPF at Kigali, Herman Cohen referred to it as foule.  In English, I imagine one could say "mad", fou, without any exaggeration.  So this is how the negotiations were described by external observers.  

Another opinion which came out while the French commission -- the French parliamentary was discussing the Rwandan events was that the international community was dealing with the Rwandan case as if it were a small civilian war, and whereas for Rwanda it was much greater than that, and one needed to have taken into account the divisions within the government party or delegation. 

The diplomats who followed the negotiations, in other words, the international community, wanted to have an agreement despite the conditions, despite the impact or the applicability of these Arusha Accords.  And that's what I can say about them.
Q.	Witness, I'd like to --
MS. OJEMENI:
With the greatest of respect, Your Honour, I urge you to direct the witness to testify on his report, and if, indeed, he is testifying outside the report, he should let the Court know, like as you directed earlier.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think the witness is testifying with respect to his report.  He mentions Herman Cohen.  That is in the report at -- in English, at page 29, and in the French, at page 21.  He -- I mean, it is clear what he is saying is within the four corners of the report.  There isn't anything that is referred to outside of his report. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but we would like him to introduce and elucidate on the report, really, because this is what we are going to work on.  Because if there's any new aspect we would like to know because we may have to look for it, so Counsel for the Prosecution may be making a point there.  So we really emphasise that he should, as much as possible, summarise and introduce elements that are really essential.  We have the report.  We are going to read it.
MR. HINDS:
Yes, Your Honour, but he has mentioned nothing outside of his report.  He talked about the French parliamentary committee.  It is right at page 29.  He talked about security council considerations within that.  He talks about Herman Cohen.  What came out is Secretary of State, but actually he is Undersecretary of State for African Affairs, in terms of a correction.  But that is in the report, so there isn't anything that the man has said -- that the professor has said that isn't within the report.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, let's go on and if he can be brief, please.  Because we are going to make use -- we have read and we will reread this report.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Professor, as you address the issues, be brief, but certainly give us the full context, but be as brief as possible in balancing -- giving us an understanding of the matters, recognising that the Court has before it the full report.  So you don't have to read the report, just summarise, amplify and move on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Or lead us to anything that you think is important by way of page or paragraph.  We will come to it.  So we don't want you to give us another lecture, as it were.  I know --
MR. HINDS:
The problem with professors.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So please be very brief, but as Counsel is saying, without forgetting to tell us what you want to demonstrate before the Trial Chamber for better understanding of the report or better following up of whatever you may have said in your report.  That's all we need, and that's the meaning of the report, of having the report. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q. Now, Professor, can you share with the Tribunal the events or impact of the events in neighbouring Burundi in October of 1993 and what impact that had on the ground, again, between the ethnic groups during that time period in Rwanda?

MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, what time are we taking the break? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, maybe we can -- maybe we can take it now so that we come back and continue.  We will start with this one when we come back.
MR. HINDS:
Witness, we are taking a break now and we will start back with that question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, we will take a break for 15 minutes and resume our work at 25 past 4:00; 25 past 4:00.
	(Court recessed from 1607H to 1627H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Yes, you are addressing --
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, the pending question is can you briefly share with the Trial Chamber the impact of events in neighbouring Burundi in October of 1993 on inter-ethnic relations in Rwanda?
A.	Yes.  The events had a very negative impact because Ndadaye's election, even though Ndadaye's election brought about a lot of optimism, his assassination and the thousands of displaced people that followed had a lot of shock and this had a negative impact in Rwanda, particularly on the multiparty system but particularly on inter-ethnic relationships because progressively there was a bi-ethnic polarisation not only within the population but, this time round, around political parties. 
Q.	Now, Witness, can you share with the Tribunal what role, if any, the media played in exacerbating inter-ethnic relations?
A.	Let me say, first of all, that I categorise the media.  There were writings that prepared the conflict, writings that sensitised the international opinion but also RPF militants and, generally, those media are those that criticised the republican regime and suggested the return to the regime of pre-1959.  And most of the extremist Tutsis -- this idea came normally from the extremist Tutsis.  

For the other media, the internal media, I must say that they reflect the viewpoint either of the political party that they are members of or the viewpoint of their sponsors of the media, in which case they make contributions to the discussion from the standpoint of the sponsor.  If he is an extremist, the newspaper will reflect his views.  But it must also be said that there is a bit of ambiguity in the media because sometimes the ideological debate is sidestepped and it becomes an individualised matter. 

With regard to radios, radio broadcasts, there was Radio Rwanda, which reflected the views of the government and also the party that normally is in charge of the ministry of information.  But besides that, there was Radio Muhabura, and Radio Muhabura, obviously, was an RPF radio, which started transmitting in the first months or, at least, the first year of the war and which carried positions of the RPF, positions which were already to be found in the media that prepared the war.  And considered from that perspective, then it can be said that they reflected a certain trend.  And Radio Muhabura covered a large area because they transmitted in shortwave.  

And there was the RTLM, which was a limited liability company.  This is a radio station that was set up getting to the end of '93.  I think they started transmitting end of '93, early '94, depending on where one was in Kigali.
	(Pages 54 to 64 by Karen L. Holm)


























	1630H
Q.	The reference, Your Honour, is at page 40 in the English, and at page 29 at the French.
THE WITNESS:
May I continue?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, slowly; slightly slowly.
THE WITNESS:
Very well.  The RTLM started broadcasting end '93, beginning '94, and I was saying that it covered a limited area because it had only one transmitter first off.  Initially it covered the Kigali region and then it went on to Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, and it was also in certain areas depending on the conditions of reception.  

Now, what I was saying is that these media -- I'm trying to put these media on an ideological platform, because these are media which represents -- which represent different trends, and in that regard I put all of them at the same level, in the sense that these are debates in society conducted in a certain manner.  But the real issue, the principal issue for the media was ideology, which each one was projecting.  Radio Muhabura put - put Muhabura and RTLM at the same level because they had taken a position in relation to the revolution of 1959, either for or against the revolution of 1959.  We -- reference has been made to extremists, and so on and so forth, and I believe, once again, that it is in relation to the position that one takes vis-à-vis the revolution of 1959 that one can conclude that this or that media house is extremist. 

I could also mention Kangura -- Kangura, which very often is cited among the hate media, but I distinguish specific articles appear in a certain newspaper in relation to the general thrust of that newspaper.  And in that regard Kangura is among the written -- the print media.  Kangura is in the print media which took a position in favour of the 1959 position.  And in that regard, Kangura, just as RTLM, was indirectly answering Muhabura, which started about two or three years earlier.  They were responding directly.  I don't know how they received their publications; they were responding to the publications before the beginning of the war.  It is, therefore, in relation to one's position to '59 that one can judge the media.  

Now, regarding international media houses, generally, international media, when they make reference to some war zones, we found this very often manipulating or, at least, the quest for the sensational.  And sometimes with -- effects which could be -- with facts which could be real but presented in a slanted manner as to give a false - a wrong imagine.  Radio France International once said that they were only 100 kilometres from Kigali.  One hundred kilometres from Kigali, if you live in Rwanda, the Uganda border, that is only 75 kilometres from Kigali, so the concepts, the notion of distance is manipulated and can lead to certain consequences.  It can, for example, bring about external pressure which is not necessary ---
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can the speaker slow down?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Slow down.  The Interpreter would like you to slow down.
THE WITNESS:
To be at 60 kilometres of Kigali --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but don't forget your summary, slow down. 
THE WITNESS:
I gave that example to be 60 kilometres from Kigali coming from Uganda is not like being 60 kilometres from Washington coming from Russia.  If the enemy is attacking from the Canadian border or Russia, if it's - if the enemy is 60 kilometres that is serious, but 60 kilometres from Kigali coming from Uganda is a lot.  So, I am saying that the dimensions were not the same.  There were several cases of manipulation.  

I will say, in general, that there were other aspects, that the media sometimes handled the war in a very light manner without taking into account the fact that in certain situations they were fuelling the war.  For example, when they were emphasising these old Tutsis who were coming back, and so on and so forth, whereas, specifically, these were not people designated by all the Tutsis.  Let me conclude by saying that due to certain positions taken by certain media houses, the media sometimes manipulated or they were not conversant with the facts, even when they were briefed either from inside or outside. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, I would like to direct your attention to another area, and can you share with the Tribunal what impact, if any, the platforms or manifestos of the five parties played in interethnic conflict within Rwanda?
A.	I will say that if we look at the political parties from the ideological standpoint, we find we can distinguish three trends.  There is one republican democratic trend, that is the MRD and MRND and later on the CDR.  There was -- there was the social Christian democratic, social democratic trend, that was the PSD and PDC.  And then a liberal trend, which was represented by the Liberal Party.  And when we look at the program manifestoes, the MDR and MRND were ideologically not different; not different because they explicitly recognised the revolution of 1959.  CDR, it was the same; PSD was the same, but they did not emphasise as the other parties.  The Liberal Party was the only party that did not recognise the 1959 revolution.  In reality, the PL maintain that is an ideology, but we observe that the MDR, who abandoned this ideology because it is ideology that ran counter to the FDR (sic) ideology which -- that was to enable them to align themselves.  So, on the field -- on the ground, MDR made very little reference to the 1959 revolution whereas it was the watchword for the MRND and the CDR.  

The problem that will come up later on was that, finally, the bulk of MDR will come back to this ideology which they shelved, and that was going to create problem between the FDC and RPF, because they came back to the ideology -- the republican ideology and the need for 1959 and the choice of electoral choices, and that brought them, again, counter to the RPF, which was against the 1959 revolution.
Q.	Now, Professor, I'd like now to bring you to 1994, and I'd like you to share with the Chambers your analysis of whether or not there was any impact on or implications for events that unfolded in 1994 from the armed conflict that preceded it?
A.	Yes.  I'm going to summarise by saying that the events of 1994 were, first of all, the death of President Habyarimana and Ntaryamira of Burundi and other members of the delegation.  Let me spell those names, especially Ntaryamira because that is the first time it is coming up: N-T-A-R-Y-A-M-I-R-A.  So it is the death of those two presidents and their delegations, then the killings and the events which constituted something that had never been seen in that country, that is, the death of millions or thousands of people.  

That event -- I am referring to the death of the president -- there were some people who said the plane was attacked, took place at a time when tension had reached an extreme level, the political tension, ethnic tension, social tension, economic problems, and so on and so forth, it was at a time when the country was actually on its knees, if I may use that expression, or let me say on the threshold of disaster.  What led the country there?  It was the armed conflict, and we have made reference to the negotiations; there was stalling, there was stalling regarding its implementation -- the implementation of the agreement, the Accord.  In spite of the signing of the agreement, some analysis -- some analysts have said that in actual fact there was preparation of the war which never stopped on each side, because some people were saying that on the government side, they knew that the RPF was preparing, with evidence that that they were preparing -- the RPF claimed that the Government was preparing for war.  So, a situation when one of the leaders of -- one of the leaders of the one belligerent forces has been killed -- has been killed, and investigations would prove or disprove this, particularly in a situation where the suspects, the person who is suspected to be the perpetrator of the killing of one of the leaders, is considered to be the other belligerent force, particularly in the ethnic situation that we had, it was obvious that this would lead to an uncontrollable situation; uncontrollable because, particularly on the government side, the conflict -- the conflict had paralysed the entire system, political, administrative economic, social; the entire social fabric had been destroyed.  So, the events which followed the death are simply consequences or a stage of the armed conflict.  That is the way I see things.  That is the way I can analyse them.  

So, there were consequences of the death on the events that followed, because these events are direct consequences of the conflict, because that situation was created by the conflict, and the events that followed are part and parcel of one and the same conflict.
Q.	Witness, can you -- I'm now looking at causation.  Can you share with the Tribunal why you say that the events, that is, the events of 1994, were directly impacted in and caused by the armed conflict that preceded it?
A.	Let me start by referring to the by ethnic polarisation.  At the beginning, we saw that there was peace, that there was harmony, there was no ethnic antagonism.  And with the conflict, this antagonism would progressively seep into the society with the attacks, the deaths that followed, the displacement that followed, until when we saw the last event, which is the death of Ntaryamira, which led to a break -- mistrust, which brought about mistrust between the two groups.  And up until the war, where there was RPF and pro-RPF and then anti-RPF and, therefore, pro-Habyarimana, we had never been -- we had never gotten into that kind of situation before the conflict.  

Before the conflict the -- economically there were problems, but it had not reached the situation that we had in 1994, because in 1994 there were a number of -- there was, there were a number of issues that came to bear on the economy.  The army -- we talked about the army, for example, we talked about the displaced persons, for example, a million displaced people, a million people who came from one of the regions of the country which was the bread basket of the country and which was not producing any longer.  And further, the social fabric had disintegrated because of the generalised insecurity, such that there was -- there was some kind of mistrust of people that you did not know or people who belonged to other -- to other political trends.  And then there was also, when I am talking -- when I am referring to security, there was the problem of weapons which were in circulation in a situation where we have soldiers who desert and you have weapons being sold in the market, so there was a generalised situation of insecurity, so that the authorities - the themselves were overwhelmed because there was media propaganda to discredit it.  So this was a generalised situation created by the conflict such that nobody was in a situation to control it, at least the day after the death of the president of the republic, nobody was in a position to ensure peace; the situation was completely chaotic.  And these elements lead me to present that as consequences of the armed conflict.
Q.	Now, finally, Professor, can you share with the Tribunal the conditions -- your analysis of the conditions, the objective conditions that were on the ground, that is, between the relationships of the two groups, the ethnic groups, Tutsis and Hutus, that impacted on what unfolded in February -- withdrawn, in April 7th of 1994, almost nine years to the day today, with respect to the death of the president?
A.	Can you clarify the question because there is something that I don't understand.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
It was even convoluted for me.  Let me try again. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Professor, can you share with the Tribunal, from the standpoint of the two ethnic groups on the ground in Rwanda on April 7th 1994, the impact of the death of President Hayrimana (sic).
A.	President Habyarimana was someone who, up until that point, had managed, each time there was a problem, managed to ensure peace and was listened to.  Let me give two examples:  The day after Gatabazi 's death -- Gatabazi was the secretary general of PSD -- should I spell his name, this is the first time he is coming up?  Gatabazi is G-A-T-A-B-A-Z-I.  There was an explosive situation following his death.  The president managed to restore peace, and particularly managed to install Mr. Bucana.  Bucana is B-U-C-A-N-A.  Mr. Bucana was president of the CDR.  He was assassinated the day after the assassination of Mr. Gatabazi, which brought us to the most explosive situation that we had seen since the February '93 attack.  

When the president died, there was a situation of confusion in the government party because there was no more authority -- there was nobody who could speak with any authority, and the Hutus were more afraid than the Tutsi because their attitude was that if they are able to get to that man, then what will become of us, because he was protected by his guards and so on and so forth?  Now, those of us poor, what is going to become of us.  Now, the Tutsi, we saw how Ntaryamira said that Habyarimana had been able to protect the Tutsi, had integrated in the social life, so they were also worried.  But that said, there was the work done by the infiltrators to bring about discord between the ethnic groups, so the work done by these infiltrators was such that they brought about doubts in the minds of certain people, leading some people, some Tutsis, to take aggressive stands.  So there was fear on each side; each one afraid of the other, not knowing how they were going to survive.  So, it was a situation where people were thinking about their survival, wondering how they were going to survive their situation.
Q.	Now, Witness, there have been terms that have been used during this trial and, as a social linguist, we would like you to assist the Tribunal in providing an understanding of how terms were used, the history of their development and, perhaps, how they have been used by various protagonists on the ground.  And I am referring to that portion of your report where you talk about demystification of key terms used in the conflict.  And we would like you to start with the term Interahamwe.  Can you share with the Tribunal that term, how it is used and how it took on particular meaning as events unfolded in 1994 for the Court?  For - the Court reference is 69 in the English and 51 in the French. 
A.	Thank you.  This term Interahamwe, I don't know whether I need to go into his composition and so on and so forth because I don't think that is important.  What I will do, however, is to indicate that, because I have read in some publications, especially in 1994-1995 thereabouts, where Interahamwe was translated by "those who attack together".  This means that there is a need for us to see the meaning of that term Interahamwe.  In truth, in the report I indicated how the word is decomposed (sic) or broken down; I won't go into that right now.  

But already we see the verb gutera from which is it is derived.  It is spelt G-U-T-E-R-A.  Gutera has several meanings in Kinyarwanda, but I have mentioned "attack" because that has been used, and has been used as a definition by some Rwandans who are speaking in specific context.  And, in fact, gutera means to attack, but it also means, as I have indicated, to appear; it means to plant.  There are many meanings.  But even in the word Interahamwe, means together, but rather it means those who seem alike or similar, so they look alike, they are identical.  So, if you can look at that -- a queue of school children of the same height, they would -- one could say (Kinyarwanda spoken) that they are the same.  So this can be used in other fields, especially in the abstract.  So Interahamwe would mean people who share ideas, who see the same objective or look through the same lens. as it were; so in other words, they are in solidarity.  Interahamwe means solidarity.  

This is a word which I have also heard often in a song in the 1960s.  But it is also a word which is common, but I wouldn't say it is understandable because it is not in common use.  It is used to describe men or youths or persons who are in solidarity and share the same ideas.  

The term Interahamwe got into the political arena to describe a group of people; this was in 1991 with the birth of multipartyism.  It was launched as a word by someone who formed a think tank.  It was a group of young people; it was a think tank.  Desire Murenzi, M-U-R-E-N-Z-I, he was a member of the MRND, which means the republican national movement for democracy and development, because you need to make a distinction between the former MRND and the MRND of 1991 onwards.  Now this man, where he was in Kigali, he set up a reflection group of young people for the exchange of ideas, but also to try to create a new political awareness, because there was competition because parties were trying to recruit members.  So Interahamwe meant or referred to these youths.  These were not children, they were young civil servants or youths from the neighbourhood.  They would be brought together for them to come and carry out political or ideological reflection, to see how they could win over members for their parties.  That was indeed the objective because at that time the MDR was predominant in Kigali, so gradually, and as multipartyism and political competition increased, there were many youths or young people in Kigali.  

I must say that the Interahamwe was an urban phenomenon.  It is a phenomenon which took place in Kigali, because that is where the powers that be were to be found, and the parties who wanted to have power, they would need to come to Kigali first before they could gain the rest of the country.  So there was competition between MRND, the MDR, the PSD and the Liberal Party, PL.  And Interahamwe was the youth of the MRND, which was in competition with these other parties.  It was at their -- at that level that you need to situate this word.  And the MDR set up Inkuba, a youth group which was in competition with Interahamwe.  Inkuba is spelt I-N-K-U-B-A, Inkuba, and it means thunder.  And the MDR youth were, therefore, referred to as Inkuba, thunder.  It was in this framework that the word was used in the political domain, in order to refer to the youths of the MRND who were in competition or in parallel to the other youths from other political parties.  

Very well, with time, generally speaking, the competition amongst the youths was conscribed within Kigali and in some towns but basically in Kigali.  Now, with time, as I was saying, we saw the FDC, how that force was formed in 1992, the objective of the MDR, of the thunder, was to re -- was to overthrow the Habyarimana regime of the MRND.  This didn't succeed.  There was an attempt at referring to the Interahamwe as militia, similar to the FDC, because they did not manage to remove them -- uproot them from Kigali.  But they were not really militiamen, they were people who were responsible for political entertainment during meetings, in other words, dance and that kind of thing.  In English, the term is entertainment.  So gradually, Interahamwe in -- those who were against the Interahamwe, is going to gain the meaning of militia and it is approached to the RPF -- it is likened to the RPF, so much so, that the RPF, the militants of the MRN -- the MDR, were considered as Interahamwe, whereas previously, Interahamwe were basically youths.  

In the events of 1994, with the division of political parties, the FDC split and there would be Inkuba within MDR, which is anti-RPF, some remained, but to stay with the term Interahamwe, because in the beginning, initially, it talked about youths who were thinking about resources of -- and ways of increasing their political influence and who, politically, through demonstrations, because that also happened, they had to confront other youths, eventually the term Interahamwe, after the division within the political parties, the term will get to be applied to all these youths who are against the RPF.  In other words, youths and political trends which had moved away from the RPF and joined what was known as the pro-Habyarimana movement.  Whereas there was no merger between the MRND youths and the other youths, but eventually, in opposition to the RPF, these youths would generally acquire the name Interahamwe.  

In 1994 I was saying that the situation was very much out of control.  What does that mean?  This meant that there were prisons which were no longer there.  In some areas, prisoners had been released because they couldn't be controlled, whereas the war was on the threshold.  There were many people unemployed, there were deserters amongst the citizenship, there was also ordinary criminals, bandits and so on.  So all these people would acquire the weapons which were in circulation and they were there -- all these people were there just doing nothing.  And quite generally speaking, it was a group of people who were young, some less young, and the idea was that each person was going to make himself someone more important, so he was going to say I am this or I am that.  And all these people got involved in crimes, armed robbery, because you see there was this situation of a war; you have many people who use those opportunities.  Whilst other people are fighting, they would be looting left and right.  Now, looting in Rwanda was generally involving the use of arms, others were involving militiamen, and it was not only one group that was targeted but everybody, all these people who were in the pro-government parties and were involved in all these things which were happening, the killings of Tutsis, all the thefts and robberies; I don't know, all kinds of crimes.  And there would be a term to cover all these activities, and that term is Interahamwe.  So you see the development of the term, and it ends up by defining in post-1994 parlance, genocidier, those who committed the genocide; they were the ones who committed all the crimes against humanity.  And even if one doesn't know to which party these people belonged, even if they didn't belong to any party, they were all these people -- all these people were referred to as the Interahamwe.  So the Interahamwe, the term, gets a wider meaning.  It comes from the initial group and it will cover all these people, be they identified or non-identified -- identifiable or unidentifiable.  So the term Interahamwe, you have seen how it developed, while stressing that the initial Interahamwe remained Interahamwe in the strict sense of the term.  They recognised themselves as such.  Now, the others who were referred to as Interahamwe, they probably included the initial Interahamwe; there were probably Inkuba in there.  There were probably Abakombozi, those of the PSD, maybe there were also the people of the RPF, because these were people who also were infiltrated.  There were a certain number of people who belonged to these political parties, but didn't belong to political parties and went about with weapons in order to be able to survive.  So, all these people end up being referred to as Interahamwe, even though they don't share the same ideology, even though they don't belong to the same political party, in other words, the MRND political party.  That is with regard to the term Interahamwe.  May I move to the next word? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HINDS:
May we move to the next --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, can you share with us your understanding of the derivative, the use of the term Inkotanyi within the context of that term being used in 1994 and its historical roots? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And also bearing in mind that we have it in the report, as well, Witness. 
MR. HINDS:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I think for the background of the term Inkotanyi one can refer to the report.  But it is a term which has been there for a long time, either in the form of Inkotanyi itself or the term Abakombozi, which is more or less the same.  But from 1990, when the RPF attacked, it was the RPF Inkotanyi, the Rwandan patriotic front, the Rwandan patriotic army, the RPA.  So this is the RPF, which is the army -- the political front, and then the army, the RPA, and this led me to conclude that the Inkotanyi was the equivalent -- was the equivalent of the RPA which designates the RPF's army.  

In another meaning, Inkotanyi refers to a soldier of that body, in other words, a soldier of the RPF, and that is what it is in reality.  I did not develop this further than that, because as it is presented in that manner it is quite clear.  It is obvious that if someone is not a member of the RFF and you refer to that person as an Inkotanyi, he is either someone involved in a lie or someone who has done something wrong.  I don't need to elaborate any further on that.  Therefore, Inkotanyi has very specific meaning.  It did not have the opportunity to suffer the fate of the term Interahamwe, in other words, get to the level of an extrapolation which would make it become a term which contains immense meanings which it did not have at the outset.  

So, I think I have done with Inkotanyi, unless maybe -- I didn't mention this aspect in the report -- but it can also possibly mean -- I don't have any precise example, it could mean an activist of the RPF.  It's something that I did not go into in depth, but I could mention it at this moment.  

Now, the term Inyenzi, if there is no objection to my moving forward, the term Inyenzi is one which I have already referred to, which was already referred to in the 1960s.  It's a term which is -- which was used by the monarchists for themselves to refer to a guerrilla movement towards the new republic.  Often Inyenzi is translated by cockroach, and it has been said that it was -- this was in denigration of the person.  It came to mean cockroach afterwards, but Inyenzi was, in fact, a code word that these people used for themselves, the monarchy, monarchist soldiers, and it came from what is referred to from Kinyarwanda as cyivugo.  It was a literal genre in which you lorded your good deeds, it's spelt C-Y-I-V-U-G-O.  What was this?  It's in the report.  Ingangurarugo, "The one who follows me is determined to be the best."  So Ingangurarugo is -- we have it here in the report -- this was a name or a noun which meant --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Spell that for the --
THE WITNESS:
Ingangurarugo is I- it's on page 73 in the English.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have it, but this is for the stenographers. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Ingangurarugo is spelt I-N-G-A-N-G-U-R-A-R-U-G-O.  Ingangurarugo.  This is a significant word.  It's a word which was used to refer in the times of the great King Rwabugiri; he died in 1876.  Now, he had a militia, and amongst the most feared, the strongest, the most fearsome was one who was referred to as Ingangurarugo.  This movement of guerrillas was going to use this term which referred to Rwabugiri's militiamen.  It is not everyone who knows this, so this is why it has often been translated by the term "cockroach" which gave the impression that this Tutsi army was being abused, but I don't think they had thought about the implications of the coincidence with the abbreviation and the word Inyenzi meaning cockroach.  So, it is this guerrilla movement which pursued the war up until 1967-68.  This word was also often used in reference to the RPF because people or journalists or politicians had the impression that the RFF was pursuing the same combat as had been done by the warriors of 1959. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, are all Inkotanyis Tutsis?  Is the term synonymous?  In other words, if you say Inkotanyi does that mean Tutsi?
A.	No, not at all; not at all.  I am saying that because Inkotanyi was a word which referred to the political war situation, and it was chosen expressly.  And when one looks at the composition of the word Inkotanyi or -- first of all, the party, the RPF, which was formed outside the country, it was not a party which was exclusively Tutsi, because there were big names which were placed in the forefront.  Some people said that they were being used as fans, but you had Hutus within the RPF, in the RPF.  In the term Inkotanyi, you also have Hutus involved.  I would mention the case of these Hutus who are very well known and who joined the RPF.  Kanyarengwe, Lizinde, Biseruka, these major military officers.  There were also those who were recruited by the RPF, because I think the army had these people in its command.  But there is no possible confusion, no possible ambivalence between the term Inkotanyi and Tutsi.  It -- the Inkotanyi recruited Hutus and Tutsis, but mostly there were Tutsis because they were the ones who were to be found outside -- outside the country. 
Q.	You mentioned some names associated with the leadership of the RPF, and Hutus who were in the leadership.  Could you spell the names for the record?  I know it is at page 74 in the English.
A.	Yes, I found the names, the names of military officials -- officers.  Do you mean the names of these military personnel who were pro-FPR, RPF.  So there is Kanyarengwe, Alexis; I just used the initial A.  Kanyarengwe is spelt K-A-N-Y-A-R-E-N-G-W-E, Kanyarengwe.  The other name is Rwigema.  I said after the death of Rwigema, maybe I should spell Fred Rwigema, which is R-W-I-G-E-M-A, Rwigema.  He was not amongst those Tutsis.  Then there was Theonniste Lizende.  The initial is T for Theonniste  and the name is Lizende.  L-I-Z-I-N-D-E, D as in delta.  The other name is Biseruka  B- for bravo, I-S-E-R-U-K-A.  Then there is also Sendashonga, Mr. S. Sendashonga.  Sendashonga is spelt S-E-N-D-A- S for sierra H-O-N-G-A.  There is another gentleman whose name I mentioned and this is Jean Barahinyura.  The name Barahinyura is spelt B- for bravo , A-R-A-H-I-N-Y-U-R-A.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. HINDS: 
Your Honour. I have two questions.  I want to finish up today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
MR. HINDS:
I have two questions that I want to put to the  witness, may I?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Professor, is the term Inyenzi synonymous to Tutsi or vice versa?
A.	These are different words which have different meanings because Inyenzi could include Hutus; it could include Hutus.  It was a movement which, although it was monarchical, it contained Hutu elements, especially the president of the monarchist party, U-N-A-R, UNAR.  He was a Hutu.  This was François Rukeba; he was a Hutu.  Rukeba is spelt R-U-K-E-B-A.  This is an example which specifically shows that although it was in the minority, this party was open to accepting Hutus who could belong to it, if they found their interests there.  There were some who did so and went there, but there is no synonymity within the terms Inyenzis and Tutsis.  If someone calls a Tutsi an Inyenzi, this is an insult, it's an abuse; it's not what it means, because the meaning is different. 
Q.	Professor, you testified that the concept of Interahamwe was an urban concept, initially in terms of the development.  At a national level, could you share with the Tribunal, was the leadership of so-called concept Interahamwe, was it exclusively Hutu?
A.	I must first of all state that the Interahamwe were never recognised by the MRND as an institution, as a body which formed part of the party.  That is one -- one aspect, and remember it had no legal status.  Another point, when one refers to the national committee of the Interahamwe, it is noticed that this is an initiative committee, a steering committee which was established in Kigali, and there was no subordinate body to it.  There was nothing lower down at the préfecture level, at commune level, at secteur level, at cellules.  

This steering committee was born in Kigali and it reflected on the status the statutes, which had not yet been adopted.  It was bringing to the party -- it had not been brought to the party higher ups, nor had it been approved by the ministry of justice.  Now, the form of the Interahamwe was in the image of party.  What I mean is that it was open, and one of the leaders, the chairman of the steering committee was a Tutsi, Robert Kajuga, and that is something which can be checked on.  Kajuga is spelt -- I can spell that name for you.  The first name is Robert and the other name is, Kajuga.  Kajuga is spelt K-A-J-U-G-A, Kajuga.  He was the chairman of the steering committee, or comité d'initiative, at least up until 1994.  So I referred to the Interahamwe as a phenomenon, which was an urban phenomenon. 
Q.	Finally Witness, can you share with the Tribunal the use of the term Umwanzi, Inyenzi, Inkotanyi?
A.	Yes.  Let me start with Inyenzi and Inkotanyi.  I did say that because the ideologies were similar and sometimes the methods similar, after Inkotanyi sometimes they were referring to them as Inyenzi.  Tutsi, Inkotanyi, I have already explained the possible confusion there.  So we are left with Umwanzi, Inkotanyi.  Within the Rwandan context, particularly within the context of the armed conflicts, we had two belligerent forces, the Rwandan armed forces and the RPF, APR.  It is obvious that one was the enemy of the other.  The RPF was the enemy of the Rwandan armed forces and the Rwandan armed forces were enemies of the RPF.  When somebody from the RAF (sic) made reference to Umwanzi - Umwanzi means enemy.  I think I can spell that for the stenographers.  Uwanzi is U-M-W-A-N-Z-A (sic).
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness said A.  I can see on paper it is "I", but he said A.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the letter on the end? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is "I" corrects the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
In the understanding of the Rwandan armed forces, because they were the fighting forces and those supporting them, Umwanzi referred to the RPF and its soldiers.  This could be extended to those who supported them, for example, those who purchased weapons for them and so on and so forth.  But Umwanzi in the mouth of somebody on the Rwandan armed forces side and those supporting them Umwanzi referred to the RPF.  Umwanzi, for the RPF, will be the Rwanda armed forces and those behind them.
MR. HINDS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Let me just check with Mr. Kajelijeli , but I think this would be the end.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Before ending the direct, Your Honour, we would like to mark the exhibits, the appendices rather, as Defendant Exhibit 53, and this would be -- this is the appendix to the report, which is now 52A and 52B.  The bulk of the -- there are five appendices, five separate documents, annexes as they are called.  Four of them are in French, one is in English; that is, annex 1, 2, 4 and 5 in French.  Annex 3, is the bulk of it, except the title is in English.  This was filed with the registry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is, is -- but they are different documents.
MR. HINDS:
There are five separate documents that are annexes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
MR. HINDS:
Annex -- or annex 3 is English, the other four are in French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In French.
MR. HINDS:
I am just telling the Trial Chamber.  And so, therefore, this was filed with the registry.  We -- copies were given to the Prosecutor.   We are submitting this as Defendant's Exhibit 53.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any objection?
MS. OJEMENI:
No objection, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't we do it this way:  Translations will be made.  Those that are not in the other language will be done.  So I -- we propose we do it this way.  It's complicated because we don't have some of this -- we want to do, for example, the French -- if we had the French text that will be Exhibit 52C, for example.  We don't want to go to 53 yet, because it is the same report.  But then - and then we would have had the English version of all the annexes as 52D.  But then we have a problem, they are divided, so, I don't know how we do it.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think that the best way to do it is that we leave the annexes as a complete document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will keep it as a single exhibit, and then I think have it labelled as Defence Exhibit No. 53 --
MR. HINDS:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- which covers everything and then the Trial Chamber directs those annexures which are in one language should be translated in the two languages, be it French or English, as soon as possible and the copy certified and made part of the record in the two languages. 
	(Defence Exhibit No. 53 was admitted)
MR. KIYEYEU:
We have taken note, My Lord. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Anything else?
MR. HINDS:
There isn't anything else.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will stop here and adjourn these proceedings to tomorrow at nine in the morning, when we will start the cross-examination of the witness, if any, by the Prosecution.  The examination-in-chief has ended and we apologise to the interpreters and stenographers, we are a bit late, close to 15 minutes.  We try to keep within the time frames within which you operate, but sometimes there will be a small overlapping for good reasons.  

So, until tomorrow at nine, these proceedings stand adjourned.
	(Court adjourned at 1745H)
