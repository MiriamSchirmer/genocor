P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Trial Chamber is now in session.  Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  

Prosecutor, do you have a new witness for this morning?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, we do, Your Honour.  Good morning to the Court and to the parties and to the registry.  

Before we start with the witness, I would like to raise a matter of scheduling, if I may, because it is something that has to be resolved today, and I'd prefer to do that before the witness is called in.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, you may do so. 
MR. WEBSTER:
This concerns the anticipated testimony of a specially protected witness, Witness G.  I believe I communicated with the parties, with CMS, and with the Trial Chamber, and indicated that because of logistical problems in obtaining his testimony, we were requesting -- or plan on proceeding, rather, by calling this witness to start his testimony on the 17th of May.  

Originally, we had proposed to call him during the third trial session.  The way that it scheduled the appearance of witnesses was to have Witness G and Witness T actually testify at the very beginning of third trial session, but that is before we had adjourned the recommencement of this trial on the 19th of December -- 19th of January.  So the preparatory efforts that we have made on this Prosecution team that were made in conjunction with the Bizimungu case, which is the Government II case, and the Military trial, which is the Bagosora trial, had anticipated that this witness would testify towards the end of May, the beginning of June, because that is when we anticipated the commencement of our third trial session.  So, actually pushing back the beginning of our trial and juggling the dates for our sessions has caused us a bit of concern.  So it's in that context that I am making this application to advance his testimony.  His testimony was anticipated for around this time, but it would have been at the beginning of the third trial session, as opposed to towards the end of the second.  This is necessary for us because obtaining his testimony requires cooperation from two different sets of national authorities and the registry.  

Your Honours will recall that in the order that granted us special protective measures, the Court has authorised us to take his testimony by video link from the Hague; and in order to do that, and to manage his movement back and forth to the Hague, is going to require extensive cooperation with authorities beyond the Tribunal.  So, that's the basis for my request.  

We have completed most of the disclosure with respect to this witness.  We have disclosed the redacted witness statements -- transcripts, rather, of, I believe, 26 transcripts of debriefings from 1997-1998.  This witness testified in the Media trial; the dates of his testimony were communicated to the Defence.  This was before this Trial Chamber ordered us to provide those transcripts.  So the assumption that we have made is that these materials were obtained by the Defence directly from Court Management.  

It recently came to my attention that there were eight additional transcripts from this witness that were made in Canada. Those eight transcripts, and I believe they are from the year 2000, had not been disclosed, and we do have those transcripts in a format ready to be disclosed to the Defence at this time.  We can disclose them in unredacted form, and we can make all of the disclosures in unredacted form by tomorrow.  If we do that, that would bring us within the 30-day deadline that was set by the Court in its previous order for protective measures.  

I have been in contact with another senior trial attorney from my office.  It's he, actually, Mr. Steve Rapp, who is in charge of all the logistical arrangements.  He is currently in Europe now attending to this.  My understanding is that things are being organised so that we can obtain the testimony of this witness on the 17th of May.  And on that basis, Your Honour, I am asking this Court to authorise the Prosecutor to advance his testimony.  

I have discussed this briefly with one set of the Defence counsel.  I do acknowledge that the Ngirumpatse Defence team has objected to this arrangement, but I don't get the impression that advancing the testimony is a problem for the other Defence teams, but I am sure they will be heard on this matter.  

With respect to Ngirumpatse's objection, I believe he was referring to the protective order and the general protective order in which the Trial Chamber ordered the Prosecutor to disclose witness statements 30 days in advance of the beginning of the trial session.  But my reading of the order for special protective measures is that those guidelines have been somewhat relaxed and that the Prosecutor is authorised to disclose unredacted statements only 30 days ahead of his actual testimony at trial.  

So, in view of the circumstances, the difficulties in arranging this witness's testimony, the significant security concerns, which is what motivates us to make the request for special protective measures in the first place and to request his testimony by video link, I am asking this Court to make a ruling, which is actually to rule on the Defence objection, the Ngirumpatse Defence objection, because that's the only impediment at this point, so that I can complete disclosure between today and tomorrow and that we can all be settled in the acknowledgment that Witness G will commence his testimony on the 17th of May.  So, thank you.  

Actually, let me amend that a bit.  There is another scheduling issue that I would like to address.  It concerns the order of witnesses for the next two weeks, but perhaps we should deal with the Witness G issue first and then I will come back to the re-ordering of witness testimony for next week.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Good morning, Madam President.  I have listened to my friend in his submissions, and I find them quite inadequate insofar as the reasons for advancing the testimony because he hasn't said that he cannot do it at another time.  Even if there were arrangements made, those arrangements were made just presupposing that this Court would just go along with that.  You know, he has already gone ahead and made arrangements, and now he's come to the Court to ask for approval of those arrangements.  

However, on another matter, it is difficult for me to make a really informed submission without having disclosure of the materials.  This is going to be an important witness for Ngirumpatse's team, and as a result, we needed to have the unredacted statements so that we can govern ourselves accordingly.  And those have not been presented.  And it's quite unfair to expect us to consent to this change without knowing whether we need to do further investigations, whether we'd be in time for the proper cross-examination.  

We need to be able to anticipate pretty accurately the testimony of the proposed Witness G, and we cannot do so with the materials that we have available to us at this time.  We need to have the full unredacted statements, and I'm asking that you allow us to make our submission after we've been provided with those statements and not before.  Those are my submissions. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I also be heard on this subject? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you wish to intervene?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Madam President. 

I also share Mr. Roach's concerns, although I am willing to be -- I am willing to try to do my best to accommodate the Prosecution and to have the testimony of Witness G begin on the 17th of March (sic).  

Probably, Witness G is the most important and most -- will probably be the longest witness in this entire trial.  He was an officer of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  He was in on the formation of the Interahamwe from the very beginning, and he continued to participate all the way through the events of April 1994, and he is an important witness for Mr. Nzirorero because he will testify that Mr. Nzirorero asked him to try to stop the killings on the 10th of April of 1994.  So, I'm aware of this witness, and he is very significant, and I just need time to prepare for his testimony.  

We have probably more than 500 pages of statements.  His testimony in the Media case, I think, lasted over the course of two weeks; it's several hundred pages of transcript.  So it is a complex witness to prepare for.  If we receive the disclosure today or tomorrow, as Mr. Webster envisions, I think I would be prepared to cross-examine this witness if I have one week of recess from this trial before the testimony of the witness in which I can use that time to prepare my cross-examination.  If we had the normal situation, where we learn all the witnesses who are going to testify for the next session in advance, then I would have had that week in my office in California to spend preparing for the witnesses for this session, including Witness G.  But given the fact that we did not learn that Witness G was even being proposed as a witness this session until after we arrived in Arusha and began the session, there is no way I can be adequately prepared to cross-examine this witness without some break in the session in which I can concentrate on cross-examination.  So, my position is that if the Trial Chamber is willing to give the week of May the 10th as a recess, and that we do receive the disclosure, today or tomorrow, then I would agree to be prepared for the cross-examination of Witness G in the Hague.  

I want to also further mention something I have mentioned twice before, once in my written submissions in opposition to -- or in response to the protective measures, and once earlier this session when this was brought up, and that is that I intend to be in the Hague to cross-examine this witness face to face, and that was also done in the Media case.  The Trial Chamber will have the video links so that the witness and the counsel can be in either place.  And I also have requested from the beginning that my client be brought to the Hague so that I can be consulting with him during my cross-examination.  So, any order that the Trial Chamber makes for the provisions of testimony of this witness on the 17th of May, I would ask include the provisions that my client be present in the Hague during the cross-examination.  Thank you very much. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea. 
MR. O'SHEA:
I hope my timing is a bit better than yesterday afternoon.  I -- at this stage, we do not foresee any difficulty from our side with regard to the proposition of the Prosecution with regard to Witness G.  However, I -- and I have communicated such to Mr. Webster; however, I just make two reservations in that respect.  First of all, Mr. Webster has just indicated that he would like to speak about the rescheduling of witnesses, so I would like to hear his position on that first before we make a final decision.  But at this stage, I see no difficulty whatsoever with the advancement of the testimony of Witness G.  

The other thing is that we would, of course, like to examine the unredacted witness statements, and I would support the proposition of Mr. Robinson of a short adjournment prior to the testimony.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You wish to make some clarifications, Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
With respect to Mr. Roach's submission, and I think Mr. O'Shea joined in that a bit in regard to the disclosure matter.  By the terms of this Trial Chamber's order, the disclosure of redacted -- unredacted witness statements would take place 30 days before the witness's testimony.  And if we honour that disclosure regime, even if this witness were to testify two or three months from now, the issue would be the same, because the Defence attorneys would not get the unredacted witness statements until 30 days before the actual testimony of this witness; and those are the terms of the Court's order.  So, I understand Mr. Roach's concern, but in that respect, there is no problem with disclosure because all of the unredacted statements will be provided either today or tomorrow, and that will be 30 days in advance of the witness's testimony.  So scheduling has nothing to do with the disclosure issue.  

With respect to Mr. Robinson, he has made an application to be present in the Hague.  I am going to oppose that, but nonetheless, that also is not an issue of scheduling, it's an issue that he would raise whether the testimony was 30 days from tomorrow or, you know, three months from tomorrow.  

So, the issue -- those two issues are really separate, and if we focus on the scheduling issue, which is the only issue I am bringing to the attention of the Court, and I think the only reason I need to bring it to the attention of the Court is because the Ngirumpatse team objected, that's what I'd like us to address now.  

In principle, the Prosecutor presents the case -- his case, as he sees fit or in his estimation of the best way to present the case.  That's what I am trying to do, and the only reason I am making this application to the Court is that one member of the Defence team has expressed concern and has objected to my advancing the testimony of this witness.  

As concerns Mr. O'Shea's inquiry about the scheduling problem, what I am proposing to do is to reorder the testimony of Witnesses GAP and GBC.  So, we are a bit behind schedule, and rather than having -- we would continue with the testimony from Witness GII and then Witness GIN, which follows the order that I had previously established.  But after the testimony of GIN, rather than going into GAP and GBC, we would take those two witnesses during the course of another trial session.  So we'd go from GIN probably directly into GIT.  So we would move two witnesses from the roster from this trial session and then take them during the course of another trial session, which would put us a bit -- put us more on track in terms of our anticipated scheduling for this trial session.  That would also address some of Mr. Robinson's concerns, I believe, because then he would have less to focus on between now and the 17th of May, since GAP and GBC are really witnesses against his client, primarily; and since he would not have to concern himself with preparing cross-examination for those two witnesses, he would have more of an opportunity to focus on Witness G.  So, it is simply that that I wanted to clarify for the Court.  

But then again, I would like to remind the parties that this scheduling is really not something of my design.  This witness, Witness G, is testifying in two other trials.  Arrangements were made for three trials at the same time.  So it is certainly not as if I am imposing this schedule on Trial Chamber III.  The change in schedule is of concern to me as well, because we also have to prepare for this witness, but the arrangements were made, really, with three trials in mind.  

The witness will testify -- I don't believe it's going to be a joint session where he is testifying in three trials at the same time; he will be testifying serially, but the logistical arrangements have to be made or would be easier or most cost-effective to make those arrangements one time than have the witness testify serially in three different trials.  So this is something that is also imposed on the Prosecutor in this particular case.  This is not an arrangement that is to my liking or to my convenience.  Actually, it is as inconvenient to this particular Prosecution team as it is to the Defence.  And if we are forced to take this witness's testimony at a later time, it's going to involve greater cost and engaging the cooperation of two different national authorities in order to arrange for his testimony.  So, it's really in the interest of the economy of this Tribunal and the judicial economy of this trial and the other two trials that we make this application.  It should not be prejudicial to any of the parties.  It simply is inconvenient; it is not prejudicial.  And on that basis, I renew my application.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
It appears that my friend the Prosecutor is talking about the expense, and he informs us that even though the Witness G will be testifying in three different matters, it would be serially, not a joint kind of matter.  So, for that reason, he has not told us that it is not possible to put the matter over to the next session.  I know that some of my friends on the Defence side seem to be willing and ready to proceed.  Of course, so far as Rwamakuba is concerned, he doesn't feature very much with respect to this witness, so it doesn't matter to them. So far as my other co-Accused is concerned, Nzirorero, perhaps that kind of arrangement could be satisfactory, but we have been told that there are six, or some number like that, new statements from Canada that we haven't seen as yet, and what I was saying is that it would be unfair to have us make some comments on this before we have seen these new statements and the unredacted ones, of course.  

Now, assuming that we get all of those statements today, we could be in a better position to see whether we can agree or not.  I want to say that it's not a categorical kind of rejection we are making of the Prosecutor's motion, but we are just saying that we need the information in order to give our consent; and the information is to have the statements.  And I am asking that there be an abeyance of your decision until such time as we can see these statements and return to give our consent or return to say that we have difficulties with the rescheduling.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could say one brief word before you deliberate on this?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, very briefly Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  I just want to say, of course you have to balance the convenience to the Prosecution against the necessity of the Defence to prepare.  I am trying to take a very reasonable position to balance both, but I tell you I cannot be prepared for this witness without some break in the trial schedule.  To be going -- preparing for trial for a major witness such as this and be in trial at the same time is impossible.  So if you are going to agree that the Prosecutor should start with this witness on the 17th of May, I ask you, at the same time, to order that we not sit during the week of the 10th of May; otherwise I really cannot be prepared to cross-examine this witness.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Madam President.  I wanted to simply point out the fact that we should be able to adequately defend our clients.  Of course, as Mr. Robinson said, if we must look through 500 pages of statements, we must have the necessary time to do so.  To that, we must add the fact that since the examination will be done in conference, in my opinion, we must -- the parties must be enabled to be represented in the Hague, and that is why I would like to express my support for Mr. Robinson's application with regard to that matter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber shall give its ruling.  The Chamber asks the Prosecutor to disclose the unredacted statements of this witness to the Defence, starting today.  After that, the decision can be made. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, may I raise some matters with respect to the next witness, Witness GBU?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, I think Mr. Hooper would like to speak before me. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, and thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Madam President, it's just to deal with the scheduling.  We were provided with the revised scheduling for second session witnesses.  I don't know if you have that before you, but it sets out, as you may recall, the order of witnesses, obviously up until the 29th of May.  And I have just heard Mr. Webster say, and I am not sure if this has been a matter that's decided or not, that he wanted to withdraw Witnesses GAP and GBC.  Now, the effect that that has on us is that we will then have a run of four witnesses dealing almost exclusively with Dr. Rwamakuba's case.

It would be stating the obvious, and I do state it, that it's an obvious preference for a Defence to have a break where possible between witnesses because it enables us to prepare better, and we hope in the long run that that will save time. What Mr. Webster said was that he would call GIT after GIN.  I don't know whether that therefore means that he would then call GLM, which is the fourth witness dealing with Rwamakuba, and then go on to GBY.  But I am unclear why there is at this point in time a change in his scheduling in respect to GAP and GBC.  I don't know what Mr. Robinson's own views on that are.  

Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I appreciate Mr. Hooper stating the obvious, but it is equally obvious that if -- had this Trial Chamber granted Rwamakuba's motion for a severance and had he been going to trial on his own, that Defence team would be taking every witness serially.  So it is really not a reasonable objection to suggest that they have to take four witnesses back to back, because if he was on trial by himself, all the witnesses would be back to back; this Court would not take days off in between the testimony of each witness.  I appreciate your concern.  It's logical that every Defence team would want to take a break between each witness, but that's not the way trials are run.  If Mr. Rwamakuba was on trial by himself, the Defence team would have to cross-examine every witness as they appear.  

As for the reason for withdrawing, it's not withdrawing the witnesses from our witness list, it's reserving their testimony for another trial session.  I anticipated trial testimony from GFA to be complete by the 1st of April.  Here we are at -- today is the 8th, I believe  -- excuse me, the 15th.  So we are two weeks behind in terms of our scheduling.  So, I mean, re-arranging the scheduling or advancing -- taking two witnesses out certainly should not take anyone by surprise because by the schedule that was established some weeks ago, we should actually be on Witness GIN now.  So I understand his concern, but it's not reasonable under the circumstances to address that.  

What I can do or inform you is that we can discuss it, and perhaps we can put another witness in between the four Rwamakuba witnesses.  I am not putting witnesses together to cause inconvenience to the Defence, but we can discuss that outside of the court session.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you didn't mention anything about GII, who was to follow GBU. 
MR. WEBSTER:
This witness is already in Arusha, Your Honour, so he is available to testify.  What we expect to do is to take the testimony of GBU.  When we complete his testimony, we will move directly into GII.  GIN is a witness that has to be brought pursuant to a 90 bis order.  The Court has signed the 90 bis order.  I would expect that she would arrive on time.  After GIN, we would go into GIT; and after GIT, GLN.  We may adjust the ordering of witnesses once we get to GIT.  I'll discuss that with my team and with the Defence, but in terms of proceeding, we already have a witness waiting in the wings to testify.  GBU is outside and GII is in a safe house.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  So we are going to hear GBU and, basically, we will have GII and then GIN, GIT and GLM, in that order, I presume.  Very well.  So, there are no objections regarding those witnesses who are scheduled for this session.  

We will see after disclosure by the Prosecution, as to what to do with the Witness G.  We do invite the parties, obviously, to get in touch with one another to consider the issue raised by Mr. Hooper in the event that there is a kind of rescheduling necessary to help you in the preparation of your cross-examination.  But, obviously, we would, as much as is possible, wish not to disturb the normal flow of the proceedings.  I thank you all.  

Mr. Webster, if you can please have the witness, GBU, ushered in.  

Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very briefly, the Tribunal may be aware that there is just one small matter outstanding from GFA's evidence yesterday, in relation, the Tribunal may recall, to the evidence of the broadcast relating to the Ruhengeri court of appeal attack, and the broadcast that GFA heard.  And from the circumstances, as GFA believed them to be, his evidence was that it was a lie that was being propounded by the radio.  That was his clear evidence., but it went a step further in as much as it was elevated to the status of official lie, an official lie.  I think all the parties, that is, Mr. Webster and myself agree, that it is not necessary for GFA to be brought back to deal with one part which, perhaps, is arguably self-evident in any event; and, that is, that I think all the parties agree, that that witness was not in a position to be able to state the source of the lie.  So, we don't know if it was official or not.  We don't know if the lie emanated from the broadcaster, from the editor, from the journalist or from some other party who may have fed in information and, if he's correct -- the witness is correct, misinformation that came to be broadcast.  But in those circumstances, it is not necessary to recall that witness in order to clarify what, in any event, I think the parties would agree is perhaps a self-evident  point.  Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Robinson, did you wish to add anything?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, I have some motions to make with respect to Witness GBU.  I apologise that we are going into the session, and I would indicate in the future that in the event that the Trial Chamber wants to convene a little earlier, I am here at seven o'clock every morning, our clients are here at eight o'clock every morning, and so if it is a disturbance that we have to make these motions during the session, I offer to be present at an earlier time so that you can hear these motions.  Since you don't allow written motions during the trial session, it is of necessity that these motions be made orally to you. 

So, my first motion is to exclude the testimony of Witness GBU based on a violation of Rule 66(A)(ii) and a violation of the Court's own modification of the protective order requiring that all unredacted statements of the witness be disclosed 30 days prior to the session.  Pursuant to the Rule 66(A)(ii), all disclosure of redacted statements of this witness would have had to be completed by September 28th, 2003, 60 days before the witness testified -- or before the trial begins.  

I will tell you that the first knowledge I had of the existence of this witness in this case was on the 21st October 2003, some 30 -- almost 30 days after disclosure was required.  At that time, I received two statements of this witness, redacted.  The four additional statements of this witness were received on the 24th of November 2003.  However, this witness testified under the pseudonym GAO in the Kajelijeli crime, and that factor was not disclosed to the Defence until the 19th of December 2003.  
On the 22nd of December 2003, I made an application in the Kajelijeli case for the closed session transcripts of this witness's testimony as well as the exhibits filed under seal.  The Prosecutor did not respond to that motion until the 24th of February of 2004, almost two months later, and 55 days later than the rule requires a response pursuant to Rule 73(F) -- excuse me, 73(E).  As a result, the decision in the Kajelijeli case was not rendered until the 8th of March, at which time the Trial Chamber granted my application for the closed session testimony and the exhibits under seal.  I received that material on the 15th of March 2004.  That material includes seven statements of Witness GBU that had been in the possession of the Prosecutor since 2001, and had never been disclosed to the Defence.  So I received only those seven statements on the 15th of March, all in Kinyarwanda; and I did not receive the translations of those statements in English or French finally until the 29th of March 2004.  And even as late as Monday of this week -- excuse me, Tuesday of this week, the 13th of April, I received an additional statement from Mr. Webster, which he has apparently just obtained.  

So, based upon all of those violation of Rule 66(A)(ii) and your own order of disclosure of unredacted statements, I move to exclude the testimony of Witness GBU.  

My second motion is a renewal of a motion I made on the 31st March 2004 that the Prosecutor be required to disclose any new elements that they intend to produce when bringing a witness.  You've never ruled on that motion.  I have received no disclosure from the Prosecutor that there are any new elements to be brought with respect to Witness GBU, and I will object, of course, if I hear any new elements developed during the testimony.  

But I think it's time for the Trial Chamber to make a ruling one way or the other.  It's my preference that the Trial Chamber order the Prosecutor that, if he intends to offer any new elements, that that be disclosed in advance of the witness's testimony; but, nevertheless, I think there is a time for that ruling to be made before we get any further with any more witnesses.  

The third matter I'd like to raise with the Trial Chamber deals with the handling of objections.  I think you noticed yesterday that we, in Mr. Webster's redirect, we made lot of objections.  And during the direct examination of witnesses, up to now, I have rarely objected to Mr. Webster's questions, even though objections could have been made.  I tried to allow him to present his case, but it is not reciprocated, and Mr. Webster -- and I think Mr. Hooper indicated -- made over a hundred interventions during my cross-examination of Witness GFA, and so, we can't allow that imbalance to continue because you are putting us under time constraints and it begins to erode the rights of my client to present his Defence.  

So I proposed to Mr. Webster yesterday afternoon, as you urged us to work together, that we have a ceasefire of objections and that both of us allow each other to present the case and not make objections which can be made and a party has a right to make but, in the interests of advancing the proceedings, are probably better not made.  And Mr. Webster can speak for himself, but I can tell you that he rejected my proposal.  I think he feels that his objections are reasonable and conservative and that mine are unreasonable and unfounded, and as a result of that, doesn't feel that he needs to alter his pattern of objections, which is his right.  So I will advise the Court that you can expect to have a continuation of objections from the Defence to the testimony of Witness GBU, until such time as Mr. Webster is willing to agree, or the Court is willing to step in and control the proceedings to the point where we have equality of arms in connection with objections.  And I apologise for having to disturb the Trial Chamber's receipt of evidence in that manner, but I think it's necessary to protect my client's rights.  

I would like to also raise some issues with respect to disclosure.  On the 2nd of April, you ordered the trial -- the Prosecutor to provide copies of all of its exhibits to the Defence.  That order has not been complied with in the least bit and, in fact, I received an e-mail this morning from Mr. Webster indicating he is going to offer an exhibit through Witness GBU that we were unaware was going to be offered until this morning.  And so, I also wish to bring your attention to the fact that on the 2nd of April you ordered the Prosecutor to list all of his witnesses with the paragraphs of the indictment to which the testimony of that witness pertains.  And that witness -- that order has not been complied with at all.  And I would ask Mr. Webster, prior to the testimony of Witness GBU, to list for us which paragraphs of the indictment the testimony of Witness GBU pertains.  

I've also been asked by Human Rights Watch General Council to bring to the attention of the Court a problem that exists, because we had reached an agreement by which she would be providing by the 15th of April, the materials that Human Rights Watch had been asked to -- ordered to provide.  We had reached an agreement in this regard, and the agreement was that if it wasn't received on the 15th of April, they would have to file their motion to strike two objections.  And I think she made what I consider to be a mistake, but she insisted on sending the materials to Mr. Webster, rather than directly to me.  So we are in the situation now where none of those materials have been disclosed.  Therefore, she has asked me to ask the Court for some direction as to whether or not it is necessary for her to submit her motion today in light of the fact that Mr. Webster hasn't forwarded any of the material from Human Rights Watch to me.  

Finally, I want to advise the Court with respect to a motion that's pending to compel the United Nations department of peacekeeping operations to provide documents.  I received a communication from the United Nations with respect to that.  I think a copy was sent to Judge Vaz as well, and I want to indicate that it appears that we are able to work out informally between us an arrangement that is satisfactory to the Defence.  And so I am asking that that motion be held in abeyance and not ruled on by the Trial Chamber, and I will advise the Trial Chamber at a later time whether in fact the United Nations has complied with what they promised to comply with, and if they do, then I will withdraw the motion at that time.

So those are the matters that I have, and thank you for listening. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
I have a brief matter, Madam President, and this is with respect to the providing of will-states (sic) or, as we call them in the common law jurisdiction, indicative statements of what witnesses will say, which is in addition to the disclosure that was already made.  You recall that in the case of the last witness, the Ngirumpatse team were embarrassed or were surprised by mention of his name as a signatory on one of the cards -- I think the Interahamwe membership card, and that had not been disclosed to us.  And now we have a witness coming now, who is GBU, and as far as we can see there is no mention at all of Dr. Ngirumpatse in any of his statements.  And we will certainly be comforted to see some kind of procedure here where, if at the last moment, additional material is obtained from the witness but has not been disclosed, that a statement be given by the Prosecutor to us.  That would help us.  

Now, with respect to the objections that we are having, I am concerned about them.  I feel that we cannot work to rule and effectively move this trial along.  And I would plead with the Prosecutor and my friends to try to forebear on those issues.  Even if in some cases these might be justifiable, especially with respect to leading questions, I believe that this Chamber should be able and, in fact, I am confident and I trust this Chamber to be able to evaluate the weight that should be given to statements that are elicited by cross-examination as opposed to examination-in-chief.  So this is not so much a plea for a ruling but a statement that we can move the case along without excessive objections. 
MR. WEBSTER:
On the issue of objections, I did have a conversation with Mr. Robinson yesterday, and his characterisation of my comments is basically accurate.  I don't think the objections from the Prosecution side have been unreasonable or have been excessive; in fact, I have been very conservative.  There were many times when I could have objected, and I preferred to allow the proceedings to go forward without an objection.  I recall a number of times when the questions were objectionable, I did not object and the Court intervened, which is an indication that there was an objectionable line of questioning going on which I allowed to slip by but which was of concern to the Court.  That should be some indication that the Prosecution side has been conservative in its -- in raising objections.  

I don't enjoy interrupting Defence counsel.  I would prefer that the entire testimony go forward without objection but I am duty bound to object if I think the question is posed improperly or without the proper foundation.  So I will attempt to be reasonable, and I hope that the Defence side will also attempt to be reasonable. We are all here to see the wheels of justice turn.  I am not trying to be obstructive, but I do have to be responsible to my case, and I will object if an objection is warranted.  

With respect to Mr. Robinson's application concerning the DPP documents, that is really not an issue that we need to respond to.  Concerning the Human Rights Watch documents, I have had several conversations with Dinah PoKempner, who is on the general council, and I have received e-mail from her, and I think I have even been copied on some of the correspondence that she has had with Mr. Robinson, and nowhere did I observe in that correspondence her request to Mr. Robinson to raise an issue on her behalf because the Prosecutor has not forwarded documents.  I think that's inaccurate.  I stand to be corrected, but I think I have received copies of the correspondence going back and forth between Human Rights Watch and Mr. Robinson.  

Now, my understanding of the agreement is that Human Rights Watch would send to the Prosecutor, to my attention, a number of documents that I would then hand over to Mr. Robinson.  Yesterday or the day before I received notice that a package had arrived for me.  I am assuming that this is the package from Human Rights Watch.  Ms. PoKempner told me that she was sending a DHL or a FedEx package for me, so I would assume that that is the package.  But I have not received it yet, but this morning I did bring that matter to the attention of members of my staff.  So we will seek that package out during the course of the day, and I will inspect its contents and then make them available to Mr. Robinson.  I think we can do that by the end of business today, so there shouldn't be a problem.  But, nonetheless, my understanding is that Human Rights Watch had requested an extension of time in which to file their brief, an extension to the 20th of April.  So I don't think that any -- although we had an internal deadline of making these materials available to Mr. Robinson by the 15th of April, I think -- I believe that there is an outstanding application to extend the time for them to respond to his motion to the 20th of April.  

Concerning the disclosure issues raised by Mr. Robinson, quite frankly, I don't have records in front of me of when all of these statements were disclosed on the Defence.  I can -- since it is a motion to exclude the witness's testimony, we can still proceed with the testimony and, if the Court decides that the disclosure obligations are so egregious that it wants to strike the testimony, it can still do that.  So I think we should move forward with this witness's testimony, and a ruling on Mr. Robinson's application can be made when I have had an opportunity to go over his representations in detail.  
Nonetheless, all of these -- two or three days ago I took the precaution of sending to Defence counsel and CMS a list of all of the statements that I was aware of in regard to this witness, and I asked everyone to get back to me to ensure that everyone had all of the outstanding statements.  The Office of the Prosecutor can only disclose what it has.  When we are talking about these statements in Rwanda, we cannot disclose the statements if we don't have them.  And to suggest that it's a violation of disclosure to not provide statements from Rwanda, when they are not in our possession, is misleading.  The two statements that I provided earlier this week, we only received the week before.  And I can't go into detail with the other statements, but there are nine statements coming from Rwanda.  We did not -- we don't archive Rwanda witness statements; we make special requests for them.  And even after making special requests, they only trickle in slowly, and sometimes not at all.  

So we have made best efforts in this regard.  I think I outlined to the Court and to the parties the efforts that I personally made to obtain all of the materials, even with respect to Witness GFA.  I personally went to Ruhengeri to look for the statements.  And it came out during his testimony that he had made additional statements, but I am not aware of them.  I was as surprised as the Defence when he said that on the stand.  

With respect to these Rwandan witness statements, we are doing the best that we can.  We cannot do the impossible.  These statements were for impeachment purposes only; we are not relying on the Rwandan witness statements to make our case, and we have been honouring our disclosure obligations.  I will look into Mr. Robinson's submission, and I will come back at a later time and clarify the record, if that needs to happen.  

We are ready to proceed.  Before the witness comes in, I'd like to distribute to the parties and to the stenographers and to the language booth copies of the spelling, a list of spellings of names that may come up during the witness's testimony.  But we are ready to proceed; the witness is in the waiting room.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, while those are being distributed, if I could just add that the seven witness statements from Rwanda were in the possession of the Prosecutor in November of 2001 when they were introduced as exhibits during this witness's testimony in the Kajelijeli trial, a trial in which Mr. Webster was part of the trial team at one point.  So, any of these excuses about last-minute statements from Rwanda don't apply to these seven statements.  Thank you. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea.
MR. O'SHEA:
I would just like to say that I would prefer if when names are mentioned during the testimony, they are nonetheless spelt because we take note with some difficulty because of the time, and it's going to be difficult to cross-reference with this list, at least the less obvious names.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor has just given us a list containing the names that may arise in GBU's testimony.  There is a number before each name.  We urge the parties to indicate the number with which that name corresponds.  That will enable us to see how to spell that name.  Have you received the document?  It's not very legible but  --
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, very well Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber urges the Prosecutor to disclose the documents that it has available and to continue efforts to obtain from the authorities, especially the Rwanda authorities, documents that have not yet been obtained.  We duly note the letter for the United Nations that Mr. Robinson mentioned.  We have indeed received a copy of that letter.  Human Rights Watch had a deadline to disclose the documents requested of them.  As regards the application from Mr. Robinson to exclude the testimony of GBU, the Chamber is of the opinion that that application should be denied.  Disclosures provided for in the rules have been respected by the Prosecution.  

Now, as regards the objections, we were very disturbed, especially yesterday, with all of the objections that were raised by the different parties.  We would like for the parties to try to avoid making so many objections because we lose large amounts of time trying to deal with these issues.  These issues can be raised sometimes in cross-examination or in re-examination.

	1015H
MADAM PRESIDENT: (Continuing)
We also ask the parties to trust us.  We are always trying, and you see this through our decisions.  We're always trying to respect the equality of arms between the parties so that no party is disadvantaged. 

Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The one other matter that I meant to address, which I didn't, and it comes in response to Mr. Hooper, and it's with regard to his comments on GFA's testimony, or the last portion of GFA's testimony.  Yesterday I did locate an audio tape-recording that is dated the 15th of April 1994 and I also located a French transcript -- a French language transcript of that recording.  And on that recording is the communiqué which lasts for, I think, a minute and a half, and this is the communiqué that I believe Witness GFA referred to during the last part of his testimony.  That was served on the Defence this morning.  Last night I sent them an E-mail message, and I copied into my message the transcript.  I believe it's only two or three sentence, four lines.  It only lasts around a minute on the radio itself, and this morning we gave them a CD-ROM that contains four minutes of that radio broadcast, one and a half minutes of which is the specific reference that I believe Witness GFA made mention of, and that's the Radio Rwanda announcements that the Inkotanyi had attacked the court of appeals.  

Now, since Mr. Robinson has raised the issue of recalling the witness, I would like to inform the Court and the parties that the witness is still here in Arusha, and I don't think it would be inappropriate to call him back for just 15 minutes to identify that Radio Rwanda broadcast.  And I would like to do that, and I would think that the Defence also has an interest in clarifying the record and seeing if this witness can identify that portion of the radio broadcast.  

So I bring that to the attention of the Court and the parties.  And I make an application that either I be allowed to submit that CD-ROM and the transcript, and the parties can stipulate that on the basis of the documents that would accompany it, that we can call GFA to come in and simply listen to that one-and-a-half-minute broadcast and comment on it. MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Pardon me, Madam President.  I know the Court wants to press on with the witness who is now sitting in court. 

Can I just invite the Prosecution to indicate what the provenance of this recently served CD is.  Does it appear on the Radio Rwanda CDs that have already been served on the Defence?  
Before I go on, can I invite the Prosecution just to respond to that, very briefly. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I tried to confirm -- let me just refer to exactly what I am commenting on.  You requested me to identify where the tape came from.  I believe these are tapes that were given to us from -- it's either the ministry of information in Rwanda or the ministry of rehabilitation -- something of that nature.  But I believe the source of the tapes is actually the government of Rwanda.  

There is an NGO or some sort of organisation that's put together called the Rwanda Archive, and I think they are the ones that sponsored the translation of those materials into French.  So the transcript that I provided, or that would be served on you, is something that is done by an NGO, I believe.  But I'll have to confirm that.  Please don't hold me to that representation.  So that's the source of the information.  

In terms of whether it has been previously disclosed on the Defence, I don't believe that we serve tapes on the Defence, so that you were never served with the recordings themselves, but transcripts were served on the Defence.  And I believe that the transcripts from -- the transcripts from the Rwanda Archive were among the materials that were provided to the Defence.  I will confirm that.  I've asked a member of my staff to confirm that, and I can get back to you on that point either in writing or during another session.  But I've made efforts on my own to confirm that this specific transcript was in fact served on the Defence.  

But it pertains to, really, one and a half minutes on a recording, and I think it would clarify the record to admit it in evidence, or at least to have the witness listen to it and be provided with an opportunity of identifying it.  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
In brief response, I see, personally, no objection, once the provenance of this document is established, and I am not entirely sure it has, but once it has been, for it to be admitted without, for my part, the need to recall the witness.  But what I am concerned about is the way in which it is served.  

And, really, I don't wish to address you, Madam President, further on that until Mr. Webster has told all of us, perhaps tomorrow, whether this is something that has been served previously on the Defence.  I don't want to take a bad or false point.  I am just anxious that if it hasn't, what that might indicate about the effective trawl of existing material that the Prosecution have conducted.  I don't wish to take any more of your time up this morning on it. 
MR. ROACH:
Briefly, Madam President. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Our position is that we challenge the authenticity of this proposed clip from Radio Rwanda.  We submit that calling the Witness GFA is not a proper way to authenticate this as being the statement.  We should really have, if my friends believes that this is a vital piece of information for the case of the Prosecution, the person who gathered it and who put it together, so that it can be presented here.  We find that this would be the proper way to authenticate a document such as this

Incidentally, I must say I oppose the recalling of the witness for this particular purpose. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I simply wanted to bring the matter to the Court's attention at the earliest opportunity, which is actually today.  I would actually prefer not to the recall the witness as well, and if we can find a means of having this admitted in evidence without recalling the witness, that certainly is the preferable approach.  

So I will make efforts to trace the chain of custody with respect to this particular document and then bring that to the attention of the parties and the Trial Chamber. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We take due note of the submissions.  

Earlier Mr. Robinson spoke of disclosure on the Prosecutor of the paragraphs on which the witnesses will testify.  We made a ruling urging the Prosecutor to disclose those documents as soon as possible.  We remind the Prosecutor of this request so that he disclose these documents quickly, and so that also the Defence be informed that each time documents of this nature must be produced during trial. 

We shall now move on to the witness testimony.

Good morning, Witness.  You are a protected witness.  You have the synonym GBU.  You shall be first questioned by the Prosecutor and then cross-examined by Defence counsel.  It is also possible for the Judges to ask you for clarifications.  

We would like to ask you to reply to the questions put to you briefly and as succinctly as possible.  

We will now like to ask you to take the solemn declaration, and the registry shall assist you in doing so.
	(Declaration made by Witness GBU in Kinyarwanda)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you. 

Prosecutor, you have the floor for the examination-in-chief of this witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

May I begin by having a document displayed first to the Court, then to the Defence counsel, then to the witness, please. 
THE WITNESS:
I have been given a document; however, I do not know how to read or write. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps a Kinyarwanda interpreter can sit next to the witness in order to assist him.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd actually anticipated this, Your Honour, and what I suggest is that we go into closed session for the first ten minutes of this witness's direct examination.  Then I can go into his personal information and, you know, where he lives and what he's doing presently.  It will take around 10 or 15 minutes, and then we can go back into open session for the rest of his testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, we have no objection to that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We apologise to members of the public, but we must sit in a closed session for a few minutes in order to protect this witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Speaking over interpretation)...indicate that it should take no more than 10 or 15 minutes, so that they can come back very quickly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The members of the public would have taken off their headsets so they would not have been able to hear that, but I did say it would only be for a few minutes.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Remember now, we are now in an open session.  We are in an open session, Mr. Prosecutor.  You may proceed.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, when you answer my questions, if you think they are going to compromise your identity, please let us know and we will find another way of getting the information, because we are in open session now. 
A.	Very well.
Q.	Now, I'd like to address to you the period of time between your arrest in 1997 and the time in 1999 when you confessed to your own crimes.  During that period, did any member of the Rwandan prosecutor's office come to you and ask you to answer questions and write down your answers, in your presence?
A.	Yes, we were often called to the prosecutor's office and we were questioned and statements were written.
Q.	When you made those statements, did you have the option of not speaking to the prosecutor?
A.	No.  When you are called by the prosecutor, you do not have the right to refuse to reply.
Q.	When you replied during those series of questions, were your answers truthful at that time?  I'm addressing myself to the period of your arrest --
A.	No.  During those two years I was lying.  I was lying to the court because I had not yet confessed my guilt.
Q.	Do you recall how many times you were called and questioned during that period?
A.	No.
Q.	Would it be possible for you to estimate?  Do you think it was more than ten or less than ten?
A.	It would be less than ten times.
Q.	Mr. Witness, since making -- taking a plea of guilty, do you continue to make statements to the Rwandan prosecutor general?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Do you recall the first time you spoke to anyone from the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTR?
A.	I do not remember.
Q.	Do you remember if it was before or after you entered a plea of guilt in Rwanda?
A.	It was afterwards.
Q.	Were you offered any inducements or any favours to speak to the Office of the Prosecutor?
A.	No.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you made your own plea of guilty back in 1999, what did you confess to doing?
A.	I admitted to having participated in the genocide.  I denounced those with whom I committed that crime.
Q.	Did you list specific acts that you committed?  How detailed was your confession?
A.	No.
Q.	What was the process in which you submitted this confession?  How was it recorded?  How did you participate in providing that statement?
A.	**********************************************************************said that I was guilty, and he said, "You know very well that we were together."  Knowing that the Rwandan government had promised to reduce the sentences of those who confessed their guilt, I accepted to do the same.  I asked him to write for me, and he wrote a letter.  He accompanied me, and we delivered the letter to the director and his office, and it was the director who submitted that letter to the prosecutor's office.  

During that period of time, security was not guaranteed, and that's why I asked ********to read to me what he had written on my behalf.
Q.	Now, **********, was he also detained or did he work at the prison?  Tell us what his status was when this was taking place?
A.	He was detained.
Q.	Did he plead guilty as well?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	I know him.
Q.	How did you come to know him?
A.	Joseph Nzirorera is someone whom I have known for a very long time.  My older brother worked at his place and he would often come from Kigali.
Q.	Do you know what he does, what he does professionally and what his status was in Rwanda in 1994?
A.	Before 1994, he was minister for a certain period of time.  In 1994 itself, multipartyism existed.  He was the secretary of the MRND.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you think you would be able to recognise Joseph Nzirorera if you saw him today?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would you take a look around the courtroom and tell us if you see him in the courtroom anywhere?
A.	I have already seen him.  He is wearing spectacles and he is seated next to a white lawyer.  He is sitting behind the gentleman with a hat.  He is wearing a black jacket.  He is seated in the second row.
MR. WEBSTER:
May I have the record indicate that the witness has identified Joseph Nzirorera. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let the record reflect that Witness GBU has recognised Accused Nzirorera in the courtroom.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, can you tell us if Joseph Nzirorera had any particular status in Ruhengeri?
A.	Whilst he was minister, I think that he directed water supply project.  We knew that he was the chairman of MRND -- that's what we thought.  He was someone who was influential within the MRND.
Q.	Was he influential in your community, in Mukingo?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And why was that?
A.	Nzirorera was someone --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness's answer is not very clear.  Can he be asked to repeat his answer and to speak more specifically, more clearly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you please repeat your answer, please.  We have not been able to follow you. 
THE WITNESS:
I answered by saying that Nzirorera -- when Nzirorera decided that one leader or other be thanked (sic), that needed to be done.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me put it to you another way.  Did you consider Nzirorera to be an important person in your community?
A.	Yes, he was someone who was very influential because we did everything he asked us to do.
Q.	What was it that made him influential?
A.	His influence arose from his responsibilities in Kigali.  He was rich, furthermore, and he used his wealth in order to buy people.
Q.	Would he do that in Mukingo as well?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Well, who were some of the people he was able to influence or he was able to buy in Mukingo?
A.	The first one that I can mention was known as Tuiyzere.  He was a former sergeant in Habyarimana's army and he had left the army. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe that's number 84 on our list.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Were there other members of the MRND in Mukingo that had any relationship that you could perceive with Joseph Nzirorera, any relationship of a personal nature?
A.	Yes, for instance, Kajelijeli and Baheza, as well as conseiller Ndisetse and Jean Demascene Niyoyita.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, Kajelijeli is at number 35; Ndisetse is at number 54; Niyoyita is at number 57. 

Are we referring to the same list now or is it still different?
MR. ROBINSON:
Different. 

MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I will just spell the names out as opposed to working from a list.  Kajelijeli, K-A-J-E-L-I-J-E-L-I.  Ndisetse is N-D-I-S-E-T-S-E.  Assiel, A-S-S-I-E-L.
MR. HOOPER:
Can you spell them just a little bit slower.  It's difficult to keep up.
MR. WEBSTER:
Ndisetse, N-D-I-S-E-T-S-E.  Assiel, A-S-S-I-E-L.  Niyoyita, N-I-Y-O-Y-I-T-A, Jean Demascene.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how often would you see Joseph Nzirorera during 1994?
A.	It was in 1992 that I began to see him frequently.
Q.	And in what circumstances?  Can you tell us how and why you began to see him frequently?
A.	After the Inkotanyi attack, Nzirorera came in his vehicle.
Q.	What Inkotanyi attack are you talking about?  Can you please be a bit more descriptive?
A.	I am talking about the first attack, the one in 1991.  The one where the prisoners were released from jail.
Q.	Right.  Now, tell us under what circumstances you would see Mr. Nzirorera after that, please. 
A.	He arrived.  He came in front of the MDR flag at a place called Yonde, and in front of the PSD flag in Yonde itself, he came back to his mother's house.  From his mother's house, he came to look for us at Byangabo.
Q.	Are you talking about a specific incident or is this where you would see Mr. Nzirorera on a regular basis?
A.	It's a specific incident that I am referring to.  That was the first time I saw him.
Q.	Do you know where Mr. Nzirorera resided when he was in Mukingo?
A.	Yes, I know where he lived.
Q.	Where was that?
A.	When he came to Mukingo he would go to his mother's house, but he lived in another place called Nyiratarengwa (phonetic).
Q.	Aside from of the specific incident that you just described to us, is there anywhere in Mukingo that you would see Mr. Nzirorera habitually?
A.	There were other occasions.  For example, he called the first meeting of the youth when the Interahamwe movement was created.  It took place at the commune office.
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you tell us what you mean by Interahamwe?
A.	It's an organisation of the MRND.  The Interahamwe were the ones who killed people.
Q.	Do you know when the Interahamwe organisation was created in Mukingo?
A.	After the first meeting that took place at the commune office, the leaders of the youth asked us to find able-bodied young men to be part of the Interahamwe.
Q.	Who was present for that first meeting?
A.	The first meeting took place at the commune office.
Q.	Do you know who called that meeting?  How was it organised?
A.	When the authorities left the meeting, people like Rukundo, Musafiri and others informed us that Nzirorera had called the meeting.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record is Musafiri is M-U-S-A-F-I-R-I.  Rukundo is R-U-K-U-N-D-O.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your response, who was it you were referring to as authorities; could you give us their names please?
A.	The leaders of the youth, including the president of the youth, who was Alexis Rukundo.  There was the vice-president, as well, of the youth.  His name was Michel Niyigaba.  There was the secretary, Noel Ndayisabe.  There was the treasurer as well, and his name was Bodwa Bidwandahagaza (phonetic).  There was also the person who covered all of the activities, and his name -- he was the, rather, younger brother of Nzirorera.  He was the leader of the whole group. 
Q.	And what was that person's name, the leader of the whole group?
A.	His name was*****************************.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record,**************************.
THE WITNESS:
In fact, he was a*********.  He had left**********. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me take a moment and spell the names  for the record.  **************.  We already have the spelling of Rukundo and Musumba.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are these the authorities that you are referring to that called the meeting or are these the leaders of the Interahamwe?  I'm trying to make a distinction.  Can you clarify that for us, please. 
A.	The persons who called the meeting were Kajelijeli and Nzirorera.  Regarding the leaders of the youth, they joined us at the communal office.
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera present during this meeting?
A.	He was.
Q.	Can you tell us what he said while you were present?
A.	During the meeting, he called our leaders.  We stayed at Byangabo.  When the leaders came back from the meeting they gathered us before a school and said that Nzirorera and Kajelijeli said that the youth had to gather to select able-bodied men among us to be part of the Interahamwe movement.
Q.	Witness, I'm not clear on one thing.  Is it your testimony that you were present for this meeting or that others told you about this meeting?  Could you make that distinction for us, please. 
A.	I was not present.  Our leaders informed us of the conclusions made during the meeting.
Q.	Was there any time during 1991 that you were present when Joseph Nzirorera made any conversation in regard to the Interahamwe?
A.	No, I was speaking of the first period.  On the second occasion, when he came from Kigali, we were at Byangabo.  At his mother's house, he told us that we were useless in Byangabo and that he wanted the parties, like the MDR and the PL -- he wanted us to tear down their flags, the flags of the MDR and the PSD.  

Since it was nightfall, we asked him to loan us a car so that we can go and in fact tear down those flags.  He gave us his driver called Kigozi and the car that he came in.  He left and told the driver to go get the vehicle at Nzirorera's brother-in-law, and he came back with a Daihatsu, a yellow one.  

Upon arrival at his mother's house he gave us 40,000 francs, and congratulated us, and said, "Very well, you've begun your work."  Nzirorera's brother-in-law was called Mbonabirama.
Q.	Can you tell us that name again please.  You were referring to Nzirorera's brother-in-law.
A.	Mbonabirama, M-B-O-N-A-B-I R-A-M-A, Mbonabirama.  That was when he took Jean Demascene Niyoyita, when we were at his mother's house. 
Q.	He took him and he did what?
A.	That is how he lifted Niyoyita up and said, "This man can beat us."
Q.	I don't understand what you are saying, Witness.  Could you explain yourself a bit?  Go back to the portion where you are discussing Jean Demascene Niyoyita and explain to us again what you are saying, please.
A.	They had reported to him that Jean Demascene Niyoyita didn't want to be a member of the MRND, so he lifted him up and said, "How can this little guy not want to be a part of the MRND?  Can he really beat me up?" is what he said.
Q.	This is what Nzirorera is saying to the group?
A.	Yes, that's what he said to the group when we were all at his mother's house.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall what year this incident took place, if you can?
A.	It was between the first attack of the Inkotanyi and the meeting -- or rather the rally that Habyarimana held at the stadium. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I would like to move to strike the testimony concerning Jean Demascene Niyoyita.  This incident that this witness has just described is completely unknown to us.  It's not contained in any of his statements, whether the seven to the Rwandan authorities, the five to the Office of the Prosecutor, and Mr. Webster gave us no notice that this would be raised.  So I'd ask that it be stricken as new material.
MR. WEBSTER:
I can assure you that that portion of the witness's testimony is a surprise to everybody in this room.  So we ask a question and we get an answer.  I don't think it's appropriate to strike the answer.  It's the witness's testimony.  I'll ask a question.  I'll bring the witness around to the subjects that interest us, but we have to accept the answers that he gives us.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the time being, we will continue to listen to the witness.  We will evaluate the probative value of his statements at a later stage.  

At this time I think it is appropriate for us to take a 15-minute break.  We shall resume in 15 minutes.  Proceedings are adjourned. 
	(Court recessed at 1125H)
(Pages 26 to 32 by S. Eboe-Osuji)























	(Court resumed at 1145H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed. 

Mr. Webster, you have the floor to continue your examination-in-chief of the witness.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  My apologies to the Court and the parties for the mix-up in the list of names earlier today, but we have rectified that.  I've corrected all of the lists that were previously distributed and redistributed a new set of copies.  The list that I am going to refer to now has 89 entries, I believe everyone has the same list, so it shouldn't be a problem moving forward and I believe the stenographers and the interpreters have the same list now.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we left off where we were talking about the Interahamwe organisation.  Tell us what you understood the purpose of the Interahamwe organisation to be when it was created.  Why was this organisation created, the Interahamwe?
A.	When we were told that we were Interahamwe we were told that we always had to be together, and that we had to be united to fight the opposition parties that could be present in the commune, that we also had to chase down the Tutsis, because they were accomplices of the Inyenzi.
Q.	Well, who told you these things?
A.	The first time Nzirorera told us to hunt down the Tutsi from Ruhengeri, at Rwankeli, where there were hidden Tutsis. When we went there we found that Tutsis had taken refuge at ISAE.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I also have an objection to this.  This is also new material that is coming either as a surprise to Mr. Webster, or if it isn't a surprise to Mr. Webster it certainly hasn't been disclosed to us.  So I move to strike that last answer as new material.
MR. WEBSTER:
This witness has made at least five witness statements to the OTP.  In those witness statements he talked about attacks against the Tutsi within Mukingo.  This is certainly within the scope of that general area.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, we can examine those statements, but there is nothing -- he does talk extensively about attacks against Tutsis in Mukingo on the 7th of April and afterwards, but there's nothing to indicate there was any attack ordered by Mr. Nzirorera on Rwankeli on the Tutsies who were being the (unintelligible) or the ones who fled to the ISAE.
MR. WEBSTER:
I can look through the witness statements, but this witness talks about two meetings where Joseph Nzirorera had asked the Interahamwe to do two specific things; one case was take the flags down; and another case was to attack the Tutsi in Mukingo, and we can address this at a later time and remove it from his testimony if that's your application and the Court agrees with you, but I would prefer to continue now.  But there is definitely a statement there, and his testimony in the Kajelijeli trial where he discusses attacks against the Bagogwe prior to the 7th of April.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I'm just asking if there is other material besides which is contained in the statement of materials that we have, there should be an obligation on the Prosecutor, if he is going to lead that material, to disclose it to us.  If the witness is now adding things here in 2004 that he has never said before, then you have to evaluate the credibility of that, as well.  But we need to know from the Prosecutor what is the subject matter of his examination as it exceeds the scope of disclosure.
MR. WEBSTER:
If we look at the witness statement of the 7th of May 1999, at least in the English --
JUDGE ARREY:
Just a minute.  I'm looking at the witness's statement on the -- K0247849 made on the 14th of November 2002.  Because I remember the first objection that Mr. Robinson made was that there was no mention of his planned lifting of somebody after they had gone and stole the flag.  If you look at the next page, page 4 of that document, you will see that that incident is recorded in his statement, "Upon the completion of the above I was to attend Nzirorera's mother's house with Nzirorera and (unintelligible) who briefed the dignitaries on the resource and the arrest all these dignitaries were pleased and gave us 40,000 francs and the others who did not resist us... blah, blah, blah, blah" and after that he (unintelligible) and gave him a job as a cleaner because at first you object that there was no mention of that.  I'm just saying, the other statements might be on the next page, I don't think you passed that.  I'd just like us to read all the statements have been disclosed, but he is giving disjointed evidence but it is there on his statement in different pages.  Have you seen what I am referring to?
MR. ROBINSON:
I have seen that and appreciate that, and I didn't object to that part of his testimony, but then he related the man Jean Demascene Niyoyita, president of the MRND, who's not mentioned in this, at all. He related another incident where this man was grabbed by -- Mr. Niyoyita was grabbed by the lapels, apparently --
JUDGE ARREY:
President of PSD.
MR. ROBINSON:
No, we're talking about two different people.  The witness testified to an incident with a Mr. Niyoyita, who's not mentioned in this statement.  And he did also talk about this man Tuyizere the president of the PSD, but I didn't object to that part of it.  But he then went on to add a new element, that president of the MRND, Jean Demascene Niyoyita, went to Nzirorera and told -- was threatened because he wanted to leave the MRND.  That was the portion I objected to.  And I don't think you will find any of this in any of the material.  But I understand your point, and it is exactly correct, that the incident with the PSD leader was covered by the materials.  But I was objecting to testimony that went beyond that incident.
MR. O'SHEA:
Madam President, may I just request that when testimony is being discussed that the witness remove his earphones?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd also like to reply to Mr. Robinson's objection.  If we look at the statement of 7th of May 1999, at least in the English at page 3, at the very bottom, it starts off, "In 1992 on the Tutsi did not live in peace due to the threat." And  then it goes on to discuss 1993, so there are general references to attacks against the Tutsi in Mukingo --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, one moment, please.  Excuse us.  We're having problems.  Can you tell us which statement you are referring to, Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  It's the statement of 7 May 1999.  It's actually the first statement that this witness makes to the Office of the Prosecutor .
MR. O'SHEA:
Excuse me, I don't know if my intervention was not translated or what's happening here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we did hear you, because we asked the Prosecutor to indicate to us the page that he was making reference to.  So we did hear you.
MR. O'SHEA:
I see.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
In the French edition it's at the bottom of page 3, I believe, the second paragraph from the bottom.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
This statement does not even mention Mr. Nzirorera at all in this entire statement and to take the one sentence, "From 1992, on the Tutsis did not live in peace due to the threat," and say that that therefore justifies all material from 1992 on that has anything to do with the Tutsis, and to put us on notice of any incident that is covered by that one sentence completely defeats the purpose of adequate preparation of the Defence and that cannot be a justification for these new elements.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, if we are going to address the issue of notice, notice per se.  Notice can be provided in many different ways. It is not restricted to a the content of a single witness statement.  The Defence has been placed on notice through the indictment; it has been placed on notice through witness statements from other witnesses; it has been placed on notice from other disclosures.  It is clear that the allegations against Mr. Nzirorera is that he was influential in Mukingo from 1991 onwards, that there were attacks against Tutsi --
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  I'm sorry to persist on this matter, but I requested that the earphones of the witness be removed. 

I understood that what you were saying to me was that reference would not be made to testimony, that page numbers were being referred to.  But if we are going to have a discussion about testimony and what he's going to say or what he doesn't or did not say, or whatever, in my submission, the witness should not be listening to this, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you please remove your headphones?  I don't know if he has been following everything that was said here.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I was referencing the issue of notice and my submission is that on the issue of providing testimony about attacks against the Bagogwe in 1993 or 1992, the Prosecutor has not failed in its requirement to give notice because such notice was given in the indictment and through other witness statements and other submissions.  If we are addressing the simple issue of notice and fairness, notice can be provided by several different means.  So it should certainly not take the Defence by surprise to hear a witness talk about events in Ruhengeri in 1992 and 1993, particularly in light of the testimony that we heard yesterday and the disclosures that were made in relation to that witness and other witnesses that are to be called.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, first of all, I would like the Prosecutor to specify the paragraphs in the indictment where the attacks on Tutsis in Rwankeli cellule in 1993 are charged against him.  I don't know of that.  That was part of the purpose in having the Prosecutor comply with the order of April 2nd, because we're all kind of blind here.  

Secondly, that general notice cannot be a substitute for the obligation of the Prosecutors to disclose new elements of testimony.  This is done in every Trial Chamber except this one in the ICTR and every trial chamber in the ICTY, but every day we come here and we hear new elements from the Prosecutor.  And I'm asking you to require the Prosecutor to give us advance notice of these elements and to strike testimony when that advance notice is not given; otherwise, we do not have a fair trial.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may just comment briefly, before the Court renders its decision, if we look at the statement of the 13th of November 2002, in the French starting on page 4, in the middle of the page, it starts about -- the witness starts to say, "Nzirorera and Setako organised a meeting sometime in November of 1993" and then there is a long passage that goes on for almost three pages, but when we get toward the end of page 6 it talks about attacks on the accomplices of (French not interpreted) so it connects the meaning that -- it starts out to say it takes place in 1993 to these attacks.  So this is certainly a reference to attacks against the Tutsi in Mukingo before the events of April 7 of 1994.

Even in terms of looking at this testimony, Your Honour --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think that it's rather difficult for the Chamber to say whether or not there was disclosure of this information.  What is certain is that the Chamber will take this into account, because if this was never disclosed at any point in time to the Defence, either in the indictment or in the disclosed documents, the Chamber will take that into consideration during its deliberations.  You may proceed, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I believe we left off when you were talking about the Interahamwe organisation.  I believe my last question to you was a request that you tell us the objectives of the Interahamwe organisation, as you understood them.  What was it created for?  Can you start again and bring us on track, please?
A.	Our Interahamwe organisation had an objective to chase down the Tutsis.
Q.	And you were telling us the names of the persons that gave you these instructions.  Can you do that for us, please?
A.	There was Setako, Nzirorera, Kajelijeli, and Bizimungu, as well as Baheza.
Q.	With respect to Bizimungu, can you tell us which Bizimungu you are referring to?  Is there any other way that you could indicate to us the name of the person?
A.	I'm speaking of Casimir Bizimungu.
Q.	Was this Bizimungu person a member of the military or a member of the government administration?
A.	Casimir Bizimungu was a civilian, a person of authority.
Q.	Now, how would these persons communicate their message to you?  Where and when did they tell you these things?
A.	We were at the residence of Nzirorera's mother when they told us that.
Q.	And when you say "we", who are you referring to?
A.	There were about 15 of us.  I think I do remember some names, *************************************** *******************************************************************************************************************
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, those names were given too fast for me to note.  Can we please have those repeated so that we can write those down?
MR. WEBSTER:
We can ask the witness to repeat the names.  I won't spell them.  Most of those names, if not all of them, were spelled previously.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell us again, slowly, please, the names of the persons that you included in the "we" that was present at Nzirorera's mother's house, the same names you just told us, but go over it a bit more slowly?
A.	There were about 15 of us.  I had said that there was *****************************************************, *********************************************************** the witness himself, GBU in other words, *****.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, *********is number 6 on the list just described to you.   ************* is number 31 on the list that you have just received.  **************is number 77 on the list.  ********* is spelt *********.  

And I believe every other name was previously mentioned and spelled out.
MR. O'SHEA:
If Mr. Webster can just say -- I think you said **********was number 37; is that correct?  If that's correct we have another name here.
MR. WEBSTER:
I said number 77.
MR. O'SHEA:
Seventy-seven, sorry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, I do believe it is indeed 77 which was mentioned.
MR. WEBSTER:
May I proceed?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may proceed, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how were you expected to chase down the Tutsis?  Tell us what you understood your instructions to be.
A.	When we were told to chase out the Tutsi we were told that they were the ones who were bringing the Inyenzi into our commune.  Because --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the witness be asked to repeat because he is using terms that are not very familiar to this interpreter? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat your answer, please, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
These were leaders, heads of families had already been taken away, such as teachers, and other persons who were influential, because they had been taken away, because it had been said they were the origin of that movement.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When you refer to "they" are you referring to the Tutsi or someone else?  I'm still not sure who you are referring to when you say "they had been taken away."
A.	It was Tutsis who were heads of families who had been taken away.
Q.	Do you know what happened to them after they were taken away?
A.	They were taken away to be killed.
Q.	Do you know where they were killed?
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.
THE WITNESS:
The first group was killed at the commune office; whereas the second group was killed -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  I have an objection for lack of foundation here.  We don't know whether this witness is reporting rumours in the community or present and reporting this.  I ask that the foundation be laid before his testimony is accepted.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll put those questions to the witness.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told us that certain people were taken away to be killed.  How do you know these persons were killed?  Did you see this yourself?
A.	When the first group was killed at the communal office, one Rudatinya, as well as**********, who is called*********, and the second group was taken by one Hasengineza, who went to kill them at Rubare.
MR. WEBSTER:
	For the record, Hasengineza is number 27 on our list.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, my question to you is, how did you know these persons were killed?  Is this something you observed or is this something people told you about afterwards?
A.	When the first group was killed at the commune office, the Mukingo commune office, I was indeed present.  The bodies of *******, as well as that of ******** -- the body of ******, I myself went to fetch it.  As for the other group, they were taken to Byangabo.  We were unable to see the bodies.
Q.	Were these events ever discussed with Joseph Nzirorera in your presence?
A.	Hasengineza did not live in Mukingo commune.  When Nzirorera came to his commune -- and he was responsible for the well-being of the people of his commune -- when he arrived did he do anything to find out why these people were killed?
Q.	Well, my question to you, Witness, is did he know these people had been killed?  Do you have a basis for saying that Nzirorera knew that these killings were taking place?
A.	He was aware, obviously, because he asked us to go and to chase the survivors.
Q.	Well, after you chased the survivors, did you go back and then tell him that you had done so?
A.	Yes, we left to go and chase the Tutsis.  We found them at ISAE and when we came back we told him that they were being watched, that they were being guarded by the gendarmes at ISAE, but that the gendarmes didn't have guns.
Q.	Well, did you ever tell Joseph Nzirorera or were you ever present when other persons told him that some of these folks that you had chased had in fact been killed, that you had killed them?
A.	We didn't see these people that he had asked us to chase.  We told them that those people had sought refuge within ISAE, so we didn't kill them at that particular time.
Q.	But with respect to the person that you did kill, the persons that you mentioned earlier, Rudatinya and some other names, were you aware of any conversations?
A.	For Gashasharo and Rudatinya, they were taken away by the leaders; so it wasn't we who took those people away.
Q.	Yes, but my question to you is, after they were taken away did you or anybody else tell Nzirorera that this, in fact, happened, that they were taken away and that they were killed?  I'm trying to find out if you or any of the other Interahamwe communicated this information.
A.	Yes, the Interahamwe informed Nzirorera.
Q.	Were you present when this happened, when the Interahamwe informed Nzirorera?
A.	Yes, I was present.
Q.	And what was his response?
A.	He gave us the order.  He said that if the survivors are continuing to bring in Inyenzi they are going to continue to kill them.
Q.	That is what he said after you informed him of what you had done?  I'm still a bit confused.
A.	Yes, he told us that when we came back from our hunt.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did the Interahamwe have a distinctive form of dress?
A.	Yes, we did.
Q.	Can you describe it to us, please?
A.	We were in uniforms made out of kitenge, the colours in it were blue, green and yellow.
Q.	How did you obtain these garments?
A.	It was Nzirorera who had brought us that uniform.
Q.	Do you recall when it was that he brought these uniforms to you?
A.	Between the first attack and the Habyarimana meeting in Ruhengeri they brought us a small number of uniforms and promised to bring us a larger number later on.
Q.	Well, did you personally receive one of these uniforms?
A.	Yes, I was given a shirt, only a shirt -- a shirt and a cap.
Q.	And was that with the first delivery or with a later delivery?
A.	Yes, it was the first time that they gave us the uniform, the first delivery.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you receive any training to be an Interahamwe?
A.	Yes.  I received training within the Virunga Force Amahindure.
Q.	Well, tell us the difference between the force of the Virunga Force and the Interahamwe.  We'd like to  understand what you mean.
A.	Actually the Virunga Force Amahindure was a selected group.  The Interahamwe who were to go through military training within that Virunga Amahindure military force, it was a select group.  Otherwise, there's no difference between the two.
Q.	Were you a member of the select group, the Virunga Force Amahindure?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What type of training did you receive to be a part of this group?
A.	We were told how to handle weapons, such as guns and grenades, as well as how to dodge bullets while lying down.
Q.	Who provided this training?
A.	It was Karorero, a warrant officer; one Musafiri, Dusabimana, Noeli, as well as reservists who had left military service.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, Karorero is at number 39.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can you give us the other two names, Mr. Witness, aside from Karorero who were the other names you mentioned as trainers?
A.	Dusabimana and Ndayisabe, Noeli, BYmenimanya (phonetic).
MR. WEBSTER:
Dusabimana is at number 17.  Ndayisabe, Noeli is at number five 3.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Right.  With regard to Dusabimana, do you know if there was a relationship between Dusabimana and Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	He's the younger brother of Nzirorera.  He's the youngest if Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	How about Noeli, is there any relationship between Noeli and Nzirorera?
A.	Noel (sic) was the son of Nzirorera's older brother.  In other words, Nzirorera was Noel's uncle.  Noel's father was known as Mutema (phonetic).
Q.	Where did this training take place?
A.	At the commune office of Mukingo.
Q.	Can you tell me if the training took place out in the open or in secret?
A.	The initial training took place in secret; whereas the latter training exercises took place in the open, in public.
Q.	Well, tell us about the secret portion of the training; what did that consistent of?
A.	We, the Interahamwe, were taught how to handle weapons and we were behind the commune office.  The intent was to go and hunt down the Tutsis, and the Tutsis were not suppose to know that we were being taught how to handle weapons.
Q.	But you make a distinction between training that took place in public and training that took place in secret.  And I'm trying to understand what portion of the training was secret.
A.	During the secret training exercises we would be brought guns and were told how to handle those weapons; whereas in public, in the open, we were only given pieces of wood, which were to be used as guns, and we would use those bits of wood as guns.
Q.	Well, where did the secret portion of the training take place?
A.	Below the commune office there was an enclosure made out of stones, that's where we would do the training.
Q.	And the portion of the training that was not secret, where did that take place?
A.	In front of the commune office.  Sometimes we would go to Gisesero.  We would also go to Gisesero.
Q.	And where is Gisesero in relation to the commune office?
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, Gisesero is number 26 on the sheet.
THE WITNESS:
Gisesero is on the other side of the road, in fact, just opposite the commune office.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You mentioned that you had trained with weapons.  Where did the weapons come from -- with guns, rather?
A.	The weapons came from Ruhehe.
Q.	And where or what is Ruhehe?
A.	It's a hill which is opposite the commune office.  It's a little bit above the main road.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, Ruhehe is spelled R-U-H-E-H-E.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, with reference to Ruhehe, Mr. Witness, was that a military -- tell us exactly where Ruhehe is, what took place on Ruhehe?
A.	There were military positions on that hill.  Habyarimana's army had a camp on that hill.
Q.	And is it your testimony that the weapons came -- tell us how the weapons that you received were related to what went on the Ruhehe hill?
A.	Our instructors would go and collect the weapons from that Ruhehe hill.
Q.	How long was your training?  Over what period of time did you receive this training?
A.	The training lasted for about two months.
Q.	How many other persons received this training at the same time you did, if you can estimate?
A.	We were about 25 in number.
Q.	The guns that you received to do this training, were these things that you could keep for yourself or were they left behind?
A.	We returned the weapons at the end of the training session and the weapons were taken back to Ruhehe hill.
Q.	Did you receive training in anything other than weapons and military drills?  Was there any other aspect to the training that you received?
A.	No.
Q.	Did Kajelijeli participate in this training, either as an instructor or someone who was being trained?
A.	No, he would come to the place where the training was taking place.
Q.	Did he say anything to you at that time?
A.	He would encourage us to finish our training quickly.  He would ask the instructors to teach us as quickly as possible.
Q.	Mr. Witness, did Joseph Nzirorera ever speak to you about this training?
A.	No, he didn't come to that place.
Q.	Did he discuss it with you in any other place?
A.	Yes, he would speak to us when we were at his mother's house.
Q.	Was this after the training or while it was ongoing?
A.	It would be after the training.
Q.	What types of things did he say to you?
A.	That's when he told us to go and hunt down the Tutsis.
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera have any role to play in your training, either directly or indirectly?
A.	He's the one who sent us the guns, he and Bizimungu.
Q.	Well, tell us how he sent you the guns.  Did he deliver them to you personally?
A.	Our instructors told us that he and Bizimungu had placed guns at our disposal, so he was not the one who brought the guns in person.
Q.	Aside from what your instructors told you, did you have any other basis to arrive at the conclusion that Joseph Nzirorera provided the guns?
A.	No, I know that subsequently he had asked who amongst us had received military training and we gave him the names of the persons amongst us who had received such training.
Q.	Well, when he asked you that question, did he say anything else to you?
A.	He added that those people who had learned weapons handling should hunt down the Tutsis.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you had mentioned a meeting or a rally where President Habyarimana was present, in one of your previous responses.  Do you remember when that meeting took place; if you remember?
A.	I know the meeting took place between the first and second attack launched by the Inkotanyi.
Q.	But independent of saying it was between the first attack and the second attack of the Inkotanyi, would you be able to tell us the year that it took place?  If you cannot, you can say as much, but if you can you can tell us.
A.	It was in November 1992.
Q.	Were you present for this meeting?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Would you be able to tell us if this meeting took place before or after the Interahamwe were created in Mukingo?  Which came first, the creation of the Interahamwe or --
A.	It was after the Interahamwe were created.
Q.	Can you tell us what you remember about this meeting?
A.	Habyarimana arrived.  He said the following:  "They say that the soldiers are campaigning on my behalf, but its actually my Interahamwe who are doing that for me, and they are enough for me."  He also said that there wasn't enough clothing and that is what he heard in different communes.  He added that a deal had to be struck with the traders, so that the Interahamwe could be clothed.
Q.	Why does this incident stand out in your mind?
A.	I remember that because during that meeting Habyarimana was present in the stadium.  I can tell you even a child who is 15 years old today would remember that event.
Q.	Well, what was so unusual about it, Mr. Witness?
A.	What was memorable about it, why I remember it, was that the president arrived.  He arrived after the Inkotanyi attack and after the creation of the Interahamwe.
Q.	Is that the end of your response?  The only reason you remember it is because it was after the Inkotanyi attack?
A.	The last attack was launched shortly after that meeting at the stadium.
Q.	When you say "the last attack," what are you referring to?  Tell us exactly what you mean.
A.	The Inkotanyi attack on Ruhengeri.
Q.	I'm just trying to understand what you're saying. The last -- was there an attack of the Inkotanyi after the meeting with Habyarimana?
A.	That is correct, when the Inkotanyi took Ruhengeri.
Q.	Okay.  So we understand how the sequence of events played out, but what I'm trying to understand is why this meeting with Habyarimana was memorable for you.  Why does it stand out in your mind?
A.	The reason I remember is that Ruhengeri was taken and they said, "Why did Habyarimana make that speech he made in Ruhengeri?"
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told us about the creation of the Amahindure.  Do you recall when that was, in relation to either -- let me withdraw that.  Do you recall when the creation of the Amihindure took place, in relation to the other events you've described?
A.	The Amahindure were created between the first attack and the meeting that Habyarimana participated in.  It was between the meeting and the second attack.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like to direct your attention to April of 1994.  Do you recall where you were when you first learned that the president's plane had been shot or had been shot down?
A.	Yes, I remember.
Q.	Tell us where that was and what happened thereafter.
A.	I was at home with my parents.  In the morning, at about five in the morning, I came out, I went to the market.  When I arrived there *******met me and they said *****and Kajelijeli and Bizimungu and Nyabusore, as well as Bizabarimana and Setako, all had held a meeting.  That meeting had taken place at Nzirorera's mother's house.  They said that, furthermore, the meeting had concluded and that the Tutsis had to be killed because they were the ones who had murdered Habyarimana.
Q.	Now, remind us of who is telling you this.  Who is the person telling you this?
A.	It was Dusabimana and Kajelijeli.  They were present.  They were at that drinking establishment just near.
Q.	Just near where, please?
A.	Just near Nyiramakuba's house.  The two places are separated by the road.  It's Nzirorera's mother.
MR. WEBSTER:
And for the record, Nyiramakuba is N-Y-I-R-A-M-A-K-U-B-A.
THE WITNESS:
They brought guns.  I think there were five of them from Nyiramakuba's place.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Who brought the guns and where did they bring them?
A.	Dusabimana carried the first gun.  Noeli was the second.  The third one was held by Muhombo.  Musafiri and Barebose (phonetic) were also armed.  All of those guns were at Nzirorera's mother's house.
Q.	Did you ever go to Nzirorera's mother's house any time during the course of that day?
A.	No, I didn't go there, but I was on the road at a place where you can clearly see the house in question.
Q.	Well, can you describe to the Court what you saw on the morning of April 7?  What did you see going on at the house, if anything?
A.	I saw those people bring guns.  As the meeting was over Bizabarimana later brought more guns.  Those were given by those on the Ruhehe hill. 

Michel, after getting the weapons - well, he had a hatchet.  He used it to kill Rukara.
Q.	All right, begin by telling us who is Bizibarimana.  Who is this person?  What is his status in your community?
A.	Bizibarimana was a major in the army in Mukemira camp.
Q.	Among the people that you've just described, were any other members of that group members of the military?
A.	Yes, Colonel Setako.
Q.	Did you see him that morning?
A.	Yes, I saw him come out of that house.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know if there was any contact, in any form, between any of the persons that you've just mentioned to us, and Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	Most of the time Nzirorera would arrive at night.  It was difficult to know where he went.  His departure was never announced.  We didn't have that type of information.  Personally, I believe that Nzirorera was at his mother's house.  Colonel Baheza and the -- Colonel Baheza and Nyabusore could not go to Nyiramakuba's house if Nzirorera was not there.  They weren't there to speak with her.
Q.	But my question to you, Witness, is based upon your interactions with any of the persons that you've just described.  Thinking back to that morning, do you know if there was any contact between those persons and Joseph Nzirorera; contact of any form?
A.	Dusabimana, his brother, said that Nzirorera gave the orders.  I don't know if he did that from Kigali or he was present in Byangabo when he did it.  Sometimes he would come and he would leave at five in the morning, after doing what he had to do.  So I don't know when they spoke, but this is what his brother told us.
Q.	Well, thinking back to that morning, can you remember anything else that his brother told you?  In other words, what did Dusabimana tell you that morning, as much as you can remember?
A.	Dusabimana told us that Nzirorera had called him.  They spoke over the phone.  Nzirorera had ordered that even his child should be killed.  This was a child that he had with a Tutsi woman.
Q.	Did Dusabimana say anything else that you can remember?
A.	No.
Q.	No, he didn't say anything else or no you can't remember anything else?
A.	Yes, he said some things, but since it's been such a long time I can only tell you what I remember.
Q.	Can you tell us what happened after that conversation with Dusabimana?
A.	Michel Niyigaba struck Rukara with a hatchet right in front of Bonasayses store, it was a pharmacy, in fact. 
Another person who was killed, was called Lucia, Rukara's brother.  After that, we went up to Gapfogo Rutamilet.  We first raped a girl.  Her name was Joyce.  After that we killed her.  
After that Iyamuremye cut Nyiraburanga's breast off.  At that time *************************
          ******************.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the witness pronounce that name, perhaps, it was not clear.
THE WITNESS:
Those girls were killed by Sabini.  

Kizungu and his children were burned alive in their home by Théoneste, Théoneste Mwambutsa.  And then Musafiri shot down Karekezi.
MR. WEBSTER:
Hold on a second please.  

For the record Iyamuremye is at 31 on our list.  Kizungu is at number 40 on our list.
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm sorry, could you give us the context of these names? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The names the witness just mentioned?
MR. O'SHEA:
I wasn't able to catch the names and put them down.  I'm sorry.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned that --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I think it will be more useful for us to proceed in the following manner:  Each time he mentions a name we should spell it out instead of coming back after or give the number at that time on the list.
MR. WEBSTER:
I agree, Your Honour.  I will try to do that.  But by the time I've heard the name he's gone on in his response because I hear it in English a few moments after everyone else hears it in French, and the witness has already moved on, but I will attempt to slow him down and give myself the opportunity to spell it out.  But the translation is taking place in relay, so actually the English speakers are the last to hear what the witness is saying.   By the time we hear it he's gone on to another portion of his answer.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned a certain Mr. Iyamuremye, which is number 31 on the list.  Tell us what this person did.  I'm referring back to your previous response.
A.	Iyamuremye, son of Zyerarusha (phonetic), cut off one of Nyiraburanga's breasts.
Q.	Okay, Nyiraburanga -- hold on, please, Mr. Witness --
MR. WEBSTER:
Nyiraburanga is at number 66 of our list.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, where did this take place?  I'm talking about the incident that involved Iyamuremye and Nyiraburanga?
A.	It was in Busogo cellule, Busogo secteur, just neighbouring Rwankeli.
Q.	You mentioned some other events.  You mentioned a certain Joyce and persons that were present when Joyce was attacked and raped.  Tell us the names of the persons that were present for that incident, please.  But after your response, pause a moment so that I can spell out those names for the other parties.
A.	Nteziyaremye, Rugumire and Gapfogo, who was called "corporal".
MR. WEBSTER:
Nteziyareme is number 59, and Gapfogo is at No. 20 of our list.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now tell us what each of these persons did, Mr. Witness.
A.	Those men found her at Rudatinya's, the grandfather's.  They raped and her and killed her.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record Rudatinya is at 71 on our list.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you know whether Joyce was Tutsi or Hutu or any other ethnicity?
A.	She was Tutsi.
Q.	And with respect to Gapfogo and Nteziyaremye, do you know their ethnicity?
A.	They were Hutus.
Q.	Can you tell us if either one of those two or both of them or none of them were members of national Amahindure or members of the Interahamwe?
A.	They were both Interahamwe and Amahindure members, both of them.
Q.	Do you recall if either of those two persons were ever present while you were present in a meeting with Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	Yes, we were together in such a meeting.
Q.	You mentioned some other names in relation to other incidents in your previous response.  Can you mention them to us again, please?
A.	Théoneste Mwambutsa.
MR. WEBSTER:
Mwambutsa Is number 50.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Was this person a member of the Interahamwe or a member of the Amahindure?
A.	He was an Interahamwe but he was never a member of the Amahindure.
Q.	Do you know if he received any military training in his status as an Interahamwe, if you know?
A.	No, he was trained after the last attack.
Q.	Do you recall if he was ever present while you were present at meetings held with Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	He was there, too.
Q.	Tell us what Mwambutsa did, please, on that morning.
A.	He burned Kinzugu and Kinzugu's three children.
MR. WEBSTER:
Kinzungu is at number 40 of our list.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Where did this occur, please?
A.	In Rwankeli, in Busogo, the same place.
Q.	Now, did all these events take place on the 7th of April.  I'm trying to simply ascertain for the record when these incidents are taking place.
A.	Yes, on the 7th.
Q.	Do you recall what time of day it was when these incidents took place?
A.	No.  We left in the morning.  None of us had a watch.  We didn't check.
Q.	Tell us what else happened that morning.
A.	Many Tutsis were killed at that place.  Some of them took refuge in the convent.
Q.	What place are we talking about, please?
A.	The same place, between Rwankeli and Busogo.
Q.	All right, now, you just mentioned a convent.  Can you tell us what happened there?
A.	Tutsis took refuge there.  Then Kajelijeli's brother, who was a teacher at Nzirorera's school, came to inform us that the Tutsis who had fled had taken refuge at the sister's convent.  And so we went there.  Myself, when I arrived at Busogo hill, I found a cow in a pond.  I slaughtered that cow, and while I was doing that the others continued.  Upon their return, they talked about what they had just done.  They said that they had killed the Tutsis who were at the sister's convent.  Now, when I went home with the meat I met Gasominari and Gasominari's children.  I gave them to Sader (phonetic) -- to the CDR, rather.  The CDR was led by Gasominari, Nzirorera's brother.
MR. WEBSTER:
Gasominari is number 22 on our list.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, I'm going to take you back in your testimony a bit because I'd like us to go into a bit of detail.  What happened to Gasominari?
A.	After slaughtering the cow that was on Busogo hill, I cut it up and took the meat with me home.  On the way I met Gasominari with his two children.  I brought them to the place where the other Tutsis were taking refuge.  When we arrived over there we found a girl.  This girl was nicknamed "CDR" and she was in the CDR party.
Q.	Tell us whether Gasominari -- tell us what ethnic identification Gasominari held.
A.	He was Tutsi, and so were the two children.
Q.	Why did you bring them to the church?
A.	Not to the church, I brought them to the house.
Q.	So their house?
A.	Yes, there I found a girl nicknamed "CDR", she was a member of the CDR party.  Gasominari was the leader of that party.  Those people were killed.
Q.	I'm still trying to understand why you brought them to the house.  Was it for purposes of killing them, for purposes of saving them?  Tell us your motivation.
A.	It was in order to kill them.
Q.	You mentioned the CDR.  Can you tell us what the CDR party was, please?
A.	The CDR party was a party known as Turimaso (phonetic), which means that "At the CDR we are vigilant."
Q.	Well, what do you mean by "vigilant", Mr. Witness, or what was meant by vigilant in that context?
A.	What that means is that if they were to be attacked they would be found at the ready, ready to resist.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, do you know what was the relationship -- or if there was a relationship between the CDR and the MRND?
A.	It was said that the CDR was the MRND's brother and that the two parties were parties for Hutus.
Q.	Well, did you know of any Tutsi that was a member of the CDR?
A.	None.
Q.	What about Tutsis that would be members of the Interahamwe?
A.	There weren't any.
Q.	What about the Amahindure?
A.	There weren't any Tutsis there.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned to us the attack on the church, or you mentioned the church in any case.  Would you go on in your account, please?  Tell us what happened there.
A.	It's, rather, at the convent.  I told you that I didn't go there.  My companions went there, they killed people there, they stole vehicles which they brought back to Byangabo.
Q.	And when you mentioned your companions continuing and going on and leaving you behind, what did you do?  I'm just trying to understand what is going on in time.
A.	I remained on Busogo hill, and I was slaughtering and cutting up the cow I had referred to.
Q.	Did you do anything else during the course of that day?
A.	No, I didn't do anything else on that day.
Q.	Can you tell us what, if anything, happened the following day?
A.	The following day the assailants went to Musumba to kill.
Q.	To kill who?
A.	The Tutsis.
Q.	And when you say "the assailants", who are you referring to?
A.	The Interahamwe.
Q.	Were you among them?
A.	Yes, we left.  We left on board vehicles in order to go and kill the Tutsis at Musumba.  I was amongst the group.
Q.	What commune is Musumba in?
A.	Musumba is between Nkuli commune and Mukingo commune, but the place where we were is close by the forest, a little bit further away than Nyaberehe (phonetic) but still within Mukingo commune.  The place where we were is in Mukingo commune, its near Gakarara.
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, we don't have the spellings of those last two words on our list.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, how many persons were killed in Musumba, if you can estimate, on the morning of the 8th or during the course of the 8th of April?
A.	We found the Interahamwe of that place there.  They were mostly soldiers who had come from Rubari and who had begun to shoot the Tutsis when we got there.  They also burnt down the houses.
Q.	When you say they were soldiers, could you tell us a bit more about that, please?
A.	We found soldiers who were shooting at houses.  At that point in time Noel was struck by an arrow to his jaw.  The arrow came from a window of a house.
Q.	And you say Noel, tell us who this person is that got struck.
A.	He was Ndayisaba, Noeli who was Mutema's son.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, thinking of the attacks on the 7th, the day before, did you observe soldiers participating in those attacks, the attacks that you described for us a few minutes ago?
A.	Yes.  Some of them even burnt down houses.  I'll mention for instance Rachel, who was at the Bigogwe camp.  They burnt down houses using petrol.
Q.	Do you know where the other soldiers came from?
A.	No.  I know that there was a lorry which came from the Mukemira camp and which was having soldiers and weapons aboard it.  That lorry dropped off the weapons and the soldiers at Rwankeli.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when you think of the events of April 7th and the events of April 8th, would you have any basis for estimating how many people were killed during the attacks, during the attacks by the Interahamwe on the persons and the groups of persons that you have just described, if you know, if you are in a position to estimate.
A.	At Rwankeli I would guess about 300 Tutsi were killed. 

As for Busogo, I am unable to give you an estimate for that location, and I'm not able to give you an estimate, either, regarding the Musumba victims because most of them were burnt alive inside their houses, but we burnt down two houses there.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, do you know if anyone survived, if any of the Tutsi of Busogo survived those attacks of the 7th and the 8th, if you know?
A.	Yes, there were survivors.
Q.	How many, if you can estimate, if you have a basis to estimate?
A.	I think that there wouldn't be more than six or seven survivors of those killings.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you described attacks on women, in particular, that women were raped.  Did anyone order you to rape the women?
A.	No, no one.
Q.	Do you have an explanation of why these rapes took place on that day?
A.	Each person has his or her own conscience and I have no comment on that.
Q.	Well, with respect to the burning of houses.
A.	Yes, we had been ordered to do so.
Q.	By whom?
A.	When the attacks began the victims would rush into their houses and lock themselves in.  In order to get them out, it was necessary to burn down the houses because often these houses had straw roofs.
Q.	After these killings took place and the attacks, the burnings, the rapes, the shootings, did you have any contact with any person that you regarded as among the authorities in Mukingo?  Was there any further contact or any discussion of these events with the authorities?
A.	No, after these events the land belonging to the victims was sold and then we were rewarded with Rachal's land, and after that meeting with the authorities there was another attack.
Q.	Well, what meeting are we talking about here?  You said a meeting with the authorities.  When did this meeting take place?
A.	Kajelijeli had been removed from office because he was persecuting Tutsis.  Now, when he was reinstated, let me tell that you Bourgmestre Harera, who had suceded Kajelijeli was poisoned and he died.  Subsequently Nzirorera and other persons in authority came and installed Kajelijeli, and Kajelijeli said thank you.
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, we have to go over that portion of your testimony bit by bit.  When you refer to Kajelijeli being removed as bourgmestre, are you referring to an incident that took place before April 7, 1994, or after April 7, 1994?
A.	It was before, before the 7th of April.  It was before 1992.  I think -- no, I think he was removed from office in 1993, because the Tutsis in his commune were disappearing.  After him one Herera, a member of the MDR, replaced him as bourgmestre.  When Nzirorera reinstated Kajelijeli, Herera was already dead.  He had been poisoned.
Q.	Right. 
A.	He died on the 8th of April.
Q.	With respect to the death of Herara, can you tell us under what circumstances he died?  Do you know any further details?
A.	Herara was in his office.  We were informed simply that he collapsed in his office and he died.  But I know that Herara was against the extermination of the Tutsis.  He was against the killings of the Tutsis.
Q.	And how do you know that, Mr. Witness?
A.	In the evening of the 7th he came, and on the 8th he was the one who supervised the burying of the bodies, and in the afternoon of the same day, the 8th, he was in his office and it was said that he fell asleep in his office and passed away.
Q.	After he passed away, what happened to Kajelijeli?
A.	Kajelijeli was reinstated.  He came together with Nzirorera and other persons in authority.  He was introduced at the Gisesero football pitch.
Q.	Would you have any idea of when this took place?  Would you be able to tell us a month or a period of time in relation to any other event so that we could understand when this event took place?
A.	Before the end of the attacks on Mukingo there were other attacks launched on the Court of Appeals building, about one week after the initial attacks.  And then, after these attacks, we went to kill the people who were at the Court of Appeals.  The same evening on the radio a journalist announced that the cockroaches, the Inyenzi, had killed people; whereas we knew very well we were the ones who had done that job.
Q.	Right, Mr. Witness, we're going to go into that in detail, but I was trying to situate in time when this meeting with Kajelijeli and Nzirorera took place.  Can you tell us if it was after the attack on the Court of Appeals or before that attack, or if you could tell us the month?
A.	It was after the attack on the Court of Appeals.
Q.	Would you be able to say how long after the 7th of April this meeting with Nzirorera and Kajelijeli took place, was it weeks later, months later; if you remember?
A.	It was about three weeks after the 7th of April.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned the Court of Appeals.  Can you tell us a bit more about that?  What happened in relation to the Court of Appeals?
A.	People came to fetch us from Byangabo so that we can go and support the Ruhengeri Interahamwe.  First of all, we refused.
Q.	When you say people came to fetch you, tell us who these people were.  If you don't know their names, describe them.
A.	It was the Interahamwe who came to fetch us.
Q.	Where did they find you?
A.	They found us at Byangabo.
Q.	What happened when they found you?  Tell us what happened next.
A.	We were asked to go and reinforce the other Interahamwe, and we refused, initially.
Q.	What happened afterwards?
A.	Initially we refused, saying that Kajelijeli was the only leader for us in Mukingo commune and that we needed to have them find Kajelijeli first.  They in fact, went to fetch Kajelijeli, and he came.  After his arrival, he told us that we needed to go and support the others.  He had a vehicle.  He was with the warrant officer Karorero.  I went onto their vehicle.  The warrant officer gave me three grenades.  He gave me two M-26s and a Chinese grenade made of wood.  We went up in order to collect other members of the CDR at Jerez's (phonetic) house.  It was Kajelijeli who bought us fuel at Mukemira.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are going to have to tell us, what are M-26s?
A.	It was a kind of grenade which had a kind of pin.
Q.	And you mentioned going to get fuel.  Pick up your story from there, please.
A.	Yes, I did say that it was Kajelijeli who bought the fuel for us.
Q.	What happened next?
A.	We went down -- up to Ruhengeri to the Court of Appeals where we found gendarmes guarding Tutsis.
Q.	When you say "we", Mr. Witness, can you tell us who was with you?
A.	It was other Interahamwes such as ****************************************************************, **************************************************.
Q.	So we'll start again with the persons that accompanied you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, we would like to adjourn in five minutes, at most.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, what I can propose is that we adjourn now and that I think I would be able to complete my direct-examination of this witness with perhaps another hour at the most.  So if we could continue on another day it shouldn't take me much longer to finish with this witness.  I only have one or two other incidents to explore.

I'm sorry, I have one request, Your Honour.  One of my colleagues from the Bagosora trial team is present with me this morning.  He has an application to make to Trial Chamber III which has to be resolved today and he's asked me to convey his concerns to the Trial Chamber.  If he could have a few minutes of your time to address you on another matter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Is it Mr. White?
MR. WHITE:
Yes thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  For the record, my name is Drew White.  I'm Prosecution counsel in the Bagosora and others case ICTR file number 98-41-T.  I think I can I resolve this issue but I need to bring it before you in one or two minutes. 
This is an oral application pursuant to Rule 75.  It relates to protective measures for witnesses.  The reason I am bringing it before this Trial Chamber is because this is the Trial Chamber that made the original order.  The parties have notice.  I have just come from Trial Chamber I and indicated to all of the parties there that I would be making this application.  There is no objection taken to either the application being made or to the relief that is sought.  

The facts are very simple, they are just these.  This morning I received a message from the head of the support unit for WVSS, Madam Sylvie Becky.  Madam Becky advised that, in particular -- with particular to a witness who is anticipated to give evidence in Trial Chamber I next week and who will be arriving this weekend that that protected witness has sought to waive the protective measures afforded to him.  In other words, he wants to testify in open court.  And he will require other accommodation than what WVSS normally provides. 

Trial Chamber I does anticipate hearing that witness next week, so there is some urgency to this matter this morning trying to resolve it before the witness comes into Arusha within the next 48 hours.  The situation, with respect to the order, is slightly more complicated in that the protective measures that presently exist arise from a series of orders, the most recent one being the 5th of December 2001 before this Trial Chamber in Bagosora et al under the same file number I referred to. 

There are four prior orders which also relate to the protective measures.  And with respect to the variation or the relief that is sought, although this is an oral application, I did take the liberty of trying to put my thoughts down in the last 45 minutes into a very, very brief terse summary of what it is we are requesting.  And you can see the single sentence relief that is sought on page 2.  What we are requesting is simply this, that any witness who wishes to waive protective measures may do so upon advising either the Trial Chamber hearing the matter, that would be Trial Chamber I in this case, or the WVSS, in respect of any protective measures granted under the orders of this Trial Chamber, that would be Trial Chamber III.  So the purpose is simply to grant authorisation to WVSS to deal with this particular witness in an unprotected manner, and if the relief is granted it would also allow WVSS to deal with subsequent witnesses in the same manner if they request to waive protective the measures without returning to the Trial Chamber again, hat in hand, asking for urgent ancillary relief.  With respect, those are all my submissions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before we proceed, we would wish to release the witness and the counsel in this case because they are not directly concerned with this motion.  The session will continue on Monday in this particular case, in Karemera et al, Monday.

Very well, this Chamber will render its decision.  Judge Arrey is going to read this.
JUDGE ARREY:
The Trial Chamber has considered the request made by the Prosecutor and orders as follows:  "That any witness who wishes to waive protective measures may do so upon advising either the Trial Chamber hearing the matter or the WVSS in respect of any protective measures granted under the orders of this Trial Chamber."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, the decision has been rendered for you, Mr. White.
MR. WHITE:
I thank you for the Trial Chamber's time, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Webster, as we said a moment ago, we are going to adjourn. The session stands adjourned.
	(Court adjourned at 1343H)
