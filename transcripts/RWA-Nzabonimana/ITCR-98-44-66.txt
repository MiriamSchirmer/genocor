   MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Could the registry introduce the case coming before the Trial Chamber this morning please.
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal For Rwanda composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday the 16th of April 2003, for the continuation of the Defence case when Defence Counsel, Mr. Hinds, will continue with the examination-in-chief of the accused Juvénal Kajelijeli, in the matter of the Prosecution versus Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  May we have the appearance of the parties, starting with the Prosecution, if we may, for the record. 
MS. OJEMENI:
With due respect, Your Honour, Ifeoma Ojemeni.  I appear with Dorothée Marotine, case manager for the Prosecution.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  May we also have the appearance of the Defence for the record, please.
MR. HINDS:
Good morning, Your Honours, Lennox Hinds representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor Bompaka, Assistant Juliet Chinaud and Interpreter Emilien Dusabe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  Accused, the Trial Chamber reminds you of the sworn declaration that you made last Monday and that you continue with your evidence today on that same sworn declaration.
THE ACCUSED KEJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to tell you that I have a serious problem.  This problem --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I have hypertension.  My heart is beating fast, but I will try to follow as much as I can because I cannot interrupt the procedure, but whatever happens, I will let you know.  My -- I have high blood pressure.  Sometimes people say that people play the comedy, but I would like to respect the procedure.  Whatever happens, I will let you know of any development.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Professor Hinds, are you aware of the Accused's condition?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I have not spoken to my client.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh sure, we understand that.
MR. HINDS:
No, I haven't spoken with him since Monday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that is true.
MR. HINDS:
So I'm just now hearing this.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, because --
MR. HINDS:
For the first time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, we understand that, yes.
MR. HINDS:
Well, I'm concerned because I think that we should make some inquiry to find out --  I don't know what his situation is, whether or not he has been checked by a doctor to see if his blood pressure is elevated.  If it is elevated, how high it is, I don't want him to have a stroke on the stand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we need --
MR. HINDS:
So, I don't know how he knows -- I don't know if he knows whether it is elevated.  He may just be feeling palpitations which may be an indication of something.  But the situation -- I know that he has a condition of hypertension, but maybe we need to know from him what are his symptoms, what does he feel at this moment.
MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.
THE ACCUSED KEJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  When I came I was feeling fine but when I sat somewhere it was a bit hot.  So I wanted the temperature to be reduced.  And when it couldn't go down, I took some cold water.  Right now, the heart is still pumping fast but we can continue.  Whatever happens, you will know of any further developments, but whatever I'm -- but I'm telling you that I don't have sufficient energy and my breathing is not regular.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I think you will need to see a doctor first.  Sorry, I didn't get the answer.

THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Yes, that would be helpful if I saw the doctor.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsels, I think we propose to adjourn for a while for him to see a doctor.  What do you say to that, Counsel?   At least we know what the condition is.
MR. HINDS:
I think, Your Honour, that is a prudent and wise decision.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour and I also concur.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All right, I think we will adjourn for -- all right.  We'll adjourn the proceedings for 40 minutes to enable the Accused to see a doctor on his condition that he has told the Trial Chamber.  And then after, we will come and proceed or be advised accordingly, for 40 minutes.  Okay, let us put it, we'll just resume at 10.  All right.
MR. HINDS:
Ten.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope by then the Accused would have been seen by a doctor.  Make the necessary arrangements as quickly as possible.  So, we'll adjourn this proceeding until 10 o'clock. 
	(Court recessed at 0914H and resumed at 1015H).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Accused, the registry informs that you are in a position to continue with these proceedings.  Is that correct?  You have seen a doctor?
THE ACCUSED KEJELIJELI:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have been given some drugs, we shall see what it will give.  We can continue, but I was feeling very bad, but the doctor says that it is okay for the time being.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Good.  Then we will continue then.  Learned counsel, Professor Hinds.
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
WITNESS JUVÉNAL KAJELIJELI
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (Continued)
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Kajelijeli?
A.	Good morning.
Q.	I would like you to try to be as brief as possible in your responses.  And if I would require additional information, I will ask you.  Okay?
A.	Okay.
Q.	Now, yesterday at the end of the day, you testified about the situation on April 10, do you recall?
A.	Yes, I do recall that.
Q.	And do you recall that you testified that you were at home in Nkuli on that day; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	Did you leave your home at any time on the 10th?
A.	I never left my house.
Q.	Could you tell the Tribunal what was the situation in the commune and in the environs of Nkuli between the 11th to the 14th.  What was the situation? 
A.	Thank you, very much.  There is no way I could tell the situation all around the commune.  I could only tell what I was doing on my own because I was -- I was also following the news on the radio especially concerning the war.  During that period you mentioned, there was war, there was fighting.  That is all I can remember.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, I would like to direct your attention to the 11th.  Do you recall, what if anything, you did on the 11th, that is the 11th of April?
A.	Yes, indeed, I did something.
Q.	Okay.  Can you share with the Tribunal what you did on the 11th?
A.	I went to open for the workers, the staff at Mukamira where I said I was on the 6th, so that they may continue their work, then I went back home.  And then I went back to Mukamira and I went back home at 12.  At the time, it was morning, and the workers they had some work to do on the house.  So I was leaving my house at Mukamira and then go back home.  That was the main activity.
Q.	When you say the house at Mukamira, what type of structure, what type of building was that that was being constructed?
A.	At home we talk about house whether it is a shop or elsewhere, but it was a commercial house that was under construction that belonged to my brother.  It was actually a commercial house, a shop.  But we all -- we refer to that as a house for whatever purpose.
Q.	Did you do anything that day other than supervise the construction of that, what you call commercial building?
A.	Yes.  I said after opening for them so that they may continue their work, I went back home.  And at home, there were workers, I was supervising those in charge of cultivation and cutting down the forest, I received them home because they were giving a report of the progress of their work because it was quite a while I hadn't seen them.  

After seeing them, I went back to Mukamira.  I went to tell the workers to go back home.  That is what I did.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, after you left the position of bourgmestre in February of 1993 to the time that you resumed that position in June of 1994, what were you doing for a living?  What was your vocation?
A.	After leaving that position of bourgmestre, I was doing some work.
Q.	We understand.  I want you to describe to the Tribunal what was the nature of your business?  What were you doing for a living?
A.	There is a problem.  What kind of job, I believe that the translator could put it in such a way that I understand what is meant by activity, the kind of activity we were exercising.  What activities, what kind of activities have different connotation.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I think Counsel wants to know what you were doing for a living.
THE ACCUSED KEJELIJELI:
I think that is better said.  Could I continue?  I think he has corrected the terminology.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Okay, do you understand the question?
A.	Okay.
Q.	Can you share with the Tribunal?
A.	Thank you.  On leaving my position as bourgmestre, I decided to work on my own.  The kind of job I was doing was an agricultural activity and trade and business.  And I was also a contractor with other traders that had signed with the government to undertake some work.  And we would agree on how I would give them what is required and then I would bill them, and they would pay me after taking what I supplied to them.  Those who had a contract with the government, for example, those who were supplying prisons, schools and establishments like that.  

I also told you that I had workers who would cut down trees for firewood.  And we had an agreement with the minister of finance.  And they would supply -- and they would tell me the amount of wood required, and then I would buy from people who owned forest.  And then my workers would go and cut down trees for firewood.  After supplying them, then I would bill them.  Then schools would tell me their requirement in firewood, especially in food staffs, because I had two teams for cultivation and the second team was supplying firewood.  I would supervise both activities.  And I would know exactly every activity, that is agriculture and wood supply.  Those were my two activities when I left the job of bourgmestre.  

And I felt it was bringing in some good revenue in a manner that I could feed my family and educate my children without having to beg for money left and right or someone would laugh at me because I had left the job of bourgmestre.  In brief, the kind of job I was doing is that, agricultural activity and supplying firewood to various establishments.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, when you said you were talking to or discussing with your workers on the 11th at your home, what workers were you referring to with respect to the businesses that you were engaged in?
A.	There were two supervisors, one was in charge of firewood, the other was in charge of agriculture.  They had brought lists of the days that they had worked so that I may prepare their salaries for the month.
Q.	Now, did you do anything else on the 11th?
A.	After talking with them, I went to Mukamira because it was time to close the day, so to tell my workers to go home.  It means that around 5 p.m. I was at Mukamira.  We closed down the work and then I went back home.  That is all I know, that is all I did on that day.
Q.	Now, was the curfew in effect on the 11th?
A.	Yes.  The curfew continued on the 11th, yes.   And there was a lot of serious fighting and you could hear that the fighting was approaching Ruhengeri and Mukingo and, therefore, there was curfew in place.
Q.	How could you tell that the fighting was approaching, as you say, Mukingo?
A.	Me, I could follow it because I could hear explosions and because people were saying that the Rwanda armed forces were fighting against the RPF, and I heard explosions and even on the radio it was being announced.
Q.	Did you leave your home on the 12th of April?
A.	Yes.  I left my house, yes.
Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal under what circumstances you left your house on the 12th and where did you go?
A.	On that day, I left my house around 9:30.  I took the vehicle and I went in the direction of Mukingo commune where I had workers cutting down the forest. 
Q.	Now, where in Mukingo did you go with respect to cutting down forest?
A.	It was in Mukingo commune between the higher institute and CIFOTAJ (phonetic), there is a forest, that is where I went to see the workers that were cutting down the forest.  That is where I went on that day because I was checking the kind of -- the amount of work they have done.  And on that day there was a vehicle that was supposed to take away the firewood that had been cut down, I was also going to wait for it.  

After checking the work that had been done, it was like around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I went back to my house in Nkuli.
Q.	Did you engage in any other activities on the 12th?
A.	There is nothing else that I did on the 12th.
Q.	Were you engaged in any other activities, or different activities, rather, on the 13th.  And if so, could you describe those to the Tribunal?
A.	On the 13th, I went with my wife to visit her maternal uncle in a place called Rusiza in Nkuli commune, that one who had died together with his wife and children, it was necessary to go there on that date.
Q.	Could we have the spelling of the location?
A.	Yes.  The spelling of Rugerero is -- Rusiza, R-U-S-I-Z-A, Rusiza, And Rugerero, R-U-G-E-R-E-R-O, Rugerero.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  He said he went with the spouse, which spouse?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Yes.  When you said you went with your wife, who is this?
A.	It was Laurence because she had lost her maternal uncle and his family.  So, it was in Rusiza, two kilometres from my house going towards his home.
Q.	And what was the distance between where you lived and this place called Rusiza?
A.	It is between two and three kilometres distance.
Q.	And when you got to Rusiza, how long did you spend there?
A.	You'll understand in a family that had lost relatives, I spent some time there.  We came in the evening, especially as it was tough in the country and not motorable, so we went on foot and even my wife was sick and she couldn't walk fast.  But besides that being sick, when you go and visit somebody who has lost a relative, you don't go there and quickly go back.  We reached there around 4:30 and -- but by 4:30 we had reached home.
Q.	Did you spend the whole day visiting with the relatives of Laurence?
A.	That day was entirely for Laurence's uncle's family.  So I spent the whole of that time visiting them.
Q.	And can you tell the Tribunal, what if anything, you did on the 14th?
A.	Of April, on the 14th of April, I had -- I had a forest I had bought from the office of pareth^ from Rwanda, it was in a place called Kareba.  Kareba in Nkuli commune, that is where I spent the full day because the workers had all of that time been cutting down the trees.  And it is quite a distance before reaching there, you have to pass through Karago commune, the forest inside of it before you reach that area which I had bought.  It is quite a long journey there.  I spent the whole day there and I came back in the evening.  And I was checking the amount of work that had been done by the workers.  Then I went back home and at around about five o'clock I had reached my home.  I went home in the evening.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, during this time period, did you listen to any broadcasts that were on the radio?
A.	Yes.  I was listening to the radio and the news was quite bad ones.
Q.	What information did you learn from the radio, that is on the 14th?
A.	The first thing that I heard and it was fightening to me, I heard it the following day on the 15th, I mean what I heard.  But on the 14th, I couldn't listen to the radio because I went home tired, I simply ate and went to sleep.  On the 15th April, I heard some news.
Q.	Could you share with the Tribunal what you heard?
A.	The first one was the shocking news that from the 12th, the government had shifted to Gataraga but it had been kept secret and we only heard about it much later.  

The second shocking news that I heard on the 15th was very serious news that the refugees that had taken refuge in the Court of Appeals, that the RPF had shelled the Court with Katoucha (phonetic) rockets, that is what I heard on that day.  I heard that in the morning at around six, between six and 6:20, that is when I heard such news, and especially every time I would leave my house I would first listen to the news first.  And then I would listen to the news on later hours.  That is what I heard on the 15th of April 1994.
Q.	Did you subsequently learn of what actually happened at the court of appeals?
A.	On that day, I did not hear anything else, except that later on I met a medical doctor who was coming from Ruhengeri.  I met him near the higher institute.  He was coming from Ruhengeri going back home.  He said that what was said was wrong, but that it was only the Tutsi that had taken refuge into the court building, but usually I used to hear that the RPF used to kill people and was surprised at how a newsman could announce on radio that RPF killed people in the Court of Appeals building, and especially Tutsi people.  I was surprised.  I thought it was some kind of game they were playing, but I was very sad, indeed, to hear of such news, especially as the government had left Kigali for Gataraga, it meant that Kigali had been lost.  

I then, I was wondering how people could be killed in a courthouse.  In a place which I knew very well was being protected just like the préfecture building was protected.  So I was really confused, I didn't know, I didn't understand that news was given to me by the medical doctor that had left Ruhengeri that day.
Q.	Now, what was the name of the medical doctor who shared this information with you?
A.	I only remember his Christian name.  His name was Martin.  He was a soldier, he was a captain in the army, and he was a doctor treating the soldiers.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't quite understand what the Witness is saying what the doctor told him about the incident at the Court of Appeals.  It is not very clear.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Could you, Mr. Kajelijeli, repeat what this doctor, Dr. Martin, told you had occurred at the Court of Appeals?
A.	Thank you, thank you.  He told me that the people that were said to have been killed by the RPF who were Tutsi, and I was wondering how people could be killed, Tutsi people could be killed by RPF at the Court of Appeals.  It was quite puzzling to me.  I kept wondering exactly what happened and why a government news person could give such news.  If there were Tutsi that were killed there, it is not understandable, but the usual -- the usual thing was that people in the préfecture were killed, but if they were Tutsi refugees, if they were Tutsis it was not understandable how they could be killed in a place that is being guarded.  So I had to seek some further information to understand what game was being played.
MR. HINDS:
Is it clear, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, did you subsequently obtain additional information concerning what happened at the Court of Appeals?
A.	I later on came to get some precision.  I learned that those people at the court building had been attacked by hooligans that came and attacked the Court of Appeals building.  And I even knew that the court building was guarded by gendarme, but the hooligans they overcame the gendarme.  I don't understand why, especially as it was near the préfecture building, why the alarm couldn't be made so that soldiers could come to the rescue of the gendarme.  But even if there was any shooting, the préfecture authority could have intervened, but it seems that there were some politics being played.  It seems that people in charge of the préfecture were playing some games.  It is not understandable how people could be killed in such a place that is so heavily guarded.
MR. HINDS:
Is that a fire alarm?
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Kajelijeli, you can continue.
A.	As far as I'm concerned, I found the problem lay on the side of the administration, and that in due course it could be cleared.  And the person who was giving the news was a government official.  There was a lot of politics.  Especially what I knew is that there was some politics, and even that person who was giving news is right now employed by the government, he is in Rwanda.  So that is all I could tell.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, did you subsequently learn the events that took place in Nkuli -- withdrawn. 

Did you subsequently learn of the details of the events that took place on April 7th, in Mukingo?
A.	I thought I had said it sufficiently yesterday, except if you want me to repeat.
Q.	No, we don't want you to repeat.  Let me put the follow-up question to you.  Did you at any time visit the location where -- withdrawn.  

Did you at any time visit the parish church in Busogo?
A.	I cannot remember the date, but I recall we went for mass, to pray for those who had been killed, those who had been killed in the plane crash that killed the president.  I also had opportunity to talk with the reverend father in charge of the parish.  He is also the one who told me about what happened in the nuns convent.  He showed me where the bodies were heaped, where they were being transferred to, how the people were shooting through the windows of the nuns' home.  I thought the devil had invaded the whole country because the whole country was on fire and people were dying in large numbers.  And the reverend priest told me what happened and how people reacted.  We -- there is nothing we could do.  We only prayed for those who had died, especially as I was on the losing side, especially those people who had died in Kigali who are my relatives and the Tutsis who were my kith and kin and those I had helped in the past, who were, I would say, who were very grateful to me because before the war, we were on very good terms, we had no problem.  And I could recall you that before the war there was no notion of Tutsi, Hutu, it was not important.  We were all brothers and sisters and the elder would call you their son or their daughter, and it was a feeling that it was unimportant being Tutsi or Hutu.  But when the war came, the whole situation changed, but it didn't stop people from living together in harmony.  We had inter-married.  Hutus married Tutsis and vice versa.  And even survivors could tell you.  I have my sisters-in-laws living in Rwanda.  Contrary to what people say, I have in-laws among the Tutsis, but there are people who want to market hatred because they know I am in prison.  I personally lost a lot of friends and relatives.  It is a calamity for me.  

Right now I am feeling it deeply inside of myself.  You told me whether anything happened in Nkuli, we had Tutsi family friend, friends and they were friends to my father-in-law, that family was exterminated.  And when I reached there, even their houses were no longer standing.  There is only one survivor and it is a reverend sister.  But we -- she is also busy trying to contribute towards the war.  And there are people who come to give testimony here, this is contrary to what -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He answered the question.  The question is particularly about Mukingo and going back to Nkuli, can the question be answered in precise terms.  If there are follow-up questions, let your counsel raise them.  So, coming back to your question is it answered.  It was about visiting -- if he ever visited --
MR. HINDS:
He answered the question, Your Honour, but then went out.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Went on, yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I would like you to be shown Prosecutor's Exhibit 7, and in particular, photographs 51, 52 and 53. 
MR. HINDS:
Could the registry assist in that regard, or does he have it there?  Okay.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, do you have photograph 51 in front of you?
A.	I can see it.
Q.	And what does photograph 51 depict?
A.	This photo is showing the church of Busogo parish.
Q.	And is that the church that you testified about most recently?
A.	And that is the church that I talked about even a few minutes ago where we held prayer for victims of the tragedies that took place.
Q.	Now, I would like you to look at photograph 52.  Do you know that particular building?
A.	That is the convent you were talking about, the convent for the nuns.
Q.	And is that the building that you just testified about that you were shown by the priest when you attended church?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did the building look as it looks now when you saw it in Rwanda, when you visited it?
A.	Those windows had been broken, I believe that it has been repaired, but at that time all windows had been broken.
Q.	Is there anything else that you noted that was different when you saw the structure from what is depicted now in the photograph?
A.	Another difference is that there was a tree fence.  You could not have access, you had to go through a gate to go to that building.
Q.	And where was the fence located, as you recall?
A.	You see that big tree, there was a fence that stopped people from approaching the windows.  Another thing, if you may allow me, it was very clean and now there is no maintenance.  When the photos were taken they were just beginning, they were, you know, it was a new situation.  But prior to that, it had been a very nice place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which building, Counsel, that positions the gate, which -- he is addressing photograph No. 52 on --
MR. HINDS:
Well, let me find out which photograph he is looking at.  Let me find out which photograph he is looking at.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have been dealing with photograph No. 15 of Exhibit 57. 
MR. HINDS:
I've asked him about 52, but I don't know what he is looking at, so let me just get it clear in the record.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you've just testified concerning a big tree, which photograph are you referring to?
A.	I'm looking at photo No. 52.  I'm saying that there used to be a tree fence that was close to the big tree there, and it would stop people from having access to their windows.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.  Could we display photograph 52 on the overhead projector.

THE ACCUSED KEJELIJELI:
There is here a fence, a fence coming from this brick wall, it would continue and a gate to the corner there.  There was another fence that went to the angle of the house.  There was a road that passed here that used to go to the Saint Joseph's Institute, to avoid the noise from students and passers by, there was a small fence, but this stopped people from having access to where the people are standing.  And nobody could go and knock at that door at any time because there was a fence to restrict entrance.  

What is new here is that there is no more fence.  The gate that was between the two walls is no longer there.  Another thing is that all of these windows had been broken.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, when you say there was a fence, what material was that fence made of?
A.	It was built of trees, simple trees.
Q.	I see.  And what was the height of that fence?
A.	It was about one and a half meters high, about two meters high.  When you were outside, it wasn't easy to see what was in the compound.  You couldn't see -- the people in front of the house nor could you have access to the house.
Q.	The people who are now standing in front of the building as shown in photograph No. 52, could they be seen if when the fence was in place.  The fence that you say was made out of trees?
A.	Nobody could stand there, what I know is I told you that I worked at this parish before, I don't know what was being done there, I think there was a shop and nothing else could be done there.  The rest was rooms.  I cannot describe what was happening inside, but I remember there was a shop here and there was a laundry room, something like that.  And there were some shower rooms as well, but people were not standing there because there was nothing for receiving -- there was no reason for receiving the people around.
Q.	Now you mentioned that there was a gate of some sort in the fence.  Where was that located?
A.	Between the two walls there is a big wall here.  Okay, it is more clear, it is clearer on another photo.
MR. HINDS:
Okay, can we show the Witness the other photo that he is perhaps referring to.
THE ACCUSED KEJELIJELI:
This is helping me more because now I can see signs of where the fence was, you can see on the left, there is a corner metal.  There were some wares that -- this was the entrance to the convent.  There were other wires, it was -- there was a small road, as well, to Saint Joseph.  And there was an attempt to stop the children from looking into the convent.  This sign here, it has got this -- these were parts of the fence and they went up to these brick, brick structures.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you see that there are two structures which appear to be brick structures in front of the building.  Are those -- were they there in 1994?
A.	I used to see that.  I used to see that because the fence, the metal structure was there long ago.  It is of no use any more, but formally it is used to connect with -- there were some trees that were between the brick structure and the metal with these pillars, brick pillars and there was a fence that went up to there.  That is what I remember, although it has been some years now.  I remember that you could not have access to where those people are standing.  That is what I know.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, just to clarify one point; what was in-between the two brick pillars that are there?  Was there anything between the two brick pillars that are showing now in photograph 53?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Right there?
A.	There was a gate between the two pillars.  You could not have access to that red door without passing through the two pillars.
Q.	And what materials was the gate made of?  What material was the gate constructed of?
A.	It was made of wood, separate pieces of wood.  They were joined, not quite well joined.  You could, when you opened, you could see, to see who is -- they could see the person knocking at the outer gate when they were inside.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, let me take a stab of trying to describe what this fence and gate look like on the photograph unless it is clear for the record.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it is clear for the record.
MR. HINDS:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Kajelijeli, you can take your seat.  Mr. Kajelijeli, during the time that you were bourgmestre between 1988 and 1993, were there any government policies of how to deal with land that was abandoned, any abandoned property?  That is, if owners of property left the country and property was just not being cultivated and abandoned, was there a policy or a process for dealing with that property from the government's perspective?
A.	Can you repeat your question, please?
Q.	During the period that you were bourgmestre from 1988 to 1993, was there any government policy in existence for handling property, any property that was abandoned; the owners left and the property was not cultivated and just abandoned?  Was there a government policy for handling that property?  Do you understand the question?
A.	Yes.  There was such a policy in what is the law governing communal property, assets.  It is explained how the commune gets its property and how it gets its resources.  It can receive gifts or grants.  It can be given -- it can be obtained from abandoned property.  

	When I was still the bourgmestre, on this question of abandoned property, there was nobody who left the country and abandoned their property, but there was such a law that said that once such a case arises the commune takes over the property and the commune manages such a property until the person, until the former owner comes back.  In the meantime, the commune can also hire out, give out such a property on rental terms.  And in the budget, in the budget under our examiner budget, non recurrent budget, there is what is called extraordinary items, and this includes property that the commune can manage temporarily, can rent out to people, and the money, the profits of such a rent would assist in the development of the commune, but it is forbidden to sell such property.  I don't know if I have explained well.

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	You have explained sufficiently, Mr. Kajelijeli.  With respect to the events between April 6th and June 17th of 1994, were you aware whether or not that policy was being adhered to by government officials, with respect to Tutsi land? 
A.	When I got to the commune between 17th and 18th of June, when I was taking over as a new -- in my new post in the commune, I did not have time to inspect this, but before that, I knew that the commune had taken land property from some Tutsis and the commune had confiscated these lands.  The commune had rented out these lands.  It was actually renting out -- letting out this, but it was not sold; there was no selling.  There was rental and the proceeds from the rent might have been misused, but normally such proceeds cannot be used to pay salaries, but rather, should be used for development projects that are visible.  I think we are talking here of Tutsi land property that was rented out to the people.  The commune did not want these people to fight over that land.  The beneficiaries cultivated this land, but they were not lucky, and they had to run away when the Hutus lost the war.  When they fled the country, the same Tutsis who had fled away came back and recuperated their land, and they harvested the crops that had been cultivated by the Hutu.  

I think the commune took a decision that was contrary to the law.  Normally, the commune could have rented out the land, and there would have been a kind of receipt or a kind of acknowledgement deed with commune stamp.  I believe this was done, and I believe there are records of this, but due to some problems in the country, there have been some kind of wrangling of this information on the land and saying that it was Interahamwe who had confiscated the land; but the records are there; the commune knows how the lands were rented out.  I know very well that there are some receipts issued.  It is actually a kind of title deed.  There should be a stamp and a signature and you can use that act to -- you can check it in the records, and here you can see who sold out the property.  There would be also proof of where the money was deposited, unless -- except for people who come here to tell lies to this Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you please do two things, one, because we want to get the translation done smoothly.  And two, answer the questions briefly and precisely, not to argue.  There is a difference between answering a question and making an argument.  Could you please answer the question as being asked by counsel in precise terms.  

If the argument -- that would be done elsewhere, maybe by somebody else. 
MR. HINDS:
Thank you, Your Honour. 

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I would like to move to another area.  During the period that you were bourgmestre, were you authorised to carry weapons between 1988 and February of 1993? 
A.	Yes, I had such authorisation, but it is not from 1988, as you stated. 
Q.	When was the authorisation that you received to carry weapons? 
A.	If I recall well, this was in 1992. 
Q.	And from whom did you obtain authorisation? 
A.	I got the authorisation of carrying firearms.  It was given to me by the Ministry of Defence. 
Q.	What type of firearm or firearms were you authorised to carry? 
A.	It was authorisation for carrying a pistol.
Q.	Were you authorised to carry any other weapons other than a pistol? 
A.	If you are asking me as former bourgmestre, yes, there were other weapons, other firearms, but they were carried by the communal police, and they were under the supervision of the bourgmestre.
Q.	I am asking you about yourself personally as the bourgmestre, what personal authorisation did you have other than for you personally to carry a pistol?  Were you authorised, you personally to carry any other weapons? 
A.	I did not carry any other firearms at all, apart from the pistol that I have talked about. 
Q.	Now, was that pistol your personal property or communal property? 
A.	I was carrying it as bourgmestre, but after dismissal, I had to return it to the commune, and I returned it actually to the gendarme. 
Q.	Now, did you obtain any authorisation to carry that pistol after you left office in February of 1993 and before you re-assumed office on June 17th or June 22nd, rather, of 1994? 
A.	Please repeat the question. 
Q.	Did you, after you left office as bourgmestre in February of 1993, obtain authorisation to carry that pistol up until you re-assumed office of bourgmestre in June of 1994?  During that time period, did you have authorisation to carry a pistol? 
A.	No, I returned it to the gendarme immediately when I left the post of bourgmestre in February 1993, and towards the end of February -- I left office on the 22nd of February; so it was towards the end of the month.  It was not possible to get such authorisation.  Anyway, I did not need that pistol, I had been given that to ensure that I carry out my duties to go in different areas, some areas where there was insecurity.  It was for self-protection, but after leaving my post as bourgmestre, I did not have the authorisation.  I did not carry the firearm, and even when I resumed as bourgmestre in June 1994, I could not even get back such an authorisation.  The government had left its city in Kigali, and I had no one to contact to go through the procedures that were carried in order to have authorisation to carry firearms. 
Q.	Did you carry any firearms between that time period? 
A.	I don't know -- in what capacity?
Q.	You just testified you did not have authorisation to carry firearms.  I am now asking you another question.  You can answer either yes or no?  Did you carry any firearms during that period? 
A.	None at all. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, I'll ask you a series of questions.  I would like you to answer whether or not you knew the individuals I am going to ask you about, and if you answer yes, then I will ask you the circumstances under which you know these people and some other questions.  If you answer no, we move onto the others.  Okay, we would like to move quickly through this, do you understand? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	Do you know someone who has testified before this Tribunal with the pseudonym GBV?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The interpreter did not get the number of the witness.
MR. HINDS:
G as good, B as in boy, and V as in victory. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Yes, I know him. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Under what circumstances did you know this person? 
A.	That witness was known to me when he was young, when I was working at the parish.  I came to learn -- I learnt about him in the testimonies that have been given here.  I have known him in his activities in Rwanda.  I have known him in three different ways. 
Q.	What are the three ways that you have known him?
A.	When he was a young boy working ******************************** then I came to know the witness when he was giving evidence here.  The third time, I came to learn that -- I saw this in the Prosecutor's file, but the information you have now is that this person was responsible for the death of 120 people, including one agricultural officer called Kagano, and there is a former major.  This witness, GVB, is one of the people who committed atrocities and who was active in making -- he had a role in the killing of Hutus who returned from exile.  He even took the decision to come and testify here.  He started giving evidence against me, because he knew me before, the file is there.  There is a number -- the human rights organisations had asked that investigations be carried out.  Anyway --
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, do you know someone by the pseudonym of GBE? 
A.	I know the person.
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal under what circumstances you know that individual? 
A.	I know this person in Mukingo commune, at the commercial centre where -- what is known as Byangabo market.  He was one of the people that were wanted for hiding stolen property.  He had a **************************************************************.  He was arrested many times and when people returned from exile, he was arrested and detained at Nakinama along with another called GAO, who came here to give evidence.  The two of them had been arrested.  Because they were Moslems, one Moslem from Ruhengeri went and begged the bourgmestre for their release.  The bourgmestre was called Samvura, Epimac.  They signed a contract under which they had to be at the disposal of Ibuka association so that they can come and give false evidence here.  I know him as one former member of MDR party, and I know that he was a thief, and he even admitted it here.  Although he said it was not serious, but in the investigations carried out, even when I was an accountant as well as when I was a bourgmestre, he was one of the accomplices for bandits in Mukingo.  He was arrested many times, and I think the records are still there.  Therefore, for him to have come here to give evidence, I wasn't surprised because he was coming to revenge.
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, with respect to GBE, did you participate in his arrest when he was in Rwanda? 
A.	(No answer).
Q.	With respect to this Witness GBE, did you play any part in his arrest when he was in Rwanda, that is before 1994? 
A.	Many times I detained him.  I arrested him with stolen goods, with bandits; it wasn't once or twice, many people know about it.  He even had another nickname, which I cannot say here because he was a protected witness.  He had other names as a bandit. 
Q.	Let's move onto the next witness.  Do you know Witness GDF?  D as David, and F as in friendly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What witness, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
G as in good, D as in David and F as in friendly.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I swear even before this Court, I saw him the first time when he came here.  Even now, I cannot tell you how he looks like.  I would find problems telling you, especially because he comes from Kinigi, and the times he mentioned -- Kinigi was under RPF.  I know Kinigi before the war around 1999 (sic), I do not know him at all.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Now, I don't know whether it is a translation with pronouns, I've heard this over many times, sometimes "he" means "she" and "him" means "her" and so on.  Now, was this in terms of the sex of the individual GDF, is this a male or female? 
A.	It is a lady, I saw her as a lady.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Your Honour.  In Kinyarwanda he or she, when you talk like that does not exist.  So unless he mentions that that was a lady, I wouldn't know that it was a he or she.   Sorry for that, but that is the language.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is what he says.

MR. HINDS:
I am learning something about linguistics here.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, if the witness is male or female -- well, I will ask you the question.  Mr. Kajelijeli, did you know Witness GBH?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Could you repeat the initials, please? 
MR. HINDS:
G as in good, B as in boy, and H as in Hinds. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Yes, I know that witness.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Is the witness male or female? 
A.	GBH is male. 
Q.	How did you know this particular individual? 
A.	I got to know him when I was a child, and again, when I was acting as bourgmestre, as I told the Court, between 1975 and 1976, that is when I came to know him in his -- where he was working **** *************************************** (phonetic), these were the residential houses where subchiefs used to live, and when these subchiefs no longer existed in Rwanda, he wanted to destroy these houses, in order to use the material to construct his own house, as well as to take the plots of land, as you at one time asked me concerning abandoned properties.  This was one of the properties that I mentioned that there were laws governing them.  So when he took over this, the communal authorities that I represented refused him to take over this property up to -- this scene included even cyprus trees, and the agricultural officers found that he had cut down one of the cyprus trees, and we gave him a warning because I knew him.  He refused and he even started exploiting the land and so, the law governing communal properties -- there are punishments provided for to punish people who have overlooked warnings by the commune.  And so, we arrested him and took him to the commune, and finally he accepted that he would never step in this communal property.  This has never been his property, although he claimed that the commune had taken away this property from him, but the préfet requested us because the préfet also knew this person.  So the préfet requested us to give him a small plot free of charge, not as a compensation for the land he claimed to be his.  That is how I remember the situation because I stopped acting as bourgmestre in 1976.  So that is how I left the situation.  So the man went to his own plot of land and the communal authorities remained with the land he had taken over.  So the commune never requested for this land from him because it was orginally -- because it belonged to the commune.  

So the fact that there was this issue, litigating issue between us, because he is the father of the son who killed the person I told you about, who he found in his place where he used to sell beers and  -- among the people who gave evidence in this area, he is one of the people who told the officers who came to carry out investigations, especially because when they came, they came with the record books and recorded what you say, and they write down the statements.  

So this old man -- this issue that he wanted to take over this plot of land became an issue between us, because he wanted to take over this land, commune property.  So, I told you that the bourgmestre is a legal representative of the commune and had to take care of communal properties, and also this issue of his son's criminal acts.  So he is one of the people who was guided to me and given false evidence against me.  I know these people.  

Unfortunately, we also know -- we have records showing what they did.  So all these people, we have issues -- so even these people had a case against him, because he had beaten a Tutsi woman from Kibungo, whom he had beaten and she had lost her teeth.  The bourgmestre is a legal representative and I am the one who convicted him.  This person refused to pay the 20,000 francs fine that he was supposed to have been given, and he was arrested and detained in Gupoma (phonetic), and this case had been conducted by appeals court.  So it is these people who told him what he should say.  For me, I was being -- they didn't like me because I defended Tutsis and I had written even on newspapers saying that I was defending the Tutsis.  It is a long story, if necessary, we can call these Tutsi women to come and explain to the Court.  That is the issue between me and the old man.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would like to have precise answers.  Slumbering on, it doesn't help. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, we know you have a lot to say, but just say it in small bits, and if I need you to elaborate, you then elaborate.  I know there is a lot that you would like to say, but just say it in small portions, okay.  Then, if I need additional information, I will ask you about it.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you.  Your Honour, you will excuse me.  My heart is almost bursting because of what I know, and the accusations against me.  I have done a lot of good and now, I am being paid with bad -- you will excuse me.  Thank you
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would like to follow you.  

Go on, Counsel.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Your Honour. 

BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, did you play any role with respect to the son of this man, GBH? 
A.	Could you please repeat the question for me. 
Q.	You told us about the role you played with respect to arresting GBH.  Did you play any role with respect to his son that you testified about, and if so, could you briefly tell us what that role was? 
A.	After his son killed this person ************* who was self-employed, this was during the war.  So his son -- it was during the war, so his son was -- the investigations were done, but there was no case prepared against him.  So up to the time we fled, we did not know, nothing was done about his son.  He was a lieutenant and he had a group of people he was leading.
Q.	Now, I would like to go to the next witness.  Witness GBG, did you know that witness? 
A.	GBG, is that what you said?
Q.	Yes. 
A.	This person -- I do not know this person, and what I am saying -- it can be checked out.  You can verify this in the commune.  He might have been born -- he might be native to this commune, but the first time I saw him was here.  I do not know him anywhere else, but the information I have is that he was an RPF soldier. 
Q.	We proceed to the next witness.  Witness GDO, did you know that witness? 
A.	Did you say GAO?
Q.	D as in David and O as in only.
A.	Oh, yes, now I understand.  This witness --
Q.	The question I am asking, did you know that witness? 
A.	I also saw him the first time here, but then I came to know the names he mentioned, but the person -- I saw the person here the first time.  You cannot know the faces -- you cannot recognise the faces of 44,000 inhabitants.  I saw him here the first time. 
Q.	Was this a male or female, a man or a woman? 
A.	GDO is a female. 
Q.	Now, we will move to the next witness, Witness GAO, G, A as in apple and O as in only, GAO.
A.	GAO.
Q.	Did you know that witness? 
A.	I really knew this person because he was a thief, and he was a hooligan at Byangago, who was loading and offloading vehicles and in the evening, he would sleep anywhere and we would arrest them during the curfew, and we would sometimes find them and they wouldn't have anything to pay, and sometimes we would let him go, especially because he was under age.  That is what I know about that person being a thief and a hooligan.  So I know that he was imprisoned at Nakimana, among the ones that I mentioned and he was not released as they released GBE, because it was known that he was one of the people who took part in killing Tutsis, as he said himself.  So he also took up the contract to come and give evidence here, and I followed this closely, and I know how he signed his contract and the compensation he would get in return. 
Q.	Now, Witness GDD, did you know that witness? 
A.	I knew this witness. 
Q.	Is the witness male or female?
A.	Male. 
Q.	What do you know about this witness?
A.	The first thing I know about him, is that he was a teacher at one time, after completing his education.  I know that when I was an accountant in Nkuli commune, I controlled him and he had swindled school fees, students' school fees and he incurred a loss; and it was necessary for the schools inspectors to deduct this from his salary, and this was taken to the school accounts, and I was in charge of this, because I used to bring teachers' salaries.  So I requested that the money he lost, more than 250,000 be deducted from his salary, and this money was being deducted in instalments from his salary.  

And the worst thing I know about him is that, I know there is an agricultural officer who was managing a project called AIDR in Mukingo commune, and the project was operating in Mukingo and Nkuli.  So this agricultural officer came  from Nkuli commune, and at one time when he was taking a refreshment, drinking something, this GDD *************************************************************** this agricultural officer, and we were saddened by this.  We gave evidence ******************** agricultural officer.  ******** him because of his money.  GDD was imprisoned, and he was given life imprisonment from 1982.  And after getting life sentence, ******************************* and a man of law, he requested that they should negotiate with the family of the victim and pay compensation to the family **************************, so that his sentence would be reduced.  I believe he was imprisoned for seven years.  The file case is there and his father was paying compensation to the family of the agricultural officer *******************.  His father continued with negotiations up to when GDD was released.  

After his release, he could not go back to teaching because of his behaviour and conduct, especially because in prison, they get to learn bad habits.  So his father negotiated and he was given the position of being in charge of the youth, and even he failed in this new position and his services were terminated.  And reports about this in the ministry of youth -- according to the reports, it was found out that this person could not be employed in that position.  By the time that took place, he was no longer an employee of the commune; he could not get a salary anywhere.  What I am telling you is written on record and he even mentioned it in his own statement in Rwanda.  That is what I know about him, plus what I told you yesterday.  He conducted attacks killing youth and people, and later on pleaded guilty and asked for forgiveness.  If necessary, you will find this on the tape where he agreed, he pleaded guilty with his accomplices.  

And so, to your question, I know him and I will add that he also -- taking that I know that he came and gave false evidence here, but unfortunately this came out.  The people -- his lawyers gave us a tape of what he said and his accomplices.  He never mentioned Kajelijeli anywhere.  So  he was requested to give false evidence against me by the Prosecutor.  Thank you. 
Q.	Do you know if -- withdrawn.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it is about time.  I don't know.  How much time do you still need?  
MR. HINDS:
I have five witnesses.  These people -- on the average, I don't know whether he knows all of them, but it is taking about three minutes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
I hope the witness is not referring to the Office of the Prosecutor or lawyers in the Office of the Prosecutor -- 
MR. HINDS:
In terms of whom?
MS. OJEMENI:
-- or legal, or lawyers in the Office of the Prosecutor.
MR. HINDS:
Concerning what?
MS. OJEMENI:
What he's just said.
MR. PRESIDENT:
His last answer was that he was requested to come and give evidence, false evidence by the Prosecutor.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, this we -- the issue --
MR. PRESIDENT:
He is entitled to say whatever he wants to say.
MR. HINDS:
Not only that, this issue is clearly on the record of this case.  We have argued vociferously.  We have cross-examined -- I want to put it on record.  We have cross-examined witnesses concerning exactly what Mr. Kajelijeli is testifying about.  What he is saying is not spurious; what he is saying is not a collateral; it is direct with respect to his defence and he is fighting for his life.  These people came --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  Just a minute, we don't want to go into an argument.  I think what counsel wants to know is to which Prosecutor, if it is the Prosecutor.

MR. HINDS:
But I am saying this has been on the record.  There is one prosecutor whom there is a pending motion that the prosecutor be held in contempt.  There are witnesses who came here and testified about that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Professor Hinds, learned counsel, I think that is what counsel wants to know; we know that.  I think what clarification your colleague was seeking is, what Prosecutor?  They are entitled to know whether it is them or anybody else.  That is what she is asking.
MS. OJEMENI:
In any event, Your Honour, he made reference to two issues.  I am asking for clarification, lawyers and then who gave him the tape; and secondly, the Office of the Prosecutor.  It is really unsolicited evidence.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, again, there is a pending motion concerning a videotape, and that was a video tape that was obtained by the Defence in Europe, the Prosecutor knows that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you answer that aspect, if you know it.  We do not want to get involved.  Can  the witness clarify in whichever way; is it the Prosecutor, what Prosecutor he is addressing?  These other issues can be followed up. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Your Honour, if I have come to give testimony here, I am the accused.  I am very happy to be here in front of you, because you can restore my rights, help me and listen to my problems.  The issue that I raised concerns this Prosecutor and she has a tape, how she has been building the case, in collaboration with people in Ruhengeri, and what they are doing about the witnesses they are preparing to bring here.  I know all these machinations. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, that means we are the ones being addressed, is it?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
You are the one who headed the commission and even people in the region know. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
These issues will be dealt with in a normal way.  Go on counsel. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Witness, do you know GAP?  G as in good, A as in adorable, P as in Peter. 
A.	Thank you.  I know this witness. 
Q.	Can you tell the Tribunal who this witness is? 
A.	I will not mention the witness's name, but he is a protected witness.  But what I know about the witness, if you allow me, I will tell you. 
Q.	Before you --
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, this may be a problem.  As I don't know what he will say, but my sense is that, given the witness's position, which is an official position, and sometimes people listen and may be able to identify the witness, I am thinking.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you propose?
MR. HINDS:
I am proposing that we skip this witness and we go to -- so if we have to go into closed session, we just go into closed session with respect to that witness and do the rest at the end. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be all right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will come to Witness GAP later. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Do you know Witness GDQ?  GDQ as in quick? 
A.	Thank you.  I know this witness. 
Q.	Is the witness male or female?
A.	The witness is male.
Q.	What do you know about GDQ? 
A.	This witness who gave evidence here, the first time I knew him, **************** for an agricultural officer in Kinigi; his name was Michel.  The agricultural officer's name was Michel and he was pursued for having speared someone in Kinigi, in collaboration with the agricultural officer.  This case was conducted and concluded.  Later on, he was released, saying that it was his boss who had instructed him to do this.  So he lived in the commune and *************************, and he later on stole something and they chased him.  

While in the commune, he went and started to grow plants in the commune plant.  And then the conseiller from Busogo secteur stopped him and later on when we followed on the case, we found out that this plot of land belonged to the commune, not even to the secteur.  So his case was taken to the Court of First Instance, and I was on leave; so it was the conseiller who was representing the commune and this person was sentenced to six months imprisonment.  So he came into conflict with the commune like that because of trying to take over communal land, and so he never liked communal authorities.  

And then when he came to testify here, he was kind of revenging against the commune authorities before the war and even the préfecture authorities knew about this issue and their case file was opened.  So he came here just to take revenge because of this conflict between him and the communal authorities. 
Q.	Now, Witness -- Mr. Kajelijeli, do you know Witness GDT? 
A.	GDT, I do not know this witness.  The witness said that he or she thought I looked like someone she knew.  So he said that he was not in that area during the time period in question, especially because he said his family existed.  So that means that he was living somehow -- the first time that I saw that witness was here.  So I do not know this witness.  Up to now, I cannot even recall how he looks like. 
Q.	Is the witness male or female?
A.	The witness is a lady.  The witness is a female, except that I have been finding her name in other cases.  I think she is collaborating with Ibuka.  So I found her in other records, in other cases, in other reports that I am reading about now. 
Q.	Witness -- Mr. Kajelijeli, do you know Witness ACM?
A.	I know the witness.  The last time I saw her, she was a girl.  I do not know if she is now married.  I don't know if she got married between the peacetime -- the last time I saw her was during peacetime, and the last time I saw her here.  I don't know if she got married in between there.
Q.	What do you know, if anything, about ACM? 
A.	This is the last time.  I last saw her in 1993.  It was the time when RPF attacked Ruhengeri préfecture that I mentioned about earlier, in which many Hutus were killed in Ruhengeri.  And so, since I  feared the consequences, and indeed, it was clear, she is one of the people I saved in the war of 8th February 1993.  She is one of the people that I saved.  So whatever followed thereafter, I learnt it from here when she came to talk about me, the way she felt.  That is how I know her. 
Q.	Now, Witness, what do you know about GAS? G as in good A as in adorable and S as in sweet? 
A.	GAS, I know the witness.  She is a *********  First of all, I know her when she was a student in primary school. 
Q.	One point, Witness, do not give the profession of the witness which may reveal that witness's identity. 
A.	Excuse me, it was not my intention.  Thank you for reminding me of this.  I know her because she is -- I knew her as a student at the school where I attended, that is Busogo I Primary School.  It was not easy for her to continue.  So after completing my education, I worked at the Busogo parish.  She was *******, the priest who were collaborating, helped her join -- I am sorry.  I should have said to go and she devoted herself to religion and later on when she became ***** -- later on she became *********** in Kigali military camp.  The time I am talking about -- the period I am talking about, I was already bourgmestre, when she came to get identity papers whilst she was working in the Kigali military camp.  She was known to Nzirorera, because they came from the same region.  So he got her a place to **** in Kigali military.  From there she became ********** in Lurindo.  Every time, of course, she changed her career.  She had to come for her identity papers at the communal office.  So when the war started, she went to Nyundo where she was collaborating, working *****************.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I would like you to focus on what you knew about the witness in terms of whether or not she had a motive, if you know of one, to come here and testify.  That is what I want you to focus on. 
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	Please continue. 
A.	Thank you.  So I used to see her when she would come ************************ to ask for identity papers during the war period.  She also told me that she was going to take some of the people, including her sister in-law as well as her brother's children, to go to Nyundo, because they needed travel documents.  So I gave her the travel documents and some of the members of the family went with Bishop Kalibushi, and she thanked me for this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you understand?  If you have more details that you want to give about that particular witness, you could do it elsewhere.  But if you want to answer  counsel's question as put to you straight away, please do go ahead.  The background of the witness, we do have it.  If you have any particular element that you want to put across, then this being a protected witness, it must be done in a proper forum. 
BY MR. HINDS:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, please do not give us that amount of information concerning the background.  Do you understand when I say motive, what I what I mean? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	If you have any information about this witness, GAS, that you think the Court should know about, the reason why that person had a motive or a bias against you, share with the Tribunal.  If you don't know, tell us you don't know.  We will go into closed session with respect to the last remaining witness.  Do you understand?  Yes or no? 
A.	Yes, I understand.  I don't think it is necessary to go into closed session because what I am telling you is something that is verifiable; that is true.  During that time, to get witnesses to come and give evidence here, Ibuka, after seeing that they didn't have any evidence, any proof, they went and looked for her, to ask her if she knew anything about me.  And there are instructions that said that anyone who did not take part in the war, then everyone should now make a contribution.  So her 
role -- she had been given a role to come and give evidence against me.  So she was given words to come and say here, because she was also supposed to fight that war.  So that is true, even with the other witnesses who came to give testimony here, because it is Ibuka that tells them what to say.  So she was requested to give that contribution, to come and testify against me, and yet there was nothing, there was no conflict between me and her.  She only did this because she was requested to do so.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I would request that we go into closed session in order to deal with the last remaining witness, GAP, for the reasons that we set on the record before  concerning the protected nature of that witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will go into closed session at this stage to enable counsel to raise questions with the Accused person, who is testifying on his behalf, questions which could have a bearing on the identity of a protected witness.  So we regret members of the public, it is a necessary procedure to be adopted at this stage.
MR. HINDS:
I think Mr. Kajelijeli wants to say something.  I don't know what he wants to say.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Could you allow me three minutes because I took drugs and I took a lot of water.  So I would like to have five minutes, if you allow me.  I will come back immediately. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Security officer, can you arrange that he goes and we will wait here?  
	(Accused withdrew from Court)
(Accused re-entered the Courtroom) 
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 29 to 30] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 15 to 28 by Sithembiso Moyo)

















	1231H
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will go into open session now again.
MR. HINDS:
Maybe I can remind the Court that we did not take a break at twelve --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, yes, that is quite true.
MR. HINDS:
-- and I need one. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you need one.  All right.  Okay. 

Perhaps, we will have to adjourn to take the break.  If we adjourn for 15 minutes to enable counsel to take the break, we will come back when it is very close to one.  So we start cross-examination one, Counsel?  No, I beg your pardon at 2:30.
MS OJEMENI:
That would be fine, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The examination-in-chief has ended.  We will start the cross-examination of the Accused, who is testifying on his own behalf, at 2:30.  So until then, these proceedings stand adjourned.
(Court recessed at 1235H)
(Page 31 by Sithembiso Moyo)
















	1435H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Examination-in-chief had ended when we adjourned; so we start with the cross-examination of the Accused, who is testifying on his own behalf.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honours.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I am going to ask you questions, and please be brief and precise so that we can finish quickly.

How long was your secondary school education?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you get the question?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
	I did three years of secondary education.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What courses did you do that made you to specialise in economics as you have testified?
A.	Thank you.  My knowledge of economics was acquired through lack of -- management of commune -- commune resources in one year.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the answer?  Your repeat your answer, please.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, can you just repeat your answer, please.
A.	I did one-year course in management of communal resources in that area of knowledge.
Q.	You remember testifying yesterday that you specialised in economics after your secondary school in 19 -- in '72, do you recall that?
A.	I -- in 1969 -- in 1969 up to 1972, that's not what I studied.
Q.	Yesterday you were asked a question when you finished secondary school and you said you completed your secondary school in 1972; and you were asked if you had any specialisation, and you said it was in economics, so now I am asking you what course did you do that qualified you, or that made you to specialise in economics?
A.	I don't know what you wrote and I didn't know -- what I said was that during three years I had two years of vocation training and one year of management.  Those were -- it was -- the three-year period was not about management, it was different courses at different periods.
Q.	Witness, I now take it that you are changing your statement because you were clearly asked this question and you said you specialised in economics.  You did say that after your secondary you went for further studies and that was when you were managing the commune?
A.	It is not you who asked me these questions; it is the other Counsel who asked me.  I mentioned three years; and two courses in three years.  I have changed nothing.  I never mentioned a fourth year.  I mentioned three years in different areas.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Kajelijeli, can you speak slowly.  We would like the translation to come through easily, and that we are able to follow you slowly.  It may take slightly more time but it's important we hear what -- we hear and understand what is being said.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, yesterday I did not ask --
THE WITNESS:
	I thank you, Mr. President.  It will help me too.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Sir, I didn't ask you this question yesterday, it was your defence team that asked you the question when you completed secondary school, and you said it was in 1972.  Then a follow up question as to whether you had any specialisation after the completion of your secondary school and you said; "Yes, in economics".  So I am now asking you how did you acquire this specialisation in a secondary school?
A.	I would like -- I would like you to know that I am not a specialist in economics.  I did my course and succeeded in my exams but I didn't say I was a specialist in economics. 
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
I think that if the Prosecutor is trying to elicit a prior inconsistent statement, what she is doing is improper.  I have a copy of the draft transcript before me.  If she wants to elicit a prior inconsistent statement that is not the way to do it.  I am objecting as to form.  She could ask the witness, and it's right here.  She can ask the question that I put to him and the answer that he gave.  The answer he gave was; "I took a course in economics". 
MS. OJEMENI:
	Excuse me, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
	He never said that he was a specialist, and so I am objecting as to form.  If she is trying to elicit a prior inconsistent statement.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think that is -- that is -- as we understand Counsel's question is to get the sequence among other things of --
MR. HINDS:
No, she accused him of changing his testimony.  She is attempting to impeach the Witness and she cannot do it that way.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I want to put it on record that I allowed my learned friend.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
	I did not in any way try to disturb his trend of thought, and I do not expect a colleague, an officer of the court to be acting the way he is acting.  

Now, I will move on.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  I have a right.  I have a right under the rules of this court to object to improper questions that are being put.  And I am stating on the record the basis of my objection.  And I have said that what she is attempting to do -- because that is what she said, she said that; "Are you changing your testimony"?  And here we have a draft of the transcript, and she should use that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let us follow up this evidence.  It is important that the sequence is known and we have a clear understanding of the evidence and a follow up of the evidence, which is the most important thing.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the records are very clear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
	I can read, I have the draft as well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
	If you want me to read the questions I will read the questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
	Question-.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Not that you have to read all the time, just for this particular aspect.
MS. OJEMENI:
For this aspect only.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
"Q.  And do you recall when you finished secondary school, what year?  A. I completed this secondary school in 1972.  Q.   And did you have any specialisation at the time that you finished secondary school?  A. Yes I did.  Q. And what was your secondary school?  A. (No translation, of course), the next, question -- Witness:  I took a course in economics. Q. Did you say that your specialisation was economics?  A.  Yes that is what I said".
	I haven't changed anything.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Go on Counsel.  Listen to Counsel's question and you will be able to respond.  We have to move forward.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, your first working experience was as a carpenter for the Busogo parish, isn't it?
A.	Yes, I said it and it is correct.
Q.	In which cellule, secteur and commune is Busogo parish?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No translation.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, can you repeat the question, can you repeat the question, please. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
One part is in Busogo secteur where there's a nuns convent.  The gate I showed you is towards Busogo secteur. 
Q.	And Witness do you know any other person who qualified as an economist in secondary during as a carpenter?
A.	You are making me go back.  You asked me what I studied, I said two years in carpentry and one year in management.  I said I had two vocational training courses, which are not in the same area.
Q.	When did you have these vocational courses?  Was it in secondary school, was it after secondary school, when?
A.	I don't know what answer I can give you because what you are asking me is about carpentry.  You are asking me about economics.  Which came first?  Is that what -- is your question about which came first or what?
Q.	Witness, you are understanding me correctly, and my question is when did you have the vocational course that you have just told the Court?
A.	I did vocational training from 1969 to 1972.
Q.	So in actual fact you didn't go to secondary school either.  Am I correct?
A.	I don't know.  Maybe secondary education, maybe it's a matter of difficult with my French but what I studied was not primary education.  I spoke about primary education which was before but this was post primary education.
Q.	So Witness, you went to primary school and after primary school you then went for this vocational training.  Is that correct?
A.	This is what I -- this was my initial answer.  I gave an answer to that.
Q.	And what is your answer?
A.	I said; "Yes".  You asked me if it is correct and I said it is correct.
Q.	So in fact you didn't go to secondary school; am I correct?
A.	Those -- there was in Rwanda, we say this is part of secondary education.  This is what is written on my certificate, and I don't know why you are finding it difficult.  You have been in Rwanda, you could even get my file from the ministry of civil service and labour and even go to places where I have undergone courses.  There are records on this.  There's no need for polemics, for polemics.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Answer the question of the Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honours.  The witness has answered the question.  He said he had secondary education and the Counsel is continuing to ask the same question over again.
MS. OJEMEN:
	Mr. Hinds, don't testify.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think Counsel is entitled to ask, to verify whether it is post-secondary, secondary school.  I think she is entitled.
MR. HINDS:
But then  -- but then admonishing the witness for answering the question.  That is what I am objecting to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please sit down, Counsel.  Let your colleague deal with the case.  If there are issues that are --
MR. HINDS:
I can object.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can object, certainly.
MR. HINDS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, go on, go on.  Be very brief. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	My question is, did you in fact attend secondary school?
MR. HINDS:
Asked and answered.
MS. OJEMENI:
No.
THE WITNESS:
	My difficult is that there's deformation, distortion of my statement.  I am saying I finished and I have my certificate.  I am sorry that I cannot accept the way you are putting things.  That's not the accusation -- the indictment I am facing here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think Counsel, as far as this is concerned, according to him in Rwanda, if that is part and parcel of secondary school there maybe different systems.  So we shouldn't dwell on this matter unless there's some specific aspects you want to raise.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, may crave your indulgence to ask for a few minutes without the witness because there's need for this.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I don't know what application Prosecutor is making but Mr. Kajelijeli cannot be denied the right to participate in every phase of the trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Unfortunately, yes.
MR. HINDS:
And so we can't have him excluded from the proceeding, and he is here facing the most serious charges.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Unfortunately not.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, my application is on Counsel.  As an officer of the court I need to discuss certain issues that concern the Defence and I wouldn't want to do that when the accused is present because I want us to discuss as officers of this Court.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	With regard to what issue?  It doesn't concern the accused?
MS. OJEMENI:
It doesn't concern the accused.  The conduct of the Defence, that's what I want to discuss.
MR. HINDS:
	That affects the accused, he is now a defendant.  If there are any issues on any phase of these proceedings, all of it he must be present.  He cannot be absent from any -- even if there are motions, he must be there.  How could we -- how could we have a process where he is done ex-parte.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am referring to my colleague, in particular.  I am not referring to the Accused.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think we need to get on with cross-examination and we will deal with these other issues maybe later at an appropriate time.  If you have a formal matter to raise with your colleague about the conduct of your colleague.  Let's deal with the cross-examination and the case.  We will be taking note also.  We are -- as a Trial Chamber, follow the events and follow, you know, whatever is happening before it.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, did you complete secondary school?
A.	No.
Q.	You were a carpenter for the Busogo parish from 1972 to 1973, isn't it?
A.	It is correct.
Q.	And you testified that you were a carpenter for the Busogo parish, isn't it?
A.	It is correct.  I repeat, it is correct.
Q.	Why did you then qualify yourself yesterday in your testimony as the head of the workshop for the carpentry team, of the -- the head of workshop for the carpentry team for the Busogo parish?
A.	Thank you, Madam the Prosecutor, I did my in-service training there, and the priest for whom I worked accepted to have a work -- set up a workshop there.  New workers were employed and I was head of those workers.  I received the orders and I -- we made supplies to the people who had made orders and there -- I was actually organising and managing the carpentry in the sense of receiving orders and making deliveries.  I was a headman of the workers I was with. 
Q.	You did all that within one year 1972 to 1973 isn't it?
A.	Yes, it is correct.
Q.	You liked being in charge or in control of affairs, didn't you?
A.	When I can it is not a matter of liking it.  When I can then I can do it.
Q.	Then again you testified that you were head of Rwinzovu secteur, isn't it?
A.	It is correct.
Q.	When you were actually the conseiller of the secteur why couldn't you use the word conseiller?
A.	I don't know whether I didn't say it yesterday but I was elected for that Madam the Prosecutor.  There's nothing amazing about that, it is, there are records on that I was elected for it.
Q.	I am not disputing that you were the conseiller of Rwinzovu secteur at some point in your life but why use the word, "head", as head of Rwinzovu secteur when there's a name for it?
A.	I think it is the way it was interpreted.  In Kinyarwanda it is the same thing to manage or to head, I don't know, there are several meanings you can be -- you can lead, you can head.  I was leading Rwinzovu secteur.  It's not a bad thing to administrator or to lead.  It's not a bad thing.
Q.	You were a conseiller between -- from 1974 to 19 -- 1973 to 1974 conseiller of Rwinzovu secteur, isn't it?
A.	It is correct and it is on record.
Q.	And you became the interim bourgmestre for Mukingo commune shortly after, from 1974 to 1975, isn't it?
A.	It is correct.  It is also on the record Madam the Prosecutor.
Q.	And you did your vocational course in accounting and became the accountant of Nkuli commune, isn't it?
A.	It is correct.  There maybe a difference between economics and management but it could be -- I would rather call it management -- management or accounts but economics were part of the course.
Q.	How long was this course, the vocational course in accounts, how long was it?
A.	From 1976 to 1977, I underwent this course.
Q.	And right after that you became the accountant of Nkuli commune, isn't it?
A.	Yes, I became -- I made three months in-service training, receiving taxes for Mukingo commune, after the three months I was appointed in Nkuli commune in 1977 and 1978.
Q.	When did you undergo this training, the three months training?
A.	I did it in Mukingo commune at the office of Mukingo commune.
Q.	Sir, what was the procedure for appointing you to getting the job of an accountant of Nkuli commune? Did you apply, and you were short listed, interviewed, and appointed.  What was the Procedure?
A.	Thank you, Madam, the Prosecutor.  I did not apply.  When I finished my course I was given a certificate of -- in this management.  It was issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communal develop and Civil Service.  They are the ones -- it was this ministry that appointed people and it is that ministry that appointed me in Nkuli commune.  I did not apply for it.  It is the ministry, which appointed me.  There was even no interview or examination because I already had my certificate.
Q.	Were you a member of MRND then when you were in school, and when you finished you were a member of MRND, weren't you?
A.	I think this is new.  Yesterday that question wasn't asked and it is not correct, anyway.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Accused, Counsel has a right to ask any questions that are relevant.  She doesn't have to base her questions on what was asked yesterday.  So you listen very carefully and answer briefly as you understand the questions, and if you have a problem you can tell us, if you don't understand, and if you are precise we will be able to move forward easily and quickly.
THE WITNESS:
	Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Sir, at that -- in 1978 when you became the accountant of Nkuli commune all Rwandans were members of MRND.  Isn't that correct?
A.	It was correct -- it is correct but I personally, I didn't know how they got the membership.  I can say that I could -- I can say that I wasn't a member because I had no business being a member.
Q.	You agree with me that people who were members of MRND benefited a lot from the then government, in terms of positions, employments, business?
A.	I cannot testify to that.  I don't even know.  What I know, if you allow me, before that party was founded there were workers, the civil servants.  I think people could be members of the party and be employees of the civil service, but no one -- when I got employed there was no mention of my being a member of the party.  I cannot testify to that but I know I have heard the same story and I can agree that it is true.
Q.	How many of you were trained in this accounting during that period, how many of you?
A.	We were 38 people if I am not mistaken.  You know, it's more than 30 years ago, I maybe mistaken but I remember we were about 38 people, but it remains to be checked, I can't be very sure.
Q.	And do you recall all of you getting such juicy jobs immediately after your training.  You recall everybody being appointed accountant of communes or similar positions or to similar positions?
A.	That is not correct, Madam the Prosecutor.
Q.	What was the correct position then?
A.	Some people failed, others had succeeded and I was among those who were successful.
Q.	Now, the ones that were successful all of them were they given such positions as you got?
A.	I can say that some went to parastatal departments; others got similar positions as mine.  It was -- there was a system to appoint people.  It was under the Ministry of civil service and it was also -- it was the same ministry with Internal Affairs and this was the ministry that made appointments in communes.  I believe a bigger -- the majority of us got jobs in communes whilst others went to parastatal departments.
Q.	So it was actually the ministry of Internal Affairs that appointed you and not the minister himself as you said yesterday?
A.	It is the ministry, which appointed me, although the ministry was under a minister, of course.
Q.	Now what was the place of birth of Alexis Kanyarengwe?
A.	Thank you, Madam the Prosecutor, Alexis Kanyarengwe, as far as, I know comes from the Gatonde commune in Ruhengeri province.  That's where he was born according to what I know.  Gatonde, Ruhengeri préfecture.  Kanyarengwe is spelt K-A-N-E -- I beg your pardon, K-A-N-Y-A-R-E-N-G-W-E.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
A.	Now Alexis Kanyarengwe --
MR. KIYEYEU:
	I am sorry, I am sorry, My Lord, there was also Gatonde, maybe if they can.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
	Sure.  Gatonde; G-A-T-O-N-D-E, Gatonde.
MS. OJEMENI:
Alexis Kanyarengwe was he also a schoolmate of yours?
A.	Your question is very difficult Madam the Prosecutor.  We never went to school together because he was the Minister of Internal Affairs and Civil Service.  I was a young man, I was much younger.  He had also been a Colonel in the national Army and those people who went to the military school had gone -- had been there in the early '60s and me I was still a child.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe just a minute.  Just a point for clarification perhaps if you may.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs, I mean going by the answer the Witness has just given, was it also part and parcel of the Ministry of public service?  Do I understand that?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
	It is correct.  It was the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Civil Service.  It was one ministry with two departments.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Civil Service?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
	Correct.  It is sometimes used as Civil Service, sometimes as Public Service.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Public Service or Civil Service.  All right.  Go on Counsel, this is what I wanted to know.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	So the job you got was a Civil Service job isn't it?  As an accountant of the commune you were a civil servant weren't you?
A.	In that ministry there's what was known as department of communal services or directorate of communes, you know there are many departments in any ministry and there was that directorate in charge of communes in the same ministry.
Q.	My question is when you were the accountant of Nkuli commune you were a civil servant?
A.	At that time as any, I was being paid by the commune but I had been appointed by the government.  The commune could not refuse you, it could not reject you saying that you were not born here or you were not appointed by the commune.  The commune could do nothing about that.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, do you know the meaning of civil servant?
A.	No.
Q.	But you had some civil servants under you when you were bourgmestre, didn't you?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a moment I think there's some translation problem.  I am told the question was not translated, Judge Ramaroson, in French. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could the question be repeated, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, can you please assist us by having these translations done in a timely manner so that we are able to move expeditiously to the end of this testimony.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Your Honour, I am not facing the interprets stall, that's the problem.  I mean, would not know when they have a problem?
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is not a problem, it's a question of translation.
MS. OJEMENI:
Oh, translation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If there are any problems then they can let us know.  Can you put back your question?
MS. OJEMENI:
Oh okay.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness I asked if you knew the meaning of civil servant?
MR. PRESIDENT:
He said, no, and then he said -- there was a subsequent question when you said that --
MS. OJEMENI:
I said when you were a bourgmestre.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	When you were a bourgmestre you had civil servants under you, isn't that correct?
A.	That must be a second question because the first one you asked me if I knew names of civil servants and I said, "No".  So if you have abandoned this question then could you please repeat the second question.
Q.	Witness, can you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
She didn't ask for names of public servants, she asked you whether you knew the meaning of public service is that not correct?
MS. OJEMEN:
Civil Service.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Civil Service yes, and you said; "No".  Would you like to -- the question put back to you?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
She asked if I knew names of civil servants that's why I said, "No".
MR. PRESIDENT:
It didn't come out correctly perhaps.  We don't know.  We don't speak Kinyarwanda but the question was, do you know the meaning of civil service or something?
MS. OJEMENI:
Civil Servant.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That is what I heard, thank you very much, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then you start your two questions in succession and see whether the witness understands.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, do I take it that you understand the meaning of civil servant?
A.	Yes, I understand what it means.
Q.	So when you were the accountant of Nkuli commune you were indeed a civil servant, weren't you?
A.	Yes, that's correct but I was getting my salary from the commune, the commune was paying my salary.
Q.	The Minister of Internal Affairs and Civil Service was an MRND member, wasn't he?
A.	What you have said is correct, Counsel.  At the time there was a single party.
Q.	And all the civil servants under him were MRND members, weren't they?
A.	That maybe possible -- that maybe -- or not possible because there were even some white men who were under him.  And I am not sure if these white people were members of MRD.
Q.	Thank you for that information.  Now the Rwandans who were civil servants under this minister were MRND members, weren't they?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	When you were then an MRND -- you were also MRND member, weren't you?
A.	At that time -- the time I was appointed I was not told that I was immediately a member of MRND that is the answer.
Q.	How did one become MRND member during that period?  Was it the ministry that gives you a card or you, the individual, get a card from MRND secretariat?
A.	I don't know if I should say what I heard about how the structures, the organs of MRND were.  But I heard there was the Central Committee, the MRND Central Committee and it had members of the Central Committee.  The Minister Kanyaregwe Alexis that I mentioned he was a member of the Central Committee of the MRND.  So whatever concerned the MRND party was discussed within this Central Committee but as far as other civil service issues were discussed in a different arena.  So these two did not interfere unless it was necessary to discuss party politics, but he never distributed membership cards and I never saw this anywhere.
Q.	So who distributed cards to MRND members?
A.	At that time Counsel there was a single party.  No cards were being distributed because whoever wished -- felt that he was a member of MRND, but you didn't even have to mention it because no one would ask you about it or question you about it.  So no cards were distributed according to what I know.  Maybe some people know better than I, but according to what I know I never saw any card being distributed.
Q.	So how do you then know that you are an MRND member if you don't carry a card?  How do you know that even if there's no card how does one know that one is a member of MRND?
A.	Counsel there was a single party that was ruling.  So the fact that this was a single party that was ruling no cards were being distributed and you can verify, you can check in Rwanda what I am telling you.  If records have not been burned you can see traces, there were no cards at that time.
Q.	And you were attending MRND meetings, were you not?  I am talking -- we are talking about 1978?
A.	During that period at our level we were -- I would say, we were technicians we did not attend the meetings, but actually later on we may come to a period where we attended meetings.  You shouldn't really dwell so much on this and I attended such meeting and I will tell you about it but at the time I was an accountant I did not attend any party meetings.
Q.	Sir, don't tell me what to ask and what not to ask just answer the question and we can move on?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	In 1978 Joseph Nzirorera was a member of the Central Committee, wasn't he, of the MRND, wasn't he?
A.	That is not true.
Q.	When did Joseph Nzirorera become -- take leadership role in MRND party?
A.	I believe that he became a member of the MRND Central Committee in 1981.  I don't know if I could say this was a leadership position because your question is a bit difficult for me.  I don't know if I could call that a leadership position.
Q.	Actually that's a leadership position.  When did he become the Secretary?
MS. OJEMENI:
Sorry, Your Honour, I am being warned that I am too fast I should give time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I don't know how you are going to do that.

BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	When did Joseph Nzirorera become the secretary-general of MRND?
A.	I do not recall exactly but I believe this was in 1983, but I have to check on this because I don't remember well.  I talked of 1993.  Correction, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
1993.
THE WITNESS:
1993.  That's what I remember but it doesn't mean you should not verify because I did not -- I have no precision on this.  It can be checked, it is written, it is on records but 1993, possibly.
Q.	In 1978 Joseph Nzirorera was a minister, wasn't he?
A.	That is not correct according to what I know.
Q.	When did he become a minister?
A.	I think it was 1981.
Q.	Now, Witness, when did Alexis Kanyarengwe become the chairman of RPF?
A.	In 1991 but this should be checked, but it was around that time.
Q.	In 1991 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Nineteen ninety --
THE WITNESS:
Nineteen-ninety-one but even this should be checked -- checked out.  I know he became chairman of RPF after he succeeded on this position to Rwigema.  I spell Rwigema, I spell Rwigema:
R-W-I-G-E-M-A, Rwigema.
(Pages 32 to 45 by Judith Kapatamoyo)















	1530H
Q.	Alexis Kanyarengwe fell out with the then government and went on exile in 1980; isn't that so?
A.	What you've said is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Nineteen.
MS. OJEMENI:
Nineteen-eighty.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is correct, 1980.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, you became the bourgmestre of -- the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1988; isn't it?
A.	What you have said is correct, Counsel.
Q.	Can you then tell the Court what you did between 1980 and 1988, what work you did?
A.	Could you repeat the question, please?
Q.	You've testified that in 1980 you became the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.  And my question now is:  Could you tell this Court what you did -- the work you did between 1980 and 1988?
A.	Between 19 -- between 19 -- I have not really -- could you repeat the question?  I haven't really understood it properly.
Q.	I am asking, you ceased to be interim bourgmestre in 1980, the interim bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1980; am I correct?
A.	What you've said is not correct, Counsel.
Q.	I will withdraw that statement.  I made a mistake; I'm sorry.  You ceased to be the accountant of Mukingo commune in 1980; am I correct?
MR. HINDS:
That is an incorrect statement.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That is not correct, either. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	When did you cease to be the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which period?
MS. OJEMENI:
I'm asking him -- he was bourgmestre -- I mean, accountant of Nkuli commune and then became accountant of Mukingo commune, from his testimony yesterday.  So, I'm asking, when did he cease to be the accountant of Mukingo commune.
A.	I ceased being the accountant for commune Mukingo in 1988.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I have the draft here, and the draft says up to 1980 -- '88.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of course, the problems of those drafts, they are indeed drafts.  That's one of the biggest problem we have.  And we have always advised you to --
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, I'm --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But I think if we go into our own notes, 1988, we check on that one, he ceased to be an accountant.  My problem -- my question that I would like to know, did he cease to be -- the translation that came through in English was that he ceased to be accountant of Mukingo commune in 1998 (sic), is it Mukingo commune or --
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, let me take him to -- please, can you have your seat.  I will clarify.  I am conducting this --
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Sir, when did you cease to be the accountant --
MR. HINDS: 
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Wait a minute, Counsel.
MR. HINDS: 
The Court had asked the question, unless the Court does not need any clarification.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, the translation that came through.  We are only interested with the translation.
MR. HINDS: 
I was just pointing it out here.  I have the draft, what the question and answer was, if you don't --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I see; the previous question and answer?
MR. HINDS:
Yes.  What you had the question about.  I was about to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, my question arises from the very question that has been answered now by the witness.  It came through in the English translation that if I heard correctly was that, he ceased to be the accountant of Mukingo commune in 1988. 
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, I would take the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And my question, is it Mukingo commune?  That's just what I wanted to know.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you were the accountant of Nkuli commune from 1978 to when?
A.	I was -- I was accountant of Nkuli commune from 1978 up to 1980.
Q.	From 1980 to 1988, could you tell the Court what work you did?
A.	I said that I was the bourgmestre -- sorry, the accountant for Nkuli commune.
Q.	Sir, from 1980 when you ceased to be the accountant of Nkuli commune to 1988 when you became the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, can you tell the Court what work you did in between 1980 and 1988?
A.	I answered by saying that I was transferred to Mukingo commune in 1980.  I was accountant for that commune up to 1988.
Q.	Could you tell the Court what contribution you made to Mukingo commune that entitled you to be the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1988?
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I played an important role not only in Mukingo commune, because I was a member of many delegations who went to work in other communes, but as far as Mukingo commune is concerned, I was able to manage the commune resources, which has a lot of things, including its finances.  And I managed these finances well, because there was also some funds for projects and the projects were realised, were successful, and, therefore,I contributed a lot, and it's visible.  You have been to that commune, maybe you did not visit the villages.  Before the war, you could access every cell by car through roads.  So, this means that all this infracstructural development was achieve through good management of the funds.  

Other development aspects is that there are some projects that had been launched, but that were not brought to a fruitful conclusion, because all these required money, some funds, and then some projects were successfully completed.  In order to be bourgmestre, because some delegations that I was part of, there are some communes that had made losses, that had -- we had audited them and we corrected the communal finances programme.  And so these communes were able also to develop, were able to acquire fund management and also showed where these shortages -- these losses had originated.  So it is clear that the work was being done well.  And so the authorities that were following -- monitoring my -- what I was doing, realised that I was able to take over communal responsibilities and bring them to a good conclusion.  And apart from the problems of war, the war that we had, I do not know any other problems at the time I was a bourgmestre for Mukingo commune; as well as the time I was the accountant for the different communes -- rather, at the time I was the account of Mukingo commune, sorry.
Q.	Sir, in 1988, you were already -- correct me if I am wrong -- a leader, an MRND leader in Mukingo commune; weren't you?
A.	After becoming a bourgmestre then automatically I became an MRND leader at that time, because that was the situation. We had a single party that was ruling.  So the leader called the bourgmestre had to represent that party.
Q.	But prior to 1988, before you assumed office as bourgmestre, you were not a leader of MRND in Mukingo commune; is that correct?
A.	A leader, an MRND leader.  I was not a leader, an MRND leader, at that time I was not, but -- thank you.
Q.	But you were just an ordinary member of the MRND before 1988 when you assumed your position as bourgmestre?
A.	You could call it how you wish, but no one requested me to be a member and I never requested to be a member.  I mean that all Rwandans were members of MRND, but certifying that such-and-such a person was a member was not enough.  That's how they were called, because there was a one party ruling, a single party ruling, but I did not feel that way.
Q.	It is your evidence that you were appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune by the president of Rwanda on the recommendation of the minister of internal affairs and communal development; isn't it?
A.	What you have said is correct.
Q.	Is communal development the same as civil service?  Is this minister the same minister for the ministry of internal affairs and civil service?
A.	That is the case.
Q.	It is also your evidence that in recommending you to the president, the minister based the decision on the proposal by the préfet of Ruhengeri at the time, that isin 1988; is that correct?
A.	I do not know if you can allow me to explain this.
Q.	Is that correct or not?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	The préfet himself based his proposal on what your contribution to the development of Mukingo commune --
A.	That is correct.
Q.	I have not put the question.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There was a question which was not translated which was answered by the witness.  Could that be the -- about the minister?  Just before this other question.
MS. OJEMENI:
To allow the translators to -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you put the question to the witness again, please?

MR. HINDS: 
It is the same problem I was having, Your Honour.  It's a problem of that -- I think once you hear the English, unless you are able to have some signal worked out or some timing, it will - we're going to continually have that problem.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I don't know how, Learned Counsel, you can position yourself. 
MR. HINDS: 
She may have to count from one to ten or something. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is that possible to --
MS. OJEMENI:
I will try.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And be slow a bit to allow the translation, but that is the same Accused Kajelijeli, also, please, we ask you to be slow, slow down in your answer because of the translation problem.  Do you follow?  We would like to follow.  

No, no, this is not blame intended, but we are asking you to be slow, to go slowly and to be watching as well the other side so that we can follow the pace; do you understand?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  When she's -- the way she is looking at me, I sometimes I fear I might have taken too much time before answering, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just be slow in your answer to allow translation.  All right, can we go on now?  All right, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
I will ask the question again.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, it is your evidence that in recommending you to the president, for the position of bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, the minister based his decision on the proposal from the préfet?
A.	That's correct, Counsel.
Q.	The préfet based his proposal on what your contributions to the development of Mukingo commune was at the time; isn't it?
A.	Actually, it is my contribution from the time I worked.  I started working in Nkuli commune up to my service in Mukingo commune, all my contribution along this, my career from Nkuli up to Mukingo, because he had all the reports about my career.
Q.	You have now told -- you've now told the Court what the contributions were at the time, haven't you?
A.	Yes, that's correct, Counsel.
Q.	And from your own opinion, that those contributions qualified you to be the best candidate for the position of bourgmestre of Mukingo in 1998.  Am I correct?
A.	Being -- saying the best would be maybe too much.  Maybe I was working -- I was the most hard working.  That's what I did.  I was the most hard working, but being the best, maybe a little too much.
Q.	From the education -- educational qualification, you have just told the Court that you had in 1979 -- 1972, when you didn't finish secondary school and the additional vocational training you had, are you telling the Court that that was enough qualification to be the bourgmestre of a commune; is that what you are telling the Court?
A.	I think it would be very hard for you because checking, controlling -- if I was capable, I don't think these are part of the accusations against me, but as far as the work I had done and the way I performed, even the person I succeeded had attended a higher level of education, but I controlled him, and I did a better job.  So, having completed school education is not enough.  You may complete secondary education or other levels of education, but you may not be an honest person.  People may not have faith on you and if you look at my file you will find that I really qualified.  I did a good job, my performance was good.
Q.	So, you are, in fact, telling the Court that it was just based on your working experience and your honesty.
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And I am telling you that you became the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune based on your close ties with Joseph Nzirorera, who, at that time, was already a leader at the préfectural level and at federal level of MRND.  What do you say to that?
A.	That is your opinion or that's what you have been told, but it is not correct.
Q.	Now, Witness, we move on to your duties as a bourgmestre between 1988 to 1993.  As a bourgmestre you were under the authority of the préfet of Ruhengeri; isn't that correct?
A.	I have not understood the question properly.
Q.	I'm dealing with your position as a bourgmestre of Mukingo commune and your duties as a bourgmestre between 1988 to 1993, and I'm asking you, or I'm putting it to you during that period from 1988 and 1993, as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, you were under -- acting under the authority of the préfet of Ruhengeri; is that correct?
A.	I do not understand the question.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You said, can you repeat your question?  Maybe it's the translation.  This may be complicated.  Can you repeat your question, Counsel?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	My question is this that the préfet of Ruhengeri préfecture had authority over you as bourgmestre of a commune that is under his préfecture; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Who was the bourgmestre between 1988 -- who was the préfet of Ruhengeri between 1988 and 1993?
A.	I will give you a list of the préfet because it was not only one préfet during that period.
Q.	We'll start with the first one in 1988?
A.	The first was Zigiranyirazo, Protais.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
These names were spelt out but I think you can spell the name.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I will spell it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The names should be spelt out. Can you spell it out?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Your Honour.  Z-I-G-I-R-A-N-Y-I-R-A-Z-O, Zigiranyirazo.
THE WITNESS:
The next was Charles Nzabagerageza.  Nzabagerageza. I'll spell Nzabagerageza, 
N-Z-A-B-A-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-A, Charles Nzabagerageza.  The next was Baliyanga Silvestre.  I'll spell Baliyanga, B-A-L-I-Y-A-N-G-A, Baliyanga.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you give the periods that each one of them was the préfet?  Protais, when was he the préfet of Ruhengeri?
A.	It is up to 1989.
Q.	Charles, when was he the préfet of Ruhengeri?
A.	Up to 1992.
Q.	Silvestre, when was he the préfet of Ruhengeri?
A.	From 1992 up to when he was killed by RPF in 1994, up to the 8th of April 1994.
Q.	The three of them were Hutus; weren't they?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And they were all members of MRND; weren't they?
A.	To say that Baliyanga was a member of MDR, but what is known is that during the multiparty era -- you will excuse me, during the single party rule, they were members of the MRND, but during the multiparty era, they did not have any responsibilities in parties, according to ministrial instructions, orders that were enforced at the time.
Q.	But you were aware that Baliyanga was a member of the MDR; weren't you?
A.	I, rather, heard of MDR.  That's what I heard, but I have no proof about this.
Q.	It is also true that all the civil servants and all persons holding public office within Ruhengeri préfecture -- within Mukingo commune were under your authority?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mukingo?
MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Mukingo commune were under your authorities as the bourgmestre of that commune, am I correct?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	Can you tell us which one that is not correct?
A.	There are some government institutions that the bourgmestre could not control over.  I could tell you, for instance, the people -- the employees in the prosecutor's office, they were under the minister of justice, the judges, the court officials were independent.  The bourgmestre did not have any control over them but, rather, they would give instructions to the bourgmestre in relation to the executive powers.  And then there are other government institutions that the bourgmestre -- where the bourgmestre could not take decisions.  So saying that the bourgmestre had powers over all civil servants in the commune is not correct.  And I will add that once there was a military camp in a given commune, the bourgmestre did not have any control over the military camp.
Q.	Witness, you were the representative of the government of Rwanda at the level of commune, am I correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And every civil servant that were under your domain, under your commune, were subject to you, or to your authority; isn't that correct?
MR. HINDS: 
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
He has given you some institutions, he has named the judges, magistrates, military camps and what have you that could not fall directly under him, but rather under their respective ministries. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	But there were some civil servants that were being paid by the commune.  They were under your authority, weren't they?
A.	Could you repeat your question, Counsel?
Q.	Some civil servants, some government officials were attached to your commune and they were being paid by the commune, weren't they?
A.	That is possible.
Q.	When I ask tell me if it is wrong, if what I've said is wrong.   We are not working on a hypothetical case here.  I made a statement; is that correct or not?
A.	That is correct.  That is correct.
Q.	Witness, in discharging your duties as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, you may occasionally request for the assistance of gendarmeries; am I correct?
A.	No, no, I would seek that assistance from the préfet.  Between me and the gendarmerie is the préfet, but myself in my capacity, I could not address myself to the gendarmerie to do anything.  So that is not correct.
Q.	You can seek assistance from the préfet, but the fact remains that your request would be granted; isn't that correct?
A.	If he has the means, the capacity to do so, depending on what area is of concern.
Q.	Let's talk about when you were bourgmestre of Mukingo commune within that period 1988 to 1993.  Did there come a time when you needed assistance of gendarmeries to restore law and order?  Can you tell this Court?
A.	I needed assistance from the préfet in relation to security concerns in order to help me ensure security by sending gendarmes to bring -- to restore security for the population in Mukingo commune.
Q.	Was your request granted?
A.	Yes, the assistance -- the request was granted, Counsel.
Q.	And you directed them or controlled them while they were in your commune didn't you?
A.	No, no.
Q.	How did they know what they came to do?  How did they go about their job?
A.	At their level, they had leaders and were were talking to their leaders, but saying that I was giving them instructions or telling them what to do, for me, I will show them what the problem was, then their leader, the person in charge of them, will tell them how -- what to do, how to ensure security.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, looking at the time, I'm so sorry, I didn't realise it's already past four.  I could stop here.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we'll stop here and take a break for 15 minutes.  We'll resume at twenty past four; twenty past four.  

Until then these proceedings stand adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1605H to 1625H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the proceedings are resumed. 

Yes, Counsel, could you proceed?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Sir, your duties included ensuring peace and safety of people -- of the citizens and property in -- I mean, of Mukingo commune; am I correct?
A.	Yes, you are correct.
Q.	How did you then maintain the peace?  How did you maintain peace in the commune?
A.	Thank you very much.  There is what in French we call the decentralisation of powers, of the executive power.  The way we handled security matters, it means that in every secteur there was a conseiller and in the cellule there was a responsible of persons with members of the cellule who knew how the security situation was in the cellule and in the secteur.  And, in general, the security in the commune would be known how it is.  It is -- we also know the role of the police who could pass every secteur to know the security situation and, of course, the secteur conseiller when things were serious, he would tell the communal authorities so that they would send the police in the secteur and in the cellule.  I am talking in terms of the security.  And if there were matters beyond the bourgmestre's power, then the préfet would be notified and he would take a decision to send in the gendarmerie and the gendarmerie would pass through the commune, and the commune would tell them where the security situation was critical.  That is during the time of peace.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, you see me breaking from time to time.  I have to wait -- I was informed that I have to, to ensure the French translation would conclude.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Right.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You also had powers to arrest; didn't you?
A.	Yes, but the power was limited up to certain extent, and it depended on what those people would have done.
Q.	Do you have policemen attached to your commune; didn't you?
A.	Yes, that is true.
Q.	And from time to time, they assisted you in effecting arrests; isn't it?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sorry, Counsel, there is a problem of translation.  I know it is not easy.  So I don't know how far -- I think the last question we heard was that "Yes, I had police attached to the commune."  Maybe you can start from there.  The previous question was with regard to whether or not he had powers of arrest.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Sir, from time to time the police assisted you in executing your powers to arrest by effecting the arrest themselves; isn't it?
A.	No, that is not correct.
Q.	How do you then do the arrest, as a bourgmestre?  Were you effecting the arrest yourself?
A.	I don't know, I would ask the President of this Chamber because it needs -- it needs clarification and the question is a bit confused.  In Rwanda, there was -- there was the judicial power, there was also the legislative power and there was also the executive power.  We were within the executive power of government.  This type of power would ensure that the decisions that had been taken are executed.  What we are doing, the public prosecutor or the public prosecutor could arrest a person through an arrest warrant.  And the arrest warrant could be use by the policemen to arrest persons, but at the level of the commune, if there are bandits, if there are hooligans, and if there are people who would refuse to pay taxes, then the commune would handle such cases.  Thank you very much.

BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I explained that you have power to arrest and you have acknowledged that before, haven't you?
A.	That is what I have just explained, where the powers of the bourgmestre got limited.  This is the way you should take the matter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In fact, given the original answer was yes, I was given power of arrest, but limited.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	But when you were effecting this power, exercising this power, you used the police to exercise the power to arrest; isn't that correct?
A.	It passed through the channels I have just mentioned, Counsel.
Q.	When you were arresting somebody for non-payment of tax, or something, how did you do that?
A.	I have talked about decentralisation some time back.  That had to be -- at the secteur level there was the secteur conseiller, he would ask people to pay taxes and he would be helped by the policeman who would ensure his security.  He would take the taxes together with the communal tax collector and would bring the funds to the commune that hose who haven't paid taxes they would be given time, and if the time is not enough the person would be given more time, then the person would be arrested.  But this did not happen so frequently.
MS. OJEMENI:
Shown the exhibit handed yesterday by the Defence.  I am not sure of the number.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it 56?
MS. OJEMENI: 
 Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
I don't know what she is asking for.
MS. OJEMENI:
You tendered only one exhibit, so that is what I am asking for.  The one you tendered yesterday, that would be 56, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be 56.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  Can it be screened?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can it be screened?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, I want it to be screened.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be Exhibit D56.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
I think it's an exhibit?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
It is an exhibit which is presented by the Defence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is a Defence exhibit.  What is the problem?  Do you have any problem?
THE WITNESS:
The translation was just the opposite. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Defence Exhibit D56?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you go across now.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Yes, Witness, it is your own document, your personal document, Defence Exhibit 56.  Can you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can move to the screen.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you identify the office that was used by the communal police that were attached to your commune when you were the bourgmestre?
A.	You can see the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The screening is not available on the other screens.  Okay.

Mr. Koshopa, could you adjust it, please.  Is that put correctly?  No, the screen, I mean, the exhibit?  All right.  No, no, no, that is upside down.  Okay.  All right.  Here you are.  Go ahead, what is the question?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I asked a question.  Do you remember, oh should I ask again?
A.	Yes, I remember the question.
Q.	Can you identify the offices of the police?
A.	You asked me where the communal police used to work from.  I said it was office number ten.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you return to your seat now.

And, sir, these were policemen attached to the commune -- the police communal, aren't they?
A.	This was the office of the police officer in charge of the communal police.
Q.	We move on to the next question.  You were the law enforcement officer in Mukingo commune -- for Mukingo commune, weren't you, as the bourgmestre?
A.	That was, in fact, the first duty of a bourgmestre.
Q.	And all the crimes committed in the commune were reported to you if you did not witness the crime, isn't it, as the bourgmestre?
A.	I would be informed, because on this question I would like to give you some ample explanation.  We had the police officer who was representing the ministry of justice.  His area of jurisdiction was within commune Mukingo.  He would make the decisions for the country as whole, the head of the gendarmerie had the power all over the country -- that was competence, over the whole country.  He could take decisions to arrest people in commune Mukingo without passing through me, but he would inform me.  There was also the chief justice of the Republic.  He had his jurisdiction limited at préfectural level.  He could arrest somebody, even the bourgmestre.  He had that competence.  He could come and arrest persons in commune Mukingo independent of the bourgmestre.  Thank you very much.
Q.	Witness, I am not talking about arrest here.  What I am talking about is the report of crimes to you, and if the crimes are not witnessed by you, a report is made to you.  I am not talking about arrest here.
A.	That is true, Counsel.  This is different from the overall functions of the bourgmestre.
Q.	Now, you are required to enforce the law, aren't you, as the bourgmestre?
A.	Yes, it is exact.
Q.	You adjudicate over certain disputes as well that were brought to your attention, between the citizens of your commune, am I correct?
A.	I would not call them disputes, but I would say the question of judicial matters -- he would handle matters that have already been passed through the courts of law.
Q.	I am referring to matters, problems between the citizens of the commune, bringing it to your attention for settlement, amicable settlement.  I am not talking about matters that go to court.
A.	Thank you very much.  I think initially I talked about decentralisation, which was up to the secteur level.  If matters became impossible, then the bourgmestre could settle that.  But then in case this is not possible, people wouldn't come to an understanding, then the matter would be taken to court.  That is the way things were done, Counsel.
Q.	Now sir, we come to documents that you deal with as a bourgmestre, or you dealt with.  You issued the ID cards to the citizens of the commune, didn't you?
A.	That is true, Counsel.
Q.	Certificates of property were also issued by you; isn't it correct?
A.	We don't call them certificates, we call them Acts of -- Notaire Acts.
Q.	So, the Notaire Acts were issued by you as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, isn't that correct?
A.	That is exact.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What would be that document?
MS. OJEMENI:
They are documents indicating the ownership, particularly the ownership which has certificates.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think that the testimony should come from the witness and not the Prosecutor.  If she wants to elicit the information, it should come from the witness.  We don't need her testimony.
MS. OJEMENI:
Well, Counsel, I am leading this -- I am conducting this examination and I know the questions I asked, okay, and his response is already on the transcript. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I am objecting to form.  I am not arguing with her, I am dealing with what is proper and what is improper.  She cannot testify.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think what I wanted, or what my question was to -- an explanation, of course, the question was raised in your question and he did answer it, but I just wanted to now what that could be.  If I can have that one explained by the witness, I think that for the record, that would be much appropriate.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you explain to Court the Acts of Notaire?
A.	Thank you.  I would like to help.  In Kinyarwanda we call it a certified document.  You see, you will excuse me, these are matters that concern Rwanda.  For example, landed property.  If you are a citizen and you wanted to sell your property to another person so that it becomes his own or her own, you had an agreement and then the agreement would be declared, would be notified to everybody.  The communal authorities would register them, I would register that the property has changed hands from you and I would write a document and that document would be given to the person who takes the land, and the money would pass to the person who is selling.  This document is what you call that Notaire Act.  There is another one, if I am not delaying you, which was a marriage Act.  When the bourgmestre -
Q.	You have answered the question.  We are now dealing with certificates in respect of lands.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Okay, that is clear.  You can go on.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You also issued birth certificates, didn't you?
A.	We call it, in French, a certification of birth, a birth certificate.  This we would issue them, Counsel.
Q.	The English call it birth certificate.  We are talking of the same thing, isn't it?
A.	Thank you very much.
Q.	You also issued marriage certificates, didn't you?
A.	Yes, Counsel.
Q.	You also issued residence permits to citizens that are not members or indigent of Mukingo commune, isn't that correct?
A.	Yes, that is true.
Q.	Witness, some of these documents that you issued as bourgmestre had ethnicity of each holder, or ethnicity of the holder of the holder indicated on it?
A.	That is not true.
Q.	I am referring, Witness, to identity cards, certificates of property, which you stated is Act Notaire, birth certificates, marriage certificates, residence permits --  and my question is, some of the documents, or one of these documents indicated -- had the indication of the ethnicity of the holder on it, am I correct?
A.	That is true.  For example, the identity card, that is the one which was bearing the ethnic origin, but the one which came from the ministry of administration that is the one which bore the ethnic belonging.
Q.	The residence permit also bore the ethnicity of the holder, am I correct?
A.	That was never done in commune Mukingo, I never saw it and it cannot be correct.
Q.	Witness, you were a bourgmestre just like other bourgmestres in Rwanda between 1988 and 1993, am I correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct.
Q.	And you did have different - or, were your duties different from the other bourgmestres during this period?
A.	It was possible that they would be different.  It depends on how the commune -- that the commune functions would be different.
Q.	So in effect some of these duties that I have mentioned some bourgmestres don't posses such powers, some of the powers that I have referred to before, some bourgmestre that were also in existence between 1988 and 1993, did not posses such powers.  Is that what you are telling the Court as well?
A.	I could even explain it if you could allow me to do so.
Q.	Yes.
A.	Thank you very much.  There are instructions that governed municipal communes, and those were special instructions that were given by the ministry in charge.  There were also common instructions that covered all the communes.  There were different instructions depending on the capacity of the commune, that is the number of the citizens of the commune and the people that would be moving into the commune, and the administration of the commune would be different.  And we had also some common instructions that were covering the whole country.
Q.	Witness, is it all these documents that I have mentioned were kept in the communal office, isn't it?  The documents -- the copies of all the documents?
A.	There was what was known as the residence registry.  It was not necessary that we keep the copy because a person who would ask to stay in the commune, he or she would be given that residence permit as you said; it could even be typed on the spot and there was no need to keep copies, but there was a register of people who were staying in the commune, how long they were going to stay, when they would go and why they are coming.  But that keeping copies of residence permits didn't exist.  There are people who would stay in the commune in a way that the bourgmestre could not give them the necessary documents.  There were such people.
Q.	But the commune kept copies of identity cards; isn't that correct?
A.	That is perfectly true.
Q.	Now, Witness, you also had in the commune, what is called communal service -- under the communal service you had what is called census service.  An individual in the commune had a form containing series of identities, including the identity of everyone that was under that commune, the citizens of the Mukingo commune; am I correct?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	I am referring to census services, Witness, and I say to you that there existed under Mukingo commune an --
A.	The way your question is formulated is not clear, that the ordinary citizen didn't have a register of all people.  On the contrary, the office of the commune had a registry where all those particulars would be kept.
Q.	Including the ethnicity of every citizen in the commune; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes, that went with what was written on the identity card; that is correct.
Q.	And when you were bourgmestre, you knew everybody that mattered in that commune, didn't you?
A.	That is not true, Counsel.
Q.	When I talk about everybody that mattered, I am talking of important personalities within the commune.  There were people who were ministers, people who were directors, people who held important positions, didn't you, as a bourgmestre?
A.	That was possible, but according to my experience, they could have been from Mukingo commune but were residing elsewhere and we didn't know them.  There were people who were in Zaire, Uganda, but who came from the commune and were important.  And there were others who came from Mukingo commune working in Kigali and who were not known to us.  It was not possible to know all those.  But at the level of ministers and director generals, it was possible.
Q.	Witness, I am referring to the residents of Mukingo commune during the period that you were -- no, let me extend it to accountants of the commune and up to 1993 when you ceased to be the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
I am waiting for the answer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you get the question?

No translation to the question to the witness, and the answer the witness has given has not been translated back to us.
MR. HINDS:
I think the Prosecutor made a statement.  I am not sure whether there was a question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you put your question back.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune an also and accountant of Mukingo commune for 8 years, you knew all the important people resident in that commune, didn't you?
A.	It's not true.
Q.	You have testified that you made a lot contributions to the commune, and that is how you were appointed as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune; isn't that correct?
A.	I accept that.
Q.	You are now telling the Court that by virtue of your position as accountant in Mukingo commune, and thereafter the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, that you didn't know the important people like the director of schools, chief executive of companies, top civil servants who are resident in Mukingo commune?
A.	I would like us to get to an understanding.  There are different categories, they are not of equal importance.  They may be natives of Mukingo but may not work there.  It wasn't easy to know such people.  But for categories of people who worked in Mukingo commune, it was possible, yes.   But I wasn't even possible a hundred per cent.  We could have known such personalities if they worked in  commune Mukingo and who were born there, while other categories came from Mukingo commune but worked elsewhere.  They were not even living there any more.  There were different categories and it is hard to assert that they could all be known to me.  That is not correct.
Q.	Witness, about how many staff did you have under you as a bourgmestre?
A.	It used to change according to the economic situation.  I cannot, let's say in 1989, the number of staff that you had was the same number that was in 1993.  The workers who started in 998 could not be the same as those in 1993.  There were changes according to economic situation prevailing.  The number used to change and I would not confirm anything before this Chamber.
Q.	Can you give an average number of the staff under you at this time?  Just an estimate.
A.	I can do that.
Q.	Go on.
A.	I can say in 1988-1989 I had about altogether 60 staff members.  Until 1993 there were now 27 staff members.  That is how it was.
Q.	Witness, I heard that the same number -- before you answered your testimony was to the effect that the same number that were there in 1988 was still there in 1993.  Is that correct?
A.	I have just explained that that is not correct?  In 1988 -- in 1989 I had 60 staff members, but in 1993 the staff was reduced to 27.  But there is what we call communal personnel, I am talking of those.  The people who were paid their salaries by the commune.  But not all the people in the commune, there were some people who were paid by the government and then there were others who were paid by the commune.
Q.	Some of these people who were paid by the government were also attached to your commune, people like agronomists, health, education; the number you have just mentioned, are they all included?
A.	I have made a distinction between the communal personnel and those who were paid by the government.  The categories you have you mentioned were not part of the number I have given you.
Q.	Now, Witness, you operated under -- you had three structures in place that you executed your functions through.  One of them is the conseiller communal, which is made up of all the conseillers in Mukingo commune; is that correct?
A.	It is exact, Madam, the Prosecutor.
Q.	How many conseillers did you have between 1988 and 1993, about how many of them did you have?
A.	I had eight conseillers, Madame, the Prosecutor.
Q.	Were these conseillers still there when you resumed office in l994, were they all there?
A.	I wish to let you know that from 1988 to 1993 there were some changes, and of course, in l994 in June when I resumed my duties there were some conseillers who were no longer there, who had been changed.
Q.	Do I say six of them were still present when you took office in l994; would that be a fair comment?
A.	Yes, and there were two who had replaced others.
Q.	And you had good relationship with these conseillers, didn't you, before and after you took over?  I am referring to the period up to 1993 when you were bourgmestre you had good relations with them, and even when you took over in June l994.  Am I correct to say so?
A.	It is not true, because when I resumed my duties in June 1994, I was not able to know the conduct of these conseiller. I did not even know how they where working.  This was due to the war situation.  It was not easy to know them well.  And I may add that the relationship with people for me is not important.  What is important is working -- the work only.
Q.	Is it unfair for me to say that in 1993 when you were living office that you had a good relationship with them, with the conseillers?
A.	I think that would be correct.  I don't think I had any problems with any of them.
Q.	And when you were no longer in power they were still close to you, they were still your friends, or you still had good relationship with them?  I withdraw the word "friends".
A.	I did not continue any relations.  I had left my work and they continued with their work.  I wasn't making any demands from them and they were not making any demands from me.  I was out of the circuit.  I had changed my career.
Q.	Are you then saying that between 1993 and June 1994 when you took office you had no relationship whatsoever with the six conseillers that you met in l994 when you took over as bourgmestre?
A.	I would say that there were eight, even the two conseillers had been replaced.  They had their secteurs to lead.  There was no other relationship.   Me, I only looked at our working relationship, I don't know what you want to get at.  Are you talking of friendship?  I did not have any other relationship, it was based on work and when I was out of my office there was no other relationship with them.
Q.	Witness, are you saying that if you had a good relationship with somebody that the fact that you left office would mar your relationship with that person, is that what you are saying?
A.	I just feel that the name you give it has got another context, another connotation.  I worked with those people.  When I left my post I later came back.  We had worked well together.  It does not mean that there was a relationship.  I do not -- there was no relationship other than the working relationship.  And when I resumed my work we again had working relations.  There was no other -- there was no special relationship with them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Witness, did this secteur continue to be your friend even when you were no longer in office; is that correct.
A.	It's not true, she remained a staff member of the commune after I had left my office.
Q.	Yes, we are not contesting that he remained a staff member of the commune, but he was not your enemy either, was he?
A.	She was not my enemy, she was neither a friend nor an enemy.
Q.	You also had two committees that assisted the conseillers communal. One is the commission technique communal, the other one is the technical staff which you called expert commission; is that correct?
A.	It is not correct.
Q.	Can you correct me where I have gone wrong, then?
A.	Thank you very much.  There was a working group of experts, a committee of these experts, and there was a commune development committee and the communal council.  There were three organs.
Q.	The commission of experts is commission technique, which is part of the commission development; am I correct?
A.	No, it was not part of the development council.  The experts committee worked out studies.  It would show what can be done in the commune, and how it can be done, showing it to the development council.  But you will excuse me, it is ten years ago, I might be mistaken, I have not reviewed this, but I remember that when the experts committee would show, would present its report to the development committee and it could make recommendations or make some amendments, if you allow me, the experts committee was a committee aside to study the communal projects and to find funding for such projects.  Thank you.
Q.	I will help you if you forgot, and correct me if I am wrong.  The second organ was called the technical commission, and it consisted qualified people such as accounts, members of parliament, Parish priests, school heads, local officials of technical committees, I mean, ministries and very prominent figures of the commune.  Does that refresh your memory?
A.	I thank you very much for your corrections, but I find there is a distinction.  It depends, the bourgmestre could choose them looking at the capacity of such people and they could be given also the duties of carrying out some statistics for the commune.  And, there were some parish priests who may not turn up for such a meeting.  There could be other people who did not involve accountants.  There are some points where we agree and others we don't agree.  I accept the correction, but it is not all founded.  They could look at the individual and see that individual could contribute to the commune. They could even co-opt a foreigner who after returning to Tanzania or to France they -- such a person could negotiate aid assistance for the commune.  Thank you.
Q.	Witness, we are saying the same thing, but probably in different ways.  Now, this technical committee -- commission, gives advice and raised funds for development for the projects in the commune just as said -- just as you have said; is that correct?
A.	It is true Madame, the Prosecutor --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, sometimes you just say it is true, because you are actually not addressing Madam Prosecutor or any other counsel.   You are addressing that to the Trial Chamber.  So you can simply say, it's true.  If it is not true, it's not true.  Okay?
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Through these two commissions, the conseiller commission and the technique commission, make up the communal de development which is the development commission; is that correct?
A.	As far as I am concerned, I know that the development counsel of the commune was composed of the conseiller of the commune, defence conseiller, the staff members of the commune and in the technical committee there were experts who were in different fields, who could submit reports to the development council.  I think we should make that distinction.  It was not necessary to have a development council, and then a technical committee.  Each organ had it's own duties and together it was developmental council.  But you cannot combine them because each organ had its own duties.  I think I may have to review that, but what I remember was what I stated.  Thank you for correcting me, but that is how it was happening, and we were following these matters very closely in the commune.
Q.	Witness, am I then correct to say that you knew virtually all the prominent people in Mukingo commune, given the fact that I have refreshed your memory with the constitution of the technical -- commission technique?
A.	I feel there are two meanings there.  Is it importance because of the post you have or because of your riches?  We did not consider either of these.  We only looked at the expertise of such individuals, and this what we looked at, if you were able to contribute to the work of the commune, what your contributions could be.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is not the answer to the question raised by counsel.  I don't know whether it was not understood, perhaps.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The counsel is asking the same questions, and she asked the question in a way that elicited his answers.  She asked, "Based upon all the things that I have said, is it true that you know virtually all -"  and again we are getting back to -- it's -- objection.  Answered for.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The objection is denied because counsel has raised -- is saying that in the light of the break down of people one as a bourgmestre would have contact -- would that be --  that is the basis of that question.   Oh, that is a different matter, the witness can say that.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I limited myself to the membership of the technique --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can you put the question to the witness, perhaps.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, given the fact I have mentioned the members of the calibre of members of the technique commission, am I then right to say that given your vantage position of the bourgmestre who presided over meetings of this commission, and who also had the powers to appoint these members, that you knew all the prominent residents of the Mukingo commune?
MR. HINDS:
Same objection.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Denied.  The witness can answer that question.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  It is not true, it is not correct the way you think about it.  I would rather make proposals of people who could assist me in the commune in accordance with specialisation, their capacity, their positions, and the proposal would be submitted to the prèfet and the prèfet would submit it to the minister of internal affairs, which could refuse or accept the list.  So, it is not correct to say that I was the one who was making the appointment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take note of the answer given by the witness on this matter.  You can go on, Counsel.  But we are almost coming to the end.  Could we stop here?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
 We will stop here and adjourn these proceedings to tomorrow at 9:00 in the morning when we will resume cross-examination of the Accused who is testifying on his own behalf will continue.

So until tomorrow at 9:00 in the morning, these proceedings are adjourned.
(Court adjourned at 1730H)
