P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
 Good morning, everybody. 

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. N'GUM: 
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Lordships. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 25th of July 2007, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Lordships.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Registrar. 

The appearances -- the appearances are the same.  Yes. 

Mr. Robinson, just before we adjourned yesterday afternoon, you indicated you wished to make a motion, an application.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Actually, if you could hear from Mr. Weyl first, we had somewhat of a difference in approach, and I think he would like to address the Trial Chamber first on this issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, indeed, I would like to make a motion before the Chamber.  The Chamber will not be surprised that it is a motion for exclusion of Witness Uwizeye.  The Chamber certainly recalls that we presented last Thursday a motion for exclusion, which the Chamber denied after deliberations, for two reasons which appear to us to be essential.  One of the reasons had to do with the Chamber's unshakeable faith in human nature, since the Chamber was of the view, and I quote the transcripts of the hearing and its translation in French, that:  "There is a logical inference that have to be made.  It cannot be said that if the witness gave a testimony that was tinged by perjury, this would be unacceptable, improper." 
Mr. President, to get rid of what is natural is not proper.  We had a demonstration of this yesterday in the obvious proceedings when Mr. Uwizeye was able to say that the statements he made and which were recorded had not been made -- we had a demonstration of that yesterday -- that who commits perjury once will commit it again and before this Chamber, as had been the case before another Chamber. 

The other reason for which the Chamber had overruled our motion last Thursday was that, and I quote the transcript again:  "The specific point on which the Chamber's attention was drawn is not essential regarding the merits of the testimony of this witness." 

Mr. President, Your Honours, I believe it will be difficult for the Chamber to consider that, in principle, insults made against Mrs. Dior Diagne could be considered as a venial fact.  As far as we are concerned, it is an essential failure on the part of the witness.  We observed yesterday, with regard to the insults against Mrs. Dior Diagne, that when confronted on two occasions with his statements, with all the care you took to alert him and to tell him that, "We have the recording and we have taken note of what you said, can you explain yourself on that point, Mr. Uwizeye?" looking at you in the eye, told you, Mr. President, "I did not do that."  Before the recess he knew what he had said and he left, saying, "It is impossible; it is incomprehensible."  

After the adjournment, you told him, "Mr. Uwizeye, we have the recording of what you said and we've heard what you said.  What did you say?"  He lied.  You gave him a second opportunity by inviting the interpreters to come into the courtroom and to relay to him what he had said and which had been recorded, and Mr. Uwizeye said, "Mr. President, it is not true." 

He was causing sunshine in midnight.  After listening to all he said, you would bear in mind that he lied because he testified under oath and the oath was still in force.  I believe we took -- have taken a lot of time with this witness, and he has demonstrated his article -- his -- his ability to go around obstacles.  

For the reasons you gave on Thursday for denying our motion, I believe I should ask you again, Mr. President, Your Honours, to grant our motion and exclude Mr. Uwizeye from this courtroom.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I don't want to belabour the point, but I have a different motion.  

First of all, I want to thank you for the way in which you handled the matter yesterday.  I appreciate that you took the time for us to listen to the recording and accurately find out exactly what the witness said.  And I also want to thank the people in the video booth and for those in the interpreting booth for making the exercise productive and allowing us all to come to a very accurate understanding of what the witness said. 

And as I understand it, and I'm -- again, I'm no expert in Kinyarwanda by a long shot, but from what has been explained to me, when he said the words "kariya kagore vraiment," it's basically an insult such as in English -- although it was interpreted literally for us as "this little woman," it might be the kind of pejorative that we would understand in the English language as "that bitch."  And I think that's the kind of insult that cannot be tolerated in this courtroom.  I think on -- the witness was not -- also was not forthright telling us what he said.  

Nevertheless, I think, Mr. President, that what I would be asking you to do is to admonish this witness that he needs to observe the decorum in the courtroom that is befitting not only those of us who are present here, but his own personality and presence.  He is an educated man, he's not a peasant, and I think he needs to be admonished to behave properly in the courtroom. 

On the other hand, Mr. President, I note that he apologised.  I note that he has been cross-examined for a long time.  It happened at the end of the day when he was probably fatigued, and I also think it's very important that we treat the witnesses here with a lot of respect.  And so, Mr. President, my motion is that we -- that you admonish the witness as a result of his comment yesterday.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, ultimately the matter is left for the discretion of the Chamber.  While I appreciate the Chamber's careful examination of the issue, I think we've spent quite enough time on it.  

Quite frankly, I have a different recollection of our review of what the witness said in the tape than Mr. Weyl does.  I'll simply rely on the record, but the fact that I remember things differently and -- than Mr. -- than Mr. Weyl -- and I've just double-checked with other colleagues on the Prosecution team -- should demonstrate amply that ultimately this is something that can only be resolved by the Court's careful examination of the transcripts, because my recollection is that the witness acknowledged exactly what was trans -- interpreted for us by the Kinyarwanda booth.  The only difference was the word "vraiment" and "honnêtement", which I think is inconsequential.  

But having said that, I agree with the latter portion of Mr. Robinson's submission, which is that everybody in this courtroom deserves respect and especially the witnesses, who, of all of us, work the hardest, I would suggest to the Chamber.  They are answering questions from the beginning of the session all the way to the end.  And when we get to the end of the day, after constantly being barraged with repetitive questions and being characterised as a liar, as someone that's not telling the truth, that's making things up, it's certainly understandable, though not -- I don't condone it in any way, that the witness would lose control in a moment of stress and fatigue.  

But I would hope that we can proceed.  Mr. Weyl's motion to exclude his testimony is clearly out of order.  When we look at Rule 95, there's nothing in Rule 95 that would suggest that Mr. Weyl is on good footing legally.  I understand the Chamber has inherent power to -- in the interests of justice to make decisions on how evidence is received, but this is clearly -- I understand the importance of this -- the issue.  I'm not trying to minimise -- minimise it, but we've clearly spent quite a bit of time on it already, and I would suggest that we move on and hear this witness's evidence about the events of 1994.  

Once again, in closing, I would urge all of us to exercise discretion and respect for each other and for the witnesses that testify before us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I should, first of all, like to thank the interpreters for assisting us to understand exactly what was said. 

Although the particular nuances that were attributed to those words by Mr. Robinson was not supported by the literal translation of the interpreters, it was clear from the remarks made by the witness yesterday afternoon that he acknowledged that he had gone too far and had crossed a line of courtesy which he ought not to have crossed. 

We had been considering how to address it.  The suggestion made by Mr. Robinson to admonish the witness is a moderate response to what transpired, but we think, in the circumstances, it might be sufficient, bearing in mind the attitude which we understand was evinced by the witness's remarks yesterday afternoon.  

Although he suggested that the remark he made was addressed to Ms. Alison Des Forges, he -- or to her testimony, we have considered that the -- he did make some sort of apology for the remarks that he made.  And it is on that basis that we consider that it would be appropriate for me to indicate to him that when he is a witness before our Chamber, that there's a certain standard of decorum which is expected.  The lawyers who are examining the witnesses, despite the fact that they have a particular role to play, either a role as a Prosecutor or as a role as a defender, they are, in fact, officers of the Court, and disrespect and discourtesy to any officer of the Court has to be taken very seriously and has to be ruled out. 

In addition to that, the gender of Ms. Diagne has to be taken into account.  And as you yourself acknowledged, it exacerbates the offence when one says remarks which could be regarded as being insulting or disrespectful to a female officer of the Court.  

So I trust that these remarks you will regard as an admonishment and as an indication that that sort of behaviour should not be repeated in our Chamber. 

I should mention that there are other steps that the Court could take, but we've decided to limit our action at this time to admonishing you and to requiring you not to repeat this behaviour.  

I should add, for your information, that when we are considering the testimony of witnesses and trying to determine their credibility and reliability, one of the factors that is used to assist us to decide what to believe is the demeanour of the witness, and what the witness says in this regard is an element of demeanour.  So there's also an issue that will be utilised at a different stage in the proceedings when we are deciding what to believe when we again look at what happened today -- or yesterday afternoon. 

With regard to Mr. Weyl's application, we do not think that the -- that what transpired provided any -- any basis whatsoever for us to reconsider the decision we had already made concerning the exclusion of this witness's testimony, and so the application is denied. 

We also would like to note that we think that Ms. Diagne has conducted herself with dignity, and we appreciate the fact that she has not, herself, made any particular application but merely drew our attention to the matter which was worthy of her complaint.  And we trust that she will accept that the way in which we have managed the matter has been a satisfactory response to the complaint that she has made. 

Now, Mr. Witness, we think that that is -- we have addressed matter.  It's taken some time, and we would now like your testimony to continue.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took at the commencement of your testimony. 

Ms. Diagne?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
FIDÈLE UWIZEYE,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  I should like us to continue with the exercise we were undertaking yesterday.  I confirm to you that as far as I'm concerned, this incident is closed and I should like you and I to finish with this testimony before the Trial Chamber in a much more serene state of mind. 

Coming back, and in order to conclude, I should like to go on to another topic, namely, concerning your statement, a statement you made on the 24th of March 2001.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
And I should like to point out to Mr. Issa that it is exhibit -- just a moment -- 14.  It is item 14 -- or document 14 that I should like to show the parties.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Witness, I should like you to concentrate on page 2 of the said document.  Witness, the document states that it's a statement you made on the 24th of March 2001 to the investigators -- to the ICTR investigators.  I should like to draw your attention, and that of the Trial Chamber, to the statement by the ICTR investigators regarding yourself personally.  Have you read page 2, the passage in question?  
A.	Yes, I see it, Counsel.  I see it, Counsel.  However, I would like a clarification.  Here, on page 3, K034893, I see the third page, I see the second page.  I don't know if you're speaking of what -- the page I just mentioned or K -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, could we have that number again?  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	The one previously mentioned.  In fact, it says 3, but that's because it's a fax.  But the proper numbering is at the bottom -- the proper page numbering is at the bottom of the page, where it is 2/22, meaning the second page of 22 pages.  So that is one K03470 -- 7893.  
A.	I see it, Counsel.  However, at the bottom of the page -- in fact, on all pages, the date is the 
	6th of October 1998.  That is the date that appears next to my signature.  And on every page, I see 
	6 October 1998 next to my signature, yet you have said that it is a statement I made in 2001, unless I am in error.  You might like to clear that up so that I know what document we're talking of.  Or are there two different documents?  Where is the document of 2001 that you have mentioned?  I'd like to see it and I'd like to see that I have signed it, as is the case for the present document.  As of page 3/22, every page has my signature at the bottom.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, I understand your concern.  It is the same document.  In fact, on the 24th of March 2001, the ICTR investigators met you for the confirmation or reconfirmation of your statement, as you have said, of October 1998.  It is indeed the same document.  We understand each other now?  
A.	No, we do not understand each other, Counsel.  You're speaking of a document or a confirmation of 2001 which was confirmation or reconfirmation of a statement given on the 6th of October 1998.  Well, this document of 2001 is not signed.  I see a text not signed by me.  I see the date 24th of March 2001, but I do not see my signature.  There's an initial on page 2/22 but not my signature to confirm that it is my statement, that I have accepted it as my statement.  In other words, you're trying to make me believe that in 2001 I reconfirmed this statement of 1998, and, as you say, at page 2, I see a text, but that is not signed by me, which is why I say I don't understand what you're saying. 
Q.	Yet again, I understand your concern, Mr. Uwizeye, but you could not, in fact, sign this page because it is an assessment made by the OTP investigators who met you on the 24th of March 2001.  And it is this assessment, evaluation report, by those investigators that I should like us to go through, you and I, for the benefit of the Trial Chamber.  Do you understand me now?  
A.	Yes, I understand you.  I don't know if the Trial Chamber understands the way we are proceeding, but I see no difficulty in analysing this document together to try and understand.  
Q.	My first question would be that I remember you told the Trial Chamber that indeed you had been arrested, that it was because, in your opinion, you thought that you'd been accused of threatening the internal -- of being a threat to internal security of the state.  And in this document that I have shown you the OTP investigators explained that you -- you testified before the IC -- before ICTR in defence of 
	Jean Paul Akayesu, and on your return to Rwanda, your superiors accused you of that, of having testified on the behalf of Jean Paul Akayesu.  You were sacked from your post and imprisoned and only released 20 months -- 21 months later, without having been, at any time, accused -- charged -- without having been charged at any time.  Is what the investigators say there correct? 
A.	I do not think that is true because I do not remember their investigation.  I don't remember their questions.  However, I believe that had they ever put questions to me on the Akayesu trial, I must have answered.  And here I'm trying to analyse -- trying to understand what they have written.  I think the question they put to me was the following:  "When you were arrested, were any questions put to you regarding the Akayesu case in Arusha?"  If that was the question, I would have told them that at the police station the major that questioned me -- but without going into in detail -- he asked me, "Did you go to Arusha to testify?"  And I answered, "Yes."  It was like an ordinary conversation.  And the main question put to me, and put to me twice, concerned national security, and that was the matter that was mentioned in my file.  It wasn't because of having testified in the Akayesu case.  That is my answer.  It has nothing to do with the Akayesu trial.  I was questioned at length on two occasions, that is, two interrogations, on the basis of which the file was prepared concerning me, and nowhere in that file is my visit to Arusha, my stay in Arusha, and my testimony in the Akayesu case.  It only mentions problems of national security. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The OTP investigators who met you at that time made an assessment, an evaluation, of your personality so as to determine whether you were up to give testimony before ICTR.  And here is what they say about you, and I will now read.  And I wish to make it clear, so as to avoid any misunderstanding between us, that I am quoting the investigators who assessed you after having heard you at length regarding your various statements.  

This is what they say, as far as you are concerned:  "The witness is incoherent and does not seem to distinguish between what happened before, during and after the genocide and what he experienced and what he heard."  I should like to repeat:  "The witness is incoherent and does not seem to distinguish between what happened before, during and after the genocide and what he experienced and what he heard." 

And I should like, Witness, to ask you to comment on this assessment by the OTP investigators.  
A.	Counsel, I have no comment to make.  Those people who wrote this have their own reasons for doing so, and I have nothing to say about it except that it is a sad thing for Prosecution investigators to say such a thing.  Maybe that's how they see me, and yet, they have asked me to come several times to testify.  How can they criticise me and then call me to testify?  If they called me to testify, it's because they wanted me to speak of what happened in Rwanda and thought I could do so.  So, those comments are antipodal to what actually occurred in my several appearances before this Tribunal.  

I'm saddened and afflicted that a person such as I, with considerable responsibilities, be considered unstable or not -- without the correct capacity to reason, and that appears to be an insult which destabilises me and is prejudicial to my rights.  The person who writes that has no right to judge me.  He is -- they are not the only one to know the truth and are not capable of saying whether I am or not able to speak the truth. 
Q.	I understand you very well, Witness.  I also was afflicted after reading this, because I couldn't understand, after having read it, how the OTP could bring you before the Trial Chamber.  

They added that -- I'm quoting:  "It appears that in his present state, this witness will not be of use, in view of his pronounced tendency to procrastinate and speak of everything and nothing, without speaking of the topic on which he is questioned." 

In more candid terms, when the investigators -- the OTP investigators went through all your testimony, when they attempted to have you confirm in 2001 your statement of -- dated September, September 1998, they said they could not accomplish that exercise.  It was not possible to do that in view of your mental state, your ability to speak -- to tell -- to say what happened in reality and describe events as they occurred in Rwanda at the material time.  

And the conclusion to which they came, I wanted to share it, you, Mr. Uwizeye, and us on the Defence benches and all that, for the benefit of the Trial Chamber, which, in the final analysis, is the body which is to weigh your credibility.  And the question I want to very sincerely put to you:  When you read the conclusions of the investigators regarding yourself, do you think we can retain anything from the days you have spent here in the witness -- at the witness stand, very sincerely, between you and me, Mr. Uwizeye?  
A.	I thank you.  I would like to say that if they had considered that I was of no use to the Chamber, I wouldn't have appeared before this Chamber to take an oath to tell the truth.  When a man appears before the Chamber and takes an oath, it is because he is convinced -- he is convinced that he is in a position to tell the truth.  If I took an oath to tell the truth, it is because I was convinced that my statements and testimony would assist Rwanda and the entire international community to ensure that justice is done, that justice is done to those to whom justice is due, and that I would be able to contribute to the process of justice in order to stamp out injustice.  

So, if I appear before this Chamber, it is because I wanted to tell the truth and because I thought the Chamber had enough faith in me such as to call me to appear before the Chamber.  They would say because Fidèle was in Rwanda during the events and knows how the events unfolded.  That is an honour for me, and I know that they have reasons for calling me to appear before the Chamber.  I, therefore, do not consider myself as someone who is of no use.  I thank you, madam.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I would request that this exhibit be admitted into evidence, and I believe it could be admitted under Exhibit Number D. K39, subject to Mr. Issa's confirmation.  
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honours, it is D. K39. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, I would oppose that application, Your Honour.  I believe that what Ms. Diagne needs on the record has been -- already been elicited by her questions put to the witness and the witness's responses.  I don't think there's any ambiguity in what she has sought to establish from the witness and how the witness explained himself.  

And if we look at the issue carefully, what we're about to do is the same thing we tried to avoid several days ago when another witness's statement was being offered in evidence by the Karemera Defence team.  This is no different.  This is not a prior inconsistent statement of the witness.  This is actually a statement of another witness, even though he happens to be an investigator of the OTP.  So, in order to maintain consistency, I would oppose that application.  But, as a practical matter, everything that Ms. Diagne seeks to establish has already been established on the record.  So on that basis, I would oppose the application.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, let me simply inform you that the document that you certainly have before you now, indeed, includes the statements of this witness.  As a matter of fact, what I have just done has been to use one page which is part and parcel of the statements of the witness, and it is an assessment report which OTP investigators wrote and which they deemed necessary to add to all of the witness's statements.  According to me, it is a conclusion drawn by OTP investigators who took the statements of the witness and added an assessment report and disclosed to us in their entirety.  So, it is, indeed, the statements of the witness commented by investigators of the Tribunal, and I, therefore, request that it be accepted into evidence -- it be admitted into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We have decided that the document should be admitted.  We admit it as -- Mr. Issa, the number, please?  
MR. MJUI:
D. K39, Your Honour.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
D. K39. 
(Exhibit No. D. K39 admitted) 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I am obliged, Mr. President.  Yesterday there were documents whose admission into evidence was reserved subject to -- it has to do with a conversation I had with the Prosecutor.  That was done.  He disclosed to me all of the communiqué and in the other languages for which we didn't have that communiqué.  And I would like to request that following our perusal of all the documents, I would request that the entire exhibit be admitted into evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think we already had a number for this, and we were going to substitute the two or three pages that Ms. Diagne had originally for the entire transcripts with the translations.  So if Mr. Issa could check back, I think we already have two numbers for what Ms. Diagne is about to do.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
The numbers were D. K37 and D. K38.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, all that is left for me to say is that I have come to the end of my cross-examination.  I crave the Court's indulgence for going beyond the time allowed.  I also crave your indulgence for any concerns I may have caused you.  And I also ask for the witness's apologies if I did not conduct myself properly towards him.  I would like to inform him that it was not a deliberate thing on my part, and I ask for his forgiveness.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Diagne. 

Mr. Witness, the -- your examination by Ms. Diagne has now been concluded.  You have to answer questions from counsel representing the other Accused, and I think that you will be examined, first of all -- or next in order by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Mr. Frédéric Weyl, who will begin his cross-examination now.  
MR. WEYL: 
I am obliged, Mr. President. 

CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Uwizeye.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	As you have been reminded by Mr. President, I am co-counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse, and I will do exactly what my learned colleague Dior Diagne has just done.  But before I begin my cross-examination, I would like to start by putting a few -- or two preliminary questions to you. 

The first has to do with the fact that last Friday at the end of the proceedings, at the end of the hearing, the Prosecutor made a motion in your regard stating that you would like to meet, over the weekend, members of the Office of the Prosecutor with whom you had relations.  Do you recall that?  
A.	I do recall that, Mr. Weyl.  However, you have just added that I entertained relations with those persons.  I do not know whether that is what the Prosecutor said.  I have no relationship with anyone in Arusha.  I have acquaintances instead.  I have no family ties with anyone here in Arusha.  What I know is that his wish was that I should end my cross-examination, and I wanted to be allowed to meet certain persons here in Arusha, persons in the Office of the Prosecutor.  I know that he made a motion in that regard, and I believe the motion was granted.  
Q.	I believe we already have some difficulty here.  It's not just something I remember from the motion of last Friday, Mr. Webster's motion was very explicit, very formal.  I have before me the transcript of the hearing of last Friday, page 37, lines 25, 26, and 27 of the French version.  And this is what is stated therein, and it is Mr. Webster speaking:  "Yes, this witness has been here for over a week.  The members of my team have been in contact with him during that period, but I know that he knows other persons in the Office of the Prosecutor and will probably contact them."  And he goes on to say the following:  "What I am requesting of you, and I'm notifying the Defence thereof, is that he should be allowed to contact other members of the Office of the Prosecutor (sic)."

Nevertheless, without contacting members of this Prosecutor team, was Mr. Webster wrong when he said that he was aware of the fact that you knew other persons in the Office of the Prosecutor and that you wished to contact them?  
A.	Mr. Weyl, I have just said that I do not confirm having heard Mr. Webster say, at least from the interpretation that came through to me, that he was aware that I had any family ties with some members of the Office of the Prosecutor.  That is what I deny hearing.  I have no family ties with anybody whatsoever.  I have just said that, as a matter of fact, Mr. Webster never used the term "family ties" with anyone whatsoever.  In other words, he filed his motion, as you have just stated, requesting leave for me to meet certain members of the Office of the Prosecutor, but that did not happen.  
Q.	We have to play by the rules of the game strictly.  I did not refer to family ties.  All I referred to was relations with members of the Office of the Prosecutor, and you are the one who introduced this notion of family ties.  

I have not ended what I am saying.  I am not done.  I have not completed my statement, and I will wish that you shouldn't interrupt me. 

My question is this:  I appreciate -- is it true that you have acquaintances in the Office of the Prosecutor?  Now, please answer my question. 
A.	I have acquaintances here, but I do not know in what section they are working.  I have acquaintances, persons who came from Kigali and who work here.  
Q.	Can you give us their names? 
A.	In fact, I have a neighbour who lives here, his name is Biramvu, and his wife Béata.  They have been my neighbours for a long time.  The problem is that there are regulations that do not allow witnesses to meet some members or officials of the Tribunal.  And when I arrived in Arusha, I agreed with them, and I discussed with them and we agreed that I could perhaps contact them at the end of my testimony.  But let me reassure you that in the meantime, I have not met with them.  

Let me spell out Biramvu, B-I-R-A-M-V-U. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, we have to admit your assertion that you haven't met anybody.  

Mr. Uwizeye, I have a second question for you, a second introductory question.  Yesterday you stated that you testified in trials in Rwanda; is that correct? 
A.	I never made any such statement.  I never said that I had testified as a witness in trials in Rwanda, at least in the capacity of a witness.  I never said that.  I believe I referred to Gacaca sessions.  In Rwanda, everyone participates in Gacaca sessions.  When you participate in a Gacaca session, you participate effectively, you follow the proceedings, you can even ask questions.  I believe I broached that subject.  I said that in our country, Rwanda, we participate in Gacaca sessions.  I do not believe I said that I participated in a trial in the capacity of a witness.  This is a clarification I want to make, and it is the truth. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, I would like us to find a passage of the transcript in which you said you testified in trials in Rwanda.  I will do that during the break.  You are playing on words and saying that it is not trials but it is just Gacaca sessions, but did you testify in Rwanda?  
A.	That is not true, Mr. Weyl.  I have no reason to lie to you.  
Q.	I'm not talking about having any reason to lie.  What I'm saying is that I do not understand what you're saying.  This morning, contrary to what you said yesterday, you said that you participated in trials, and that's why I'm asking you to state under what circumstances, before what court, in what trial, where and when you testified in Rwanda.  
A.	My answer to you is that I have never testified before any Rwandan court.  And let me add that, nevertheless, as a Rwandan citizen, just like any other Rwandan citizen, I attend Gacaca sessions, but I have never attended a Gacaca session in the capacity of a witness.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, can you tell us in what Gacaca session you participated? 
A.	In all Gacaca sessions held every Sunday in my cellule.  All inhabitants of my cellule participate in such Gacaca sessions every Sunday.  I live in the Gishushu cellule in Gishushu village, Nyarutarama cellule, Gasabo district and Remera secteur.

1030H 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, the time is 10:30 a.m.  May I request that we take our mid-morning recess now?  And immediately after we resume I would end with this line of questioning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Madam Registrar, could we get an update on the timing, or do you wish to do it at the resumption after the recess?  
MS. N'GUM:  
I will do it on resumption, Your Lordships, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1032H to 1057H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can continue now.  

Madam Registrar, you wanted to make a statement at this time?  
MS. N'GUM:  
Yes, Mr. President.  Yesterday Madam Diagne utilised four hours, one minute from the Ngirumpatse case, and this morning she utilised 31 minutes.  So the balance left for the Ngirumpatse case is one hour, 41 minutes for that case.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  

Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, yesterday we were smiling, but after what has just been said I would like to say that if Counsel Diagne spoke for 13 hours, I should sit down and leave it at that.  I don't think we really should account for things like that, because Madam Diagne took the time she had to take.  That doesn't mean that I have to neglect my mission.  And although I can tell Madam N'gum I will try to be reasonable, I am not bound by the hour and 40 minutes.  I should like to be reassured on that score, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, let's take it step by step.  You now know what is the estimated guideline within which you have to comply.  If, when that time is approaching, you need more time, then you let us know and we will make the assessment.  

MR. WEYL: 
Yes.  But, Mr. President, I should like -- not like Ms. -- Madam N'gum's assertions to be the rule, should nothing else be said.  So I will take the time necessary with due reasonableness.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, have you had higher education? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Have you studied sciences, have you had a scientific education?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You became préfet in July 1992?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you go to an administrative school or anything that prepared you for administrative office, administrative functions?  
A.	No. 
Q.	So, to the French expression, you were trained, as -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Well, it is an English expression.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	-- it is, on the job?  
A.	Yes, if you're speaking of administrative duties.  
Q.	We agree that the office of préfet presupposes, firstly, decorum, secondly --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Could counsel repeat his question?  The interpreters did not understand the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, could you repeat the question?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, I was asking if we agree that the office of préfet presupposes both good manners, intelligence, global thinking, overall thinking, sense of organisation, liveliness of mind, initiative.  Do you understand my question?  
A.	Yes, you're right.  But you're -- the way you're putting your question is different from the one before, because before you seemed to imply that only people having been trained in administrative duties can fulfil the functions of préfet.  But let me tell you that, in a political context, when someone is appointed préfet, it is possible to fulfil those duties without having had administrative training.  I was mandated by a political party that had its own purposes and objectives, and those that appointed me considered that I was competent.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, do not interpret my questions; just answer them.  We will gain time thereby.  I think that you do have the faculty to understand and the intelligence that makes it possible for you to answer my questions without interpreting them.  
Do you, therefore, consider that you have the necessary skills to carry out your mandate as a préfet?  
A.	If I accepted that appointment, it was because I deemed myself fit to do the job.  
Q.	I thank you for this direct answer.  

Mr. Uwizeye, you were also a politician involved in the work of the MDR party in 1992; isn't that correct?  
A.	I was not one of the leaders of that party at national level.  I was an ordinary member among the members of the party, but I wasn't one of the leaders of the party in the political party bureau, or at national level.  
Q.	My question was whether you attended the MDR congress.  
A.	Which congress are you referring to?  
Q.	Did you attend any of the MDR congresses?  
A.	The only MDR congress I attended was the one that was held in 1993, and I attended that congress because the statutes of the MDR provided that the préfet, drawn from that political party, was entitled and had the obligation to attend congresses.  So I did not attend that congress as a full-time official of the congress, but as a member of the party and in my capacity as préfet.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, I know that everyone is tired, and you would wish that my cross-examination should come to an end as much as I do wish.  I would request you to, quite simply, answer my questions, instead of putting questions to me.  You can answer my questions very simply.  In a few words, you can say, "I attended the 1993 MDR congress."  It would enable us to gain time.  Could you please, therefore, adopt this approach to answering my questions from now onwards, Witness.  

So, what you are saying is that you attended the MDR congress in 1993?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you tell me which faction you joined when the MDR split? 
A.	I did not join any faction; I remained faithful to the MDR party as préfet.  However, I worked in concert with the faction -- members -- whose members were in government.  So I worked with the prime minister in my capacity as préfet.  So, in my capacity as préfet, if you wish, I -- I could say that I favoured that government.  
Q.	Can you tell us which prime minister you are referring to?  And, please, give that person's name.  
A.	Can you give me a date of reference as to when I started working with the prime minister?  Can you tell me from what date to what date?  
Q.	We were talking about the year 1993, Mr. Uwizeye.  
A.	In 1993, the prime minister was Nsengiyaremye, and he was replaced by Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  
Q.	So, you successively supported the ideas of Mr. Nsengiyaremye, and also espoused the ideas of Mrs. Uwilingiyimana?  
A.	No.  In my capacity as a civil servant I supported the policy of the government, as the state agent at the level of the préfecture.  As to the ideologies of the party, the question is more complex.  You cannot espouse the ideas of a person, you would rather espouse the ideology of the party.  To respond to your question as you asked me to do directly, I would say that I supported the action of the prime minister, who was a member of my party, and also the policy of the government, since I was the representative of the government.  Regarding my ideas and my ideology, I would say that my ideologies continued to be those of the party, even though the party was experiencing difficulties. 
Q.	Does this mean that your ideology was somewhat divided, Mr. Uwizeye?  
A.	I would like to inform you that, as regards my party, to which you have made reference, and its ideology, well, ideology is something very complicated.  That party did not have a well-established ideology.  We were, rather, continually looking for an ideology, and I cannot assert that at that point in time we had a well-established ideology.  
Q.	To such an extent, Mr. Uwizeye, that your party was extremely divided and it split into factions.  
A.	What you should rather say is that, at a point in time, the party knew factions -- knew of factions.  
Q.	You are refusing to specify in what faction you were personally known to have been, what faction you were known to have joined.  
A.	It is -- it is not that I am refusing to tell you to what faction I belonged.  I did not join any faction.  When I observed that there were factions, and that there were people espousing the ideas of other persons, as far as I was concerned I did not espouse any particular ideology.  I continued to do my work as a préfet, and I waited for the problem faced by the party to be resolved.  But if you ask me what were my affiliations, I would say that I supported madam -- the prime minister.  And, as a préfet, I knew that I had to continue to work in concert with the prime minister.  
Q.	It has taken us seven or eight minutes for you to answer a question I asked specifically on this point seven or eight minutes ago.  You have difficulty specifying your ideological affinities, or affiliations.  It is because, at that time, you had more affiliations for the RPF.  
A.	Mr. Weyl, I would ask the Kinyarwanda interpreter to continue assisting me to answer in Kinyarwanda.  I could answer your questions in French, but that wouldn't be proper.  I haven't understood what the Kinyarwanda interpreter said.  The Kinyarwanda interpreter should explain what I say clearly to Defence counsel in order that I may use the adequate terminology before the Chamber.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, perhaps it should be explained -- it should explain to the witness that we cannot speak Kinyarwanda at the same time as him, when he speaks Kinyarwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the interpreters have asked me to explain to you that they cannot speak Kinyarwanda to you at the same time that you are speaking Kinyarwanda to them.  So there has to be a delay between the speech that you make and the response that you receive.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to say, quite simply, that I wasn't receiving the Kinyarwanda interpretation on the channel in order to follow the question of Mr. Weyl.  What I was hearing was the French.  I could not have answered the question in French -- I did not want to answer the question in French.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Perhaps someone should assist the witness to have him tuned to the right channel, that is, the Kinyarwanda channel, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the registrar will assist you to tune to the Kinyarwanda channel.  
THE WITNESS: 
I have changed to the right channel. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
I now understand correctly.  My headsets were not working properly.  I have changed, and I am now using another earphone (sic).  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Which channel are you listening in to now?  Are you listening to the Kinyarwanda channel or the French channel?  
THE WITNESS: 
I am now tuned to the Kinyarwanda channel, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Very well.  

Mr. Weyl, I think you can continue now.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I thank you.  I hope Mrs. N'gum will not take into account the three minutes of my time that have been spent on solving this technical problem.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I understand that you had problems specifying what your ideological affiliations in the MDR were.  Is it because already, at that time, you were more in support of the ideologies of the RPF?  
A.	No, that is not true.  What I supported was the programme that was important and necessary and which had been adopted by our party, the MDR, and which, according to the party, had to be implemented.  When factions were established in the MDR subsequently, or when certain individuals wanted to change the programme of the party, I did not support those individuals.  I supported members of the MDR who remained faithful to the MDR party and who wanted to support the implementation of the Arusha Peace Accords.  When factions came into being, some members of the party did not support that programme, some members of the faction did not support the accords, and I disagreed with members of those factions.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you can see that my question was deduced from your answer given to Mrs. Diagne on Monday morning.  In your answer you said, "I am a member of the RPF-Inkotanyi."  And she asked, "When did you join that political party?"  You answered that question by saying that, "I have been a member of that party for a very long time, since I heard of the existence of that party, and I had already endorsed the policy of that party.  Since then, I have been a member of that party."  You subsequently corrected your answer, but that was your initial answer.  

Do you know when the RPF was established?  
A.	Mr. Weyl, I do not know when the RPF was created.  I have told you that I joined the RPF once it was established in Rwanda.  It was only when it was established in Rwanda, when it came to Rwanda, that I started to read the manifesto of that party, and I told the Defence counsel that I joined that party in 2002.  And I believe my answer was clear.  I therefore did not join the RPF before its arrival in Rwanda.  Before it came to Rwanda I was a member of the MDR, and I supported the faction -- or, rather, the part of the MDR that supported the peace agreements, that is, the Arusha Peace Accords, between that party and other parties, which accords had condemned extremism in Rwanda.  I supported those peace accords, at least from the ideological standpoint.  That does not mean, however, that I was a member of the RPF.  
Q.	Do you mean that you had no contacts with the RPF in 1994?  
A.	No contacts.  
Q.	Neither did you have contacts during the events, or after the events?  
A.	No contacts either, even during the war.  
Q.	Nor did you have any contacts after the war?  
A.	During what period, Counsel?  
Q.	At the end of the war; after the 1994 war, in 1994.  
A.	In 1994, as I told you, I went back to Kigali and I immediately started working in the ministry of interior and communal development.  That was in late September.  You would therefore understand that, at the end of the war I contacted the RPF, given the fact that I joined the government headed by the RPF, and I became an executive officer in that government.  
Q.	Were you the one who contacted the RPF in September 1994?  
A.	No.  I spoke with Colonel Satre, a Frenchman, commanding officer of the French army in the turquoise zone in Kibuye, and I asked him to tell them that I was in Kibuye.  At the time I was in a camp that had been set up by UNAMIR.  And I spoke to Colonel Satre, who was the liaison person between myself and the RPF.  We went to meet them in the buffer zone, and there were other French soldiers and members of the RPF at that meeting between us.  And after that meeting, the RPF -- or, members of the RPF organised my return.  But that was done rather belatedly.  That was after the French left, that was when I returned.  There were no longer any Senegalese or Congolese forces or any other UNAMIR forces in the country.  
Q.	Are you therefore confirming that the events had not ended, that is, you had links with the RPF even before the events ended?  
A.	No, that is not true.  I spoke to the French after the war, at least what was referred to as the war, that is, the confrontations during which there was a crossfire between Defence forces.  There were still problems in the country.  People were trying to go back to their homes -- persons who had been displaced from their properties were trying to get back to their homes.  
Q.	We will come to that -- that, Mr. Uwizeye.  

I note that you remained a key player in the political and administrative life of Rwanda.  Are we agreed on that?  
A.	No, that is not true.  We can say that I was a leader at a higher level.  I don't know how you would call that.  At that time, I was a director, and I remain a director.  It is not a very high position in the administrative hierarchy, but you cannot consider that post to be a low-level post, nevertheless.  
Q.	Going by your statements, you are saying that you supported the minister, the prime minister, the president of the republic, and you were ready to support them.  You resisted the prime minister, the minister, and the president at the time.  You were someone who liked resisting.  You were insubordinate.  
A.	I was afraid.  As far as I was concerned there were certain acts that were positive, and I could not fail to support those actions.  Those actions supported certain persons who were -- like the préfet in my préfecture.  I could not have gone against those actions.  For instance, I could not support the killings.  I cannot accept that killing persons is a good thing.  Besides, if I had vehemently supported survivors, it's because I myself lost members of my family, so I decided to support survivors and to defend them.  
Q.	I really have no luck with my questions; I am trying to keep them so simple and yet I get such complicated answers.  Yet, in 1994 you did put up a resistance to the leaders.  Can you say today you are more docile, more obedient?  
A.	In 1994 I wanted and could resist negative acts when I could, for example, massacres of the population.  That's all.  Now you're telling me that I put up a resistance to the authorities.  I think you're exaggerating.  One could speak, rather, of resisting negative actions.  That I did, and I can confirm that.  
Q.	Be that as it may, today you're a civil servant respectful of the hierarchy; your minister trusts you and sends you on duties, missions, that require trustworthiness.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  My minister has trust in me, but he's not the only one among the political leaders to trust me.  The minister trusts me, but we have three ministers in our ministry, and all three ministers trust me.  That is true.  
Q.	In general, your administration, your superiors trust you, but it happens that you make mistakes.  Sometimes you get carried away.  You lose your cool, you do not fully respect to the oaths you have given, and then you make mistakes.  Can we say that?  
A.	What you're saying is baseless.  I might not agree on the way in which a file should be handled with the minister, and I can prepare a letter for the minister and ask him his signature for some administrative measure.  And if he doesn't agree, he sends the letter back to me with more precise instructions.  And then I rework my draft, or we discuss it.  It is I who prepares the minister's correspondence and ministerial decrees.  But we do all that in cooperation, and I have -- never have been in confrontation.  So you cannot say that I've failed my oath.  I have not yet been untrue to my oath; everything I does (sic) is within respect of that, and we understand each other well.  
Q.	The sort of faux pas I'm thinking of, Mr. Uwizeye, is to come here and testify before the ICTR in the Akayesu case in March 1998.  You can recall that episode in your life?  
A.	Why -- but why do you call that a faux pas?  I don't see any incompatibility between my testimony and my duties.  Moreover, I was called to testify in the Akayesu trial.  It is, moreover, a tribunal we trust -- not only Rwanda, but the world as a whole.  Therefore I came here as a Rwandan citizen whose duty is to come here when he is called.  So I do not see any incompatibility with my administrative duties.  I don't see what faux pas you're talking about when I came to testify in the Akayesu case.  Counsel Weyl, I do not understand you. 
Q.	Well, maybe that's a problem of translation.  However, I find myself perplexed by your response.  You maintain that it was at the Tribunal's request that you came to Arusha in March 1998?  
A.	Yes, I maintain and assert it was Arusha that called me; it wasn't the Rwandan government.  And, moreover, I am here today before you because I was called by the Arusha Tribunal.  I think we're not understanding each other, Counsel Weyl.  
Q.	You are an intelligent man, sir, and you can distinguish between Tribunal, Prosecution, and Defence.  You're not here today at the request of the Tribunal; you're here at the Prosecutor's request.  You said you understand it.  Do you still understand that?  
A.	Yes, it's perfectly clear.  And you just said so yourself, the Prosecutor explained to me why I'm here, the nature of my testimony.  He told me, "You have come here as a Prosecution witness."  As I did -- last did.  However, regarding the Akayesu case, the situation was not as clear as all that.  They were speaking of Arusha.  

And, Counsel Weyl, I'm giving you a lengthy answer because I feel it is necessary.  Personally at one point I asked the ICTR Deputy Prosecutor in Kigali, and even the state prosecutor in Rwanda, I asked them -- I told them I would not go anymore to Arusha if it wasn't made clear, if it wasn't stipulated in what context I was going, whether I was going as a Prosecution witness or a Defence witness.  And they've both agreed with me.  They said that it is true that witnesses had been called without it being made clear to them whether they were Prosecution or Defence witnesses.  And these days, nowadays when witnesses are called, it is made clear to them for whom they are testifying.  And in my case it was very clear.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, please be wary of lengthy answers that waste time and which give me additional material to work on.  You say that you wrote to the Deputy Prosecutor in Kigali and you wrote to the state prosecutor in Rwanda?  
A.	That is not what I said, Counsel Weyl.  I -- what I said is that I went in person to put the question orally.  I did not say that I wrote.  
Q.	Well, that is a rectification that is in accord with this morning's transcript, but not in accord with testimony you gave in Bizimungu.  But we'll come back to that.  You tell us today that you spoke to the Deputy Prosecutor in Kigali; there is no trace of that.  You say that you spoke to the Rwandan state prosecutor.  Was it to apologise for having broken the rules and gone to testify for the Defence in the defence of Akayesu?  
A.	What rule did I break in coming to testify in Akayesu's defence that would lead me, as you claim, Counsel Weyl, to go and make pardon?  
Q.	I will follow your reasoning, Mr. Uwizeye, for a minute.  Are you trying to tell me that you were not informed that you would be testifying in the defence of Mr. Akayesu, and had you been informed of that you would have refused to come to Arusha?  
A.	Counsel Weyl, that is not what I said, and I would like you not to interpret my intentions.  If I had been informed that I was coming as a Defence witness in the Akayesu case, I would have come, but at least I would have known why I was called.  What I didn't like was that I was called and came without knowing whether I was a Defence witness or a Prosecution witness, and after the trial there was a disagreement between me -- myself and Akayesu's lawyer, and I even threw back at him the documents he'd given me, which is when I wrote to the state prosecutor in Kigali -- I can't remember his name.  I think the counsel's name was (unintelligible).  

But in my letter to the state prosecutor I said that I was not satisfied with the treatment dispensed -- the way I was treated by Akayesu's Defence lawyer.  I was upset about that treatment and about how I was called because it was a rouse; I was tricked into coming.  And it was, moreover, criticised by people other than myself.  But I consider that today the situation has been corrected and I have no further concerns in that regard.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you maintain that when you testified in the Akayesu case you did not know that you were called by and for the Defence?  
A.	As to whether I was aware of I was -- that I was testifying in Akayesu's defence, well, I tell you that I learned that here.  Ten minutes before testifying the Defence counsel informed me thereof.  I met him and he clearly explained to me that I was here to testify for the Defence in Akayesu.  And, moreover, in my testimony I said everything I knew about Akayesu, whether it was positive or negative.  And I did speak of him in positive terms because I was a Defence lawyer.  But I mentioned everything I knew about him, because I knew him well.  I hadn't come here to lie; I spoke the truth.  I said about what I knew about Akayesu.  I told the truth about what I knew about him.  
Q.	So you came at Akayesu's request for Akayesu, and you told us just now that whatever you were told before coming to Arusha, you would, in any case, have given your testimony.  
A.	Yes, I would, and that's what I did.  If you look carefully at my testimony, I said things in his defence and other things that weren't in his defence.  In any case, I would have accepted to come, and I did come.  And it all went rather well, but I did not like the behaviour of Akayesu's advocate.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping)... repetitive now.  He's repeating the same thing over and over again.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, fully agreed.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So there was no reason to go and beg the pardon of the Rwandan state prosecutor.  
A.	Counsel Weyl, I don't know who's been talking to you and all this beg pardon business, if you're speaking of the Rwandan state prosecutor, or if you're speaking of the ICTR Deputy Prosecutor in Kigali.  When I went to see those people it wasn't to beg their pardon, it was to explain about the way things had gone, how I had arrived in Arusha.  I went to complain with a written document to protest against the -- Akayesu's lawyer's conduct, the way I was treated when I arrived here in Arusha.  And I think you'll find that document in the Tribunal's archives.  

I didn't go to beg anyone's pardon.  What did I do wrong that I would have to beg pardon for?  When one makes a mistake, one acknowledges one's mistake and begs for forgiveness.  But I committed no mistake in coming to testify in Akayesu's defence.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, that is no doubt not the attitude of the Rwandan authorities, because some days after you went to see the Rwandan state prosecutor you were arrested; is that correct?  
A.	That is not true.  I do not know what you're talking about.  That is not true.  You see -- you say you think.  But what is reality is something completely different.  
Q.	So then it is merely a coincidence that, on your return from Arusha at the beginning of the month of March, you're arrested on the 1st of May 1998? 
A.	I don't know what you're calling a coincidence.  I think I've already provided ample explanation of my understanding of why I was arrested in Kigali, and I know the file.  I had to sign it.  I don't know what you, Counsel Weyl, are calling a coincidence.  
Q.	There is a criminal file concerning you?  
A.	I have no criminal file because I was never arrested or imprisoned.  I was questioned, and I know on what -- for what -- about what I was questioned.  And when I was being questioned at the military camp, I signed those documents before leaving the military camp.  
Q.	Several documents together; that's a file.  You signed documents.  I suppose that those documents together constitute what I call a criminal file.  Do we agree?  
A.	Pardon me, but what I would call a criminal file would take you before a court, and on the basis of which you are tried.  As far as I'm concerned, I was detained in a military camp, I was questioned at night, and before leaving the military camp I signed those documents.  When I was being questioned I was asked, "Do you assert that you did not play a role in destabilising -- contribute to destabilising the country by assisting in infiltrations?"  And I did maintain that I had not, and that's when I signed the document.  It all took about three minutes.  

As regards a criminal file, that would mean a trial, that you've been charged.  There was no such trial at -- as far as I'm concerned, in my country, concerning, in any case, threats to national security, or anything else, for that matter.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, we know that you were not convicted, but there were documents drafted which you signed, and I'm convinced that those documents would interest us considerably in pursuing our investigations, and we shall, therefore, ask for them to be disclosed, or served on us, so that we have a full understanding of that phase of your life.  But you say that you were not detained; well, that's abbreviating things because you were detained for 21 months after May 1998.  Is that correct or not?  
A.	I never said that I wasn't detained, I said that I had never been tried and convicted.  No sentence was ever handed down.  As to being detained, anybody can be detained.  Even you yourself could be detained.  
Q.	By probity and democracy save me from that, Mr. Uwizeye.  But you, Mr. Uwizeye, you were detained for 21 months as of the 1st of May 1998, under conditions both difficult and exceptional.  
A.	Was that a question that I have to answer or is it an assertion?  Was that an assertion or a question you want me to comment upon?  
Q.	For the préfet to understand, I will say:  Do you confirm that you were detained for 21 months as of the 1st of May 1998, under conditions that were both difficult and exceptional, without a trial?  
A.	That's what happened.  I was detained for 21 months, or one year and nine months.  As to saying under difficult, exceptional conditions, well, excuse me, I have to make a comment.  

Sometimes you're detained in a lockup cell or in a prison.  When I was put in a cell, I was responding to a summons.  I was summoned, I went in response to the summons.  When I got there, I didn't find the intelligence officer, the G2, a major.  I didn't see him; I didn't find him there.  Moreover, I was in the company of my wife.  But before leaving, I was advised to wait.  After a few minutes, they told me, "Please, sir, go into the cell."  So I went into the cell and I spent three days there.  Then I was transferred to a military camp, where I spent 27 days -- no, rather, three months.  And when I came out of the military camp, I was questioned.  That is the document in question which I signed.  And then I was told to go home.  

But, before that, I was taken to Kigali state prosecutor to give me a document so I could go home, because I was working.  I was a civil servant.  But before going home, the prosecutor said to me, "But you were arrested by a very high authority and the charges are so serious that you should first go before the state constitutional court.  You would have to appear before you leave, because otherwise you'd be accused of bribing me."  And that's when I was taken to Kimironko prison, where I spent a year and six months.  But in the meantime nobody questioned me any further than that.  

So, later soldiers came and spoke to the prison director, told him that the prosecutor -- the state prosecutor, the public prosecutor had signed a letter asking for me to be released because the public prosecutor said that I had been falsely accused.  Of course I was pleased, because that meant that I was innocent.  Of course, it is a sad thing to have been unfairly detained for so long, but I was happy that, nonetheless, it was acknowledged that I was innocent and I was released.  I told you that in 1998 there was a serious problem of infiltrators who were shelling Kigali.  I think that the people in charge of security had a reason.  
Q.	Let me come back to the beginning.  You provided a detail which is very interesting, that you were put in a cell after you'd responded to a summons which you'd responded -- which you'd answered by coming with you and your wife.  Is that -- please answer in one word, yes or no.  
A.	Yes, I asked my wife to come with me.  I thought I was being summoned to provide explanations on my official functions.  I went in my car, moreover.  But the situation suddenly changed, which surprised me.  But I can tell you that today I have forgotten that misadventure, and that happens in administration of justice, that mistakes can be made.  
Q.	But, Mr. Uwizeye, you wouldn't forget what you told the Prosecutor on Thursday morning, when he questioned you on the circumstances of your arrest.  This is what you said:  "I was arrested at the time when I left the national stadium."  What was the real version?  
A.	Yes, I left the national stadium on the 1st of May, that was Labour Day.  I went to the stadium to participate in the festivities, and when I left the stadium I was given a convocation, a summons.  I found it at home.  So I went to the officer in charge of intelligence to find out why I had been summoned.  So I did not contradict myself.  Perhaps I did not give all the details, but that does not change anything in the information I had given earlier.  I went to the stadium like everyone else.  At the end of the ceremonies I went home and I found a summons.  I subsequently took the summons to go and find out what it was all about.  

I perhaps could add something if you wish.  I remember that that day was a Friday, but in the following week I had to go and teach -- I had to go and teach the sous-préfets.  I had to go and give them instructions on -- or, a course on the management of communal finances.  That seminar had to last a week.  So I had to find out what that summons was all about in order to go and conduct that seminar the week later.  I believe I dwelt on this matter in the Akayesu trial.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, are you aware that Amnesty International was rather stunned by your situation?  
A.	Yes, I am aware of that.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. Issa, can you show Mr. Uwizeye Exhibit 17, which is an excerpt of another exhibit I tendered?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, can you peruse that document?  

Mr. Uwizeye, have you read -- gone through that document?  
A.	Yes, I have perused it.  I believe I saw this document.  This is not the first time I am seeing it.  
Q.	This document faithfully relates the situation that you faced in 1998 after your release.  
A.	Yes, by and large.  It generally reflects what happened.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, may I request that this witness be -- this document, beg your pardon, be admitted?  I unfortunately do not remember the exhibit number which should give to it.  I believe it should be Exhibit 69, subject to his confirmation.  
MR. MJUI:  
Yes, Your Honour.  The document will be D. NG69.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, didn't you say it was part of an exhibit already exhibited in evidence?  
MR. WEYL: 
Not to my knowledge, but you know how fallible I am in this area, Mr. President.  In fact, it has an ID number, identification number 63, but which could be an identification number given by another Chamber, which would make it very confusing.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, thank you.  

Mr. Issa, the exhibit number is, then? 
MR. MJUI:
D. NG69, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG69 admitted) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, is it therefore correct to say that you were isolated for a very long time?  
A.	Yes, quite.  And that was at the military camp.  It was a lockup at the Presidential Guard camp.  I spent two months and 27 days there; almost three months, because I spent the other days in Remera, in the home of the intelligence officer, when I went to see the major, the gendarmerie major in charge.  Regarding the Presidential Guard camp, I spent two months and 27 days there.  That is why I say that, by and large, I spent three months in a lockup.  And you know that there aren't many people who can be locked up in a cell.  I was the only person.  
Q.	Is it correct that at times you heard many detainees screaming because they were being beaten up?  
A.	I believe that soldiers were detained not far from where I was detained, because while -- while they were being interrogated, I could hear them being interrogated.  They were being beaten up because they were undisciplined.  But they were not with me, they were in another building.  They were in other premises.  At night I would hear them scream, but I do not have any further details to provide on that, because I did not know those soldiers.  It was while they were being interrogated, while they were being asked whether -- or, why they had gone to a bar, bought drinks, and yet not paid for them.  They were also asked why they had deserted. 
Q.	Is it correct to say that you were given a bag to carry on your head as you left your cell -- your cell?  
A.	Yes, a bag was put in -- or, a bag was put on my face so that I wouldn't see.  It wasn't a big bag; it was some kind of bag that was put over my eyes in order that I wouldn't recognise where I'd been detained.  
Q.	Is it correct to say that after the treatment you received you had difficulty walking, that your health status was bad because you hadn't been fed properly, and you hadn't -- there wasn't sufficient light in your cell -- your cell was insufficiently lit?  
A.	That is not true.  I do admit that I was weak.  I ate once a day; I didn't do any exercise.  I spent the whole day indoors, inside the cell.  But I wasn't eating well, I wasn't eating as well as I ate in my home.  It is true that I was rather lean when I came out of the cell.  
Q.	According to Amnesty International, whose information is by and large accurate, you -- you've confirmed the information one piece after the other.  After your detention you do admit having testified in the Akayesu case.  Is that the only inaccuracy?  
A.	That is not true.  Among the questions put to me -- you see, at times you are questioned orally, but there are other times when you are asked to write down your answer.  I believe that I said this, Mr. Weyl; you are asking me to repeat the same thing.  I do not know why.  But I told you that when I went to the home of the major in charge of intelligence, he finally arrived and we introduced ourselves to one another.  He asked me who I was, where I was working, he asked me whether I'd been imprisoned before, and whether I had appeared before any court, and I told him that I had come to Arusha.  But regarding the substantive interrogation in which you are asked to write things down when you are informed of the charges against you and on which document I had to sign, that interrogation took place.  But in that written document, it was never mentioned that I had appeared before the court in -- or, the Tribunal in Arusha.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, it is evident that they would at least have left a trace of what you wrote.  
A.	Why do you say that?  If you said in that document there were charges against me, why wouldn't they have mentioned it? 
Q.	What I'm saying is that you were criticised for that.  I am not saying that it was mentioned that you were officially charged with certain offences in an official document, a copy of which, of course -- a copy of which we will of course request.  
A.	Where did you get that information then?  If you testify before a court, is that an offence that can result in your imprisonment?  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you should take note of this information regarding the alert made by Amnesty International in your regard, and we -- we've understood that it was extremely well investigated and documented.  That is my source of information.  

Mr. Uwizeye, can we consider that after your misadventure, or misfortunes, you were rather reluctant to testify before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda here in Arusha?  
A.	No.  You are trying to establish a link between the questions I put to the Deputy Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha and the concerns I expressed to the state prosecutor in Rwanda.  You are trying to establish a link between the two things and my testimony in the Akayesu trial.  And that link does not hold -- it does not hold any water.  You are on a fishing expedition looking for information.  My testimony in the Akayesu trial had nothing to do with my imprisonment.  Let me tell you that I was not satisfied with the procedure followed before I came to testify before the Arusha Tribunal.  I therefore request you to refrain from establishing links that do not hold regarding all what happened. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, is it because you were not authorised by your government that you refused to testify in the Ndindabahizi trial?  
A.	If I did not appear as a witness in the Ndindabahizi trial, it is because I was not called as a witness.  Perhaps you do not know under what circumstances witnesses are called to testify before this Court.  I would be surprised if that were the case.  Let me inform you that I was not called to testify as a witness in the Ndindabahizi trial.  However, some people came to Kigali -- I do not remember who exactly they were, but they were ICTR officials, and they told me that I may be called to appear as a witness in the Ndindabahizi trial.  If they had wanted me to testify in that trial, I would have appeared to testify.  Besides, that would have been easy for me because my testimony would not have been very long with regard to Ndindabahizi.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, did counsel for Ndindabahizi ask you to testify in the trial?  
A.	Counsel Weyl, I have just answered that question.  I said that no one called me officially to testify.  There is an official procedure whereby witnesses are called to testify before a tribunal, and that is done transparently.  Ask the Prosecutor here present, ask him how he called me to testify.  He contacted the state prosecutor for Rwanda.  I received a phone call, and I was asked to travel to Rwanda -- to Arusha.  This is an official procedure.  If such a procedure had been followed by the other person, I would have accepted.  I am a Rwandan, and I have explained at length that it is my duty as a Rwandan to assist this Tribunal and to assist Rwanda in these proceedings.  And I do not see why I would refuse to appear.  

If the Tribunal, or the competent authorities called me to appear -- I therefore request you, Counsel Weyl, to unconditionally accept that if I had been requested to appear in the Ndindabahizi trial in accordance with the normal procedure, I would have come.  The more so as I really like -- or, love Ndindabahizi.  I love him because I housed his wife and children, and he, in turn, assisted my children to escape.  Furthermore, he gave me some advice.  He told me, "Be careful, you are going to be dismissed from your position."  He is the only minister who tipped me off, telling me, "Be careful, do not continue to move about on the streets as you wish, because you could be killed because you are considered as an accomplice."  We are now before a tribunal, and I say this in his interests.  If I had been asked to come and testify in his defence, I would have been very willing to come and testify in this case.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, my colleague, Pirard, P-I-R-A-R-D, a lawyer at Verviers, V-E-R-V-I-E-R-S, he wrote to you in August 2001 requesting you to make a statement regarding the period when you were in contact Mr. Ndindabahizi.  Did he do that; yes or no?  
A.	Mr. Weyl, I haven't quite understood the name of the person you say wrote a letter concerning me.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. Issa, please show Mr. Uwizeye Exhibit 20A in my bundle of exhibits.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, do you have the document, this letter, before you?  
A.	Allow me to peruse it, Counsel, because I note that I am not aware of this document.  Give me time to read it.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, perhaps it would be proper for Mr. Uwizeye to read it during the break.  But he could quite simply answer my question after having refreshed his memory, and tell me whether he knows this letter or not.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl, we can take the luncheon break now, and you can come back to this after -- after the adjournment, after we resume this afternoon.  

We will take the luncheon adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, you may read the letter during the lunch break.  
(Court recessed at 1231H) 
(Pages 14 to 29 by Kirstin McLean)








(Court resumed at 1420H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, good afternoon, Mr. President.  If I could just take a moment to make a request; and that is, that after discussions with Mr. Webster, we feel that we're in need of a decision from the Trial Chamber regarding the next trial session.  I've asked him to provide to me the list of witnesses by Monday so that I could get my materials ready, and discuss with Mr. Nzirorera before we leave at the end of the session.  And because there is still uncertainty as to the length of the session, Mr. Webster doesn't seem to be in a position to be -- giving me very accurate information, which I don't blame him for. 

And, also, I would -- there seems to be some uncertainty as to whether the Trial Chamber will require the Prosecution to rest its case; which, obviously, would have some impact on his selection of witnesses.  

So I'm putting it to you that the ball is in your court, and we need a decision on those matters so that we can organise ourselves before we leave Arusha.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, I would actually join in that application.  We did discuss it.  Actually, this was not the first conversation, in fact.  We've discussed it a couple of times.  And there was some e-mail correspondence that was copied to the Trial Chamber coordinator and the other Defence teams.  

I would extend his application a bit, though, because my concern is not simply for this trial session, but for the next.  And I think to plan adequately, it would be helpful to have some indication, even if it's tentative, of what the session would look like in January or February of 2008.  So, if we could have a definitive sense of when we start and end in 2007, and some preliminary indications of what the first session in 2008 would look like.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We will address this quickly.  We'll let you know.  We probably may have an informal status conference.  If this witness finishes in time, we'll do it on Friday.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I take it the Court is expecting this witness to testify all the way into Friday?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Because as long as we're on that note, I was, actually, anticipating that we would finish with this witness by tomorrow afternoon so that we could hear another witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
On Friday morning?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
-- on Friday afternoon -- or Friday morning.  We have a short witness, GAY, who's the next witness; and then another witness, KGV.  And I was hoping that we would make arrangements so that we hear both of them by the end of this session, and I don't think we will be able to complete KGV unless we complete GAY by Tuesday -- or by Monday at the latest.  So it's my hope that we at least take GAY's direct examination by Friday.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you.  Yes.  

Mr. Weyl, you can -- 

Madam registrar, do you have an update on the time that you've -- 
MS. N'GUM:  
No, Your Lordship, I had not calculated it yet.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl smiles.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, a sigh -- a smile of relief, you know, because I was expecting that I would have some other sledgehammer.  But for once, Mrs. N'Gum spared me that.  

Mr. President, with your leave.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, did you take advantage of the luncheon break to refresh your recollection concerning the document which I gave to you earlier on?  
A.	Yes, Counsel Weyl. 
Q.	Was it, indeed, a letter which you received from the attorney of Mr. Ndindabahizi?  
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	Did that letter actually comprise a request as follows:  "We pray you to give a detailed statement on that period, and also let us know what you know -- or what you are able to know at the time when you were in contact with Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi."  Is that correct?  
A.	From what I notice in the letter, I was requested to reply in writing.  And they also requested information regarding what I knew concerning the issue raised in the letter, and also, if necessary, to add any other information at my disposal.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you did reply to that letter, didn't you? 
A.	I believe I did reply to the letter, even though it was all a long time ago.  But I believe I, indeed, replied to the letter. 
Q.	Were Mr. Issa to give you a copy of that letter, I believe that would be of assistance to you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Issa, kindly give the witness the document number 21A, which is one of the documents in our list of materials.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do you have that document, sir? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Are you familiar with that document? 
A.	Yes.  I wrote it.  
Q.	Your reply was that it would be necessary for in-depth discussions to take place, correct? 
A.	Correct.  That features on paragraph one; I invited the person concerned to come and see me so that we could have in-depth discussions.  
Q.	But you further added that, at any rate, it was impossible for a chap called an Icyitso, or "traitor of the nation", like you, to know much about the conduct of people of Mr. Ndindabahizi's standing.  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is what I said in my letter.  
Q.	And you did not give any written statement concerning the events which occurred, and during which you interacted with Mr. Ndindabahizi?  Are we in agreement on that? 
A.	Well, just because a person did not come to see me.  A statement is given in the form of answers to questions, so you can give a statement either accusing someone or clearing someone, and at the end of it you will sign the statement.  That is the reason why I asked the gentleman to come and see me so that we could discuss, and then I would give him a statement.  I could not respond in the form of a letter.  So I think the problem was at the level of the modalities.  But as you can observe for yourself, in my letter I did not turn down the offer to discuss with that person.  Rather, the person had to come and contact me officially so that my statement would be recorded.  I did not want to engage in exchange of letters with that person.  

Concerning the other cases, I never went about it by exchange of letters.  I always gave statements in the form of answers to questions put to me.  And at the end, I will sign my statement, recorded and translated in other languages.  Now, if that person had come to see me, I don't think that there would have been any issue whatsoever.  I think I could even have given him a statement concerning what I knew regarding Mr. Ndindabahizi. 
Q.	Would you have dared to request the authorisation of the Rwandan government to go and testify in the defence of Mr. Ndindabahizi?  
A.	Why do you think I would have dared?  Do you think I was scared?  Well, that may be your construction.  But do you think I come here to do, what?  I am present in this court to say the truth regarding the doings of various people.  And it is on the initiative of the person representing the interest, either of the Accused, or it is on the initiative of the Prosecutor.  I think it is my duty, so I am not scared to come and testify for the Defence or for the Prosecution. 

Now, if the steps taken concerning Mr. Ndindabahizi were not successful, it was on account of a problem of modality, it was not because I turned down the request. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, sir, Mr. Ngirumpatse, who is listening to the French and Kinyarwanda channels simultaneously makes me understand that there may be a misunderstanding, between us and the witness.  Sometimes there are translation nuances which are added by the interpreters and which may water down our dialogue.  The witness answered that he was not scared.  The word "scared" I did not hear.  I asked him if he dared.  And, apparently, the interpreter -- got to him was the word "scared".  That is why he responded saying that he was not scared.  

So I am praying the booth to be as accurate as possible in the interpretation.  I know it is difficult.  But in order for us to do our work in the best possible way, please, please try not to add things which will mischaracterise my question.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, I have understood your answer.  When you came to Arusha to testify in this trial, did you need to ask for permission, or did you need to be authorised to do so by your superiors?  
A.	I sought no such authorisation.  But the Prosecutor, who wanted to call me, did inform the public prosecutor, state prosecutor.  And after having been informed, they called me and asked me if I was ready to go to Arusha -- or available to go to Arusha, according to the nuance.  I said that I'd already been contacted by the Prosecutor, and I saw no difficulty therein.  So it is the Prosecutor who started the proceedings with regard to my appearance here.  But I didn't need to ask permission.  Arrangements are made as a preliminary.  And the party calling the witness, whether it be the Defence or the Prosecutor, contacts the witness first, and then it is up to that party to undertake the necessary démarches with the authorities.  But the state has no role to play in those démarches as such.  The government is informed by the party wishing to call the witness of their wish to do so.  
Q.	Do you mean that every Rwandan, even if free, at liberty -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is not very clear.  Could Counsel repeat that?  Sorry.  We did not get the question.  Anyhow, witness is answering.  

THE WITNESS:
That's not what I said . 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, the translators did not get your question, and they wish you to it.  

I'm wondering if you haven't already exhausted this topic.  
MR. WEYL: 
I will repeat my question, because I don't think this has been touched upon. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, are you telling us that a Rwandan who is free -- presumably that means at liberty -- when he comes to testify before the Tribunal, only does so after an exchange between the Prosecutor -- the Tribunal Prosecutor and the state prosecutor in Rwanda? 
A.	I don't know about that.  But for myself, every time -- each time I've testified, that was the procedure.  The Prosecutor contacted me first.  When I indicated my agreement, my travel was organised.  But as to my superiors in the ministry, or the minister himself, that is no problem; because before travelling, I informed -- I informed the minister verbally and told him that I had to testify here.  And he told me that was part of my work, part of my duties.  And I had to inform him because I was due to participate in the parliamentary proceedings.  Were I on leave, I could have travelled without having to inform the minister beforehand. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, the same thing occurred when you came to testify in the Bizimungu trial? 
A.	That is a custom.  It is customary.  The person most particularly concerned is the person calling you, whether it be the OTP or the Defence.  It is that person that plays a determinant role.  It is that person who must contact the authorities.  The only thing I need to be sure of is that I've had contact with that person beforehand, and given a statement, and I know in what context I'm testifying.  But in the Ndindabahizi case, there was a problem of procedure.  I had made no statement for the party -- to the party that wished to call me as a witness.  Moreover, I needed a ticket.  You must understand that all that is done by the party calling the witness, in cooperation with the ICTR office in Kigali.  And to date, that is the way things are done. 
Q.	My question was different.  I was asking you, is that the way things went when the question arose of your coming to testify in the Bizimungu trial? 
A.	I think it was the same procedure.  They sent me my ticket, they came to pick me up at home, I think that's how it went -- things went. 
Q.	And your country's leaders asked you to come and testify in Bizimungu?  
A.	I don't know whether it's your question that is badly put, or whether maybe the interpreters have misinterpreted you.  Are you asking me whether my country's leaders authorised me to come and testify in Bizimungu?  I think you haven't been understanding from the start.  I told you that my hierarchal superiors, in the instance, my minister --  before I testified in Bizimungu, I informed the minister that I had to come to Arusha at a given date.  And before testifying in the present case, I also told him I had to come.  And he said -- he gave me his -- the permission, told me it was part of my duties, and I was allowed to absence myself.  What is surprising about that?  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, I have before me the transcript of 12 December 2005, page 68 of the French, line 8 to 20.  What you state there is somewhat different.  You say that after the Akayesu trial, you returned to Rwanda; that you drafted an official letter, and that you sent that letter -- I had this in mind somewhere -- and you sent it to the deputy prosecutor then in Kigali.  I'm going on to line 17.  "This time I knew why I was coming, but the first time I was dragged into a trial for which I was not prepared.  I was misled, and that is why several times I received invitations from the Tribunal to come and testify, but did not want to come."  

And you go on by saying that, "I was authorised by my leaders" -- you don't say that.  You say, "Even Rwandan leaders took part, and it was they who led me to accept to come here."  

That's a bit more than an authorisation, is it not, Mr. Uwizeye?  
A.	What do you think that means, (French spoken).  It's a question of style, as you'd say in French, but doesn't change anything to do with the essentials.  You say I was invited by the Tribunal in Arusha on several occasions and I refused to testify, but this time I accepted.  The Tribunal invited me, called me, and I responded.  What remained was to inform my superiors, and I did so.  When you say that the hierarchal superiors made a contribution, it means they authorised.  I don't see how you interpret that.  What it means is that they signify their agreement.  I don't know if you can interpret that any other way.  
Q.	Is it nonetheless --
A.	Counsel Weyl, I should like to add something, if you would allow me to do so. 
Q.	If it is relevant, please do so.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I should like to add to that.  If you put the question to the present 
	Prosecutor -- the Prosecutor in the present trial -- he will confirm to you that I did not immediately respond.  I consistently asked him to postpone my testimony, because I was not free, having work in Rwanda.  We were preparing the law governing mines and quarries in Rwanda, mining and quarrying in Rwanda; and under such conditions I had no window of opportunity to appear to testify.  And I informed the Prosecutor, if you were to come and see me when I was on the point of leaving for India, as happened last year, I was leading a project for prospecting for precious stones and hydrocarbons in Rwanda, and there was an invitation to India.  And I informed the Prosecutor, and we waited a further window of opportunity. 
Q.	I regret having given you the green light, because your answer is not pertinent in respect of the question I put.  So as not to lose any more time, one more question regarding these problems.  

Was there, or was there not, an official letter to the Prosecutor when you returned to Rwanda after the Akayesu trial?  
A.	I do not remember such a letter, Counsel Weyl.  Perhaps you'd like to refresh my memory.  That might be a good thing.  
Q.	No, because you make a perfect connection with the following question.  You see, I have a concern.  You are a witness the Defence must be wary of.  When you answer a question, either you make (sic) things that cannot be counterchecked, or you say "I don't remember."  Do you know how many times you've said "I don't remember" since we began questioning you in answer to specific questions?  
A.	Unfortunately, my answer will be the same.  I don't remember.  I don't remember how many times, but I've given it many -- even if I have given it many times, you're asking -- putting questions to me on dates and years.  All I would ask you to do, Counsel, is to believe in my good faith.  I am ready to tell you the truth.  I am not trying to elude the questions you put to me. 
Q.	So, according to the time you remember having sent a letter, you deny having sent a letter, or you no longer know whether you did, and ask me to come to your assistance and refresh your memory.  That's it, isn't it? 
A.	All I know is that if you would -- could show me the letter, it would help me to refresh my memory.  But if you put me the question off-the-cuff like that, do I remember this or that, anyone would be faced with the same problem as that I have now.  But, please, believe me if I say it is not out of bad faith on my part.  I'm not trying to avoid your questions; we're not playing hide and seek. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, for very precise facts, events, circumscribed and specific, the 
	7th, 8th, the 9th, the 10th or the 11th is immaterial to you?  There's no difference?  
A.	Dates can change, if you insist on dates, but they lose their value in the face of events spoken of at the time in question, important events, one cannot -- events -- cannot forget.  What I can confirm to you is one does not forget the events. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you, who had to answer accusations for the 21 months that you were detained, know that if one has to defend one's self against an event that occurred on the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th or 11th, it is not the same thing.  Do we agree?  
A.	I did not understand your question, Counsel.  I did not fully grasp the first part of your question, Counsel. 
Q.	My question was, to defend against specific accusations, you will admit that it is important to know whether one is defending against things -- events occurring on the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, or 11th.  Do we agree?  
A.	In that question that you have repeated, I did not hear anywhere what you said the first time when you were alluding to my -- when I was detained for 21 months.  I presume you have changed your question.  
Q.	Answer the first or the second.  You understood both the first and the second.  
A.	But, Counsel, how can I ask you to repeat your question if I understood it?  Do you think I'm here to indulge in polemics?  I don't think you are treating me properly, Counsel.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, Your Honours, I don't understand the question myself, so perhaps Mr. Weyl can rephrase it.  He said the 7th -- what I hear in English is a reference to the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th.  I'm assuming he's talking about the month of April, but nothing we've said in the last 20 minutes has concerned that first part of April.  So the question is confusing to me.  Perhaps if Mr. Weyl could rephrase it, then we'd all move ahead more expeditiously.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'm merely noting that if I rephrase it, the witness will then again say, "But you did not rephrase it quite as the first or the second time."  So I phrased it once.  I was told, "I did not understand it."  I rephrased it a second time, I was told it was not the same as the first time.  And I will rephrase it a third time.  And how -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm wondering something else.  Is this important?  Are we wasting time at this stage?  
MR. WEYL: 
I did not want to lose any time, as it is being measured out, as you know.  I will go on to the next question.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, do you have problem situating yourself in time?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, come on, please.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I was asking the witness if he had problems situating himself in time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping) ... times already.  He's said that several times already.
MR. WEYL: 
But I haven't had my answer, Mr. President.  I did not get an answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT.  
(Microphones overlapping) ... you several times before.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you testified in Bizimungu last year, is that correct?  
A.	Yes, Counsel Weyl. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, we are in 2007, you testified in Bizimungu in 2005, that was two years ago.  Have you difficulties in situating yourself in time? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What are we doing now, Mr. Weyl?  The witness has said on several occasions that he does not have a good memory for dates.  Why do you waste time asking him the same question in different ways?  

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, have you ever -- or never, according to the nuance -- been suspected of participating in the genocide? 
A.	Never.  Never. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, have you ever been on a list of people having taken part in the genocide, or the massacres? 
A.	No. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. Issa, could you please show Mr. Uwizeye item 15 in my bundle?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, do you have that document before you?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, the document has been given to me. 
Q.	Is it, indeed, a list of people likely to have been involved in the genocide? 
A.	Just give me time to peruse the document.  From what I can see, it's a list, and the title is "List of people".  Well, I can see a list, as you're saying.  I see a list. 
Q.	Can you read the first three lines on the top of the first page?  It is in English.  Do you read English?  
A.	But it is clearly stated; it is a list of people suspected of having participated in the genocide.  It is a list, but this is not an official document because I don't see anything official on the document.  And as you say, it is a list; you must have gotten it from somewhere.  But even though it is a list, I cannot make any comment about it.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, I'm not asking you to make any comment.  It is a list which is part of Prosecution disclosures, as evidenced by the K number, K0003383 to 3392.  It is a list drawn up by RPF.  Kindly turn to page 8 and tell me the name which is against number 168.  
A.	Against number 168 is written "Uwizeye, Fidèle".  And then "Now prefect, Gitarama".  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I move to tender this document, D. NG70. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, we'd object to that.  There's no foundation for this document, we don't know where it came from, what it stands for.  Yes, it bears a K number, but so do thousands of other documents that we've disclosed and that we've used ourselves.  The fact that it was entered into the OTP database does not vouch for its reliability.  

The Court does not know what this is.  When I look at the document, the first thing that strikes me is that when you get to number 74 and number 76, we have the names of two dead people on the document.  We've already had testimony in this trial that Godfroide Ruzindana was one of the first victims of the genocide.  He, here, is listed as one of the perpetrators.  I believe there was testimony elicited from the Defence that Joseph Habiyambere --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if counsel could speak slowly, please.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry.  I have seen this document before, but this Court has no foundation to appreciate the contents of this document.  The way it has been placed before this witness makes it inherently unreliable.  If we had some context for the document, then perhaps it would assist us, but we have none.  All we have is a typewritten list of the names of authorities.  And the first thing that strikes me when I look at it is when you get to number 74 and 76 we have the names of persons who were killed and were victims of the conflict from its first days.  So it's clear from the document itself that it's simply a list of authorities; it's not the result of any sort of investigation. 

So I would oppose its admission.  If Mr. Weyl has a way of putting this document into context, telling us how the names were generated, where it comes from, then perhaps it would assist us.  But at this stage it does not, so I would oppose its admission.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I must say I am surprised when my learned friend says that they disclosed documents which are not reliable.  This is a document which, if admitted, will have the value which the Trial Chamber will assess as being an evident -- or the value.  And it has a list of names of people known as perpetrators of the genocide.  The witness has identified his name in that list.  I think the Trial Chamber has all the necessary elements to admit the document in to evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, is it possible to get some information from the witness concerning what the document is?  Could you put some evidence as to what the document is?  We just know it's a list of names.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, as I had asked you early on, can you tell me what is featuring on the first three lines of the first page, starting with "The list of people"?  By the way, I believe that you have already mentioned it, and that it pointed to the type of document it was.  Can you repeat that for us?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  As you just heard, it is a list of people.  The heading of the document is "List of people suspected of genocide".  But I must say that this is not an official document.  We don't know when the document was drawn up.  And as far as I'm concerned -- I can see my name on the list.  But against my name is written "Fidèle Uwizeye, now prefect of Gitarama".  

Even if it were a list prepared by the RPF, then it was not a list drawn up on the strength of any investigation.  Probably it was a list drawn up at the time when I was still préfet before the RPF took over power.  Perhaps it is a list of people, state functionaries, or others living in the country.  But there are official lists signed by the public prosecutors, and which featured in the official gazette of the Rwandan republic.  And on that official list gazetted officially in the Rwandan republic, my name does not feature.  

So as Prosecution counsel just said, I cannot lend any credence to such a document.  No one even knows the source thereof.  In my country, official documents will be published in the official gazette of the Rwandan republic.  As I am telling you, there are other lists which were officially gazetted in the Rwanda republic, and my name does not feature on those lists.  So perhaps this was some rough work, or perhaps there were some people still conducting their investigations, or yet someone who for unknown reasons decided to insert such a list in my file.  

That is all what I can say, Mr. Weyl. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, has someone ever showed this document to you before today?  
A.	That is possible.  It is possible in some of the other trials here, but that does not take anything out of what I just said to the effect that there are official lists.  I have copies of them in my house.  I even have copies of the official gazette at my home.  I just told you against which backdrop this list may have been drawn up, and I just made comments about that.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, were you shown this document when you testified in the Bizimungu trial? 
A.	Mr. Weyl, that is possible.  I don't remember very well. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I move to tender this document into evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, my suggestion is that it simply be marked for identification.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, President, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The evidence has been given about the source of the document.  We will mark it for identification.  
MR. MJUI: 
The exhibit will be ID. NG2.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Marked for identification. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NG2, marked for identification)
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, do you know whether you were recently accused at a trial in Rwanda? 
A.	No.  I am unaware of that. 
Q.	Were you aware of a programme of the Voice of America dated 15th of July -- correction -- 15th of June 2007 dealing with the trial of Marie Mukamurenzi in the Gacaca trial in Gahogo in Rwanda?  
A.	Marie Mukamurenzi?  I don't remember that lady.  But -- wait a moment.  There is something I have to add.  
Q.	Do you want us to play the broadcast of the Voice of America programme in which you are accused? 
A.	No.  I am trying to complete the answer I just gave you.  I haven't landed yet.  I just said that I did not remember that lady.  But I also said that I had a comment to add concerning that I was accused over the radio.  With your leave, I would like to make a comment.
Q.	So, Mr. Uwizeye, you personally, and by name, was accused in a radio broadcast on the 
	15th of June 2007.  Do you confirm that?  
A.	What I know is that my name was mentioned over the radio, and I would like to tell you what they talked about during that programme.  In a trial which took place in a place called Gahogo in Rwanda, I would like to tell you what I heard being said about me.  
Q.	Carry on, sir.  Carry on.  
A.	What they said was in connection with the death of one Louis.  I know Louis.  We know each other.  It is said that Louis went to see Préfet Fidèle Uwizeye to explain to him his problems, that he was being threatened by people, and that Fidèle did nothing to assist him.  And it was said that he left Fidèle's home, and on his way, not far from Electrogaz he was killed.  But it was never said that he had been killed by the préfet, or that the préfet had played any role.  The radio never mentioned that the préfet had killed him or had played any role in his murder.  I believe I heard this in a radio programme, but I cannot remember whether it was the Voice of America. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, what the journalist said was that "After the murder of Dusenge Marie Josée, her husband, Rutahunga, Louis, left his hiding place to go and plead with Fidèle Uwizeye, who was the préfet of Gitarama, and seek his assistance.  Préfet Uwizeye did nothing for him.  On his way back, Louis Rutahunga was killed when stones were lobbed at him.  He was murdered."  

So we are, more or less, in agreement.  And when I asked you whether you were closely or distantly involved in such activities, your name is mentioned as someone who did nothing to rescue Louis Rutahunga.  
A.	No one accused me in that matter.  People narrated the chain of events.  But if people had come to seek information from me, I would have availed them with the information, because I have information about that.  That lady, when she came to my home, she was coming to seek advice from me.  Actually, she was looking for Sous-Préfet Gasana, but when she did not find him there she came to my home and we had a conversation.  Actually, members of the PL party had concerns.  And they said that since Mugenzi was within the vicinity, perhaps they could be harmed.  Such were their concerns.  

So, that lady came to my home -- or, rather, it was Louis who came to my home as a friend, and I even saw him off right up to the Mbonyumutwa stadium on foot.  And I advised him to go to Kabgayi.  By the way, I advised many people to go to Kabgayi, and they survived.  So when you told me I played a role, either closely or in a remote manner, in the death of those people, if such were the case then I would have been summoned by the Gacaca courts to come and answer such charges.  No one accused me.  That lady never accused me, she simply gave an account of how things happened.  That does not mean that I did not assist her.  I know I assisted her, even though by some unfortunate happenstance, he was killed. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, to abide by the normal formalities in tendering of documents, I would like that the document, which is the Kinyarwanda transmission, which is document number 18 on our list of materials, be shown to Mr. Uwizeye so that he can confirm what he just said; and that the transcript be admitted into evidence, both the Kinyarwanda version, and our translation, which is number 18F. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could Mr. Weyl also indicate how we got this transcription?  Is the transcription from the Defence or from another source?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, this transcription comes from the Defence.  It was not at all easy for us to get it.  But earlier on, we just got the CD-ROM recording of the radio broadcast.  And I would propose to the witness to listen to it so that he can refresh his recollection.  But, finally, it turned out to be an exercise in futility because he remembered.  So we intend to tender the audio recording of the radio broadcast, the transcription, which we carried out in Kinyarwanda, as well as the French translation thereof. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. Weyl, from what I can see, your document is in French, whereas that radio broadcast was in Kinyarwanda.  For instance, I see the word "plead".  What does that mean?  Firstly, it is a verb without a compliment. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye -- Mr. Uwizeye -- Mr. Uwizeye -- (Microphones overlapping)
A.	It is said that he pleaded with Fidèle.
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, please, let's not waste time.  I will ask Mr. Issa to give you --
A.	I don't have any issue, Mr. Weyl, no problem at all.  But it will be necessary for you to tender as evidence the Kinyarwanda document so that we may not have to deal with any poor translation given, that the document is in Kinyarwanda.  
Q.	We are in agreement, Mr. Uwizeye.  I was asking Mr. Issa to provide you with the Kinyarwanda version of the document.  It is just by mistake that you got the French version.  Our intention was for you to receive the Kinyarwanda version, or a transcription.  That's why I was trying to interrupt you, that way we won't have to waste time.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, ordinarily I'd object to the admission of this document because it has absolutely no probative value.  But given the amount of time we've spent on it, what I would request is that the Chamber order an English translation of this, and that it read it for itself, because this is not something we would wish to revisit in redirect.  But, clearly, when the entire text is read, it becomes abundantly obvious that this is simply a newspaper report where a brief reference is made to the préfet, Fidèle Uwizeye.  It concerns a criminal case against a woman who is charged with killing the wife of the person mentioned in relation to Uwizeye; and this is simply to complete a narrative and a journalistic rendition of someone else's trial.  So the only way this can become comprehensible to the Court is if the whole thing is translated into English, and the Court can appreciate its contents in relation to what the witness said.  But this has absolutely no probative value.  I don't know why Mr. Weyl has spent so much time on it.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I think there's never been any misunderstanding as regard to the -- what -- the nature of the document.  But Mr. Uwizeye has confirmed the main parameters, as I stated them.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel Weyl, but I think there was a misunderstanding between us.  When you compare a sentence in Kinyarwanda, this document, with the French translation, I don't think it's the same thing.  I speak both French and Kinyarwanda.  And what's more, I heard this over the radio, even if I forgot that it was the Voice of America.  And I should like to say that it's hardly surprising, because at our Gacaca court hearings, people come and speak of everything they remember.  I never said that Louis never came to me.  He was my friend.  He said -- he was killed after leaving my house.  Nobody accused me of having killed Louis or getting him killed.  I would have immediately been arrested.  And moreover, in the Kinyarwanda, it says "Préfet -- Préfet Uwizeye did nothing to help him".  Well, there is nuance here.  When it says, "It is said that", that's not in the French.  In the French it is more affirmative.  In the Kinyarwanda it says, "It is thought that Fidèle did not help him".  That is something very different.  Moreover, there's this word (French spoken) to plead, to beg.  He didn't come to plead with me; he came to ask me where Gasana, the sous-préfet, was, and telling me of his concerns because Mugenzi was in the vicinity.  That's why I advised him to go to Kabgayi.  In fact, the sous-préfet, Gasana, had also fled to Kabgayi, which is why I advised him to go to Kabgayi.  I shared a drink with him, and I accompanied him.  I didn't even know that he'd been killed.  I learned it -- I learned of it with this rebroadcast from the Voice of America.  

Thank you for showing me this document, but I don't think we should dwell on it excessively.  The Defence must trust me, after all, since I'm speaking the truth.  
(Pages 30 to 43 by Vicki Eastvold)







1530H 
MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Mr. President, I think the time of the recess is approaching, but you will accept to my suggestion to tender the audio recording.  And if the Prosecutor agrees to the transcription and the translation, I see no difficulty in having this broadcast mentioning the - the mention of Mr. Uwizeye in this broadcast as having not given assistance and not rendering assistance -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
	I am sorry, Mr. President, the correct legal expression has escaped me. 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	-- and not rendering assistance in a time of need as it stands.  
	
	Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, Mr. Weyl, no evidence has been adduced as to who did the translation.  And in the absence of an agreement that it is accurate, we would ask the registry's assistance to provide the necessary translation and transcription for the exhibit.  So we will admit the tape and we will make a tentative admission of the transcription and translation until the official translation from the registry got supplanted.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
May I offer a suggestion, Your Honours?  

In view of the Court's concern, perhaps we should mark the transcription and the translation for identification and simply admit the CD-ROM or the disc.  And then when we have an official translation, that can be entered into the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Madam Registrar, could you arrange to have the tape exhibited and the transcription and translation marked for identification?  
MS. N'GUM:
That will done, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Numbers, please?  
MR. MJUI:
The CD will be D. NG70, and the transcription will be ID. NG3, C for Kinyarwanda and A for French.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Mr. Issa.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG70 admitted)
(Exhibit No.  ID. NG3A and ID. NG3C marked for identification)

We now take our mid-afternoon recess.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I thought I heard 17 when I think it should be 71. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Registrar, could you please confirm?  
MR. MJUI:
I think the document which was supposed to be D. NG 70,  now it is marked as ID. NG2.  Thank you, Your Honour.  Not as an exhibit, just marked for identification, Your Honour.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Mr. Weyl, does that answer your enquiry?  
MR. WEYL:
No, Mr. President, I have a problem with the translation.  I thought that the CD is admitted as evidence, D. NG and not Z, D. NG70, 7-0, but then the translation is D. NZ17 or 71.  I do know perhaps I will probably check it with the registrar during the break.  Forgive me, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
That is the best way to manage it so that we  can revert to it if necessary afterwards.  

We take our mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1539H to 1559H) 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could make one quick -- Mr. Weyl spent quite a bit of time on the letter from the Ndindabahizi defence team and Mr. Uwizeye's response.  I don't think that has been marked in evidence.  Is that an oversight?  Given the length of time we spent on it, I would prefer that it be placed on the record.  
MR. WEYL:
We fully agree, Mr. President, and I was coming to it myself, but I don't want to waste the time available for cross-examination.  I was going to ask the Trial Chamber about that afterwards.  But it could be admitted as D. NG71 A and B regarding the -- Ndindabahizi Defence counsel's letter and 72A and B for Mr. Uwizeye's answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Registrar.

MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour, the letter from l'Avocat Magali, will be D. NG71, G for giraffe, and A and B; A for French and B for English.  And the letter written by the witness, Uwizeye, Fidele, will be D. NG72. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Admitted.
 (Exhibit No. D. NG71A, D. NG71B, and D. NG72 admitted)
MS. N'GUM:
Thank you, Mr. President.  As I had said earlier, the Defence for Ngirumpatse was now left with one hour, 41 minutes.  It was my fault that by the lunch -- the coffee break I had not got the time -- by the lunch break I had not got the time that has been utilised by the Ngirumpatse defence team, and it was one hour 43 minutes that they used this morning, and so they've already used an extra one hour and 
12 minutes during the -- after the lunch break.  So, I believe it is time for them to request for extra time.

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am not very sure I understand the rules of the game.  And by virtue of what must I ask for an extension as I have up to now, in spite of my difficulty in obtaining a rapid answer, used only two hours and 50 minutes of cross-examination when the Prosecutor used more than six and a half hours.  I don't understand the insistence with which Madam N'gum says that I have exhausted my time at the beginning of every sitting. 
MS. N'GUM:
Thank you, Mr. President.  If you may recall, during the time that Madam Diagne was cross-examining, she exhausted the six hours 13 minutes entitlement, and you explained that the Ngirumpatse Defence was quite willing to allow Madam Diagne to utilise some of the time of the cross-examination from the Ngirumpatse Defence team, and she did.  And as I said this morning, she used four hours and one minute.  So that left you with one hour and 41 minutes.  And it was the Chamber that ordered yesterday that when it is the time for the Ngirumpatse Defence team to cross-examine, if the time that was left for the Karemera Defence team was exhausted, it was for counsel to request for additional time.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, you certainly remember also that I said that I would take the time I would need to defend the interest of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And if the time reserved for Mathieu Ngirumpatse's defence is so compressed, then there is the issue of a fair trial which is (inaudible) for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

And, Mr. President, I understand that you said that your rule will be applied with some flexibility.  So, Mr. President, I pray for your leave to continue with my cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
But Mr. Weyl, as you said over and over again, the time standards that we set, are set as guidelines, not as -- and will not be exercised in abstract.  But we want to exercise some control over the length of the cross-examination, and not have it go on indefinitely.  
Now, how much time do you need, and why do you need extra time?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I will need the time necessary for me to continue with the questions which I have for the witness.  You must have noticed that on several occasions, when I put questions to him which he has to answer in a simple manner, he finally answered for seven, eight or ten minutes and the record is there.  

The witness is not present here -- is not -- is not present here at our discretion, and we need to avail ourselves of the necessary time to get the answers and the clarifications we need.  I believe I will need two or three hours more to complete my cross-examination if we continue in the same pace.  If the witness wants and is ready to give brief or simple answers to simple questions, then we will move faster. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Weyl, you also had some responsibility for the length of the cross-examination.  I thought, as I had indicated more than once, that you were being repetitious, and I also thought that your approach of matters that you were dealing with was unnecessarily roundabout, but you could have come more quickly to the point that you were making.  But we will allow you to continue for now, but we are interested in making certain that the cross-examination is as compact as it could be.  
MR. WEYL:
I will do my level best, certainly with the assistance of Mr. Uwizeye.  

And I am obliged to you, Mr. President, for allowing me to continue.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, during your cross-examination, you said that the October 1990 war was to solve the problem of the return of the refugees because, according to you, nothing had been done in that respect.  Do you remember that? 
A.	My answer was close to what you just said.  I said that the war was aimed at showing the international opinion that the refugees were experiencing problems.  So, it was a sort of expression of a revolt.  So it was a war aimed at bringing democracy into Rwanda.  So, I would say that my answer is in the affirmative, but kindly also take on board the additional information I have brought in. 
Q.	Let us deal with the basics, Mr. Uwizeye.  Does that mean that you are not aware of the Rwanda/Uganda joint ministerial commission proceedings on the problem of Rwandan refugees in Uganda, which meeting took place on the 27th-30th of July 1990? 
A.	I have already answered this question when it was put to me in another way.  I have talked about the discussions and the conclusions, but they did not satisfy RPF, so the RPF was led to attack.  The discussions, per se, were not enough.  It was necessary that at the end of the discussions, there be resolutions which were satisfactorily.  If the RPF attack, it was because it was not satisfied with the resolutions which had been taken. 
Q.	So do you agree that there was an agreement signed, the resolution that led to an agreement signed on the 30th of July 1990?
A.	If you have the document drafted in that connection, I don't deny that there was an agreement.  That may enable us to make speed and -- 
Q.	What if Mr. Issa were to show you the document, which is number 16 of our list of materials?  Will you be able to confirm that you are familiar with the document?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Issa, please.  
THE WITNESS:
I have already told you that I do not have any problem concerning that document.  If the document exists, then I am ready to recognise it.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, in order not to waste time, given that we have to make progress, why don't you go to 
	page 11 point 14 of the document.  There is a point 14 there: 

"The delegations noted with satisfaction, progress made so far towards seeking a lasting solution to the problem of Rwandan refugees living in Uganda.  The proceedings were conducted in a frank and cordial atmosphere.  The delegations of the Ugandan government, UNHCR and OAU, expressed their sincere gratitude to the government and people of Rwanda for the warm welcome and brotherly hospitality reserved them."  

And the document is signed by three people:  For the Rwandan government, Dr. Casimir  Bizimungu; for the Ugandan government, Honourable Ibrahim Mukore; and for the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Husseini Fassassi, F-A-S-S-A-S-S-I.  

Do we agree on that? 
A.	No problem at all, and I've already told you that I do not have any problem with that document. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I move to tender that document as evidence.  D. NG73.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG73 admitted)
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, so it was two months after that document was signed that in order to solve the refugee problem, the RPF attacked Rwanda; do we agree? 
A.	If you are saying so, then it means you know it.  I don't deny that.  You know the date. 
Q.	Let's move on.  
Mr. Uwizeye, you said that in your préfecture, there were attacks launched by Setiba.  I am not going to talk about dates because we had crossed purposes in that connection.  Let's just talk about the nature of the events and the time frames.  

In this Court, you told us that Setiba came on the 8th and looted.  He came back on the 9th and killed.  Without talking about dates, do you agree with the factual chronology that according to you on the 8th, there was a raid to loot; and on the 9th, there was a raid to kill? 
A.	I agree with you, sir. 
Q.	You see, Mr. Uwizeye, in what you said in the Bizimungu trial, you did not refer to the same dates.  You mentioned different dates.  You said the first attack was launched against a trading centre, and as earlier as that first attack, people were killed.  These are details that -- don't you think there is an inconsistency between the chronology of events? 
A.	That is not a detail, Counsel Weyl.  These are events which occurred at the time especially events which you had referred to.  I talked about them in various statements.  Please look at the various documents and you will realise that the dates 8th and 9th are mentioned, and on those dates, there were various activities carried by Setiba.  Let us be clear about this.  

On the first day, they came and looted.  On the second day, they came and looted, but they also killed especially.  That is evidenced by a report established by the bourgmestre of the commune and those issues were raised during the meeting of bourgmestres.  That is history.  I think what is important is to look at the deeds as well as the chronology. 
Q.	That is, indeed, the reason why giving different chronology at different trials is a problem, which may bring out inconsistencies.  And between what you are saying here and what you said in the Bizimungu trial, there is a difference.  

And, Mr. Uwizeye, you did not say the same thing in the Akayesu trial, but my problem is that in the Akayesu trial, you testified in closed session.  And here I cannot give a narration of your evidence without moving from open to closed session under conditions which will make it extremely difficult for me to do.  So my proposal to the Trial Chamber is that we take due note of this and during a single closed session I will put you face-to-face with what you said in the Akayesu trial.  

But simply for now, I am asking you whether in the Akayesu trial you did not say that Setiba killed anybody, be it in the first or the second day.  In the Akayesu trial, you said he came only to loot.  Do you have any comments to make? 
A.	You need to closely look at all the documents which I drafted or the statements I recorded.  You will even notice that I gave the names of his victims.  

Mr. Weyl, please focus on the reprehensible acts which were perpetrated, and also take into account documents coming from other persons.  

When you take out a document -- from a document dealing with the same event, I don't consider this an honest way of proceeding.  What is most important is that Setiba committed those offences, and at my initiative, soldiers intervened to try and contain the operations.  

Thank you for allowing me to give such explanations. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, please, don't go down a road which would lead to you casting doubt on my honesty.  Already yesterday, there were certain problems, and on another occasion you had said that a colleague of mine was lying.  My intentions are honest. And what I am saying is that in the course of your various testimonies at some point in time, you say something and at some other times you said something else.  I've already put the inconsistencies to you and in the next few moments I will confront you with what you said in Akayesu.  

You also gave statements regarding the same events and you said that Setiba's first attacks took place following or after the 12th of April, and that was November 1999, KO159060, line 5: 

"It was only from the 12th of April 1994 when the interim government had moved to Gitarama préfecture that we started experiencing massive arrests, intimidations and armed interventions, remote controlled from the neighbouring préfectures."  

That is the end of that paragraph.  So you start with the 12th of April 1994 when the first incursions took place.  That's your fourth document and fourth different narration of your accounts.  Do you have any comments to make? 
A.	Counsel, I will ask you to refer to the meeting of préfets and ministers which took place in Kigali on the 11th of April and to consider what I said during that meeting before putting questions to me about the state of security in Gitarama -- or when questions were put to me about the state of security in Gitarama.  The president, as well as the ministers were present.  
Furthermore, I don't think we should belabour the issue of dates.  For me, that is not what is essential given that the dates are close to one another, be it the 9th or the 10th.  
However, somewhere you were not saying the truth when you say that I said that it took place after the 12th of April.  I don't know of any statement in which I said that the events occurred after the 
12th of April.  Nowhere did I place Setiba's action beyond the 12th of April.  

The only attack by Setiba which could have taken place after the 12th was the one which was launched in Mugina, but that attack is different from the other ones which were launched in Runda.  I think that when you confuse those two attacks, that is where the problem props up.  So you are the one creating confusion. 
Q.	Do you want to be confronted with your statement? 
A.	Counsel, I don't think that is necessary.  You are belabouring this point because you have your specific objective.  But it is public knowledge that it was mentioned by various persons and during various meetings.  So in order not to waste the time of the Court, my proposal is that we set this point aside because it wouldn't lead you anywhere. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am in the Court's hands.  Is the Court ready to take into evidence the witness's statement of the  10th of November 1990, which is document number 12A of my list of materials, 12B for the English version?  Is the Court ready to admit it into evidence without the witness having to recognise it?  I don't want to waste time, rather, I want to gain time.  I have read the relevant portion of that statement to the witness and he has no comments to make about it.  Is the Court ready to admit that document into evidence as D. 74A (sic) and B for the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I think it will be necessary for the witness to confirm that it is a statement. 
MR. WEYL:
That is what I wanted to do, but he doesn't seem to be amenable.  

Mr. Issa, kindly avail Mr. Uwizeye with documents 12A and 12B so that he can recognise the signature and then we will move the Court to admit the document into evidence.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you signed the English version, which is document 12B.  Do you recognise your signature, sir, on each of the nine pages of that document? 
A.	Counsel, when you give me a document like this one, I think it is an abuse because I will need time to peruse the document.  It is not comprehensible for the registry officer to give me a document and hardly do I have time to look at the document than you put a question to me.  I don't think this is appropriate, because I am entitled to look at the document being given to me.  I cannot immediately answer with a yes or a no to your question when I have not yet had time to study the document.  Thank you.  
Q.	I think it will be simpler for you to study the document than indulge in comments? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe I can offer a (inaudible).  Perhaps, if Mr. Weyl just ask the witness to recognise his signature at the bottom of the page, that will suffice, other than that, the Prosecution has no objection.  But I would wish to indicate, for the record, that there are two references to Setiba on the statement.  It's on 
page 4 and page 6 of the French text, and page 4 and -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, please for the interpreters. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Prosecution has no objection.  I will suggest to Mr. Weyl that if he has the witness recognise his signature at the bottom of the English document, the Prosecution would have no objection.  And I would simply like to indicate, for the record, when we go back to this for the ease of access of whoever is reading the transcripts, that the references to Setiba appear on page 4 and page 6 of the French text, which is -- which would be 074A and page 4 and page 7 of the English text, which will be 074B. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, that, indeed, was what I was suggesting.  I wanted to find out from the witness whether he recognise his signature on the bottom of each of the nine pages of the English version bearing his signature.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do you recognise your signature, Mr. Uwizeye? 
A.	Mr. Weyl, the signature is not clear.  We just see two strokes on where the date is mentioned 
	7th of March 2000.  The signature which comes after that is, indeed, mine.  But I am talking about the signature which appears after the date, 7th of March 2000.  After that, the signature is mine.  And I think I will be able to tell you whether the signature was forged, so I confirm that it is, indeed, my signature.  

As for the French document, the version I have before me is not official, so I cannot be bound by it.  

However, concerning the English document, I do confirm that it is, indeed, my signature.  

Besides, I would like to tell you that I do recognise my signature on the page where there is interpreter's certification.  So to make things easier for you, I will acknowledge that this is my signature on the English version. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
We now admit this in evidence.  

Can we have the number, please?  

MR. MJUI:
The statement will be D. NG74, A for French and B for English. 
Thank you, Your Honour.
(Exhibit No. D. NG74A and D. NG74B admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 
MR. WEYL:
I will accelerate now, Mr. President.  Trying to stick to some -- 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you tell us on the 18th you called a meeting at the préfecture to talk with your bourgmestres and memorandum.  Without going into details, do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	You told us that Mr. Kambanda's personal assistant came to tell you that, first of all, the meeting should be held in Mr. Kambanda's presence, and when he came back to tell you that the meeting should be held at Murambi.  Can you describe to us a bit more, this person, Mr. Kambanda's personal assistant or personal secretary?  
A.  	You want to know who Mr. Kambanda's personal secretary was?  
Q.	That is my question? 
A.	I've already clearly explained that I don't remember his name, I only remember what his office was and that I described the conditions under which he came to see me.  If you want to know his name, I must tell you that I no longer recall what it was. 
Q.	Nor can you describe him, his size, his age? 
A.	That I can do, Counsel Weyl.  He was plump -- plumpish; he was bearded.  He had a heavy beard and he had a big head.  

Now, as to his age, I would say that he was in his thirties.  I'd say somewhere between 30 and 36.  I should also make it clear that it was the first time I saw him.  Even if I was a member of the MDR, I did not know that man.  And when he came, he was in the company of soldiers -- or escorted by soldiers.  So he told me that the prime minister had heard that I had called for a meeting of bourgmestres. 
Q.	We've already heard that.  
A.	But that the prime minister wanted to speak at the meeting.  This was an important detail that I wish to make acquaint you with. 
Q.	That was not my question.  I asked you to describe him and you told us that he was plump and bearded.  
A.	In your question, Counsel, you said -- you referred to what he said and there was a word you used that was incorrect, which is what I wanted to correct.  But I agree with you what you said so far.  We can continue.  
Q.	We will come back to that during the break to compare it with your statements in the Akayesu trial.  So you went to Murambi and you arrive there, at what time please? 
A.	I don't remember what time it was when we arrived in Murambi, but it was in the forenoon.  Maybe about 10 o'clock. 
Q.	Thank you.  You confirm that when you arrived in the classroom where the meeting was to be held Kambanda was alone? 
A.	I confirm that he was alone, but as soon as we arrived, the people who were nearby immediately entered the classrooms.  As you saw in the photographs, the classrooms were closed to each other, and I think someone called him and they immediately entered, but when we arrived, Kambanda was alone. 
Q.	We shall come back to that to confront you with your statements in Akayesu in closed session.  

Do you confirm that there were no clergymen in that meeting? 
A.	I did not see anyone and I have already -- frequently stated that. 
Q.	Nor were there any soldiers? 
A.	I did not see any. 
Q.	Nor were there any gendarmes? 
A.	I have already said who -- whom I saw and you were present when I said that. 
Q.	So you did not see General Ndindiliyimana? 
A.	He was not present. 
Q.	On the 6th of April 2005, this was not in closed session, so that I can use the transcript, in French, 
	page 67, regarding the people you met in Murambi, beginning with line 1, you say:  

"I did not see General Bizimungu, but I saw General Ndindiliyimana three times.  I saw him the first time when he came in the company of the president of the republic when they took up their seat in Gitarama."  

Well, I will leave it at that, unless you want me to say more.  And then you said more:  

"And then I saw him again between the 12th and the 18th of April, and I saw him again at that meeting which was held in Murambi in the course of which Prime Minister Kambanda and his government and the political party leaders met and I was there -- I was present."  

In Bizimungu, then he was there? 
A.	No, that's not what I said.  I did not say that even if it's written down there.  
MR. WEYL:
The Trial Chamber will weigh -- I should like the extract I've just read to be entered from 
Bizimungu et al, Wednesday 25th of April 2005, page 60 in English, 76 in French, D. NG75, I think.  
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG75 admitted)
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, we will stay with the facts.  Who spoke and then in what trial?  Please summarise and do it quickly so as not to exhaust the Trial Chamber.  And I think that with your assistance, I will finish this afternoon.  

Before the Trial Chamber you said that you spoke, and then, the bourgmestres from Mugina, Runda spoke after you -- followed you; and then, Kambanda spoke; and then, Édouard Karemera; and then, Mathieu Ngirumpatse; and you further said that he fully supported Édouard Karemera, then Mugenzi; and after Mugenzi, you felt under pressure -- you exited and left them in the room with Kambanda and never came back.  You confirm that chain of events? 
A.	But, counsel, do you think the most important thing is the sequence in which the speakers spoke or what they spoke about?  What is more important for you?  The sequence of speakers or the topics?  
MR. WEYL:
I think my question is pertinent and the sequence in your narration of the facts since you come to testify as a witness of fact.  The sequence is relevant.  I am asking you to answer my question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry; could I have the reference again please, because I am having trouble locating it in these papers?
MR. WEYL:
For the time being, it's not an exhibit; it's Mr. Uwizeye's testimony before this Trial Chamber and the examination-in-chief.  It is to refer to the transcripts.  I am in the hands of the Trial Chamber.  I can try and dig out reference to the transcript, but that will be fastidious. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, I am reminding you of what you said before this Trial Chamber.  The sequence of events that you gave us is that -- or do you have any doubts as to the chain of events? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am referring to something that Mr. Weyl was reading from just a few minutes ago.  So that is the reference I am trying to find.  If he could just give me the page number and the date please. 
MR. WEYL:
I am not reading a statement; I am summarising what the witness has said in testimony before the 
Trial Chamber.  I am putting to him the sequence of events.  You have the transcript also, 
Mr. Prosecutor.  You can check it for yourself.  We can read the transcript, but I think that would be unnecessary and that we will use mister -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Are you referring to the document that has been admitted into evidence?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That one I have, I have it as page 67 in the French and continued on page 68, but I thought Mr. Weyl was reading from a second document after he had admitted D. NG075.  So that's what I was looking for and my sense was that he was reading as I heard it on the mike.  But if he says that that was not the case, then we can proceed and I apologise for the interruption. 
MR. WEYL:
I was saying and what I am doing, I repeat, is to narrate to the Trial Chamber what was said last Thursday. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, do you confirm what you said about you speaking, then the bourgmestres, particularly Zaraza (phonetic) in Mugina, Runda and then Aka -- then Kambanda, then Karemera and then Ngirumpatse confirms what Mr. Karemera said; and then what Mr. Mugina -- then Mugenzi, whose words were such that you left, "slamming the door", and the meeting continued with Kambanda.  That is what you said.  And you repeated the same thing to my colleague, Dior Diagne.  I should merely like you to confirm to me again that this corresponds to the sequence as you remember it? 
A.	The sequence is that which I informed you of and that is the sequence as I remember it. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, I should like Mr. Issa to show you your statement of the 10th of May 1996.  The French version is signed.  It is my item 7 in the bundle.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Issa, could you help, assist, please, and show item 7 in the bundle to Mr. Uwizeye?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, do you have the statement before you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you recognise your signature at the bottom of page 1, 2, 3, 4 and at the top of page 5? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, it is, indeed, my signature. 
Q.	Would you please turn to page 4?  For the transcript, this is page K0027845.  Are you there, 
	Mr. Uwizeye? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Could you go over this page which is a narration you gave in 1996 of the meeting held in 1994?  

Have you finished going through it? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you see the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse on this page? 
A.	No, I do not see the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse on this page, but notwithstanding, I have another statement giving his name and I should like to tell you also, Counsel, that the answer depends on the question.  I think you should understand that.  One answers a specific question and when the 
	person -- putting the question gives you time to answer, then your answer can be more detailed.  

As to the question whether the name of Mathieu Ngirumpatse appears here, I would like and invite you to look at other documents, other documents, other testimonies I have given.  You say that you are summing the various documents, I think it would be preferable to deal with each document one by one, because then one or the other might supplement or complement.  

Give me time, Mr. Weyl.  This is an important point.  If you want to scheme over this important point, I can, of course, let you do so.  But I will advise you to use all the documents available and previous statements available.  As far as I am concerned, the most important things are the acts, facts and the authors of those facts. 
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, I've just seen you look at your watch.  You know that time is running against me and you are playing with the clock.  I am putting you questions on documents from 1996.  I will come to the others later.  But let us think of 1996.  I would like to read the penultimate paragraph.  
A.	Counsel Weyl, you can't prohibit me from looking at my watch which is my very own watch, and nor can you speculate as to why I am looking at my watch, but please, continue. 
Q.	Counsel, with your permission, Mr. Uwizeye, I am going to read the document that you have before you, the penultimate paragraph:  

"The meeting finished in a fish tail because no solution was proposed to the problem I'd raised with my bourgmestres.  Indeed, the prime minister who was supposed to decide between us and the Interahamwe was very ambiguous in his statement.  He was followed by Karemera and Mugenzi.  The two authorities, who espoused the cause of the militiamen, et cetera et cetera."  

You only speak of two authorities.  You don't speak of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, whatever the question could have been.  Do we agree on that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry; Mr. Weyl, this doesn't seem like the proper way to proceed.  But even so, we should, at least, read the whole sentence.  Mr. Weyl stops at the word "militiamen", and the very next word is "Interahamwe".  So if he is going to put something to the witness, he should put an entire sentence to the witness and be complete in his question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Weyl, I don't understand what you are doing.  You are trying to get the witness to give evidence about whether your client was present at the meeting or not?  

MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am confronting him with his statement from 1996 where he speaks of three successive speakers, Kambanda, Karemera, Mugenzi.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
You can proceed.
(Pages 44 to 58 by Sheriffo Jammeh)



	




























1700H 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it is an essential element of our case, as you know, because since the beginning we've been saying Mathieu Ngirumpatse never took part in that meeting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, there's no evidence of that adduced in-chief up to now, as far as I'm aware.  
MR. WEYL:
To my knowledge, there was, but I will come back to that.  It was a witness that testified before this Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't stop you from addressing it but, if you wish, you may continue.  I just drew to your attention --
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I didn't understand the comment from the Court, actually, because this is something we did go over in our examination in-chief.  And Mathieu Ngirumpatse was definitely present for the meeting of the 18th of April.  And, in fact, the witness spent quite a bit of time talking about the presence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  But my --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
At this meeting? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, at this meeting of the 18th of April that was part of a -- a significant part of the direct examination.  Perhaps the Court is confusing this with the second meeting on -- that involved Ndindiliyimana and Rusatira.  But, Your Honours, quite frankly, on this issue, is what -- my concern earlier, when I was asking for a reference from Mr. Weyl from the witness' testimony in the Bizimungu trial concerns this very issue because we've never established a date for that second meeting.  And I think that we're a bit at a disadvantage here because he speaks of both meetings as occurring on around the 18th.  So when we have a transcript that is being offered to show inconsistency, when there's actually none, and it hasn't been put properly to the witness, it's a bit disconcerting.  Now, this witness has made -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you can't address it in this way.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Perhaps I could offer this -- I am sorry.  This witness has made 10 statements.  The Prosecution has no objection to all 10 statements being offered by the Defence.  The Court then can look at all the statements and assess all of the inconsistencies, and that seems to me would be a much shorter way of addressing Mr. Weyl's concern.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, what Mr. Weyl (sic) wants is to run his cross-examination as he wishes and not let Mr. Webster -- decide at one point or another how the witness should answer.  I'm speaking of only one meeting.  Since the beginning, I've only been speaking of one meeting.  I'm not speaking of any other meeting.  I'm speaking of the meeting that Mr. Webster has been asking me for three months whether I have an alibi defence or not.  We're speaking of the same one.  But if Mr. Webster wants me to -- does my defence case - argument, let him pursue and do the questioning as he sees fit.  I'm speaking of the meeting of the 18th that was transferred to Murambi at the request of Kambanda's private secretary -- personal assistant. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I suppose the problem already started when I thought you were asking about a meeting at which this witness has not said Mr. Ngirumpatse was present.  That's been clarified now, so you may proceed with your questions.  
MR. WEYL:
I'm most obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So, Mr. Uwizeye, on the 10th of May 1996, when you described that meeting which took place around 10 o'clock in the morning at Murambi on the 18th of April, you did not see, nor did you hear Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mathieu; correct?
A.	All what I would tell you is that in the statement, which you've given to me, Ngirumpatse's name does not appear and I agree with you on that score.  But I would like to add that you can also peruse the other statements on my prior testimonies in this Tribunal.  More especially, you could consult -- look at what I said today in this courtroom.  So please don't focus on the -- on the statement of the 10th of May 1996.  

I think that you're not taking on board the circumstances under which I was interviewed by the person who recorded this statement, the circumstances under which my statement was translated, or the circumstances under which I signed the statement.  It sometimes happens that you sign a statement which is incomplete without you even having time to read through the statement.  

But the only problem which I had with Akayesu's counsel, Tiangaye, is the falsification of documents.  

You want to demonstrate that Mathieu Ngirumpatse did not attend the meeting of the 18th, but my advice to you is to refer to the other documents, the other statements.  Do not restrict yourself solely to the one of 1996 because it bears my signature.  

As I had told you already, the people who recorded the statements in the years around 1996 were people we could not identify and who sometimes were not serious.  Sometimes those people even claimed not to know the language we were using, which we spoke.  And when, at the end of the interview, the person went to translate the document, the person would come back only weeks or months afterwards to have you sign, even sometimes by the roadside.  Even if you keep on attaching so much value to that document, simply because it bears my signature -- I should also express my concerns and worries to you because at that time the people who were recording statements had other objectives.  

But today things have changed.  When the person does not identify himself clearly, when he does not give you the necessary time for the interview, you will simply not give him the statement.  But in 1996, those people used the pretext that they did not have enough time and that we could even sign the documents whose content we were not familiar with.  

That said, you're entitled to do your work.  And I'm ready to continue with you.  But I am praying the Chamber to closely examine the content of the statement and to also consider my previous testimonies because this is the third time I am testifying.  And questions were always being put to me regarding the meeting of the 18th.  So we can't see various answers in the various documents and the various transcripts of the testimonies which I've given before the various Trial Chambers of this Tribunal.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I stand corrected by the court reporters.  But I'd like to place on record that Mr. Uwizeye's last answer lasted more than five minutes for nothing -- for nothing, other than simply to obstruct my cross-examination and that has been the case ever since this morning.  

Now, when we look at the document, the one of 10th of March 1996 -- 10th of May 1996, which is document number 7, which is D. NG76A for the French version and D. NG76B for the English version.  It is the statement of the 10th of May 1996.  

And before moving on, Mr. President, there are two things which I would like Mr. Uwizeye to say regarding the statement.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	The first one is -- 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I was waiting for your decision regarding the admission of the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the document is admitted.  

Mr. Registrar, can you confirm the number.  
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, the document will be D. NG76A, for French, and B for English.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG76A and D. NG76B admitted)
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, before we move to the next document, because indeed I intend to put your six successful statements, which you made, and point out the various -- and variant account of the same meeting.  I would like to draw your attention to the last paragraph, the meeting ended with, "Applause", even to the two last speakers, according to you, Karemera and Mugenzi.  Now, if you heard people applauding it means you did not stage your walkout.
A.	Why are you saying this, Counsel?  Because it is not written that I walked out?  You do not believe that I did stage a walkout?  
Q.	Well, I have my answer, Mr. Uwizeye.  

My second comment regarding that document:  You say that sometimes you would sign without having time to read or sometimes you would sign months afterwards.  Can you tell me when you signed your statement of the 10th of May 1996?  It is just near your signature.
A.	Don't ask for dates from me, Counsel.  I simply draw the attention of the Trial Chamber, and your attention also -- and I gave the circumstances under which such documents were drafted.  
Q.	Please, answer my question.
A.	It is not necessary for you to request this from the President.  Don't ask for dates from me.  This happened more than 10 years ago.  So you understand yourself that you are doing this deliberately.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you're very hostile, but I'm asking you to read the date near your signature on that statement of the 10th of May 1996.  Please, what is that date?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, haven't you put this document in testimony -- in evidence?
MR. WEBSTER:
It's already admitted.  The Court already admitted it has D. NG76, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The date is already in evidence.  
MR. WEYL:
The date of signature is the 14th of May 1996, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Four days after the statement of the 10th of May.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, you wanted us to talk about other statements.  Let us talk about the one of the 16th of March 1997 now.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Issa, kindly give Mr. Uwizeye that statement of 16th of March 1997, that is document number eight in the bundle.  The French version was the one that was signed.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, do you remember that statement?
A.	I have the document.  You should, rather, ask me whether I am familiar with that document, and my answer will be, yes, I am familiar with the document.  It bears my signature, even though the date when it was signed is not mentioned, but I do see my signature and I recognise the document.  
Q.	So is it, indeed, the statement which you gave the investigators on the 16th of March 1997, investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	Indeed, that is what is written.  
Q.	Please, turn to page 5 -- rather, page 4, the bottom of page 4, about 10 lines from the bottom.  There is a paragraph starting with, "I had one of my rare official contacts with the prime minister on the 18th of April 1994."   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, for the record, that will be page 5 of the English version.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	In that paragraph, you give an account of the start of the meeting.  Do we agree? 
A.	On page 5, that is true.  Where it is written that we were forced to go and see him in Murambi.  That is true.  
Q.	You narrated the statements which you made during that meeting.  And then on page 5, 19th line from the top of the page, by way of answer, "Mr. Kambanda" -- in English it says, "In response, all Mr. Kambanda did was read to us his so-called keynote speech which did not at all address our concerns."  So, according to you, Jean Kambanda responded.  And then you continued by saying that he gave the floor to the big politicians who were part of his suite.  Are you with me?
A.	We are together, sir.  
Q.	And that is where Mathieu Ngirumpatse's name first appears.  But, according to your statement, then he was the first to speak.  The sequence is not the same as the one you had narrated to us; do we agree? 
A.	What remark did I make concerning the sequence which we talked about earlier on, if I put the question back to you?  
Q.	I'm asking you to confirm to me that in your statement of March 1997, according to you, you spoke, Kambanda spoke, Mathieu Ngirumpatse spoke, then Édouard Karemera and, further down the page, Mugenzi spoke.  

And if we move on to page 6, the prime minister just smiled and did not say anything at all.  Rather, you spoke once again and you end, in your narration of that meeting, with the following words:  "The prime minister just repeated his speech, this time in a summary form and told us that it was quite clear.  That is how our meeting ended."  And you attended that meeting up until the end.  So that is a fourth different version.  Do we agree? 
A.	In your opinion, it is a fourth and different version, but as far as I know all those versions are complimentary.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I pray the Trial Chamber to admit D. NG77A for the French version, and B for the English version, it being this statement given my Mr. Uwizeye.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG77A and D. NG77B admitted) 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I will have another version, a new version to disclose, which is the one mentioned in the Bizimungu trial, but which is not the same at all.  However, I want to spare the Court this and, rather, deal with the version proposed by Mr. Uwizeye in the Akayesu trial, which is yet another version, another sequence.  My worry is that it was closed proceedings and I don't want to refer to a closed proceedings matter in another trial in open session here today, even though the reasons for the closed trial then are mute.  
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	However, Mr. Uwizeye, I'm going to tell you that (unintelligible) in the Akayesu trial.  You described a completely different meeting with different speakers and different chronology.  And you said you remained there up until the end.  

Tomorrow, at the beginning of the proceedings, we are going to deal with it and I think that will be the end of my cross-examination.  
MR. WEYL:
I think things are sufficiently clear enough, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	But, Mr. Uwizeye, I'm going to confront you with that tomorrow.  But do you think we can actually retain six different versions of the same event and actually learn any credence to them?  Do you have anything to say about that, Mr. Uwizeye?  
A.	I am speaking to you as someone giving you a piece of advice.  I'm asking you to have the good will to locate all those documents, compare them, and check if the contents are not the same, to check if the account of the events are not the same, to check if the events mentioned therein -- the information are not complementary.  I think that is the best way of going about analysing such documents.  Don't just examine on the one document; examine all the documents, bearing in mind the circumstances under which the investigators were working, that they encountered difficulties having the witnesses sign, that there were language difficulties.  You, yourself, just noticed when you looked at the date of the signature.  Those investigators could come back to your home after one month or after several days for you to sign.  I experienced such a situation.  I know what I'm talking about.  So I will ask you to use your discretion and to be careful when examining all those documents.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, before the adjournment, and before the Trial Chamber grants me leave to take a few moments in closed session to go through your statements and the inconsistencies as we noticed in your testimony in the Akayesu trial, I would like to take you to a document which is not the outcome of an interview by investigators, which is your own work, which is your erred memoir, signed in August 1994.  Do you remember that document? 
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	It has been admitted into evidence at the request of the Prosecutor.  I think it is Exhibit P. 105.  It is a document which you, yourself, prepared very close to the events in a spontaneous manner which -- enough hindsight between June and August 1994.  You agree with it? 
A.	Mr. Weyl, look at the heading of that document.  I prepared that document in June 1994.  It was written and signed sometime later on.  It was written, in French, "An analytical overview of the events."  I used the word "overview".  I think you understand the language.  An overview is an overview.  It is an erred memoir.  It is not a substantive document.  Analyse it with substance.  But it doesn't pose any problem to me.  Come with that document tomorrow.  We are going to talk about it.  I'm going to clarify matters.  For the benefit of the Court, you can even bring other documents, any other documents you have.  I'm going to shed light on them for the benefit of the Court.  Thank you.  
Q.	Mr. Uwizeye, between the time the document was prepared and the time it was signed, you had two months to think and rethink about it and fine tune it, yes or no? 
A.	Thank you.  But I'm telling you that it was an analytical overview of the situation.  You understand the language.  You know the meaning of an overview.  An overview is an overview.  But that's the problem as far as I'm concerned.  Bring the document tomorrow, we'll talk about it.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's now 5:30.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could offer some assistance to Mr. Weyl:  He seemed to express some concern about the closed session nature of the witness' testimony in Akayesu, but there is a statement that the witness made as a Defence statement, a Defence witness statement in Akayesu, which is not covered by protective order where the witness at length addresses the same meeting of the 18th of April.  So if Mr. Weyl wants to explore that tomorrow, he is certainly welcome to do so.  It's a statement of the 4th of March 1998.  And it also addresses at length the same meeting that he's referring to.  
MR. WEYL:
I thank my learned friend for this very belated clarification because if I had had it to go beyond the confidential matter of a closed session, information -- we would have saved time, but if the Court so minds, then we can deal with certain issues concerning Akayesu tomorrow morning in closed session.  

Perhaps you can give me leave to put one or two more questions this evening to land with my line of questioning concerning this analytical overview. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Weyl.  I don't think there's much point in doing that.  We want to take the adjournment now.  

We take the adjournment now and we resume tomorrow morning. 

Sorry, there's -- my -- Mr. Patrice has provided some information which maybe good news.  And so, perhaps, I should ask him to say it on behalf of the Court.  

Mr. Patrice, you have the floor.  
MR. MATHIAM:
Tomorrow morning, the Chamber will sit in Courtroom number one, in fourth floor, Laity Kama room.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
What about three other words; "For" -- four other words, "... for the duration of the trial."  How's that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not in a position to say that yet, but it might be said soon. 
(Court adjourned at 1737H)
