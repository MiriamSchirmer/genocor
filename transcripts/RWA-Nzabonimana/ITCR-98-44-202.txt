(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, can you open the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 17th of November 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same as yesterday.  

Mr. Witness, we resume our sitting this morning.  Your evidence will continue, and we remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence commenced.
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall will continue her cross-examination.  
MS FALL:
	Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS 3/10
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning.  
A.	Madam Prosecutor, good morning.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to proceed with your cross-examination.  I'd like to remind you that yesterday I was putting questions to you in respect of your statements, or the statements that you gave to the Defence team.  I'm going to continue by putting questions to you -- well, a very few questions, in any case -- on the interviews that you had with the Defence.  And I'd like you to tell us exactly when you came to Arusha.  Can you tell us the precise date on which you came to Arusha?
A.	I got to Arusha on the 2nd of November, and it was a Wednesday, this year of course, 2005.
Q.	Since your arrival here in Arusha, have you had the opportunity of meeting the Defence -- counsel for the Defence?
A.	I told you so yesterday, I have met him once, the Defence counsel.
Q.	Can you tell us how much time the discussions you had with him took on that occasion?
A.	We discussed for less than 15 minutes.
Q.	Of course, in your discussions, you talked about the statements that you have made.
A.	He put questions to me on my first statements -- he read out my first statement to him (as interpreted) and put questions to me on that and I said that my first statement had to do with what befell me and my family.  Later, I gave him the last statement in which I told him about what I saw while I was in flight, and the first statement or interview that I had with him is when he put questions to me concerning my family.
Q.	And when you said he put questions to you concerning what you saw while you were in flight, what were the events you discussed?
A.	For instance, the route that I took up until when I got to my property.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you indeed tell us that it is the itinerary that you took.  Now, can you tell us what you had to relate to the Defence counsel during or while you were making your statement?
A.	On that subject, I am going to briefly tell you what I related to him.
Q.	Well, I'll be more pointed.  Can you tell us, in general terms -- I think I'll come back to that question -- can you talk to us about the events that you mentioned in your statement of 4 November 2005?
A.	On the 4th of November I talked to him about what happened at the Kayanga health centre near the school.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would now like to take up certain events, and I'll begin with the events that occurred in your cellule from the 8th to the 11th of April 1994, and I will not put too many questions to you; merely, I would like to have some clarifications.

Mr. Witness, you stated in your statement of 21 June 2003 -- you said that the situation in your cellule was calm; is that correct?
A.	That is true, everything was calm in my cellule.
Q.	You did say that on the 8th and 9th there was no particular problem.
A.	That is true, there was no particular problem in my cellule.
Q.	And you say that what you noted on those dates was the presence of refugees that had come from other neighbouring secteurs?
A.	Those refugees came from Rutare and the Rutongo communes.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you made it clear, still in that statement, that it was from the 11th that the situation began to change; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And that this was caused by certain displaced persons that had arrived and who had provoked the Tutsis, and certain Hutus of course.
A.	That is what happened; they were provoking Hutus whom they knew were in agreement, or who lived in harmony with Tutsis.
Q.	Mr. President -- or Mr. Witness, before this Court you've had to testify to the effect that on the 8th of April 1994 that is when the situation deteriorated, because Brigadier Nyarwaya arrived, fired a shot in the air, and that is when the situation became difficult, so things were no longer calm and it was from the 8th that things became difficult.
A.	I wasn't referring to my cellule there; I was talking about what had happened at the Ndatemwa centre where I had gone to take a drink.  That is where Brigadier Nyarwaya found us.
Q.	However, you said, Mr. Witness, and I'm still referring --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Can you let me finish my sentence while I'm still referring to your statement, where you stated that between the 8th and the 9th of April you did not go out and that everybody had remained home following the instructions that had been issued.
A.	We remained at home, after Brigadier Nyarwaya had frightened us -- I think that is what I stated.  I said it was after the 9th that we remained at home because we were scared of Brigadier Nyarwaya -- I believe that was the purport of my statement.
Q.	Well, that can be ascertained in the transcripts, and I'm sure that all the parties will have them available to them.

Mr. Witness, during your statement of 21 June 2005 (sic) you never mentioned Brigadier Nyarwaya firing a shot in the air; is that correct?
A.	That is correct; I did not mention that fact, because I was under the impression that the counsel was putting questions to me concerning my family.  He was asking me what had happened to me during the war.  He didn't put any other questions to me.
Q.	And you thought that the fact that Brigadier Nyarwaya had fired a shot in the air and that this frightened you, and had frightened the population, was something you didn't need to mention to the Defence counsel?
A.	That is the first time that we were holding a discussion, and he was putting questions to me concerning my family.  That is the reason wherefore I gave him other details that I deemed to be useful when I got here.
Q.	The version of events that you give in the statements and in the light of what you testified before the Chamber, it would appear that there are two versions of events.  

Mr. Witness, I'll now move on to a different line of questioning and this would concern the events -- the unfortunate events of which you were a victim; that is, the death of your wife and of your children.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I don't think we need to go into closed session.  I can put questions that will not reveal -- that may not reveal the identity of the witness, and I would like to call on the witness to call me to order in the event that I put questions to him that are likely to reveal his identity.

MR. HOOPER:
I would request that, on this subject, as in-chief, we go into closed session, because I know the sensitivity that this involves and the difficulty of allegations that are implied, if not expressed, and the difficulties that this may cause.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I will be in your hands.  I will defer to the decision that you'll take, but I would like to point out that during the examination-in-chief there were questions that were put to the witness by the Defence counsel on the events and that were done in open session.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think it is better to err on the side of safety, so we would order closed session.

About how long do you think this line will take, Madam Prosecutor?  About how long do you estimate?  
MS. FALL:
Five to 10 minutes, Mr. President.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 5 to 10] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 4 by Maureen Dunn)
 




















BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I will therefore continue, Witness.  Witness, can you tell us then at what precise moment your daughter made that first narrative of the events that had befallen her and to whom did she make the narrative?
A.	At the outset, she couldn't speak.  When she regained consciousness, she was able to speak to me, say a few words, but today, when you try to speak to her of that event, she tries and refuses to speak of it.  She won't speak of it.
Q.	So, this child who was unfortunately injured, who was in a coma for nearly three weeks, and today does not want to speak of those events; when the question is put to her was nonetheless able at one time to tell you that it was local authorities -- RPF people -- accompanied by a certain Rutayisire who had committed the crimes against your family?
A.	I think you are putting words in her mouth.  She did not mention local authorities.  She mentioned Rutayisire, of course, and mentioned RPF soldiers, but nothing about "authorities".
Q.	Well, I meant local inhabitants -- I correct myself then.  But that was not my question.  My question was how that girl, who was in a coma for three weeks, who could apparently at one point tell you everything that happened, and giving you a name, cannot -- you just told us that same daughter today refuses to speak of those events, and gives no detail.  How can you explain this variation in what you have been stating?
A.	It was a traumatising event, a sad event, and when you bring up the topic, she bursts into sobbing and tears.
Q.	Yet, beforehand, as you said, she had no difficulty in giving you a precise narrative of the events, with all the participants, and giving the name also of one of the perpetrators of that crime.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Witness, third version of the events -- you also stated before the present Chamber on Tuesday, the 16th, that it was people who had gone to your area who came to inform you of what had happened -- what had befallen your family?
A.	You're saying that I made that statement on the 13th of November?  On what date?  Please repeat your question.
Q.	The 16th of November, Tuesday, the 16th of November, you stated that it was people who had come to your area who subsequently told you of what happened to your family.  That was the third version.
A.	I think that you are wrong; that is not what I stated.
Q.	Forgive me for a minute -- just give me a minute.  Tuesday, 15th of November, page 16, fourth line, after the question put by the Defence counsel, "It is only subsequently that you learnt of the unfortunate events that befell your wife, your son and your daughter?"  "Yes, subsequently I learnt that unfortunate news.  It was people who came to our area who came to tell me about it, as I told you yesterday."  Whereas "yesterday", which was the day before, Monday, you did not state that at all.
A.	I don't remember having stated that.  I cannot invent anything about the people who informed me of the death of my wife.  I know very well who informed me.
Q.	Yet, again, Witness, did you or did you not make that statement before the Trial Chamber, as I was saying, on Tuesday, the 15th of November?
A.	You are claiming that I heard the information from members of the population?  No.  The first person to give me that information was that man who escaped from the RPF and saw my daughter in the state in which she was.  And subsequently that man came and informed me what had happened.  She did not, however, mention Rutayisire.  It was my daughter who mentioned Rutayisire when she came to her senses.  I am inventing nothing, Mr. Chairman.  There is no advantage for me in lying.
Q.	For the third and last time, Witness, did you or did you not state before the Trial Chamber that subsequently, "Yes, I learnt that unfortunate news.  It was people who came to our area who reported it to me, as I told you yesterday" and I will add that on the "yesterday" in question you said nothing of the sort.  
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Witness, can you answer me by "Yes" or "No" to this precise question?
A.	Well --
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	Yes, it was certain people among the people who buried my wife who gave me that information.  As I told you, I did not participate in the burial of my wife.
Q.	Witness, I should like to know, of those three versions, which is the true version, but I will move on to other topics.

Witness, I will now question you as to the events that took place at Kayanga health centre.  You recalled for us that the statement was made when you were in Arusha, since its date was 4th of November 2005.
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Witness, that statement -- I suppose questions were put to you and you answered them.  Did you subsequently sign the statement that you made to Defence counsel?
A.	I believe that the Defence counsel did not show me a document that had to be signed.
Q.	In any case, did he show you any document?
A.	He put questions to me, which questions I answered, but he did not ask me to sign the document.  However, he read out the contents of the statement to me.  You know, I did not understand the language spoken by the Defence counsel, and he needed to use an interpreter for me to understand what he was saying.
Q.	So, when you answered all the questions he put to you through the interpreter, was the statement that you made read out to you?
A.	Yes, they read it out to me.
Q.	Mr. Witness, so questions had to be put to you.  What you said had to be interpreted and subsequently what you said was read out to you.  How much time did all of the above take?
A.	Since the services of an interpreter had to be used, the interview lasted between 30 and 45 minutes.
Q.	Mr. Witness, didn't you just say before this Court that you saw the Defence witness (as interpreted) only once and that the discussion lasted only 15 minutes?
A.	Yes, it is true that I mentioned 15 minutes, but the discussion did not really take 15 minutes.  We needed to wait for the lady that served as an interpreter, because she was busy in the kitchen.  Subsequently she came and I had a discussion with the Defence counsel, but prior to the arrival of the interpreter the Defence counsel was present.  We stayed together, but he could not talk to me, since I did not understand his language.  So we needed to wait for the interpreter.  When she came, we were able to hold our interview.
Q.	Mr. Witness, once again, did you state that the interview or discussion you had with the Defence counsel -- because you were with him -- did you state that the discussion took 15 minutes and that today --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Now, can you let me finish my statement, please?  So today you are testifying before this Chamber that the interview lasted 30 to 45 minutes, which represents quite a significant difference.
A.	Yes, it is true the difference is significant, but, indeed, from the onset I had to go to the room where I had to be interviewed, and we spent about 15 minutes waiting for the interpreter.  And when the interpreter came, the interview began and lasted about 30 minutes.  Probably I didn't express myself well before in answering the questions put to me by you, which is why I said I was with the Defence counsel for 15 minutes.  But if the truth be told, I stayed with the Defence counsel alone for 15 minutes, but we could not hold any discussion, because I don't speak his language and when the interpreter came, the interview per se began.
Q.	All the more why, Mr. Witness, you did not from the very beginning tell the Chamber, since you were asked the length of the discussion that you had with the Defence counsel, and you said -- why didn't you say that the interview lasted between 30 and 45 minutes?
A.	My answers depend on the questions that are put to me and my understanding of the questions that are put to me.  But the truth is what I've just told you.
Q.	Was the truth 15 minutes, or between 30 and 45 minutes?
A.	The truth is that we stayed together for a period of between 30 and 45 minutes, but this includes the time that I spent with the Defence counsel without telling anything, and I should also make it clear that I am only giving an estimate of the time, since I wasn't wearing a watch.
Q.	We are not going to dwell on your two answers in respect of that single question.  And I'll move on to another line of questioning.

Mr. Witness, in these statements you contend that you were a witness of the Kayanga centre attack?
A.	That is correct; I know a part of the events that occurred at that centre.
Q.	Regarding the attack at that centre -- concerning the attack of that centre, you testified before this Chamber that you met Brigadier Nyarwaya and that somehow he forcibly caused you and other persons to accompany him to that establishment.
A.	The version of it you are giving is not complete.  He did not force us to accompany him.  If you give me the opportunity, probably I can give you more explanations.
Q.	It is true that I did not finish my question, because I'm going to take up that portion of the narration of the events.  Isn't it true that you said that somehow Nyarwaya asked and forced you to accompany him to the health centre?
A.	Yes, it is true that he was manning a roadblock, so he forced people to go along with him to go and fight the RPF.  Along the way somebody told him that there weren't RPF elements at the health centre -- he was accompanied with policemen and other people, and most of those people were refugees.  I believe that I explained at length this issue.  When he got to the health centre, he met a doctor.
Q.	Please, can you move in stages, if you will, and I will take up the statement again that you made according to which you said that you had made a mistake and that, indeed, brigadier did not force you to accompany him to the health centre.  We're going to move in stages.  That is what you've just stated?
A.	No, you weren't mistaken.  For starters, the brigadier asked them to go and fight the Inkotanyi and when he got to the health centre that is where there was an individual, and I don't remember his name.  But this person said that, "If you want to fight the Inkotanyi, do you think there aren't Inkotanyi at the health centre?" 
Q.	Mr. Witness, that statement, which is partially correct, and that we can find in what you said yesterday before the Trial Chamber, does not in any way reflect the statement that was made on the 4th of November 2005.  And in your statement of 4 November 2005 it doesn't appear that you make any reference to the Inkotanyis.
A.	Probably I did not give exactly the same explanation, but that was my intention.  When he wanted us to go towards the health centre, actually what he wanted is that all the members of the population should go and fight the Inkotanyis.  That was Nyarwaya's goal.
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you tell us what was the number of people who were accompanying Brigadier Nyarwaya on that day?
A.	He had with him key figures of the commune -- the key figures were four in number.  Otherwise, the rest of them were just members of the population.
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say the "key figures of the commune", who else are you referring to?
A.	By that I mean people whom he survives, otherwise that the brigadier was the chief of all the communal officials.
Q.	So when you say "key figures", are you referring to officials?
A.	No.  In Rwanda a communal policeman is known by everyone.  So I was talking to you about people that all the members of the population know.
Q.	Can you tell us the names of the persons that are known by all the members of the population?
A.	I will begin with the brigadier himself.  There was a communal policeman called Kayibanda, I can no longer recall his first name.  By the way, he used to live at the health centre.  There was another person, Ngarambe, and another influential person who used to work at the commune and his name was Mathias Rubanguka, who was the accountant of the communal office.  There was yet another person, and one can say that he was their acolyte, and his name was Ngiruwonsanga.  These were people who were known in the entire commune and who, by the way, used to carry arms or weapons.
Q.	You say they used to carry weapons.  Are you in a position to describe the type of weapons that they used to carry?
A.	For instance, all communal policemen were armed with guns.  As for the other persons whom I would refer to as the acolytes, these were equipped with big clubs.  The accountant, on his part, had only grenades with him. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you be in a position, since you mentioned those persons and the authorities -- would you be in a position, therefore, to estimate, in approximate terms, the number of the local population that accompanied Brigadier Nyarwaya and the other four persons?
A.	I am not in a position to give you the number of the members of the ordinary citizens.  There were refugees in that region, and the refugees were the ones that were active and who were willing to collaborate with the brigadier.  As for the local population, it could be seen that they weren't keen to collaborate with the brigadier.
Q.	My question, Mr. Witness, was very precise.  Can you give an estimate -- and I'd like to make this clearer -- can you give an approximate number of persons accompanying the brigadier?
A.	There were very many refugees.  As for the ordinary members of the population, there were many of them as well.  I think I can estimate the figure at 200.  The figure was not less than 200 in any case.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think this is the appropriate time to take the break for recess for the day.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We'll take our recess now.  It will be a little longer than usual, as there's a medical commitment which we have to take.
(Court recessed at 1029H)
(Pages 11 to 16 by Maureen Dunn)




































(Court resumed at 1120H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now resume.  Ms. Fall, do you have an idea how much longer you are likely to be?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think perhaps within an hour, or perhaps a bit less, I will have finished with the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
As you know, we are -- we don't have the courtroom tomorrow morning.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President.  Should I cut short my cross-examination?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I wasn't minded to make an order for that issue, but if it's possible to complete the witness today, that will facilitate the trial generally.  
MS. FALL:
I will try, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Before the break, Witness, I was putting questions to you concerning the assault on Kayanga health centre, and you answered me that Brigadier Nyarwaya, communal policeman Nyarwaya, had obliged you to accompany him to that centre.  You gave us the name of the people who accompanied him, people known by the locals, and when I asked you to specify the approximate number of locals, you gave me the approximate figure of 200 people, thereabouts, or a bit less.  
A.	Yes, I think you have correctly summarised the point at which we had reached. 
Q.	For further precision, could you tell us between that figure of 200 that you gave us today and that of -- even if it is only approximate -- of 500 that you gave us on Tuesday, which is the figure that is the closest to the truth?  
A.	I think that as a reference point we should take that figure 200, inasmuch as some people managed to escape from Nyarwaya's clutches en route. 
Q.	Witness, you stated that when you arrived at the trading centre, you saw certain things, namely, that the patients were being brought out, or the people in the centre were brought out -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, this is the medical centre I think she's referring to.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	-- were brought out?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Can you give us a figure, even if only approximately, as to the number of people who were on the premises? 
A.	It is difficult for me to give an approximate -- give you the approximate number of patients at the health centre.  Someone from the nursing staff could provide further details or appropriate information on that topic, of course, but it is difficult for me to give you the approximate number you are asking for. 
Q.	Could you tell us whether the people that you saw taken out from the health centre -- could you once again tell us approximately how numerous they were?  Was it 10, less than 10, more than 10, 20?  
A.	I will try to give you an approximate figure.  I would say it was more than 10 but less than 20. 
Q.	Witness, you have stated that being part of the group that went to the health centre, you saw the beginning of the attack when the people were being brought out and at one point the communal policeman fired into the air, and that is when you were able to escape, to flee? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  However, I was not the only one to flee; other people who were afraid also fled. 
Q.	So, if I follow you correctly, Witness, in that attack you only saw people being taken out of the health centre and being struck as they did so, as they were being taken out? 
A.	Yes, they were struck, but also they were kicked. 
Q.	Witness, in your testimony yesterday you said that there were people that you knew, but you did not name them yesterday.  Would you -- could you -- would you be in a position today to give us their names?  Could you give us their names today? 
A.	Are you referring to the people I knew who were among the attackers, or among the people taken out of the health centre?  I know I did not give the names of the people taken out of the health centre.  I therefore stated that I knew certain people who were taken out of the health centre, and it is true that I did not give you the names of those that I knew, and I would like to say I did not know all the people who were taken out of the health centre. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would it be possible for you to actually give us names of those persons? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I know some of the persons who came from my area and who had been hospitalised at that health centre after having been struck by soldiers at Ndatemwa. 
Q.	Can you give us their names? 
A.	They were brothers, but I won't be in a position to tell you who was older or younger.  So these were two brothers, Rutembya and Rutembesa.  Their patient minders who were also their brothers -- brother was there and his name is Rutayasire.  And then there was the sister who had brought them food and whose name was Murakatete.  She was also present at the location. 
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, those persons that you knew are amongst the victims that were killed at the health centre of Kayanga? 
A.	Inevitably, those persons are amongst the Kayanga victims, given that after the war they were never seen again. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your testimony yesterday you stated that it was after having heard the gunshot that was fired by the brigadier that you took flight.  
A.	Yes, indeed.  Actually, we ran away, and I was not alone to run away.  There were many of us who did so. 
Q.	In your statement of 4 November you contended, in respect of your flight, without mentioning any gunshot, you said those people were being taken out of the premises, and that is when you took flight.  
A.	I probably forgot to mention that incident, but you should understand that we couldn't have been running away without any cause.  We were scared of Nyarwaya and we fled when he shot into the air.  And by the way, he had done the same thing during the Ndatemwa incident and that is why we were scared of him. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you did tell us that there was a crowd of about 200 persons, after having chosen between 200 and 500 a figure that you preferred, so there were about 200 people, which is quite a significant crowd.  Did Brigadier Nyarwaya have control over all those 200 persons? 
A.	You cannot understand what the situation was like, Counsel.  Those -- that person had become a wild animal.  He no longer had his human nature.  He had lost his humanity somewhat.  
Q.	Once again, Witness, can you please answer my question?  You did say that there were about 200 people, which is a significant crowd.  Did Brigadier Nyarwaya have control over all those 200 people at the same time? 
A.	Now, listen, he forced all those people to follow him.  Nobody followed him of their own volition, and I'm telling you the truth here.  He was like a rebel who had rebelled against the bourgmestre of the commune, and during that time of war, he was feared because he had forged a reputation of being a very strong person or a person that was hard to deal with. 
Q.	You have not addressed my question, Mr. Witness, which question is whether the brigadier was in a position to control the actions and behaviour of 200 people at the same time.  Were you at the front line when the attack was being launched to be in a position to tell us whether the brigadier had control over you, or not? 
A.	When he forced us to go up to towards the place of attack, he did so as a person working with the communal administration.  So he acted as if he was acting within the framework of his duties. 
Q.	Once again, Mr. Witness, is it so difficult for you to answer the questions that are put to you, or is it that you don't want to answer the specific question that I'm putting to you? 
A.	I really would like to answer your question, but apparently you don't seem to be understanding the way in which I answer your question.  If an official asked you to go here or there, what would you do if you were the one?  
Q.	You are not the person to be asking questions, but I am the one who is here to ask questions, so please answer the specific questions that I'm putting to you; that is, did Nyarwaya control everybody that was amongst the 200 persons, or was it because you were close to him that he could control your actions and behaviour? 
A.	Generally speaking, he had control over all of us. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do we therefore agree, when we say that when you fled, only -- all that was done was to bring out the patients and other persons from those premises, and when the massacres per se occurred, you were no longer present at the centre? 
A.	Yes, you are correct. 
Q.	So the events, that is, the massacres that took place at the centre, the massacres, therefore, were only talked to you about by other persons? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  But the information was given to me by my house servant who found me at the school where I had stopped, he told me that the fate of the children that were at the dispensary had been sealed. 
Q.	At what time did your domestic servant tell you the information, or at what specific point in time did he tell you about it? 
A.	The massacre took place on the Friday afternoon and I am almost sure that it was in the afternoon but not beyond 2 p.m.  It took place between 12:30 and 2 p.m. or between 12:30 and 1:30 p.m.  The massacres did not take place after 2 p.m. 
Q.	You were not present, but you are in a position to affirm that the massacre did not take place after 2 p.m.? 
A.	Absolutely so.  The massacres occurred before 2 p.m., but it wasn't before midday.  The massacres took place between 12, midday, and 2 p.m. 
Q.	Mr. President -- I'm sorry, Mr. Witness.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to crave your indulgence here.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness --
A.	Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	-- why do you insist in saying that the massacre did not take place before midday? 
A.	I am insisting on this because I am relying on the time that I got to the roadblock, and I am putting that time on balance with the time that I left or the time I reached their house where I went to look for food.  And I am telling you that those two events occurred before midday; that is, before the attack. 
Q.	Well, I don't quite follow you there.  You are talking about the events that occurred which are the events that occurred before midday; that is, before the attack.  I don't quite understand you.  Are you talking about the massacres which, as you say -- now, please let me finish -- as you say did not take place before midday, or are you talking about events that you witnessed? 
A.	No.  I am telling you what happened in the afternoon, between 12 midday and 2 p.m.; that is what I've just told you.  I am not talking about the morning, that is, the time before midday. 
Q.	And can you recall to us what happened between 12 and 2 p.m.? 
A.	The person I talked to you about intercepted people at the roadblock and asked them to go and find the Inkotanyi at the dispensary.  Now, somebody told him that there were no Inkotanyi at the dispensary, but then he went with those people to the dispensary and they brought out the people who were there at the dispensary.  This, in summary, are the events that occurred that afternoon.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were not present when the massacres were actually perpetrated at the Kayanga centre.  You yourself made it clear that you left well before then.  Under those circumstances, do you know or not whether other people, apart from the group you mentioned, subsequently were able to go to the premises? 
A.	I know the first group; that is, the group of persons that I left there and the group that my domestic servant saw, when he told me that the children had been taken out of the dispensary and taken to the other side of the road.  And my domestic servant, in relating what had taken place to me, insisted on the actions and gestures of the officials. 
Q.	I am going to repeat my question, Mr. Witness:  Was it possible for you, who wasn't present at the time of the perpetration of the massacres, to see the people who had come and not informed about them?  Is it a possibility; yes or no? 
A.	Yes, it is possible.  If another person got there subsequently, I wouldn't have been able to tell.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would not like to dwell on this because indeed you are not an eyewitness to the massacres that took place at the health centre.  What you saw was related to you later by your domestic servant.  

Mr. Witness, prior to the statement of 4 November, have you had to talk about the events that took place at the Kayanga health centre?  
A.	You're saying that I have to talk about the health centre?  But who would have put questions to me on that, Counsel?  
Q.	I am going to repeat the question to you.  Probably, you did not understand it well.  I was asking you if, prior to your statement of 4 November 2005, you have had an opportunity or not to talk about the events at the health centre.  
A.	I am not the only person who has had to talk about the events at the health centre; other people also talk about the events.  Many people talk about the events.  These are events that occurred in broad daylight and virtually all the inhabitants of that area talk about the said events, and I am telling you this very frankly and sincerely. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you at one point or another, prior to that statement, had to talk about the events that took place at the Kayanga health centre to the Defence counsel? 
A.	Yes, I remember having asked him questions, or having asked Defence counsel questions because he was asking questions to me concerning my identity and my private life.  So I asked him whether he did not have any interest in having me talk about the events that took place in my area.  So I am the one who took the initiative to talk about those events to the counsel. 
Q.	Can you tell us at what specific time you took that first initiative to talk to the counsel about those events? 
A.	I took the decision to talk about them after having become aware that I could come here to Arusha, because he had put questions to me in respect of my private life and my particulars, and that is when I decided I had to talk to him also about the events that took place in my area. 
Q.	And can you tell us at what point in time that happened? 
A.	As soon as I knew that I could come here to Arusha, I decided to talk about them.  I think I got here on the 2nd.  On the 1st we were accommodated in Kigali; I think it was a Tuesday.  And on the Friday of the week before, I knew that I could come to Arusha and that is when I decided to think, and I told myself since the questions concerning my private life have been put to me, since questions are put to me concerning what my personal experience was, why wouldn't I talk about other events that took place in my area, since all the members of the population had problems that were caused by the brigadier and whose behaviour was not appreciated by all the members of the population?  
Q.	So before the statement that you had to give, as you said, in November, so after having reflected, you hadn't mentioned what you knew about those events before then? 
A.	Everybody in the Kayanga, Rutongo and Gasabo areas discussed those events. 
Q.	Well, I put a question to you and we are talking about your interviews and discussions with Counsel Hooper.  Do you mean that before you did not make reference to the events of the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	No, since he talked to me about my personal experience, what I have witnessed, especially in connection with my family. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, during -- or in your statement of 21 June 2003, did you not at the end of your statement make it clear that you were aware of the events that took place at the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	From what I observed, the counsel was interested in knowing my personal experience and in having details concerning my family, and that is why I did not talk about them. 
Q.	Did you, or not, talk about what you knew of the events that took place at the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	Yes, very recently I have talked to him about them, and I told him that since he put questions to me concerning my personal experience and details concerning my family, I told him that, in my opinion, this was not enough because I also had information on the events that took place elsewhere. 
Q.	Once again, Mr. Witness, and I will be clear and I will repeat my question:  During your interview of 21 June 2003 with Counsel Hooper, did you not make reference to what you knew in respect of the events that took place at the Kayanga health centre? 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry -- 
THE WITNESS:
I am repeating this to you, madam.  
MR. HOOPER:
The witness has been asked this series of questions and stood firm, and so I don't add at all to his evidence.  But we have a copy of his statement -- I think the Bench has it as well -- dated the 21st of June 2003. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President.  
MR. HOOPER:
And there is no mention there of the Kayanga health centre.  The first time any allegation was made concerning André Rwamakuba and the Kayanga health centre was in a will-say statement from Witness GIN provided in April 2004, the day before she gave her testimony.  There had never, ever been any reference to Kayanga health centre and the Accused André Rwamakuba.  It emerged just last year for the first time.  So when I met this witness in Kigali in 2003, there was no allegation concerning any event in Kayanga against the Accused.  Why on earth would we be interested in it?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would indeed like that Counsel Hooper should stop answering in the place of the witness.  I asked a specific question.  I am going to ask another one that may be more specific.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, from your statement of 21 June 2003, at the end thereof, when you accepted to come and give evidence, you said you knew or you were aware of the killings that took place at the health centre.  Did you, or not, state that Nyarwaya was responsible for the murder of Tutsis?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I think a similar difficulty has arisen as happened with Ms. Cummings-John.  In serving -- this is an unsigned statement.  It is effectively my note, that is, the note of 2003, and it should have reached you in the form of "Concluding statement taken by DH JMN, 21st of June '03", and then "signed, witnessed, date."  That was never done because this was drafted back in London much later and never re-presented in Kinyarwanda, or any other form, to this witness.  

In serving witness statements, what you have added to that is a computer note which you can see I'm holding up, which was taken by Ms. Pouplard in July this year, when I met this witness again in Kigali.  It is five yards -- six sentences, if that, "Ref:  Statement in David's computer.  W" -- that's the witness -- "knows many people who should be held responsible for the events in Kayanga and Ndatemwa, KHC", Kayanga health centre.  "Nyarwaya was responsible; that's why his sister was killed later by the RPF, and some Tutsis.  The date of the killings was approximately the 14th or the 15th of April '94.  Willing to come as a protected witness.  Arrangements should be made later."  

It wasn't a long meeting, and that was the first indication I had that this witness knew something of the Kayanga health centre.  We've made the decision to bring him here.  I knew the general parameters of his evidence, and when he came here we met, longer than the 15 minutes that he's spoken about; my recollection, about an hour, and we spoke about events.  And out of those notes I made last week I extracted those notes relevant to the Kayanga health centre, never seen by this witness, though my fair recollection of what he said.  Those two have been served on the Prosecution.  So that's why that's attached here.  

You look at the original, as it were, on my computer.  What you have to his 2003 statement, as a matter of convenience, has been cut and pasted.  The complete record that I have is from Ms. Svetlana Pouplard which she transferred to my computer, and that's the first time -- the first time this witness mentioned Kayanga health centre, to my recollection, to me.  

And I stress again, the time I'd seen him -- and only time I'd seen him before -- Kayanga health centre was not on the indictment, was not a charge; no witness spoke of it.  It all came about with GIN's will-say.  For the very first time she mentioned it in April, last year.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you for those clarifications, but I am convinced that the Chamber will take note of the manner in which materials or documents are disclosed to the Prosecutor.  We have cut-and-paste notes of statements made by the witness arising from questions that were put to him.  I think you could allow me to finish my statement.  I didn't interrupt you.  So these are cut-and-paste portions of statements that he gave in answer to questions that were put to him, and I'm talking about cut-and-paste portions of statements because these questions were put to him, and I think the jurisprudence of this Tribunal are there to ascertain this.  So the statements of the witness are cut-and-paste portions that the Defence have had to serve.  

I think, Mr. President, Your Honours, that in order to ensure that there is equality or fairness in the treatment of the parties, that Mr. Hooper should disclose the original statements of witnesses to us.  They should convey to us questions and answers that represent statements so that we can also have the possibility of doing our job the way it should be done.  This, I think, usually explains the problems that we have on the Prosecution side, and I take advantage of this situation to mention the problems we have with the statements that are disclosed to us by Counsel Hooper.  

With your leave, therefore, I wish to proceed. 
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly, but I feel that your express or implicit criticism is unfounded here.  And, as I understand it, the Chamber will have the statements that have been served on the Prosecution as part of disclosure.  They were served, in fact, in electronic format from London, and where possible, I reduced the filings by compounding files.  So the first statement that was served is a statement which does bear a date on its original, which I believe the Prosecution now have.  The original is in Kinyarwanda, and as I understand it, signed by the witness, and it was taken by the investigator some years ago.  And you can see from the format of it that, in fact, at that time I'd requested the investigator to follow a pro forma of questions.  So the questions are in Kinyarwanda, "Have you heard of Dr. André Rwamakuba?"  Answer:  "No."  "What do you know of him?"  Blah, blah, blah.  And it's a fairly short document.  That was the first contact with this witness.  

The next document you have is headed "Witness Statement", and as I've explained, I hope, in the context of previous witnesses, at the end, though it says "signed" "witnessed" and "date", there is no signature to that.  The document's in English.  And what this is, is in fact a statement drafted by me from my notes.  So I've met the witness, made notes in one of my blue counsel notebooks in pen -- or perhaps Mr. O'Shea has, whichever it is -- and from that we drafted, in what we hope is an articulate and consecutive manner, giving all the relevant aspects that we consider relevant in respect of the witness, and it was done in the hope and expectation that one day the opportunity would be done -- for our benefit -- to have the statement signed, because it's normally better to have a signed statement before you call a witness here, in case they contradict something that is prejudicial to the Accused.  But, in fact, because of this method, these statements -- this statement, as far as I know, has never been read back to the Accused, certainly not by me because I wouldn't take time out like that and I don't work like that.  

We meet him again in Kigali and that's when you get -- or I've got -- the short note of that meeting.  And you've got all that; it's all been served on you, but it was compounded with the other statement for convenience sake because it meant sending only one file through e-mail and court management services was struggling with what had been sent in any event, as the Chamber may know.  

Subsequently I've met this witness in the safe house.  We've talked about a number of things.  We haven't just talked about Kayanga health centre, but we have discussed Kayanga health centre, and because that was not in his original statement and only briefly referred to, as you can see, in the July note, we provided you, the Prosecution, with his full account to us as it was recorded.  

Now, the only statement -- the only statement -- I've come to the end anyway.  The only statement that he has ever signed or been asked to sign, as I recall, would have been the one to the investigator four or five years ago.  

Now, because of that, it's misleading to refer to anything other than something signed by an accused as his statement.  It's, at best, an accurate record by counsel, but it's essentially counsel's note, and we don't try to get it wrong but inevitably you can, through an interpreter.  This witness has never had the opportunity to go through those documents line by line and correct them and sign them.  So, to that extent, it's unfair to refer to them as his statements.  They're counsel's notes of meetings.  

Where the opportunity arises, conveniently, for the witness to sign his statement, they sign it.  But often that's only when they're speaking in Kinyarwanda and they can read there and then what is written because we don't take printers with us and anything we put on our laptops can't be signed; of course, it can't.  And it's normally in English, or French.  

Now, I mention this because with future witnesses it may assist if that's borne in mind, and in particular if you have a statement and after the "signed" "dated", there's that little note, it's almost certainly Ms. Pouplard's note of meetings in July.  We've met it before, and that's what's happened here.  And you can inspect my laptop if you entertain any doubt about that in respect of those witnesses.  
MS. FALL:
I thank counsel, my learned friend, for that information.  I think that the Trial Chamber would note with me that all that you've just said is but a précis of what you put into the statement, and I understand that more and more you tend to speak in the witness's stead.  So you are testifying in the witness's stead, and I should also like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to the fact -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I don't think that comment is called for at all in these circumstances.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I should nonetheless, with regard to these statements, be enlightened to the extent that 95 per cent of the statements disclosed to us by the Defence were statements that were never signed, even if they date from 2003, and after the second meeting of counsel with the witness, the statements were never signed.  And I am indeed speaking of statements.  I will continue.  I think note was taken of that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, Mr. Hooper explained that it is not reasonable to describe his note as a witness statement, and I think that's quite a fair comment.  Now, the rules that govern these proceedings do not require Defence counsel to serve witness statements on the Prosecutor, so what has happened is not inconsistent with the rules that govern the practice and procedure here.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that on this point on the Prosecution side we might have a motion to raise before the Trial Chamber, shortly.  

So I will continue my cross-examination.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So, Witness, to finish with the Kayanga health centre topics, you agree with me when I say that you gave a narrative of those events only on the 4th of November 2005? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And the information you give only concerns the beginning of the attack at that health centre? 
A.	Yes, you're right, I narrated the events until the time when the people inside the health centre had been dragged out. 
Q.	You also said that not having been present at the time of the massacre, it was possible that other people could have arrived at the health centre without your knowing of it? 
A.	Yes, I told you that that was possible. 
Q.	Witness, I will go on to another topic concerning the list of witnesses of certain people that was shown to you and in respect of which you gave your judgement concerning certain people you considered that, in fact, they were criminals.  I will not return to those people by name, but I think you did at least mention four people which were -- two you named on a piece of paper as being those who participated in the crime committed against your family.  Can you tell us how you obtained that information on those people? 
A.	One of those people discussed it with his concubine, and that concubine and I have a relationship.  That person spoke to that concubine and does not live near me.  So I am related to that concubine and she spoke to me thereof. 
Q.	So it is only the concubine that mentioned these events? 
A.	Yes.  The concubine told me that her lover had told him what he had done -- had told her what he had done. 
Q.	I do not think it is necessary to go further into details as to the source of your information.  

Mr. President, is it correct that all these people you mentioned as being criminals have never been to prison?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I am not flattered that you keep on referring to the witness as President.  
MS. FALL:
I am most aggrieved.  Please forgive me, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness.  
A.	Yes, Madam Prosecutor?  
Q.	Is it correct that the people that you accuse of having committed those crimes were never detained, were never imprisoned, did not "do time"?  
A.	No, no one arrested them and imprisoned them. 
Q.	And those heinous, odious crimes, they committed them but were never -- but they were never imprisoned.  And you, who did nothing, spent six years inside, "in the can", in prison? 
A.	Yes.  That is understandable.  For other crimes that are not considered as crimes of genocide, people are not arrested, but there will come a phase when people who committed crimes not of genocide will be arrested and tried, we hope. 
Q.	Witness, according to what you told us of what those people did at the time they did it, it is part of the crime of genocide.  
A.	According to what we see in Rwanda, there were people who committed genocide and other war crimes.  It was explained to us that now we are in the phase of judging the people who committed genocide, and they have explained to us that there will also be a phase where the administration will take care of the people who committed war crimes. 
Q.	You have still not answered my precise -- my question precisely.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, perhaps it's time to break.  I have three or four more questions on this topic before coming to the last topic of my cross-examination.  I don't know whether I can finish with this topic or if we have to wait until Monday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have to stop now.  We will take the break until Monday.  

Mr. Witness, we don't have access to the courtroom this afternoon or tomorrow.  The trial will resume on Monday morning.  As I mentioned yesterday, you remain a witness during this break, as long as it is.  You are required not to discuss the case, or your testimony, with anybody during this or any other adjournment.  Are there any things that we need to discuss before we rise for the weekend?  
MR. HOOPER:
Just so I can make it plain that as this witness is giving his evidence, I'm certainly not able to talk to him, or any of the Defence team, and I mention that because there's four days now before we'll come together again.  I don't want him to think we've just forgotten, neglected him.  He's got his earphones off now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I thank you for being attentive to the idea of removing your earphones when legal matters are being discussed, but on this occasion Mr. Hooper wanted to make a comment which was directed, I think, for your hearing.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  It was merely this, speaking, as it were, through you, Mr. President, to the witness that amongst of course the people who cannot speak or see him at this time is myself and any member of the Defence team, and that's a rule, and an appropriate rule, and I mention it because I wouldn't want the witness to go away now for three or four days and think we were just neglecting him -- far from that.  But we cannot speak to you until you have finished your evidence and that, we anticipate, will be fairly early on Monday morning.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now take the adjournment and we resume on Monday.  
(Court adjourned at 1230H)
