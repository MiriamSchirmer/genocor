MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 12th of May 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you begin your testimony, you are going to have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.
(Declaration made by Aurore Uwase in English) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the English booth, Mr. President, there is a feeling that the witness is tuned to the Kinyarwanda booth; whereas, she seems to want to speak in English.  Maybe that should be clarified. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping)...give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by the counsel designated for that purpose. 

Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.



AURORE UWASE, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Madam Aurore, good morning.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Are you okay?  Is everything fine with you? 
A.	Yes.  I'm okay. 
Q.	There is a document in front of you which has particulars of your identification.  Do you have that document in front of you? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Could you please cross-check the content.  If there are any corrections you would like to make, let us know.  In case there are no corrections you need to make, please sign the document.  
A.	The document seems to be correct.  I will sign it. 
Q.	You would have to indicate today's date on the document.  
A.	Okay. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would be applying to tender that document as an exhibit, Exhibit D. NZ797. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ797 admitted) 
MR. NIMY: 
I'm obliged.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Madam Aurore, can you give the Chamber your academic and professional background.  
A.	I left Rwanda when I was in the secondary year of the secondary school -- sorry -- second year of secondary school.  And I was a student at the Saint André college.  And when we left Rwanda for Zaire, I didn't attend -- I don't believe I attended any school there in Zaire.  In Cameroon I attended, I think, one year -- I think, like, a year of secondary school and then also in Benin one year.  

When I left for the Netherlands, I started high school again, and I graduated within two years in 2002.  And I continued to University of Maastricht, and I graduated in 2006 and -- a Bachelor of Science degree.  And I have a Master of Science degree from the University of Amsterdam awarded in 2008.  And I'm currently studying at the London Graduate School of Management, and on the 5th of May 2010, I was awarded a -- a degree in advanced studies.  And I'm still writing my thesis to accomplish a doctorate in business administration.  I currently work in Holland in Amstelveen at HP as an operational account management adviser. 
Q.	Very well.  Thank you very much.  Tell the Chamber, where were you in the evening of the 6th of April 1994 and in whose company were you?  
A.	I was at home, at our home in Gishushu, Kigali.  And I was with my family:  My father, my mother, my siblings, like, all six children; my two cousin, Florence et Fabrice; my uncle, ******************* a couple of domestics; and three military officer, I believe.
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber where your residence was located.  
A.	Our residence was facing the CND, the parliament, where the FPR -- RPR -- RPR (sic) soldiers were resident. 
Q.	And how did you get the news of President Habyarimana's death on the 6th of April? 
A.	It was 9 o'clock in the evening, and our father called us together, and he announced that the presidential plane was shot. 
Q.	And what was your reaction to that? 
A.	We were completely shocked because we knew, like, how -- how tense the situation was, and with the RPF soldiers next door, we were worried for our safety. 
Q.	Okay.  What about your father, Nzirorera?  Did he leave the house in the night of that 6th of April 1994? 
A.	No, he did not. 
Q.	So you remained at home with your parents that evening in the presence of Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  Our mother asked us to be prepared in case we could have an occasion to leave the house.  So we stay late -- we stayed up late at night.  But no car came.  Nothing came.  So we went to bed. 
Q.	And what about the following day, Madam Aurore?  What did you do? 
A.	Around six in the morning, our mother wake us up suddenly, and she said there was a car that came to pick us up, so we should just stand as we are and leave the house. 
Q.	Did I hear you say in the morning of the 6th?  Were you talking about the morning of the 7th? 
A.	I'm sorry.  I meant the 7th. 
Q.	So -- thank you.  So you were saying that in the morning of the 7th -- could you continue with your testimony, Madam Aurore.  
A.	Yes.  So we stood up.  We were still in our pajamas.  And we went out, and there was a military Jeep that came to pick us up.  We all got into the car.  And we sat really low.  And we left the house with all the eight children, our six and the cousins; and my mother; my father; two military accompanied us; and one of the domestic, the female domestic. 
Q.	You mean that all those people got into one vehicle?  How many vehicles did you have? 
A.	Many vehicle.  But we only left with two of them plus the Jeep that the military brought us. 
Q.	Does that add up to three, if my arithmetic is correct? 
A.	Yes.  We left with three vehicles in total. 
Q.	Madam Aurore, I thought I heard that you were in Mr. Nzirorera's green Mercedes Jeep.  Would that be correct? 
A.	I believe so. 
Q.	And what is the passenger capacity of a Jeep like the one you used?  How many passengers could it take? 
A.	It could easily contain, like, eight people because in the behind there were extra chairs. 
Q.	And when you left, Madam Aurore, what was your destination? 
A.	We headed towards the residence of Setako. 
Q.	Are you referring to Colonel Setako? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And when you got to Colonel Sekato -- Setako's home -- sorry -- who received you there? 
A.	His children and his wife were waiting for us. 
Q.	Did all of you remain at Setako's residence? 
A.	No.  As soon as we arrived, my father left. 
Q.	Very well.  And you remained with the Setako family right up till when? 
A.	We stayed until the 11th of April. 
Q.	And thereafter what did you do? 
A.	On the 11 of April, my brother -- godfather, Higaniro, he arranged a cortège, like, many cars, who could have taken away a couple of families.  So we left with Higaniro, me; my sister, Flora; my brother, Oreste; and my cousin, Florence.
Q.	Tell us, again, how many children in your family left Kigali on the 11th of April with Higaniro? 
A.	In total four.  Just named them.
Q.	Okay.  And where did you go along with the Higaniro family? 
A.	We went to -- to his house in Gisenyi. 
Q.	And you were in Higaniro's house in Gisenyi up till when? 
A.	Somewhere in May we stayed -- remained there. 
Q.	Did it happen that you never saw Nzirorera and the rest of your family members? 
A.	When we left Higaniro's house in May, we joined our family in Gisenyi at my father's house.  And we saw our family there. 
Q.	Very well.  Madam Aurore, to your recollection, did you have a house in Kiyovu near the 
	German embassy? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You never heard mention of any such house? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Aurore.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy. 
Do any of the other Defence teams have any questions for this witness?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I have no questions.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have no questions either. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you very much. 

Madam Witness, you now -- now have to respond to the Prosecutor, who will have an opportunity to cross-examine you. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like to ask the registry how long I was in my direct examination. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
17 minutes, 1-7 minutes.  Thank you.
MR. SENDZE:  
Good morning, Mr. President, Honourable Judges, members of the Defence teams.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, Ms. Uwase.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	My name is Takeh Sendze, and I'm representing the Prosecutor.  I have a few questions for you.  

You have testified that, as soon as you arrived Mr. Setako's house, your father left.  Could you please tell us where he went to. 
A.	He did not share that information with us. 
Q.	You have also said that you left on the 11th of April 1994 from Kigali to Gisenyi.  Are you sure about that date? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	We have information from your sister, Flora, that you left Kigali on the 9th of April 1994.  Could you have been mistaken about the date? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Her information is, therefore, not accurate.  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	I believe it's not. 
Q.	And you left Kigali with your three siblings.  Is that what I heard? 
A.	Yes; my brother, Oreste; my sister, Flora; and my cousin, Florence. 
Q.	Did you leave with your mother? 
A.	I do not believe that she was in the same car, and we did not leave with her. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the witness kindly repeat her answer for the booth. 
THE WITNESS:
She was not in the same car with us.  So I do not believe that she -- she left with us. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Do you remember any other persons who travelled with you, apart from your sister, Flora; your cousin; and Higaniro? 
A.	I do not recall the exact names. 
Q.	But when you arrived Gisenyi, were you there with your mother? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You travelled to the Netherlands sometime in 1998; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And your reason for travelling to the Netherlands was to seek asylum; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And in that process you were interviewed by the immigration authorities of that country? 
A.	Yes, I was. 
Q.	It is true, is it not, that, when you were asked to give details about your family members, you declared a certain Bitihuse to be your father? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	That was a lie, wasn't it? 
A.	Bitihuse was, in fact, my grandfather. 
Q.	He was not your father? 
A.	No.  
Q.	When you were also asked about the whereabouts of your father, you told the immigration authorities that your father had been killed by the RPF in 1994.  Isn't that what you said? 
A.	I do not recall that information. 
Q.	And I put it to you that that is what you told them because I have the record here with me.  Do you have any reason to dispute what I am suggesting? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, when was the -- after leaving Kigali for Gisenyi, when was the last time you saw your mother -- or when was the first time you saw your mother after you left Kigali? 
A.	I believe I saw her in Gisenyi. 
Q.	When? 
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	Even an approximate date?  
A.	No. 
Q.	When was the last time you saw your father, Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Can you please clarify which period or -- after Kigali?  
Q.	After -- yes.  When you left Kigali for Gisenyi, when next did you see your father? 
A.	I saw him occasionally at our Gisenyi house. 
Q.	Occasionally?  He didn't stay with you? 
A.	I didn't see him that often. 
Q.	And do you know where he was during the times when he was not at home in Gisenyi? 
A.	No.  
MR. SENDZE:
That would be all, Mr. President. 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Mr. Nimy, do you have any redirect examination?  
MR. NIMY: 
I have no re-examination, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Madam Witness, your testimony is completed. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may be excused. 
THE WITNESS:
I have another request, if I can see my father later. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Yes.  Permission -- the registrar will make appropriate arrangements. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
(Witness excused) 
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I would like to make an application to admit the immigration record I referred to, which is an interview dated the 17th of April 1998.  I only have it in Dutch, but I promise to provide an English translation subsequently, just so that it's part of the record. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does -- is the relevant information already on the record?  
MR. SENDZE:
The date -- the date of the document is important, Mr. President, and I did not raise that with the witness.  So unless we can -- I can state the date for the record and then.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We think you can do that. 
MR. SENDZE:
Okay.  The date of the immigration record I referred to with the witness is 17th of April 1998.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes.  Mr. President, I have no objection.  These are immigration documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be P. 490 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  No.  No.  We -- we have not admitted the document. 

Yes.  Mr. Nimy, where do you go from here?  
MR. NIMY: 
The next witness is Kalisa, Flora.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you begin your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.
(Declaration made by Flora Kalisa in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will now give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by counsel. 
Mr. Nimy. 

THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.
FLORA KALISA, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Ms. Flora, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Are you okay? 
A.	Yes, I am.  Thank you. 
Q.	Ms. Flora, a brief comment, since both of us are speaking French, when I put a question to you, you observe a pause before answering the question.  That pause enables the interpreters to translate.  And I will do the same thing.  When you answer, I would pause before asking your next question for the same reasons.  Is that clear? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Ms. Flora, can you tell the Court your academic and professional backgrounds.  
MR. NIMY:
Sorry.  I think I went too fast.
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have a sheet before you?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	That's where we'll begin.  You're going to go through that sheet.  All information identifying you should be on that sheet.  Verify, go through it, and see whether all the identifying information is on it.  
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	Now, write a date on it.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness says she doesn't have a pen. 
MR. NIMY: 
Registry, please, can you help the witness.  Can you give a pen to the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Today's the 12th, is it?  Is this -- is today the 12th?  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Yes.  Have you signed it? 
A.	Yes.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, we tender into evidence this document as D. NZ798. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ798 admitted) 
MR. NIMY: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  Can I continue, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Ms. Flora, can you tell the Court your -- what your educational and professional backgrounds are.  
A.	I went to private school in Rugunga.  And when I left Rwanda, I was in year 4 (sic), secondary school.  Thereafter, I continued my education in Cameroon right up to the upper 6th, the French system.  I had my baccalaureate in mathematics.  Thereafter, I continued higher education in Belgium, and I completed in 2003 as electronics engineer.  

Thereafter, it was not easy for me to find work in -- in Belgium.  So I spent three years without employment.  In the final analysis I was able to find a job.  I worked as an analyst programmer in a credit company.  Since -- unfortunately, since the economic crisis, I am out once more on the 
job market looking for a job. 
Q.	Very well.  Ms. Flora, where were you on the evening of the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	We were home.  We were home and -- at Nyarutarama. 
Q.	Can you be more precise?  Where exactly was home, or where was the house located? 
A.	It was near the parliament.  We were live -- we were living near the Rwandan parliament at Gishushu.  That is also -- it is also called Gishushu. 
Q.	Gishushu, if my memory serves me right, is in Kigali; am I right? 
A.	Yes, it is in Kigali. 
Q.	How did you come to hear or learn of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	In fact, it is our father who informed of -- who informed us of his death on the evening when we were about to go to bed.  He told us that the president's plane had been shot down. 
Q.	And after hearing the news, what did you do? 
A.	First of all, we were shocked, all the more so as the RPF army was occupying the parliament building.  Since there were rumours that the RPF troops went out at night, we feared that they would come out.  But, thereafter, we went to bed.  That's it. 
Q.	None of you left the house that evening; is that right? 
A.	That's right.  None of us left the house.  In fact, we feared that there would be an ambush because it was already dark.  So my parents decided that we had to stay home because that was safer. 
Q.	So did you stay home throughout that night right up to the morning, together with your parents, Nzirorera as well as your mother? 
A.	Yes.  We stayed home with my parents, that is, my father, my mother; the six of us; our two cousins; soldiers; domestic servants; my father's half-sister.  Yes. 
Q.	And in the morning, the morning of the 7th of April, what did you do? 
A.	On the 7th of April, there was a military vehicle which arrived very early in the morning to come and pick us up.  We were still sleeping because it was still very early.  So we were woken up, and we were told, "Come quickly.  We have to leave."  So we left. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court the direction or the destination for which you left.  
A.	We went to Setako's family because they were our friends.  They were downtown.  So we went in the direction of downtown, that is, the centre of the town. 
Q.	When you say Setako, are you referring to Colonel Setako? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Thank you.  Once you arrived in the residence of Colonel Setako, who welcomed you? 
A.	Their children, the family.  We went to join their children.  Since we were still wearing our nightgowns, they gave us some clothes to put on. 
Q.	Did you stay there? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Everyone?  All of you, including your father? 
A.	We stayed, but my father left after some time.  We only saw him again at around midday. 
Q.	You should pause after my question.  Now, at the residence of Colonel Setako, did you meet people there? 
A.	Yes.  But we did not know them. 
Q.	Until when did you stay with Colonel Setako's family? 
A.	Until the 11th.  Until the 11th.  Thereafter, we left for Gisenyi.  We left with the family -- or we went to the family of Alphonse Igarino (sic) in Gisenyi.  
Q.	Is that the person you are referring to? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you remember, if you can, how many children of your family left Kigali on the 11th of April 1994 with Alphonse Igarino? 
A.	In fact, it was the elder children, that is, we the bigger children, my brother, my elder brother, myself, and Aurore, whom you have seen, and one of my cousins, Florence. 
Q.	So the older children, if I understood you well; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, the older children. 
Q.	And where did you go to? 
A.	We went to his residence in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Until when did you stay there in his residence? 
A.	We stayed there until my parents -- until our parents also arrived in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Can you remind the Court the date.  Can you remind the Court of the date.  
A.	I do not remember the exact date, but it was in the month of May.  Yes.  I think it was in the month of May.  I do not remember the exact date. 
Q.	When you say May, do you mean May 1994? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And when your parents arrived, Nzirorera was also there; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Ms. Flora, in Kiyovu near the German embassy, did you have a house? 
A.	No, as far as I know.  As far as I know, we didn't have a house there.  In fact, my father was building a Gishushu house and for some time went to live in Kiyovu.  So I think if he had a house there, we would have gone to live there instead of renting the house. 
Q.	So if I understand you correctly, you did not have a house near the German embassy in Kiyovu? 
A.	No, we did not, as far as I know. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Ms. Flora.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is there any examination from the other Defence teams?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I have no questions for this witness. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I don't have questions either for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Mr. President, the examination-in-chief lasted 15 minutes.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You now have to answer questions from the Prosecutor. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, Ms. Kalisa.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	My name is Takeh Sendze, and I represent the Prosecutor.  You have testified that your parents had another house in Kiyovu.  Could you please tell us where this house was located.  
A.	No.  I did not say that they had a house there.  In fact, they did not have a house in Kiyovu.  I was saying that, if we had had a house in Kiyovu, we would not have been renting a house, because, before living in Gishushu, my father was renting a house in Kiyovu.  Therefore, had he had a house, he would not have been renting a house in Kiyovu. 
Q.	You are coming to us today from Belgium; is that true? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And you are there because you sought asylum and have been granted asylum in that country? 
A.	Yes.  I sought political asylum.  I was granted it.  And I naturalised.  So I have Belgian nationality. 
Q.	When you were being questioned by the Belgian authorities about the happenings of April 1994, you told them in an interview dated 15th of December 1999 that you left Kigali for Gisenyi on the 9th of April 1994.  Today you have testified that you left Kigali on the 11th of April 1994.  
A.	Yes.  Yes. 
Q.	So you have provided inconsistent information in respect of when you left Kigali in April 1994.  Is that because you have tried to harmonise your testimony with that of your sister who just testified? 
A.	No.  No.  No.  In fact, I don't remember having said the 9th. 
Q.	Let me refresh your memory.  
MR. SENDZE:
Issa, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Perhaps there must have been an error because we were interviewed, but I was not the one who wrote the report.  It's someone else who wrote the report, the person who was opposite me.  And I confirm that this is not my handwriting here.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	But if -- if you turn to the second sheet of that document and look at the last -- the last line on that page.  You confirm that the information recorded there is that you left Kigali on the 9th of April 1994; correct? 
A.	Where is that?  I cannot see that. 
Q.	Last -- last line of page 2.  
A.	Page 2?  No.  I can't see. 
Q.	Are you looking at page 2? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So look at the bottom.  
A.	I have, "Two days later the situation -- the situation was aggravated." 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	I do not see the 11th. 
Q.	Now, before that line -- 
A.	Oh.  No.  I do not remember.  You would see that this was added.  It was -- it is not on the same line.  That's what I see here. 
Q.	You started by talking about the 7th of April.  And you said that you left and sought refuge in Kiyovu.  Then you go ahead to say two days after, which means the 9th.  From the 7th two days after is the 9th.  That is when your father sent you to Gisenyi.  That is what is recorded on that document; correct? 
A.	Yes.  But this is not correct. 
Q.	You are making that correction now? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  In 1994 -- 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	-- you were aware that young Tutsis were killed in Rwanda; correct? 
A.	In fact, being aware?  No.  I wouldn't say that we were aware.  We were in Kiyovu and waiting for arms -- we heard weapons, but we didn't know what was happening.  We were somewhere.  We heard gunfire.  But we didn't know what was happening. 
Q.	But you were informed of what was happening? 
A.	By who?  No.  In fact, we were home.  We were playing with Setako's children.  
Q.	Ms. Kalisa, that is a document that was generated by the Belgian authorities when they were examining your asylum application; correct? 
A.	That is totally false.  In fact, no.  This is totally false.  Who typed this?  This is the first time I'm seeing this document. 
Q.	We obtained this document along with your other immigration records.  Could you please read the last paragraph that is highlighted in yellow on the first page, please.  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	That paragraph -- read the entire paragraph slowly, please.  
A.	"As concerns his (sic) implication -- involvement in genocide, he was very young and cut away from the world.  It is after leaving that he understood that innocent people had been killed and not those responsible -- had been told them by their parents." 
Q.	So that paragraph says you were informed -- 
A.	"As concerns his (sic) involvement in genocide, she was very young at that time, and she was cut away from the world of adult people.  It was when she was leaving Rwanda that you understood that innocent people had been killed and it was not the traitors who killed as -- the traitors who were killed, as the parents had told her." 
Q.	So in that paragraph we understand that your parents -- Mr. Nzirorera had informed you -- 
A.	Sir, I have never said that, and I do not know who typed this.  This is the first time that I'm seeing this.  And you are the one telling me that this comes from my file.  I never said that myself.  And why did -- and why did I not get to sign it if I am the one who said it?  So I challenge what is contained therein.  You are making me say things about something I am seeing for the first time?  This is the first time I'm seeing this document. 
Q.	Did your parents tell you that those who were being killed in 1994 were traitors? 
A.	No.  No. 
Q.	So you are telling us that, first, the immigration authorities falsely recorded the date you left Kigali and now in their assessment of your file they have also falsely recorded what you supposingly (sic) had told them about those who had died or those who had been killed? 
A.	I contest and challenge this paragraph, and I am going to go to the immigration to tell them that I challenge it.  This is not from me.  

As concerns the date, there might be an error.  I do not know.  I no longer quite recall.  

But this I challenge.  Somebody typed this.  Somebody else typed this, not me.  It might perhaps have been what the person understood about what I meant.  But that is not what I meant, and I'm sorry. 
Q.	The rest of the summary in the document bears accurate information when compared with the interview that you gave on the 15th of December 1994 (sic).  And your only desire now is to challenge this paragraph because of its possible implications.  
A.	First of all, I have not read the text.  You are the one telling me that it is correct.  I would have to read the text to know whether what is contained therein is correct; right?  All I read was that paragraph, and I challenge it totally.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I have nothing further for the witness.  But I would like to move these two documents as exhibits for the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, would you not allow us to examine this document critically?  We would be able to look at the document that we have to use with the next witness and also look at this document too with -- this -- this document that has been challenged by the witness.  So we could use an early break to do that, and then we could continue the proceedings later. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  In the -- in the meantime, do you have any redirect of the witness?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I do not have any re-examination, as such.  But after looking at this document, I might have questions.  I do not know how we will proceed.  In any case, I have no contact with the witness.  So I would rather give you my answer after the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
All right.  We'll take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed at 1010H) 
(Pages 1 to 16 by Tanya West)



































(Court resumed at 1038H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, with the Court's leave, the Prosecutor would request another one minute or two minutes to put a few questions to the witness that we omitted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Ms. Kalisa --
A.	Yeah.
Q.	-- you testified that you left Kigali for Gisenyi with a certain Alphonse Higaniro? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, I want to inform you that, on the 2nd of October 2006, Mr. Alphonse Higaniro testified in the Bagosora trial in this Tribunal.  
A.	Yeah. 
Q.	And on that day, he talked about his departure from Kigali to Gisenyi, and this is what he had to say.  
A.	Yeah.  
Q.	I'm referring to page 30 of the transcript of that day, from lines 9 to 16.  He said:  

"Secondly, I am not the one who took the decision to"..."leave Kigali for Gisenyi.  It is the Bagosora family that decided to leave Kigali for Gisenyi.  And since the fighting was getting closer and closer to the centre of Kigali, my wife, myself, my father-in-law's family who had no longer father nor mother, because the mother was in hospital in Brussels, we thought that it was proper for us to take advantage of the Bagosora's family departure to go to Gisenyi, because it was not easy to leave Kigali, go across the whole town all the way to Gisenyi, without protection or without laissez-passer."  
A.	Yeah.  
Q.	So my query is, in discussing his departure, Mr. Higaniro does not mention leaving Kigali with you, your sister, your cousin, or anybody from the Nzirorera family.  
A.	In fact, when we left, there were several vehicles.  We were in a convoy.  Perhaps he -- I'm not sure.  Perhaps he's talking about the people with whom he left in the same vehicle, but otherwise, we left in the same convoy.  And we later on went to his house.  It is not because he did not mention us that we did not go with him.  

We were more than -- there were more than ten vehicles in the convoy.  There were many people, many families in the convoy when we left Kigali.  It was not only the Bagosora and Higaniro families.  There were other families, and we were in one of the vehicles.  
Q.	So you're confirming that you left with the Bagosora family for Gisenyi; correct? 
A.	Yes, but we left with Higaniro's family.  We met them at his father-in-law's house, and from there we went to -- in the convoy for Gisenyi.  And in Gisenyi, we lived with the Higaniro family.  
Q.	Which members of Bagosora's family were part of this convoy? 
A.	I no longer remember.  I no longer remember because, when we were in Rwanda, we're two families.  Our family and Bagosora's family were not friends.  I did not know their children, so this is not something that caught my attention.  Their children were not our friends.  I saw Bagosora for the first time -- I saw him -- I saw his face for the first time when we went into exile.  Therefore, I cannot tell you exactly -- I didn't know Bagosora before.  
Q.	So you did -- you did not see him on the day you left for Gisenyi?  
A.	I did not even know him.  What I know is that we left together with Higaniro.  I knew him.  I knew his children.  I knew his father-in-law.  I knew his children.  So we were together with the Higaniro family.  Perhaps Bagosora's children were there as well, but I did not know them.  That's all.  
MR. SENDZE:
I thank the Court for the extra time.  

Thank you, Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes.  Mr. --
THE WITNESS:
I have a question.  No, I have -- I have -- I want to -- to say something to the Judge concerning -- regarding what is written here on this paper.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness holds up the document.  
THE WITNESS:
Concerning what is written here regarding immigration, first of all, I would like to say that, in fact, what is written here is what I was advised say.  But what is -- I mean, what is here in the summary -- what is here in the summary is what I was advised to say.  But all that is here is not the truth.  

For example, I told you that I studied in Cameroon, and this is not mentioned here.  Therefore, you cannot rely on this to say that I lied.  There are many things which are not correct here.  I said this simply in order to secure political asylum.  

As regards credibility -- the second part where it is written "credibility", I have the impression that the person who was interviewing me is the one who is giving his analysis because that person says in the first sentence, "The person" -- that is, I -- "is very consistent." 

So this is -- these are the conclusions of the person who wrote this report, not mine.  This is what the person concludes in regard to what I said in the summary.  Therefore, in my opinion you should not rely on this to say that I lied because this is not correct.  

I would also like to say that you should remember that I asked for political asylum for the first time in Belgium in 1994.  And we -- from there, we were deported to Zaire.  It was a rather traumatising period for us.  During that period we understood that, in order to have political asylum, you don't have to speak the truth because when we spoke the truth we were deported.  

So when we returned, we had to say what would be accepted in order to be given political asylum.  So when I say here, "Two days later on in Gisenyi...", this is wrong.  And nowhere is it mentioned that I lived in Cameroon.  That is wrong as well.  

There are many other things that are wrong in this document, but I had to say them in order to obtain political asylum.  That is the risk I took.  I do not know where that is going to lead me, but I would like to tell the Judges this so that they should bear it in mind.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, do you have any redirect of this witness? 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President.  In relation to the immigration document that the Prosecution sought to produce, I have an additional question to put to the witness.  And I would request Mr. Issa to give to the witness a page of this immigration document, the page that reflects only what is contained in the document which the Prosecution had the witness read.  

Mr. Issa, please. 

No, Mr. Issa, that is not the document.  It is the original that I have here with me, Mr. Issa, the manuscript.  I have it here with me.  It comes from the Prosecution K038 -- K0389046.  This is a Prosecution document.  

Mr. Issa, could you please show it to the Judges. 


RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Ms. Flora, do you have the document? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	That is the original.  Can you see the passage that has been highlighted? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you read it -- that is, read both the question and the answer.  
A.	"Do you know that young people were killed?  Yes.  I learnt that classmates had been killed.  It is on leaving Rwanda that we learnt through the media that innocent people were also killed.  Before that, I learnt that those who had been killed were traitors."  
Q.	On the basis of this document, it's through the media that you learnt of it.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	The document which -- which the Prosecutor asked you to read did not talk about the media, but talked about your father.  
A.	That was a summary made by the lady who interviewed me.  
Q.	So the Prosecutor's document, which is a summary, if you compare that to the original, you'll realise that it has two different answers.  
A.	Absolutely.  
Q.	In the interviewer's summary she says that you learnt from your father; whereas, in the original, you learnt it from the media.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Further, the Prosecutor says that you learnt that in 1994, but the original shows that you learnt that much later; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is after we had left the country.  
Q.	Very well.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I have no further questions regarding this immigration document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That -- that concludes your cross-exam -- your redirect examination? 
MR. NIMY:
I'm done with the re-examination.  And I would be applying that this document, which is the original, should be tendered as an exhibit, Exhibit D. NZ799. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Isn't that the same document the Prosecutor asked to be -- 

Yeah.  Actually, we think that the relevant information is on the record and that we don't need to admit any of the proposed documents.  
Madam, that terminates your testimony.  We thank you for assisting the Tribunal in its work, but you're now excused.  

Mr. Nimy, you have an application? 
MR. NIMY:
Yes.  Mr. President, I would be asking that Madam Flora should kindly be given an opportunity to greet the accused persons, especially Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar will make the appropriate arrangements.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  I have something else to add.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam, your testimony has already concluded.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The registrar will make arrangements for you to see your father.  
(Witness excused) 
(Innocent Twagiramungu entered courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you give your evidence, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that. 
(Declaration made by Innocent Twagiramungu in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel.  And you will respond, first of all, to Mr. Nimy, who is representing Joseph Nzirorera.  
MR. NIMY:
I'm obliged, Mr. President.  In fact, this witness is appearing following your decision on an application from the Prosecutor who would like to cross-examine the witness.  So it is proper for the Prosecutor to proceed with the cross-examination.  

What I will do is proceed to cross-check the personal information sheet with the witness, and then I will tender it as an exhibit, and then the Prosecutor will proceed with the cross-examination, and I will re-examine, if necessary.  That is the procedure I am proposing, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that's the accepted procedure, so you -- you may proceed. 
MR. NIMY:
	Good morning, Mr. Twagiramungu.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Nimy, pardon me for interrupting, but I think, as a matter of procedure, we've -- we've gone through this once before.  And my suggestion to the Court and the Defence is that we simply admit this witness's 92 bis statement, which will have all of this information, and Mr. Nimy can ask him questions on the basis of that exhibit, which will be a much more economical approach to dealing with these issues.  

The statement has not yet been admitted.  The decision of the Chamber was that we'd hold those statements in abeyance until the witness actually shows up for cross-examination, which he's done right now.  So if we could get the 92 bis statement, have the witness check the identifying information on that statement and admit that, I think that would be a more appropriate way of handling this issue.  But it's for the Chamber and Mr. Nimy to decide.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to point out to the Chamber that this is the same procedure we followed when Witness Hassan Ngeze appeared.  So there is nothing different.  It is the Prosecutor who has to cross-examine, and I will talk later if there's something that I have to say.  It is exactly the same procedure with Hassan Ngeze who took the stand a few weeks ago here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  The -- the minor difference, Mr. Nimy, is that if you do it -- continue to do it this way, we'll admit 
two documents.  We'll admit his information sheet, and then we'll also have to admit the 92 bis statement; whereas, all the information on the information sheet is contained in the 92 bis statement.  So it will be more economical if you just did that.  So you're at liberty to put it to him now, for him to check the information, and then we could admit it in one go.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I will be applying to tender as an exhibit the witness's statement as Exhibit D. NZ799.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ799 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have it? 
MR. NIMY:
I have the statement, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

Mr. Issa, could you admit that.  

The statement is admitted.  

Thank you.
MR. NIMY:
I'm obliged, Mr. President.  

One question for the witness.  

Witness --
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NIMY:
-- your statement has been tendered as an exhibit.  Is Mr. Nzirorera concerned with anything that you mentioned in that statement? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  No, Mr. ...(microphones overlapping)  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...that is an issue that was addressed already in deciding whether to admit the statement, so that matter has already been clarified.  It's not necessary to put that question to the witness.  
MR. NIMY:
Very well, Mr. President. 

Witness, I have no question for you.  

Mr. President, I'm obliged.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Mr. Witness, the reason for your coming here is to permit the Prosecutor to cross-examine you on your statement, which is admitted in evidence.  So you now have to respond to the Prosecutor. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Twagiramungu.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	My name is Takeh Sendze, and I'm representing the Prosecutor.  You confirm that on the 
7th of April 1994 -- well, I'm sorry.  I take that back.  

During the multiparty era in Rwanda, you agree that various political parties established youth wings; correct? 
A.	Thank you for your question.  But before I answer, I would like to say something, if I have your permission to do so.  
Q.	I would rather you answer the question and say something at the end of my cross-examination.  
A.	I thank you.  Can you please repeat your question.  I've forgotten it already.  
Q.	During the multiparty era in Rwanda, you agree that various political parties established youth wings; correct? 
A.	I do.  
Q.	And the party leadership was responsible for these youth wings; agree? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	What was the name given to the MRND youth wing? 
A.	Thank you.  In my locality the MRND youth wing had two branches:  The Zulu, who were in Nyakabanda in Kicukiro; and the second branch was called Inyange, and it was in the neighbourhood called Kimironko. 
Q.	Was the MRND youth wing not generally known as the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  People had called that youth wing Interahamwe.  
Q.	On the 7th of April 1994, the Interahamwe, acting in concert with soldiers and the Presidential Guard, attacked Kabeza; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And they were led by a man known -- called Aloys Ngirabatware.  
A.	Yes.  That is what happened on that April 7th.  
Q.	And you confirm that Mr. Aloys Ngirabatware was a member of the MRND party.  
A.	I confirm that.  He was a member of the MRND party.  
Q.	These Interahamwe that you've talked about were led at national level by a man known as Robert Kajuga; true? 
A.	Yes.  The national leader of the Interahamwe was called Robert Kajuga.  
Q.	He too was a member of the MRND party; correct? 
A.	Yes.  He was a member of the MRND party.  
Q.	In your statement of 2nd December 2008, which has just been admitted as D. NZ799, at paragraph 3, you stated that a certain Gasana came to a bar and informed you and some soldiers and gendarmes that there were accomplices in the area, and you had to go and fetch them.  Who were you referring to as accomplices? 
A.	The people who were described as accomplices were Tutsis who were living in that neighbourhood, 
as well as the Hutus who were in opposition to the powers that be.  
Q.	So these accomplices were ordinary Tutsi civilians? 
A.	Yes.  They were ordinary citizens living in that locality.  
Q.	Who had made you understand that the accomplices were the Tutsis? 
A.	Thank you for the question.  When the presidential plane was shot down, several radio stations in Rwanda said that it was a group of Tutsis who had shot down that plane and that, consequently, the Tutsis who were in the country were accomplices or enemies because they were in an armed group which was fighting against the national Rwandan army.  
Q.	Could you give us the name of one or two of these radio stations that publicly declared the Tutsis accomplices and enemies.  
A.	The first radio station, which the residents of Kigali listened to, was RTLM.  And then there was also the national radio station, Radio Rwanda, which was confirming what radio RTLM had said -- that the enemies of the country who had attacked Rwanda were Tutsis.  
Q.	And you confirm that, when these Interahamwe attacked, they asked the population to identify the homes of these innocent Tutsis so that they could be attacked and killed.  Correct? 
A.	Yes.  That is what was happening because the attackers did not know the houses -- or all the houses of the Tutsis.  Only the neighbours of the Tutsis could indicate their homes to the attackers.  
Q.	And you stated at paragraph 4 of your statement that you were present when four families were gunned down by the Interahamwe.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.  And I was indeed present.  
Q.	Can you confirm that it was also the case that the leadership of the MRND also joined in in characterising the Tutsis as the enemy and accomplices? 
A.	Before the genocide, there were a number of MRND leaders who were talking about their 
political platform, but after that, some leaders -- in particular, those of the Interahamwe who, when they were given an opportunity to speak on the radio, RTLM, said that the enemy of the country was Tutsi.  
Q.	Could you tell us the names of the leaders you heard over the radio, the MRND leaders characterising the Tutsi as the enemy.  
A.	One of the persons I heard saying that was Robert Kajuga.  
Q.	This -- this was the president of the Interahamwe at national level; correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Were there any others? 
A.	I have forgotten the names of the other leaders.  
Q.	So let's go back to the Tutsi families that were killed in your presence.  You confirm that they were killed using guns? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that.  
Q.	Could you describe the kind of weapon -- the kind of gun or guns that the Interahamwe used. 
A.	I was able to see that the Interahamwes in question were armed with different weapons.  Some of them had what is called Kalashnikovs and another weapon called Rubaho.  
Q.	Who had issued these weapons -- 
A.	Rubaho -- sorry.  That's the name of the weapon, Rubaho.  
Q.	Who had issued these weapons to the Interahamwe? 
A.	I do not know who had distributed the weapons.  When I saw the Interahamwes in our neighbourhood, 
I saw them with guns, but I do not know when the guns had been given to them or who had given the guns to them.  
Q.	You -- you admit, don't you, that except for these four families who were killed in your presence, many other Tutsis were killed in Kabeza at different locations?  
A.	Yes, I admit that.  There are other Tutsi families that were killed in Kabeza in Kanombe secteur.  
Q.	Were you present at all these killing sites? 
A.	The victims were not killed on the same day.  
Q.	But you admit that you were not present at every site where Tutsis were killed in Kabeza? 
A.	I was not able to go to all the massacre sites, but I witnessed the killing -- or killings of various Tutsi groups and at various sites.  
Q.	So when, in your statement at paragraph 5, you state that you never saw Robert Kajuga during the 1994 -- 1994 events in Kabeza, you are not suggesting that you are absolute about the fact that Kajuga was never in Kabeza in 1994.  
A.	I thank you.  Whilst I was in Kabeza, I was on the tarmac road at a roadblock.  And whilst I was there during the period of the genocide, I never saw Robert Kajuga pass by there.  In fact, I had known him even before the genocide.  
Q.	Who were those manning these roadblocks you have just mentioned? 
A.	The roadblock in question had been erected by the senior officer in charge of the protection of the airport.  The said roadblock was manned by the local population that lived in that area.  
Q.	In your statement, at paragraph 6, you stated that you have been tried before the Gacaca and you have been sentenced to 11 years in prison.  Now, you stated that you went through -- you followed the 
guilty plea procedure.  Could you tell us what crimes you confessed to.  
A.	I thank you.  First of all, I accepted that the genocide had taken place; secondly, I accepted that I participated in the deadly attacks; and thirdly, I admitted that I manned a roadblock; fourthly, I admitted that I had carried out looting in some Tutsi households.  
Q.	What exactly were you doing at the roadblocks you manned?  You were there to identify the Tutsis; correct? 
A.	Our leaders had given us instructions.  They had told us that, if someone we did not know passed by that roadblock, we had to ask that person to present their identification papers and that, if we noticed that the person concerned was a Tutsi, such a person had to be taken to the authorities.  
Q.	Who are these leaders you've just mentioned? 
A.	I told you that there was an officer who was in charge of the protection of the airport.  He was called Bikomagu.  There was also a gendarme called adjudant Kome.  In addition, there was a citizen called Jean Bilinda.  He had a gun.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Twagiramungu, for your testimony.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I have nothing further for the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Nimy, do you have any redirect of this witness? 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President, the question I wanted to ask, according to what you told me, has already been dealt with.  I have no further questions for this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to request that -- allow -- request you to allow the witness to see the accused persons -- to greet the Accused at the end of the witness's testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony has concluded.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work, but you're excused and free to go.  The registrar will make arrangements to allow you to see the Accused, if you so wish.  
THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I hope I'm not jumping the gun, but I would like to address some housekeeping matters with the Chamber, if -- if I may.  I saw Mr. Nimy trying to get to his feet also.  I think I beat him to it.  Maybe he wanted to address the same issue.  

My concern is how we will proceed on Monday.  I understand the Nzirorera Defence plans to call Colonel Bagosora to testify, but I think we may run up against the same hurdles that we encountered at the beginning of this week.  I did read this morning a letter that Mr. Raphaël Constant addressed to the Chamber.  I don't know if the Chamber has had an opportunity to review it, but my sense of what he has to say is that he cannot move from where he is in Martinique to the Chamber at a moment's notice and that he needs several weeks' advance notice before he can be present in Arusha.  And since that letter was only written yesterday, I take it, from its contents, that he will not be able to arrive here on Monday to be present for --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  I understood something slightly different from that.  I understood that he was saying that he was entitled to choose whether his convenience took precedence over the Court's directions.  So I didn't understand that he couldn't come.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that he thought that what he had to do was more important than this. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I didn't read it very carefully.  But I got the essential information which is, to my mind that, he would not be here on Monday.  And --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, no.  He didn't quite say that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  What I wanted to raise with the Chamber, however, is that I think -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understood that, from the correspondence involved -- that Mr. Nimy was going to make an application concerning that matter, and if you saw that correspondence, it's strange that you're trying to pre-empt him because that issue might have been addressed in -- if he makes an application -- which he gives notice that he is going to make. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sure we'll get to that issue.  I wanted to raise another one which is related, and it is this:  That I'm aware Mr. Bagosora has several counsel, not just Mr. Constant.  And my understanding -- and Mr. Nimy or the registry can correct me -- is that he has two assigned counsel to handle his appeal.  Mr. Constant and his -- his assistant were the attorneys for his trial, but that he has two separate -- separately assigned counsel for the appeal and -- in addition to the woman that was here on Monday, who -- whose -- whose name I don't know.  I only know her by her first name.  

Now, I'm wondering if the Chamber could ask the registry to make an enquiry because if Mr. Constant is either not here or not available, certainly there are at least three other persons that could assist Mr. Bagosora.  So whether the Chamber orders -- or whether Mr. Nimy makes a motion to order Mr. Constant to be here or not, there are still other options that we can explore.  So that's what I wanted to raise. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why don't you wait until -- to find out whether Mr. Nimy is going to make an application, and then you can make those submissions.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, we received notice that you intended to make an application this morning.  Do you intend to make it now or not? 
MR. NIMY:
Yes.  Mr. President, we bring in an application to your attention so that you should make an order directing Mr. Constant's team to send a counsel, because they have counsel.  If Constant himself cannot come, they should dispatch a counsel to be present on Monday the 17th, when Mr. Bagosora may be testifying before your Chamber.  

That is our application.  Because letters are not as binding -- even if they are signed by Mr. Pascal Besnier, it is only the authority of your order that can produce the desired effect.  
And that is why we are making this application, namely, that you should make an order requiring 
Mr. Constant's team to dispatch a lawyer of their team to assist Mr. Bagosora during his testimony of Monday the 17th of May.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think I've already given voice to my concerns.  And I simply wanted to bring it to the Chamber's -- well, allow the Chamber to make an enquiry if -- if you think it's appropriate to find out the status of the attorneys that are assigned for the appeal.  Because I understand that there are four attorneys:  Two for the trial and two for the appeal.  So, at least, one of those four should be available on Monday if we're going to proceed with Bagosora's testimony.

1145H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, would you mind putting the names of the four counsel on record, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't have their names.  My information is basically coming from the appeals section of my office, and some of the attorneys that are involved in the appeal, the Bagosora appeal, have mentioned to me that there are two separate counsel that have been assigned for the appeal, but I don't know the names.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  How can we make an order if we don't know who we are making the order to?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not suggesting that you order these persons to appear, Your Honour.  I was suggesting that you enquire with the registry or have the registry report back if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We've done that already.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Well, I have nothing further to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the registry took action, and Constant decided that he was not obliged to respond.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My concern was that Mr. Raphaël Constant is not the only attorney that may be available for -- to assist Mr. Bagosora.  There may be others.  I was suggesting that the registry look into the option of the 
three other counsel of record that I understand may be able to assist us if we are to go forward on Monday.  

Essentially this is a Defence issue, Your Honour.  It -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you're saying now that we should choose who should represent Mr. Bagosora.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Not at all.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That we should make enquiries and decide which lawyer we should order to appear.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm simply bringing to the Court's attention that there may be other options; that if Mr. Constant is not here or not available, that the contingency planning that the Court has in mind may also include looking to other assigned counsel.  But essentially this is a --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are suggesting that the Court should assign counsel to Mr. Bagosora if counsel does not appear.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not even a Prosecution issue.  We are ready to cross-examine Mr. Bagosora without counsel.  I was simply trying to volunteer information that may be of assistance.  But since that's not having its intended effect, let me simply turn the matter over to Mr. Nimy and he can sort out which witness is coming on Monday and how that witness will be assisted if he needs assistance.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, now, you suggested that we should make an order to Mr. Bagosora's team.  In my opinion that's very vague.  Against whom can such an order be enforced?  Do you have the identity of the team that should be ordered to appear?  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  All I know is that Mr. Constant was already willing to have his co-counsel come.  I think Mr. Besnier -- Pascal Besnier is in a position to give the exact name.  I do not want to take a chance and maybe mispronounce the name.  But Mr. Constant's co-counsel could be available.  Well, regarding the other counsel that the Prosecutor referred to, I think the same Pascal Besnier, who is responsible for Defence counsel, could help the Chamber to have a name.  I do not think this should cause a major problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're making an application without sufficient information for us to make any order.  And then you're saying that we must make enquiries and take a decision as to how -- what order should be made in response to your application.  So what exactly are you asking the Court to do?  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, we requested that your order should order or direct Mr. Constant to be in Arusha on the 17th in order to assist Mr. Bagosora.  And in the absence of Mr. Constant, his co-counsel should be present on the same date and for the same reasons. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

Well, we have considered the issue.  We have seen the communication sent by Maître Constant in response to our requirement that he provide explanations why he should not be prosecuted for contempt of Court.  

Now, having reviewed all that, we have come to the conclusion that the course of action we should adopt is to direct that Mr. Constant make adequate arrangements for the representation of 
Colonel Bagosora during his testimony commencing on Monday, the 17th of May.  

It was apparent in his communication that he had already obtained the consent of his client to have co-counsel, Richard Perez appear.  It is also apparent in his communication that he considered that the legal assistant was not capable of discharging the duties of representing Colonel Bagosora in those proceedings.  

We have not had any information on the identity of any other counsel besides those whose names I've mentioned, and it is up to Mr. Constant either to be here personally or to arrange for Richard Perez to be present to support Mr. Bagosora on Monday.  And that is the order of the Court.  

Are there any other matters?  Okay.  Yes, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to thank you for the decision you have just made.  I would also like to thank the -- particularly thank the Chamber for the decision it took yesterday, the decision to hear witnesses this morning, particularly the first witness.  That decision was made after the Chamber obtained -- after the Chamber obtained the information on the situation that the witness went through.  I thank the Chamber for having made that fair decision, the decision to postpone the testimony of the witnesses to this morning.  

Moreover, this justifies what I said this morning regarding the same fears.  Mr. President, from a human point of view I was upset by the scandalous nature that you ascribed to my statement.  But when you cross-checked the events you were able to realise that what I said was correct.  But nevertheless, I apologise.  Maybe I said it at an inappropriate moment.  That is all I wanted to tell you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, would you like the Court's record to reflect what actually transpired?  Because the twist that you gave to it was not accurate.  And if you want to revisit it, then maybe it would be appropriate to let the record show what actually happened.  Is that what you want?  
MR. NIMY:
No, Mr. President.  I think it is not necessary for us to reflect what happened yesterday in the record.  It's not necessary.  But I thought it was, nevertheless, my duty to thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Mr. Nimy.  Thank you.  We'll leave it at that.  
MR. NIMY:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, with regard to the rest of the week, we had previously made an order that this Defence was to be managed so that there were no gaps in the testimony.  You've been saying that you cannot complete the case within the time we've allocated, but yet there are several days when we've been having no witnesses, and that is not an acceptable situation at all.  

Now, what contingency plans do you have for next week in the event that anything else goes wrong?  Because that is also an order that we have made, that there must be back-up witnesses in the event of any eventualities which makes the original plan incapable of being achieved.  So what are the arrangements that you have for next week and the following week?  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President.  I would like to thank you, Mr. President.  Your concerns are perfectly correct, and they are always true.  And in the face if this emergency situation, we are going to have a meeting of our team, and as soon as possible we will get the Chamber informed of our proposal so that the testimonies can be held as regularly as possible.  We are going to look at the situation as it is and, Mr. President, we will inform the Chamber perhaps even later today when we must have got in touch with the 
lead counsel.  

I would not like to dare to just give you a programme on the basis of nothing, a programme that we are going to adapt to the possible situation.  That would not be prudent on my part.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, I won't comment on the issue of the availability of lead counsel at this stage.  But what the Chamber is interested in emphasising, as we have already ordered, is if you don't have any witnesses available to testify, you cannot just have the Chamber sitting down idle doing nothing, and we're not going to do that.  

What we expect to happen, and what we will direct, is that if you are in the situation where there is no witness to testify, Mr. Nzirorera must go in the witness box and give his evidence.  We have already indicated that the witnesses who are on the list, if they are not available now and they become available later, we have given you leave to apply to have them called when they become available, so long as it is before the close of the evidence in this matter.  

So when -- so you have during Ngirumpatse's case to make allowance for that type of eventuality if that is a problem that you're experiencing now.  But it is not going to be acceptable that the Court just sits around doing nothing.  So if you do not have witnesses, we will expect Mr. Nzirorera to testify.  And then if the witnesses become available later, at that stage you will make an appropriate application.  
Am I clear?  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, it's as clear as clear can be.  And that is why I am saying that we should have a consultation and give you exactly what you are asking me even by the end of the day, Mr. President,  and that would place the Chamber in a better situation.  Because we also have to contact the 
witness protection service, look at the programme for the arrival of witnesses, dates and so on.  And then we will be in a position to give you an answer which takes into account the real matters that are going on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

We will take our adjournment now until Monday.
