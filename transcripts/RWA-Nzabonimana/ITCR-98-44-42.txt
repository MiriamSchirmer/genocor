         1   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         2   Q.   Sir, did you know a woman by the name of Rachelle who 

         3        lived at Byangabo in that location?

         4   A.   Yes, I also know her.

         5   Q.   Could you describe for the Tribunal how you knew 

         6        Rachelle?

         7   A.   This lady whose first name is Rachelle lives in Byangabo 

         8        and I also lived there.  So I know her very well.

         9   Q.   Do you know the location of her house in Byangabo?

        10   A.   Yes, I do.

        11   Q.   And where is her house located in Byangabo?

        12   A.   Her house is on the road towards Rwankeri and from the 

        13        main road to her house, it is a distance of about 

        14        350 metres.

        15   Q.   Do you know, sir, whether or not Rachelle was in 

        16        Byangabo on the dates of either the other 7 or 8?

        17   A.   I know very well that she was not in Byangabo on those 

        18        very dates.

        19   Q.   How do you know this?

        20   A.   Yes, it is because I know that she had gone to seek 

        21        treatment because she was unwell.

        22   Q.   And do you know where she had gone during those dates?

        23   A.   I know this that she had left there for Kigali for 

        24        treatment.

        25   Q.   And do you know when she left for Kigali for treatment?

        26   A.   I do not recall the date.  However, I know that it was 

        27        at the end of 1992.

        28   Q.   And do you know whether or not she returned back to her 

        29        home after 1992, that is her home at Byangabo?

        30   A.   She never came back to that place.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Sorry?

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Bodyguards.

         6   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Counsel, could you please repeat the 

         7        question I didn't quite understand it?

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Did you, at any time in 1993 or 1994 have a bodyguard?

        10   A.   No, I have never benefited from the protection of any  

        11        bodyguards.

        12   Q.   On the 7th of April, do you know whether or not there 

        13        were any attacks that took place at the nuns' convent at 

        14        Busogo parish?

        15   MR. PRESIDENT:  I thought this was asked and answered 

        16        yesterday.  He said, "I do not know of attacks at the 

        17        nuns' convent, "yesterday.  Of course, the name of 

        18        Busogo was not mentioned at least from the answer as far 

        19        as I can recall, but at least that was the answer that 

        20        was given yesterday.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Let me rephrase the question.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        23   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        24   Q.   Do you know of the nuns' convent at Busogo parish?  Do 

        25        you know of the nuns' convent at Busogo parish?

        27   Q.   Do you know whether there were any attacks that took 

        28        place at the nuns' convent on the 7th?

         1        took place from the nuns' convent on the 7th?

         2   A.   Yes, there was looting in that place and we were able to 

         3        observe the looting.

         4   Q.   Could you tell the Tribunal how you knew that there was 

         5        looting that took place there?

         6   A.   We realised that vehicles which normally belonged to the 

         7        nuns at the convent were being driven by other people.

         8   Q.   And where did you observe those vehicles?

         9   A.   I was at Byangabo.

        10   Q.   And how many vehicles did you identify as being looted 

        11        from the nuns' convent?

        12   A.   There were five vehicles.

        13   Q.   Did you identify or could you identify any of the 

        14        individuals who were driving those vehicles?

        15   A.   Yes, I was able to do  so.

        16   Q.   Could you tell the Tribunal who were those individuals?

        17   A.   I was able to identify the following persons: 

        18        Alex Rukundo.  Rukundo is spelt R-U-K-U-N-D-O.  Theonést 

        19        Barebereho.  Barebereho is spelt B-A-R-E-B-E-R-E-H-O.  

        20        Kwitonda whose nickname was Sesera.  Kwintonda is spelt, 

        21        K-W-I-T-O-N-D-A.  Sesera is spelt, S-E-S-E-R-A. Turgeon 

        22        Nsengimana.  Nsengimana is spelt N-S-E-N-G-I-M-A-N-A.  

        23        Finally, Ndayisabye is spelled N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-Y-E.

        24   Q.   On April 8th 1994, sir, were you aware if any orders 

        25        were given to bury bodies at Byangabo?

        26   A.   Since there were no dead bodies, we couldn't give 

        27        instructions regarding the burial of bodies.  There were 

        28        no instructions or orders given to that effect.

        29   Q.   On April 8th, did you observe anyone participating in 

        30        the burial of bodies in or around Byangabo?

         2   Q.   Were you aware of any burial of Lucien and Rukara?

         3   A.   I am not aware of the burial of anyone known as Lucien

         5        were not seen at Byangabo.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Three and four.

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        14   Q.   Witness, I would like you to look at photographs 3 and 

        15        4, and could you identify these photographs?

        16   A.   Yes, I can recognise these photographs.

        17   Q.   What was on the photographs?

        18   A.   I can see buildings on those photographs.

        19   Q.   Do you know what buildings these are?

        20   A.   Yes, I know these buildings.

        21   Q.   What are they?

        22   A.   These are the buildings which house a court, 

        23        specifically, it is the Ruhengeri Court of Appeals.

        24   Q.   Now, sir, were you aware that there were attacks on the  

        25        court of appeals sometimes in April of 1994?

        26   A.   Yes, quite so.  There was an attack on the court of 

        27        appeals.

        28   Q.   Do you know, sir, when in April that attack took place?

        29   A.   The attack was launched on the court of appeals on the 

        30        14th April, 1994.

         1   Q.   Are you sure of that date?

         2   A.   Yes, I do remember that it was indeed on that date that 

         3        the attack took place.

         4   Q.   Now, sir, how do you know that there was an attack on 

         5        the court of appeals?

         6   A.   When the attackers themselves came back, they said that 

         7        they had just killed people who were at the court of 

         8        appeals.

         9   Q.   Do you know, sir, who participated in the attack on the 

        10        court of appeal?

        11   A.   Yes.

        12   Q.   Can you tell the Tribunal those individuals whom you 

        13        know who participated in the attack on the court of 

        14        appeals?

        15   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: The witness would like to know 

        16        whether there would not be a problem in him mentioning 

        17        the names of those persons in a public hearing, an a 

        18        open hearing.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel, what do you say to that?  Do 

        20        you have an idea of what these people are?

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        22   Q.   Do you know any names of any of the individual who were 

        23        involved? 

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: I think -- it might be complete to go by the 

        25        names and the pseudonyms come, be brought up after the 

        26        names have been clearly spelt out, if that be the case.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: We know from prior testimony, Your Honour,  

        28        that there is one witness who has already testified, who 

        29        has a pseudonym and who testified about these events.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  And is he aware of the pseudonym?

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think so because he has already testified 

         2        concerning that person's pseudonym, he has already 

         3        testified.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Now, quite frankly, I am not quite sure 

         6        whether there will be other names mentioned.  Maybe, be 

         7        just to be on the safe side we should go into a closed 

         8        session although I want to avoid going back and forth.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: But just to be on the safe side perhaps, we 

        11        should do that because I am not quite sure what names 

        12        might be mentioned.

        13   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, may I ask how a witness knows a 

        14        pseudonym when there are protective measures in respect 

        15        of those names?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness has said that before that, he 

        17        did not know pseudonyms when I had asked him before.  We 

        18        then went into closed session and we went through the 

        19        process with respect to this name that I know that we 

        20        already identified the pseudonym with the name in closed 

        21        session. 

        22   MR. FLEMING: So, my learned friend, in fact, informed the 

        23        witness in court or be it in closed session just the 

        24        name and the pseudonym of the witness.  With the 

        25        greatest respect, that is in breach of the order.  Even 

        26        though it was done in court, this witness now knows who 

        27        the previous witness was for the Prosecution.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this was a process that we all 

        29        agreed upon in court.  Mr. Fleming sat there.  He never 

        30        objected.  He never raised any questions and we went

          KAJELIJELI                                      19 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        through that yesterday and the process that we used was, 

         2        in fact, open, even before we went through the process, 

         3        I suggested perhaps we would use pieces of paper and 

         4        Court said no and we used the name of person and we said 

         5        for the purposes of the record, Your Honour, this is, 

         6        this witness, this is who this witness is.  Mr. Fleming, 

         7        I am on my feet please.  And, we, in fact, for the 

         8        record established that.  

         9        

        10        Now, Mr. Fleming never objected.  Now he is suggesting 

        11        that there was a breach of the order.

        12   MR. FLEMING: That still remains, a breach of the order.  Your 

        13        Honours, Your Honours will recall the incident well.  My 

        14        learned friend did ask to write the name of the witness 

        15        down on a piece of paper or that came from someone.  

        16        Your Honour said no, he can give the name.  It was then 

        17        my learned friend announced, not as a result of any 

        18        agreement that the pseudonym then of this witness was 

        19        something.  Now, there is little point at that point in 

        20        time in doing anything much about it because the cat is 

        21        out of the bag at that point and the cat is out of the 

        22        bag in respect of this witness.  So, we want no 

        23        reference whatsoever to pseudonyms in this trial if that 

        24        is at all possible.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, just in terms of the record.  

        26        Right.  During the Prosecution's case, and if we look at 

        27        the record, we will see; we went through the same 

        28        process that I went through.  There were no objections 

        29        raised.  Right.  Witnesses testified, we had pieces of 

        30        paper and then the Prosecution, they themselves said,

         1        for the record, Your Honour, this witness use 

         2        pseudonyms.  I raised no objections about that because I 

         3        thought within it in the context of what we were doing.  

         4        It was a way of facilitating the Court.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, I don't think we need to put this matter 

         6        further than this.  If it has happened, it has happened, 

         7        but I think for the future, we should be going, perhaps, 

         8        the practice should be to use the names, of course, in 

         9        appropriate forum in the closed session when dealing 

        10        with protected witnesses who have pseudonyms.  Of 

        11        course, the link as to -- the link as to the pseudonyms 

        12        will be, that it be done by counsel to the Trail Chamber 

        13        and not the witnesses, not to the witnesses.  It is the 

        14        link, the pseudonyms are interplay between the parties 

        15        and the Trial Chamber.  Okay.  So that one might know 

        16        the actual name and but the pseudonym remains private 

        17        and only for the use of the Trial Chamber and the 

        18        parties who have access to all the information that is 

        19        relevant to enable them to do their work.  

        20        

        21        Yes.  So in that case, we will go into closed session to 

        22        enable counsel to raise the questions some of which 

        23        could have a bearing of the witness's identity or to 

        24        other protected witnesses.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         1        

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Do you know, sir, whether there were any gifts given to 

         4        the Interahamwe of Tutsis' properties after the attack?

         5   A.   I don't know anything about that.

         6   Q.   Specifically, were you aware that Rachelle's property 

         7        was given to Interahamwe as a result of the or in reward 

         8        for the killings that took place on the 7th or 8th?

         9   A.   No, I don't know anything about that, Counsel.

        10   Q.   Were you requested at any time by Kajelijeli to solicit 

        11        moneys from businessmen at Byangabo for the killings 

        12        that were done on the 7th and the 8th?

        13   A.   No, Kajelijeli never asked us to do any such thing.

        14   Q.   Do you know the term Amahindure, have you ever heard  of 

        15        that term?

        16   A.   Yes.  I know the word Amahindure.

        17   Q.   When did you first hear of the term Amahindure?

        18   A.   I heard that word for the first time in 1985, but even 

        19        in 1994, I heard Amahindure mentioned.

        20   Q.   What does the term mean, if anything to you?

        21   A.   Around 1985, when my mother saw that it was going to 

        22        rain, she said, it was going to rain the rains called 

        23        Amahindure and in 1994 when we went into exile, we saw 

        24        lava that was due to volcanic eruptions also referred to 

        25        as Amahindure and in 1992, there was in 2002, there was 

        26        also the volcanic eruption in Zaire referred to as 

        27        Amahindure.

        28   Q.   Did you -- have you ever heard the term being used to 

        29        describe the Interahamwe?

        30   A.   No, I never heard that.

         1        client, maybe at the end of questions.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, yes, please do so.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: No further questions, Your Honour.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, thank you, Counsel for the Defence.  

         5        

         6        Any cross-examination?

         7   MR. FLEMING: Yes, thank you, Your Honours.

        11   BY MR. FLEMING:

        12   Q.   Witness, you have told us that in order for you to be 

        13        allowed to join Interahamwe, they had to make those 

        14        conditions.  One of those conditions was that they were 

        15        law-abiding, they were good citizens.  That is your 

        16        evidence; isn't it?

        17   A.   Yes, those youths should be good citizens.

        18   Q.   And, witness, I take it that you were  president or 

        19        elected president because you were, in fact, a good 

        20        citizen and of the appropriate age?

        21   A.   Yes, yes, I was a good citizen.

        22   Q.   And you were indeed a good citizen while you were 

        23        ****************; weren't you?

        24   A.   Yes.

        25   Q.   As such a good citizen, describe to me in detail how you 

        26        killed Rukara?

        27   A.   I killed Rukara on orders.

        28   Q.   Tell me how you killed him?

        29   A.   When it was necessary to kill him, when we had to kill 

        30        him, we went to get him from his place and knifed him.

         1   Q.   Tell me how you did that?  Please describe it to us?

         2   A.   Well, to kill someone, I told you we went to get him 

         3        from his place and as we had pipes, we used something, 

         4        we clubbed him until he died.  

         5   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Pipes or bars it is not quite clear, 

         6        excuse me. 

         7   MR. PRESIDENT:  Now carry on.

         8   MR. FLEMING: Bars, didn't say them.  I am sorry bars.  

         9   BY FLEMING:

        10   Q.   NOW, witness, tell us what you did personally?  You 

        11        Describe what you did.

        12   A.   As I explained, we took Rukara out of his place and I 

        13        was the first to hit him with the pipe and the others 

        14        followed and the others also had pipes that they used to 

        15        beat him, to club him with.

        16   Q.   But tell me what you did, where did you hit him with the 

        17        pipe? 

        18   A.   I began by hitting him on the head and then on the 

        19        shoulders. The others followed until he was dead.

        20   Q.   How many times did you hit him on the head? 

        21   A.   Only once.

        22   Q.   What effect did that have on Rukara when you hit him on 

        23        the head?

        24   A.   What do you want me to tell you?  When you hit someone 

        25        he changes.

        26   Q.   How did he change?

        27   A.   Yes, he changed.  When you hit someone, his first 

        28        reaction is to change.  He changed and began to say 

        29        sorry pleading for forgiveness while putting his hands 

        30        on his head.

         1   Q.   And were you moved by his pleas for forgiveness?

         2   A.   No, it didn't mean anything to me because at that time 

         3        we were like crazy people.

         4   Q.   What had Rukara done for which you were seeking for  

         5        forgiveness?

         6   A.   Personally, I know that Rukara did nothing wrong.  It 

         7        was orders, we had been ordered to kill him.

         8   Q.   If you knew he had done nothing wrong, why did you kill 

         9        him?

        10   A.   I told you it was an order.  At that time, people were 

        11        like crazy because they had heard about the death of the 

        12        president of the republic.

        13   Q.   So were you of the view that you had an obligation to 

        14        obey the orders of somebody?

        15   A.   Yes, it was an order and I felt obliged to implement it.

        16   Q.   You were a civilian; weren't you?

        17   A.   Yes, I was a civilian.

        18   Q.   You weren't under military orders, were you?

        19   A.   But at that time, the solders could give you an order 

        20        and you would be obliged to execute it.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour.  

        22   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Microphone, Your Honour.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: I haven't said anything.  I am -- we have 

        24        worked out a process where I would stand and be silent.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we understand, Counsel.

        26   MR. FLEMING: Can we go into closed session.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        28   MR. FLEMING:  And that can be dealt with on the record.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. We will go into closed session to enable 

        30        counsel to proceed with the cross-examination and raise

         2   BY MR. FLEMING:

         3   Q.   Witness, tell me how Lucien died?

         4   A.   Lucien was taken out of his house and Musafiri stabbed 

         5        him.

         6   Q.   Were you there? 

         7   A.   Yes, I was  there.

         8   Q.   Did you watch it? 

         9   A.   Yes, I was present at that place.

        10   Q.   Did he ask for assistance, Lucien that is? 

        11   A.   No, he didn't call for help.

        12   Q.   After that incident you told us, I think you went to 

        13        Busogo hill; is that right?

        14   A.   Yes, that's correct.

        15   Q.   Why did you go to Busogo hill?

        16   A.   On orders because the people wanted to execute the order 

        17        and hunt down the Tutsi wherever they were in order to 

        18        massacre them.

        19   Q.   So, Rukara and Lucien were Tutsi; were there?

        20   A.   Yes, they were Tutsi.

        21   Q.   How many Tutsi were there on Busogo hill according to 

        22        you?

        23   A.   I don't know how many.

        24   Q.   Estimate for us, were they tens, hundreds, thousands, 

        25        give us an estimate?

        26   A.   The Tutsis who lived in Busogo and Rwankeri were about 

        27        ten of them.

        28   Q.   So were there only ten Tutsis killed on Busogo hill that 

        29        day?

        30   A.   Yes, that's correct.

         1   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: He spoke of tens.  Did I perhaps 

         2        misinterpret some tens, I suppose we would say a few 

         3        score.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  Is that correct, were tens?

         5   MR. FLEMING: I will ask the questions again, Your Honours.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, please.

         7   THE WITNESS: Yes, it took all day because we started at 8:30 

         8        and finished at 4:00 p.m.

         9   Q.   At that time from 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. there was 

        10        killing of Tutsis going on; isn't that the case?

        11   A.   No, there were several things, there was massacring, 

        12        there was pillaging and others were sharing out the 

        13        cows.

        14   Q.   And, you were there all of that time, weren't you?

        15   A.   Yes, I was there.

        16   Q.   What crime had these Tutsis committed to be massacred in 

        17        that way?

        18   A.   Mr. Prosecutor, I told you the people could not resist 

        19        in view of the information which had just been given 

        20        about the death of the president.  So, we went to kill 

        21        the Tutsi because were we were informed the Tutsis were 

        22        involved in the assassination of the president.

         1        1030H

         2   MR. FLEMING: Were there women and children murdered on Busogo 

         3        hill that day?

         4   A.   Yes, women and the children were also massacred.

         5   Q.   Witness, tell me how the women and children were 

         6        involved in the killing of President Habyarimana?  

         7        Please, tell me?

         8   A.   We did not distinguish; It was enough to be Tutsi to be 

         9        killed.  We didn't distinguish between ages.  The 

        10        population understood that all Tutsi had to be killed.

        11   Q.   Where did you get the understanding from, that all Tutsi 

        12        had to be killed?

        13   A.   I hadn't understood before that all Tutsi had to be 

        14        killed, it was after the 7th of April that this 

        15        understanding came to us.

        16   Q.   As a responsible citizen, one who took the position that 

        17        you took -- that you did in society, why were you not 

        18        prepared to allow the killers of President Habyarimana 

        19        to be hunted down and dealt with by the law in the 

        20        normal way?

        21   A.   Could you please repeat the question, Mr. Prosecutor?  I 

        22        did not quite understand.

        23   Q.   As a responsible person in the community, why didn't you 

        24        just allow the killers of President Habyarimana to be 

        25        hunted down in the normal way and be dealt with, 

        26        according to the normal law, instead of going out and 

        27        killing all the Tutsis?

        28   A.   My position had nothing to do with what happened.  Even 

        29        normal ordinary citizens not in my position could not 

        30        contain themselves.

         1   Q.   So, you describe yourself then as a person who, because 

         2        President Habyarimana's plane was shot down, felt it 

         3        necessary to go out and kill Tutsi men and women.  That 

         4        is a fair description of you then; isn't it?

         5   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Could you please repeat for the 

         6        interpreter?

         7   BY MR. FLEMING:

         8   Q.   So, a fair description of you would be a person who, 

         9        because the President's plane was shot down was prepared 

        10        to go out and murder innocent men, women and children 

        11        who were Tutsi?

        12   A.   I answered this question several times when I said 

        13        everything we did, we did on orders.  Moreover, the 

        14        population of the people (sic) was exited because the 

        15        President of the Republic had just been killed, and that 

        16        is how the killings happened.

        17   Q.   And, it is your understanding that because the President 

        18        of the Republic was killed, all Tutsi men, women and 

        19        children had to be hunted down and killed.  That's your 

        20        understanding; isn't it?

        21   A.   In my region, some people survived, not all the Tutsis 

        22        were dead.

        23   Q.   Witness, you didn't answer the question.  It was your 

        24        understanding, wasn't it, that because the President's 

        25        plane was shot down all Tutsi men, women and children 

        26        should be hunted down and killed.  That is your 

        27        understanding, wasn't it?

        28   A.   No, that is not how things should have happened.

        29   Q.   So why did it happen that the Tutsis were hunted down 

        30        and killed at Busogo hill even by yourself?  Why did

         1        that happen?

         2   A.   I explained and gave my answer several times to this 

         3        question.  The President of the Republic had just been 

         4        killed; the people were angry, were not able to contain 

         5        themselves.  But all Tutsis were not killed, and for the 

         6        simple reason that there was no plan before hand -- 

         7        prepared plan to kill the Tutsis.

         8   Q.   How many Tutsi members were there of the Interahamwe in 

         9        l994, in your region?

        10   A.   In 1994, no Tutsi was a member of Interahamwe.

        11   Q.   Is that because there was no Tutsi who was of the age of 

        12        18 and of good character.  And, therefore, couldn't 

        13        qualify?

        14   A.   I can't know why the Tutsi did not join the Interahamwe.  

        15        It was up to each individual person's inclination.  I 

        16        cannot speak for them.

        17   Q.   There was a recruiting drive for members of the 

        18        Interahamwe; wasn't there?

        19   A.   There was no recruitment for the Interahamwe, but I know 

        20        that there were Tutsi who were members of the MRND 

        21        party.

        22   Q.   Witness, we are concentrating on the Interahamwe for the 

        23        moment.  Were there Tutsi members of the Interahamwe 

        24        when it was organised in 1993?  I think it was January 

        25        or February; wasn't it?

        26   A.   Could you repeat the question, please?  I didn't quite 

        27        understand.

        28   Q.   Were there Tutsi members of the Interahamwe in February 

        29        1993, or shortly thereafter, when the Interahamwe was 

        30        formed in your region?

         1   A.   There were no Tutsi members of the Interahamwe in our 

         2        region.

         3   Q.   So the Interahamwe in your region was exclusively a  

         4        Hutu organisation; wasn't it?

         5   A.   Yes.

         6   Q.   Let us go back to Busogo hill on the 7th of April l994.  

         7        How many Tutsi died on Busogo hill on that day?

         8   A.   I told you that I couldn't know how many Tutsi died on 

         9        Busogo hill.

        10   Q.   Let us go back to what appeared to be a misunderstanding 

        11        earlier.  I asked you to give an estimate of how many 

        12        Tutsis there were; tens, hundreds or thousands.  Would 

        13        you, please, give to us the estimate?

        14   A.   I gave you an estimate speaking of tens -- several tens.

        15   Q.   You told us yesterday that these Tutsis armed themselves 

        16        with bow and arrows and spears; didn't you?

        17   A.   Yes, that is what I said.

        18   Q.   Those who pursued them, what were they armed with?

        19   A.   Those who were chasing the Tutsi had clubs, bludgeons, 

        20        machetes and the big sticks.

        21   Q.   Did the military arrive to give assistance?

        22   A.   Yes, that is correct, the military came.

        23   Q.   And what were the military armed with?

        24   A.   The military had firearms and grenades.

        25   Q.   Witness, you made a statement, didn't you, to Defence 

        26        Counsel on the 24th September 2001?

        27   A.   The statement that I saw is the one of the 24th of 

        28        September 2001.

        29   Q.   Witness, let me read to you a paragraph.  I know you are 

        30        testifying in Kinyarwanda.  The statement wasn't taken

         1        in Kinyarwanda.  So, I will read to you the paragraph in 

         2        the manner in which it was taken, and I quote: "The 

         3        killings in Rwankeri began at 8:30 a.m and lasted up to 

         4        about 4:00 p.m.  There was no need for traditional 

         5        weapons at Rwankeri because, first of all, the Tutsi 

         6        were not armed." Let me pause there.  Last year, 2001, 

         7        you said the Tutsis were not armed; didn't you?

         8   A.   With regard to what is in my statement concerning arms, 

         9        and, in view of the question the Prosecutor is asking me 

        10        in my statement, I meant to say that the Tutsi did not 

        11        have modern arms that the soldiers used.  I didn't mean 

        12        that they didn't have weapons -- traditional weapons.

        13   Q.   You make no distinction in your statement, do you, "the 

        14        Tutsi were not armed", is what you say; isn't it?

        15   A.   For us peasants, when people speak to us of weapons we 

        16        suppose guns and grenades, we don't think of bows and 

        17        arrows, lances, spears or big sticks.

        18   Q.   Why did you then, as a peasant, yesterday when you were 

        19        asked the question by Defence Counsel whether they were 

        20        armed you informed the Court that they were carrying 

        21        bows and arrows and spears.  You made no distinction 

        22        then?

        23   A.   I could say the question as Defence Counsel raised it  

        24        was different than the way you have raised it.  It is 

        25        not the same circumstance, is it?  This question -- if 

        26        both questions were put to me again, as it was raised 

        27        yesterday, and, as you put it now, perhaps I could then 

        28        explain myself.

        29   Q.   Let me read to you the precise words I used in a 

        30        question about six or eight questions ago, when talking

         1        about the Tutsis who had armed themselves.  The next 

         2        question I asked you: "Those who pursued them, what were 

         3        they armed with?"  And you said:  "They were armed with 

         4        clubs, machetes and big sticks."  Again --

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Again, the issue is weapons, not what they 

         8        were armed with.  The distinction is weapons and the 

         9        witness is -- Counsel, Mr. Fleming, is using two 

        10        different words, and the witness has testified when 

        11        weapons are used what it means.  If you look at the 

        12        statement the witness made, it is with respect to 

        13        weapons, not what they were armed with.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, these are the issues that -- should it 

        15        arise, that the Trial Chamber at a later stage will be 

        16        examining, to see and determine exactly the interplay of 

        17        these words.  But Counsel perhaps can find out and 

        18        follow up that aspect and that will be left to the 

        19        Trial Chamber to determine the differences, if any.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honours.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: And, Learned Counsel, we plan to take a break 

        22        at 11:00, so you can see how best you would wind up this 

        23        aspect you are dealing with.

        24   MR. FLEMING:  Thank you, Your Honour.  I will ask this 

        25        question again.

        26   BY MR. FLEMING:

        27   Q.   Witness, just one moment ago -- sorry, five moments ago, 

        28        I asked you a question and I said to you: "Those who 

        29        pursued them, what were they armed with?"  And you said:  

        30        "They were armed with clubs, machetes, and big sticks."

         1        You made no distinction yourself in respect of arms; did 

         2        you?

         3   A.   Yes, I concede that from what I have just said, but 

         4        myself as a peasant, since the Tutsis were on the side 

         5        of the RPF, when asked if they had arms I thought you 

         6        were alluding to modern arms -- modern weapons.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: We take note of his evidence on that point, 

         8        Counsel.

         9   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.  Is this an appropriate 

        10        time for the break?

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we could take the break now.  All right, 

        12        we will adjourn these proceeding to slightly -- let us 

        13        -- we resume at twenty past eleven.

        14        (Court recessed from 1100H to 1125H)

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  The proceedings are resumed.  We 

        16        continue the cross-examination of Witness RGM, 

        17        Mr. Fleming.  And, please, interpreter, could you please 

        18        tell witness we are in open session, or we continue to 

        19        be open session.

        20        

        21        Well, I hope that noise stops.  Please, go on, Counsel.

        22   MR. KIYEYEU: We have sent someone to follow it up, My Lord.

        23   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        24   BY MR. FLEMING:

        25   Q.   Witness, we were at the hill in Busogo where many Tutsis 

        26        were killed, and you we were there from 8:30 a.m until 

        27        4:00 p.m, weren't you?

        28   A.   Yes, that is right.

        29   Q.   You told us that there was a massacre, there was looting 

        30        and there was the dividing up of the Tutsi cattle.  That

         1        is what you told us; isn't it?

         2   A.   Yes, that is right.

         3   Q.   What were you doing for the whole day?

         4   A.   During that day, I was also in the group of killers.

         5   Q.   So, you participated in killing that day as well, didn't 

         6        you?

         7   A.   Counsel, I would like to tell you that all these events 

         8        are referred to as massacres, whether there is looting, 

         9        killings or whatever; we call it massacres.  In Rwanda, 

        10        even if you say that you participated in the lootings 

        11        you are known to have participated in the massacres.

        12   Q.   Witness, you participated in the killings, didn't you, 

        13        that day?

        14   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        15   Q.   You participated in the looting, didn't you?

        16   A.   Yes, quite so.

        17   Q.   And you participated in the dividing up of the cattle, 

        18        didn't you?

        19   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        20   Q.   And you came away that day with some of the spoils of 

        21        the looting and the dividing up of the cattle, didn't 

        22        you?

        23   A.   No, I did not go away with any spoils.

        24   Q.   Witness, there were rapes that day too; weren't there?

        25   A.   I don't know anything about that.

        26   Q.   You did talk about a man called Yamuremye; didn't you?

        27   A.   Yes, that is right.

        28   Q.   He cut the breast of a Tutsi woman, didn't he that day?

        29   A.   I don't know anything about that.

        30   Q.   He also leaked her blood; didn't he?

         1   A.   I don't know.

         2   Q.   What do you know about Yamuremye?

         3   A.   All I know is that Yamuremye threw a spear towards a 

         4        girl and the spear hit her on the chest.  I don't know 

         5        whether he cut off the girl's breast or not.

         6   Q.   Witness, let me read to you from the statement you made 

         7        on the 24th September 2001, and I quote from your 

         8        statement:  "I saw Yamuremye, who stuck a knife in a 

         9        lady's chest and she died immediately.  He did not cut 

        10        off her breast or leak her blood."  You said that in 

        11        your statement, didn't you?

        12   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Mr. President, could Counsel please 

        13        indicate the exact location for the benefit of the 

        14        French booth?

        15   THE WITNESS: I would like to see the document, because I know 

        16        that that is not what I said.

        17   MR. FLEMING: We will give you a copy of the handwritten 

        18        document.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  And, Mr. Fleming, the interpreters, 

        20        particularly the French interpreters, would like to know 

        21        the references, if any.

        22   MR. FLEMING: They have the document, Your Honour.  I have 

        23        informed them where it is.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right.

        25   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, I call for the original of that 

        26        document.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, registry?

        28   MR. FLEMING: It would be better if he looked at the original 

        29        and give me back the copy.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, can you give the witness the original.

         1        In which languages was it taken?  It is in English?

         2   BY MR. FLEMING:

         3   Q.   Witness, would you go to the last page and verify again 

         4        that it bears your signature?

         5   A.   Yes, I see that my signature appears on that page.

         6   Q.   Immediately above your signature are these words, and I 

         7        quote: "I swear that what I have told you is the truth."  

         8        Those words are there, aren't they?

         9   A.   Yes, that is right.

        10   Q.   You had the statement read back to you, didn't you, 

        11        before you signed it?

        12   A.   Yes, it was read to me.

        13   Q.   You even made some alterations, didn't you, to what was 

        14        read to you initially?

        15   A.   Yes, that is right.

        16   Q.   Would you go to the second last page, please?  Have you 

        17        found that?

        18   A.   Yes, I am there, but I am unable to decipher what is 

        19        written there.

        20   Q.   I will work it through with you.  The first paragraph on 

        21        that page says this --

        22   MR. FLEMING:  Your Honour, for the benefit of the booth, we 

        23        will be working from a typed version.  It is on the 

        24        second page in the fifth paragraph down.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Which text?  That is the English text?

        26   MR. FLEMING: Yes.  And in the French text, it is again the 

        27        second page, and the fifth paragraph down, so to say.

        28   

        29   BY MR. FLEMING:

        30   Q.   Now, let me read this to you from the handwritten 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        version that you signed: "I did not see any rapes or 

         2        hear of any rapes taking place at Rwankeri on April 7th, 

         3        1994.

         4        

         5        I shall pause there so that it can be translated.  

         6        Second sentence is this: "The first time I heard about 

         7        rapes was during the Gacaca trials in 1999/2000.

         8        

         9        I pause there again so that it can be translated.  The 

        10        third sentence is this: "I saw Yamuremye who stuck a 

        11        knife in a lady's chest and she died immediately."  And 

        12        the last sentence is:  "He did not cut off her or leak 

        13        her blood."  All right.  Do you agree that that is what 

        14        you said in that statement?

        15   A.   Yes, that's right.

        16   Q.   Now, let me go back a little to the sentence, 

        17        commencing:  "I saw Yamuremye --" in that sentence you 

        18        initially said:  "I saw Yamuremye who threw a spear 

        19        through a lady's chest."  That's what you said 

        20        initially; isn't it?

        21   A.   Yes, that was the initial sentence.

        22   Q.   And when it was read back to you, you basically said 

        23        that was wrong and you crossed other words: "Threw a 

        24        spear at", didn't you?

        25   A.   No, he threw a spear into that lady's chest.

        26   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:  The witness is making a 

        27        correction that it was a knife.

        28   MR. FLEMING: Exactly.  You crossed out the words; "threw a 

        29        spear at", and in their place you said; "stuck a knife 

        30        in a lady's chest". That is what you said in the

         1        statement; is it?

         2   A.   Yes, that is right.

         3   Q.   So, tell me now from your recollection what you saw 

         4        Yamuremye do?  Tell me what you saw?

         5   A.   Yamuremye struck her with a knife in the chest and the 

         6        girl immediately died -- fell dead.

         7   Q.   Did she plead for mercy or any such thing?

         8   A.   No, she did not say anything.

         9   Q.   Do you find that mildly amusing that you smile when you 

        10        give that response?

        11   A.   I think the Prosecutor should not try to terrify me, 

        12        because I came here to testify on events which I 

        13        witnessed and one cannot come before a court while one 

        14        is angry.

        15   Q.   Why did you smile when you made that response in respect 

        16        of the witness -- I am sorry, in respect of the woman 

        17        not asking for mercy?

        18   A.   If I have smiled it is not because I wanted to laugh at 

        19        the lady.  I simply smiled because I feel happy.  I, 

        20        therefore, don't have any problems in my heart.  The 

        21        events took place and --

        22   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: I am sorry, Mr. President, could the 

        23        interpreter repeat the last sentence?

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Could you repeat the entire answer, it seems 

        25        it is the same in French as well, Interpreter?

        26   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: I don't know whether I will 

        27        reproduce it as I had before because I am using signs.  

        28        He said, "If I smiled it wasn't because I was mocking 

        29        the lady.  I smiled because I am happy, I don't have any 

        30        problems in my heart and these events took place.  I

         1        have no complaint about these events".

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         3   BY MR. FLEMING:

         4   Q.   Witness, as a responsible person, tell me what crime 

         5        that woman had committed to deserve death of that sort, 

         6        with you watching?

         7   A.   I think I have already explained to you and given 

         8        answers in this subject.  People were angry, they were, 

         9        as if they were mad and I, myself, could not appease the 

        10        situation.

        11   Q.   Does that suggest you tried to appease the situation?

        12   A.   No, I didn't do anything.  I didn't have the ability to 

        13        do so.

        14   Q.   You simply participated in the massacre with a clear 

        15        conscience; that is what you did, isn't it?

        16   A.   Yes, quite right.

        17   Q.   Witness, I want you to go back to the paragraph that we 

        18        read through, and to the second sentence, and I quote 

        19        again; "The first time I heard about rapes was during 

        20        the Gacaca trials in 1999/2000."  You said that; didn't 

        21        you?

        22   A.   Yes, that is what I said.

        23   Q.   Witness, the Gacaca did not commence until the year 

        24        2002; did it?

        25   A.   Could you repeat the question, please?

        26   Q.   I said the Gacaca did not commence until the year 2002; 

        27        did it?

        28   A.   But within the prisons the Gacaca proceedings started 

        29        before the year 2002.

        30   Q.   Witness, the proceedings, even in prison in respect of 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        Gacaca did not start until 2002, did it?  There was no 

         2        Gacaca there was no Statute by which Gacaca could be 

         3        held before 2002?

         4   A.   But I have told you that these courts were there before 

         5        the year 2002; in other words, 1999 until 2002.

         6   Q.   Witness, let us deal then with what you have described 

         7        as the plea of guilty to genocide.  You do believe that 

         8        there was genocide in Rwanda, don't you, between the 6th 

         9        of April 1994 --

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, My Lord.  I am not quite sure 

        11        where Mr. Fleming is going.  He is asking for a legal 

        12        conclusion for this witness.  I am not sure whether he 

        13        is asking for such a conclusion to be used in these 

        14        proceedings.  This witness has talked about his 

        15        involvement in massacres and killings, and so on.  We 

        16        all know what the definition of genocide is.  And so 

        17        asking the witness that question, I am not sure whether 

        18        or not he is asking it just in a general sense or he is 

        19        looking for any linkage with respect to whatever that 

        20        means in the context of Rwanda and what this witness 

        21        pled to or confessed to, and what we are dealing with 

        22        here.  And so I am objecting to the question.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel.

        24   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, there are two aspects to it that I 

        25        am going to investigate.  The first is the fact that he 

        26        has confessed to genocide, and the second is what his 

        27        understanding is of what took place in Rwanda.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, first of all, I am not sure 

        29        that even what Mr. Fleming is saying is, in fact -- 

        30        there is any factual basis to support that.  If he has a

          KAJELIJELI                                      19 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        copy of the witness's confession and plea, and in fact 

         2        he wants to confront him with that as whether or not he 

         3        pled to genocide, I certainly would like him to present 

         4        that to us.  He has indicated before they have no such 

         5        information.  But if there is a document that he wants 

         6        to confront the witness with, I have no objection to 

         7        that, if, in fact, the witness has so stated for the 

         8        limited purpose for what the document may say.  But, 

         9        again, I am objecting to that question being asked the 

        10        way it is now being asked because of the implication to 

        11        this particular proceedings.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Counsel, we are not bound by whatever 

        13        the witness may have said with regard to the definition 

        14        of crimes before the Trial Chamber.  He can ask the 

        15        question if the witness has any answer to give.

        16   BY MR. FLEMING:

        17   Q.   Witness, it is your understanding, isn't it, that there 

        18        was a genocide in Rwanda from the 6th of April 1994 

        19        until about the 16th or the 17th of July l994?

        20   A.   What I know and what I have admitted to are the killings  

        21        for which I have been accused.

        22   Q.   Let me read to you from your statement again, you have 

        23        it there, the very first paragraph, and after the name 

        24        of the prison in the second last sentence, we have: "I 

        25        am presently in a particular place, and have been 

        26        charged with genocide".  You said that in your 

        27        statement; didn't you?

        28   A.   Could you, please, repeat the question for me?

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  And which statement are you referring 

        30        to?  The same statement?

         1   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour, exactly the same statement 

         2        dated September 24th 2001.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Right.

         4   MR. FLEMING: The first paragraph -- the last two sentences of 

         5        the first paragraph, you say, and I quote: "I am 

         6        presently in (interpolation) and have been charged with 

         7        genocide."  You said that in your statement; didn't you?

         8   A.   Yes, I said the same.

         9   Q.   You then said in the last sentence of the first 

        10        paragraph: "I have pled guilty, and I have confessed to 

        11        this crime.  You said that; didn't you?

        12   A.   Yes.

        13   Q.   Now, the public Prosecutor's office in Rwanda has 

        14        refused to accept your plea; hasn't it?

        15   A.   Yes, that's right.

        16   Q.   It is a condition; isn't it, and you know this, for them 

        17        to accept the plea, that you are telling the truth when 

        18        you state the facts.  That is the condition for them to 

        19        accept the plea of guilt; isn't it?

        20   A.   Yes, you are quite right.

        21   Q.   You have had put to you by the Prosecutor's office, 

        22        different versions to the one which you said occurred; 

        23        haven't you?

        24   A.   Yes, that is right.

        25   Q.   So, they are saying to you that they have evidence that 

        26        something altogether different to what you say happened 

        27        actually happened; isn't that the case?

        28   A.   But the office of the Prosecutor never told me that it 

        29        had any evidence proving that events occurred which were 

        30        different to those that are mentioned.

         1   Q.   So, Witness, the situation now is that they have refused 

         2        to accept your plea of guilty and you must face a trial 

         3        before a court.  That is the situation; isn't it?

         4   A.   That is true.

         5   Q.   So, in your trial before a Rwandan court, you will be 

         6        given the opportunity to ventilate the facts which you 

         7        say are true; won't you?

         8   A.   Yes, that's true.

         9   Q.   And the Prosecution will have opportunity of ventilating 

        10        the facts that they say are true; is that the case?

        11   A.   That is right.

         2   Q.   And, indeed, you have been told that if you plead guilty 

         3        and tell the truth and assist the authorities, you may 

         4        well get a reduction in sentence?   You've been told 

         5        that; haven't you?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  That has not been 

         7        the witness's testimony.  There is nothing about if he 

         8        told the truth that -- what the witness was told that if 

         9        he name certain people.  I mean, that is precisely what 

        10        he is mischaracterising, what the witness said.  There 

        11        was never any statement made to this witness that if he 

        12        told the truth that he will have a lighter sentence.   

        13        The statement was said if you name certain people, and 

        14        that's what the -- that is what the record is.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel, but the witness can answer that 

        16        question and give his version as he understands.

        17   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  My learned friend 

        18        knows full well I am cross-examining and putting 

        19        alternative versions to the witness.  So he might well 

        20        smile at his intervention.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we are not before a jury.  

        22        Mr. Fleming is making these comments about witnesses 

        23        smiling, I'm smiling; the Judges are smiling.  That is 

        24        completely inappropriate.  I mean, who is he pleading 

        25        to?  The audience.

        26   MR. FLEMING: Could be possibly, but I didn't know there was 

        27        an audience out there, I can't see --

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Put your question, Counsel and --

         1   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         2   Q.   Witness, you were told, weren't you, that if you 

         3        admitted the crime and told the truth, there was a 

         4        prospect that you would get a lighter sentence?

         5   A.   Yes, quite right.

         6   Q.   All right, Witness.  Now, you tell us you come here 

         7        because -- and I quote from your statement, the first 

         8        sentence of the second paragraph -- "because I believe 

         9        that the truth should be revealed".  You said that in 

        10        your statement; didn't you?

        11   A.   That is correct.

        12   Q.   You believe that Kajelijeli is innocent; don't you?

        13   A.   That is quite true.

        14   Q.   And you are here, aren't you, to help prove his 

        15        innocence; isn't it?

        16   A.   Yes, that's right.

        17   Q.   Now, Witness, I want to go back to Busogo hill.  What 

        18        happened to the bodies of the Tutsi on Busogo hill after 

        19        the 7th of April 1994?

        20   A.   The bodies were buried.

        21   Q.   You told us earlier on that there was no order to bury 

        22        bodies.  What did you mean that there was no order to 

        23        bury bodies?

        24   A.   Did I say that there were no instructions for the burial 

        25        of the bodies?

        26   Q.   I thought you did.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: The question is being taken out of context.  

        28        I object, Your Honour.  He said there was no order to 

        29        bury bodies at Byangabo.  I mean he just cannot be 

        30        asking the witness questions with the intent to --

         1        unless he just wants to confuse the witness.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, indeed, he did talk about Byangabo 

         3        specifically.  That appears to be our recollection as 

         4        well, Counsel, not Busogo hill yet.

         5   MR. FLEMING: Thank you.

         6   BY MR. FLEMING:

         7   Q.   Was there any order to bury bodies around the 7th or the 

         8        8th of April 1994?

         9   A.   No, personally, I didn't hear that order.

        10   Q.   Who buried the bodies on Busogo hill?

        11   A.   The bodies were buried by the people living in the 

        12        neighbourhood.

        13   Q.   As somebody who participated in the massacres, did you 

        14        go back and participate in the burial of the bodies?

        15   A.   No, I didn't go back for the burials.

        16   Q.   You were prepared to travel that distance to kill 

        17        people, but not to travel that distance to bury them; is 

        18        that what you tell us?

        19   A.   I think that in this question you are only wanting to 

        20        disturb me.  I spoke to you about the situation 

        21        prevailing at the time and the state in which the 

        22        inhabitants were in.

        23   Q.   Witness, you were there from 8:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m., 

        24        that is at Busogo hill, on the 7th of April 1994.  At 

        25        any stage, as a responsible member of the society, did 

        26        you ever say stop the killing?

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: I think he has answered that question in a 

        28        variety of ways.

        29   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  I will move on.

         1   BY MR. FLEMING:

         2   Q.   Let us go to Busogo parish.  How far away from Busogo 

         3        parish do you live?  There is no need to tell us where 

         4        you live, just tell us the distance.

         5   A.   So, you now want to know from the Busogo parish up until 

         6        my home?  There is a distance of one and a half 

         7        kilometres.

         8   Q.   You were in Byangabo, you tell us, when you were 

         9        basically at home with nothing else to do.  That's your 

        10        evidence; isn't it?

        11   A.   Yes.

        12   Q.   How far is Byangabo market from Busogo parish?

        13   A.   There is one kilometre.

        14   Q.   Are you telling this Court that on the 7th of 

        15        April 1994, you did not know that there was a massacre 

        16        at Byangabo parish -- I'm sorry Busogo parish?

        17   A.   Frankly, no, I didn't know.

        18   Q.   Is it the state of your knowledge still that you didn't 

        19        know until you came to this Court that there was a 

        20        massacre at Busogo parish?

        21   A.   Yes, I heard that there were massacres at Busogo parish, 

        22        but I cannot testify as to that which I did not witness.

        23   Q.   You are not prepared to testify about things that you 

        24        did not witness, is that what you are telling this Court 

        25        now?

        26   A.   Yes, I cannot testify as to an event that I did not 

        27        witness.

        28   Q.   You didn't witness the massacre at the court of appeal; 

        29        did you?

        30   A.   Yes, I did not witness, meaning no I did not witness

         1        those massacres.

         2   Q.   Witness, on the morning of the 8th, there was concern, 

         3        wasn't there, about the decaying bodies in the vicinity?

         4   A.   I was present; there were no corpses.

         5   Q.   There were corpses on Busogo hill; weren't there?

         6   A.   I did not fully understand your question.

         7   Q.   I said there were corpses on Busogo hill and we are 

         8        speaking about the 8th of April 1994.

         9   A.   I said that those corpses were buried on Busogo hill, 

        10        but I was not present when the corpses were buried.  I 

        11        only said that I was at Byangabo -- at Byangabo centre 

        12        when the burial took place.

        13   Q.   There were corpses at Busogo parish, more than 80 

        14        corpses there, weren't there, on the 8th of April 1994?

        15   A.   I told you that I don't know.

        16   Q.   Witness, Conseiller Asiel Ndisetse, on the morning of 

        17        the 7th, he attempted to placate the crowd; didn't he?

        18   A.   Quite.  Yes.

        19   Q.   He was threatened with death, wasn't he, for his 

        20        efforts?

        21   A.   Yes, that is how it happened.

        22   Q.   Witness, tell me this, when did the military arrive on 

        23        the morning of the 7th of April 1994 at Byangabo market?

        24   A.   The soldiers arrived at Byangabo at 7 a.m.

        25   Q.   And, Witness, Asiel Ndisetse attempted to placate the 

        26        crowd before the soldiers had arrived, hadn't he?

        27   A.   No.

        28   Q.   He tried to make a speech before the soldiers arrived to 

        29        prevent the youths, including yourself, from taking 

        30        revenge; isn't that the case?

         1   A.   Yes, that is correct.

         2   Q.   Do you understand what I am saying: before the military 

         3        arrived he made a speech to try to prevent the youths 

         4        from taking revenge?

         5   A.   Yes, quite, I have understood.  I will explain.

         6   Q.   You then -- it was at that point in time before the 

         7        military arrived that he ran away; wasn't it?

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Is there a breakdown, Interpreter? 

         9   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Did he say anything?  I don't think 

        10        he has answered yet.

        11   MR. FLEMING: No, he hasn't, nor has it been translated into 

        12        Kinyarwanda.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Let him translate into Kinyarwanda.  Did the 

        14        French interpreter get down to the Kinyarwanda 

        15        interpreter.  Did you get counsel's question, 

        16        Interpreter?  I don't know what happened, that's why I 

        17        said -- can you repeat your question, Counsel? 

        18   MR. FLEMING: Yes.

        19   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Yes, please, could you repeat the 

        20        last question?

        21   BY MR. FLEMING:

        22   Q.   Witness, it was before the military came on the scene 

        23        that Asiel Ndisetse ran away; isn't it?

        24   A.   Yes, I did want to explain fully.

        25   Q.   Just to -- relate to my questions and --

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  Counsel is 

        27        attempting to confuse the witness.  The witness is 

        28        attempting to explain and give a fuller answer of what 

        29        happened.  I mean, the issue is what was the sequence of 

        30        events, and the witness is attempting to explain it.  He

         1        doesn't want the witness to explain.  What is the 

         2        purpose of this?  The witness should be able to tell the 

         3        truth as he sees it.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: I think the questions are very clear.  The 

         5        last question was whether or not the person ran before 

         6        the soldiers came or before the arrival -- before the 

         7        soldiers came, and the witness answered, of course, yes, 

         8        and then say that he wants to explain.  Okay, so, 

         9        whether there was any ambiguity on that, it is a clear 

        10        answer that it appears to come from the witness and can 

        11        be followed up also from -- if counsel does not want to 

        12        follow up, you can follow it up also from your side in 

        13        re-examination in-chief.  Please take note.

        14   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours. 

        15   BY MR. FLEMING:

        16   Q.   Now, Witness, you've told us that --

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: If a question is not clear, it does not appear 

        18        to be clear to the witness, the Trial Chamber will say 

        19        so and that question has got to be clarified. 

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Can we get the witness those instructions so 

        21        that we -- in all fairness to the witness, so that we 

        22        don't have to waste a lot of time with me having to deal 

        23        with it on cross, let -- the witness could deal with it 

        24        directly.  Opportunity.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: About what?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, the witness has said, "I would like to 

        27        explain", but I am asking the Court to tell the witness 

        28        if there is any ambiguity, if he doesn't understand.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Yes, Mr. Moore (sic).  The witness, as 

        30        we always say, that if there is any problem about 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        understanding a question, he can always say so and such 

         2        a question can be clarified.  There is no doubt about 

         3        that one.  Can you tell that to the witness.

         4   THE WITNESS: On that point, I should like to give some 

         5        explanation as to the circumstances under which the 

         6        soldiers arrived and in respect of this gentleman, 

         7        Ndisetse.

         8   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

         9   BY MR. FLEMING: 

        10   Q.   Now, you've told us that Ndisetse ran before the 

        11        soldiers arrived, and you told us that he ran as a 

        12        result of the threat against his life.  That's the case; 

        13        isn't it?

        14   A.   No, that is not my statement.  Yesterday when counsel 

        15        for Kajelijeli asked me a question, I answered that 

        16        Asiel Ndisetse, the conseiller, had run away after the 

        17        soldier, Mburuburengero, had given the order to kill him 

        18        because he was trying -- the conseiller, Ndisetse, was 

        19        trying to prevent the massacre of the Tutsi.  That was 

        20        my statement.

        21   Q.   That was yesterday.  It wasn't the statement today.

        22   A.   I don't understand very well your question, but I said 

        23        before that I needed to give an explanation so that you 

        24        could understand how the military arrived and what 

        25        happened in respect of Ndisetse.

        26   Q.   Witness, had Ndisetse fled before the order was given to 

        27        go and get Rukara?

        28   A.   No, I was saying that that conseiller was condemning the 

        29        acts which we were indulging in, and when the lieutenant 

        30        arrived, we told him that that conseiller was preventing

         1        us from going to seek out Tutsis where they were.  There 

         2        were many refugees who were very excited and that's when 

         3        that lieutenant gave this order.

         4   Q.   Witness, had Ndisetse fled before the order was given to 

         5        kill Rukara?

         6   A.   No.

         7   Q.   Had Ndisetse fled before Rukara was killed?

         8   A.   Ndisetse fled after Rukara was killed.

         9   Q.   I want you, please, to go back to your statement taken  

        10        the 24th of September 2001.

        11   MR. FLEMING: And for the benefit of the booth, that is the 

        12        first paragraph, in each case, on the second page.

        13   BY MR. FLEMING:

        14   Q.   I want you to go to -- if you would, please, Witness, to 

        15        the third page and the second paragraph and I want you 

        16        to listen to what you have said in that.  "Before 

        17        Lieutenant Mburuburengero and military arrived at 

        18        Byangabo market, conseiller Asiel Ndisetse tried to 

        19        prevent the youth from taking revenge because of the 

        20        president's death".  I pause there so that it can be 

        21        translated.  Second sentence, and I quote, "He made a 

        22        speech to try to prevent us from taking revenge and the 

        23        military came on the scene and Ndisetse was pointed out 

        24        and he ran away".  I pause there to allow the 

        25        interpretation.

        26   A.   Yes.

        27   Q.   The third sentence and I quote, "Immediately after we 

        28        went to Rukara's brother's home, located about 300 

        29        metres from the main road in Byangabo".  I pause for 

        30        translation.

         1   A.   Yes.

         2   Q.   Next sentence, "We took Rukara and his brother Lucien 

         3        out of their home and I and three others killed Rukara 

         4        and one other killed Lucien".

         5   A.   Yes, that is right.

         6   Q.   Now, Witness, the point is this: Ndisetse was pointed 

         7        out and he ran away and immediately after that occurred, 

         8        you went to Rukara's house and you took him out and you 

         9        killed him; isn't that the way that happened?

        10   A.   No, that was not the sequence of events.

        11   Q.   So the statement that you made on the 24th of 

        12        September 2001, where you swore that you have told the 

        13        truth, is wrong, isn't it, according to you now?

        14   A.   That statement that was made at the time is correct.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, maybe -- I don't know he follows or 

        16        perhaps -- has he followed the reading as put to him by 

        17        counsel?

        18   THE WITNESS: Yes, I followed.  I should like to explain so 

        19        that the Tribunal -- the Chamber will understand that 

        20        what I am saying matches what is in the statement, but I 

        21        noticed that the Prosecutor doesn't understand that 

        22        Mburuburengero came twice.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: What is the witness to address vis-a-vis his 

        24        statement and whatever issue he wants to address?

        25   BY MR. FLEMING:

        26   Q.   Let us go through it again, Witness.  No matter how many 

        27        times Lieutenant Mburuburengero came, I want to deal 

        28        with Ndisetse and what you said and I will read again 

        29        about Ndisetse.  In the second sentence, "He made a 

        30        speech to try to prevent us from taking revenge and the

         1        military came on the same day and Ndisetse was pointed 

         2        out and he ran away".  Now, please translate that 

         3        sentence.

         4   A.   Yes, I understand.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

         6   BY MR. FLEMING:

         7   Q.   The next sentence is --

         8   A.   However, in the statement we are talking of when 

         9        Ndisetse spoke, but before he spoke Lieutenant 

        10        Mburuburengero had already given us the order to go and 

        11        arrest Rukara.

        12   Q.   Witness, immediately after Ndisetse was pointed out and 

        13        he ran away -- I quote again from your statement -- 

        14        "Immediately after we went to Rukara's brother's home, 

        15        located about 300 metres from the main road in Byangabo, 

        16        we took Rukara and his brother Lucien out of their 

        17        home".  You said that; didn't you?

        18   A.   Yes, I made that statement, but it was just to try and 

        19        show that the two individuals were killed practically at 

        20        the same time because between the death of the first and 

        21        the death of the second, there was not more than 

        22        15 minutes elapsed.  The two persons -- individuals were 

        23        both taken out of the house.

        24   Q.   Witness, you were anxious to tell us before that 

        25        Lieutenant Mburuburengero came twice.  I want you to go 

        26        to the previous paragraph, to the one which we've just 

        27        been dealing in the statement. 

        28   MR. FLEMING: For the benefit of the booth, that's the last 

        29        paragraph, in each case on the first page of the 

        30        statement.  That is the typed statement.

         1   BY MR. FLEMING:

         2   Q.   And Witness, I am talking about the first paragraph of 

         3        the handwritten statement on the third page.

         4   A.   Yes.

         5   Q.   All right.  And please follow this through and see if 

         6        you agree that you said this in the statement, and I 

         7        quote, "I first heard of the president's death around 

         8        6:00 a.m. on April 7th, 1994, while I was at home and 

         9        immediately went to Byangabo market".  I pause there for 

        10        the translation.

        11   A.   That is correct.

        12   Q.   Second sentence, and I quote, "When I arrived there, a 

        13        military officer named Lieutenant Mburuburengero, who 

        14        was S3 in Mukamira camp, came and told us that Tutsis 

        15        were responsible for the president's death".  I pause 

        16        for the translation.

        17   A.   That is right.

        18   Q.   The next sentence: "It was around 7:00 a.m."?

        19   A.   That is correct.

        20   Q.   Next sentence: "He asked where Rukara lived since he 

        21        made building blocks that we used that Mukamira military 

        22        camp".

        23   A.   Yes.

        24   Q.   Now, the next paragraph is one that we've dealt with, 

        25        but let us put it in context.  Immediately after that 

        26        paragraph you said and I quote, "Before Lieutenant 

        27        Mburuburengero and military arrived at Byangabo market 

        28        Conseiller Asiel Ndisetse tried to prevent the youths 

        29        from taking revenge because of the president's death".

        30   A.   Yes.

         1   Q.   Now, shall we pause there?  Is this the second time that 

         2        you say that the lieutenant had come that morning?

         3   A.   Yes.  You mean, Mr. Prosecutor?

         4   MR. FLEMING: Was that from the witness or from the 

         5        interpreter?  

         6   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: It is the witness, 

         7        Mr. Prosecutor.

         8   THE WITNESS: When the lieutenant arrived the second time, 

         9        Rukara was already dead.

        10   BY MR. FLEMING:

        11   Q.   All right, that's the way you want to read it.  I am 

        12        just putting it in terms of what you've said.  You then 

        13        go on to say the next sentence, "He made a speech to try 

        14        to prevent us from taking revenge and the military came 

        15        on the scene and Ndisetse was pointed out and he ran 

        16        away".  That's the next sentence.

        17   A.   Yes, that's right.

        18   Q.   "Immediately after --" and I am quoting from your 

        19        statement -- "immediately after we went to Rukara 

        20        brother's home located 300 metres from the main road of 

        21        Byangabo, we took Rukara and his bother, Lucien, out of 

        22        their home, and I and various others killed Rukara, and 

        23        Musafiri killed Lucien".  Now, that's what you say was 

        24        the order of events, isn't it, in your statement?

        25   A.   That's what I explained in the statement.

        26   Q.   Yes, thank you.  Now, the country by this stage, I take 

        27        it in your view, was at war, was it?

        28   A.   Yes.

        29   Q.   And the swift response of the 7th of April in your 

        30        region must have been seen as a victory of some sort;

         1        wasn't it?

         2   A.   No.  No, that is not how we proceed.  That is not how we 

         3        understood the situation, because we can't say that we 

         4        really knew anything regarding the war.  We heard on the 

         5        radio, talk about the war; we heard of attacks by the 

         6        RPF; we could see refugees, but we didn't know much 

         7        about the war apart from all that.

         8   Q.   In your area, you took swift revenge, didn't you, for 

         9        the killing of the president?

        10   A.   Yes, that's correct.

        11   Q.   And it was seen in your area as a victory, wasn't it?

        12   A.   No, that did not occur to us.  I -- personally that 

        13        didn't occur to me as such.  It's we the people who were 

        14        excited -- emotionally upset of the death of the 

        15        president.  That's how I explain it.

        16   Q.   So, as a result you went out, you killed these many 

        17        Tutsi as you could find; you shared their property 

        18        around.  That was the response; wasn't it?

        19   A.   Especially that the refugees who were in that area 

        20        remembered what the RPF had done to them.  They had left 

        21        their home areas, their place of birth, running from 

        22        hill to hill, and the lieutenant we mentioned said that 

        23        the Tutsis were involved, implicated in the death of the 

        24        president of the republic.  Those are the circumstances 

        25        under which it occurred.

        26   Q.   So, Witness, you went out with the others; you all 

        27        killed these many Tutsi as you could that day, and you 

        28        shared out their property; didn't you?

        29   A.   Yes, that's how it transpired.

        30   Q.   And you had a beer at the end of the day to celebrate

         1        it; didn't you?

         2   A.   No, that did not happen, at least, as far as I know.

         3   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, is that an appropriate time?

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We'll stop here and take a break and 

         5        resume our work at half past two this afternoon.  

         6        

         7        Could you also, Interpreter, inform Witness RGM 

         8        accordingly, and that until 2:30 these proceedings stand 

         9        adjourned?

        10        (Court recessed from 1300H to 1435H)

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  The 

        12        registry informs us that the witness has had some 

        13        medication.  Maybe you can tell Witness RGM in case he 

        14        needs any break at any time he can let us know -- let 

        15        the Trial Chamber know.  

        16        

        17        Yes, Mr. Fleming.

        18   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.

        19   BY MR. FLEMING:

        20   Q.   Witness, so far as you know, there was nobody at ISAE on 

        21        the evening of April, the 7th.  That's the best you can 

        22        say; isn't it?

        23   A.   No one was at the ISAE.

        24   Q.   You were there, were you?

        25   A.   All I know is that the institution was closed.

        26   Q.   So you did not know, do you, if anybody was or was not 

        27        at ISAE that night?

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  The witness has 

        29        said no one was there, the institution was closed.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: I think that is a proper question to follow

         1        up.  The witness can answer the question.  He can 

         2        reiterate, give another version.  I think the counsel is 

         3        entitled to ask that question.

         4   THE WITNESS: I don't know whether anyone was at that 

         5        institute, but all I know is that the staff of that 

         6        institute were not -- was not there because the 

         7        institution was closed.

         8   BY MR. FLEMING:

         9   Q.   Witness, you told us before, that you don't give 

        10        evidence about things that you didn't see.  You didn't 

        11        see the ISAE on the night of the 7th, did you?

        12   A.   I know that the institute was closed.

        13   Q.   Witness, you were not there, you didn't see it, did you, 

        14        on the night of the 7th?

        15   A.   I didn't see anything at that location.

        16   Q.   Because you were nowhere near that location on the night 

        17        of the 7th, were you?

        18   A.   That is correct.

        19   Q.   So, Witness, we come back to what you said.  You don't 

        20        know what was happening there because you didn't see it, 

        21        isn't that the case?

        22   A.   I don't know what would have happened at that place 

        23        since I didn't go there.

        24   Q.   Exactly.  And you were too keen to tell us this morning, 

        25        or perhaps last night, that there were no drinks when 

        26        you don't know that's the fact, isn't it?

        27   A.   I told you that the institute was closed during that 

        28        period of time.  Since it was closed, I wasn't able to 

        29        say that nothing had happened in that place.

        30   Q.   All right.  Witness, you are quite convinced, aren't

         1        you, that Kajelijeli was not present so far as you could  

         2        see on the 7th or the 8th of April 1994?  You didn't see 

         3        him those days, did you?

         4   A.   That is correct.

         5   Q.   By that you mean he wasn't where you were; isn't that 

         6        what you mean?

         7   A.   Yes, that's correct, they were not at the same place as 

         8        myself.

         9   Q.   And at the same time as yourself?

        10   A.   Yes, they were not with me at the same time nor at the 

        11        same location, because on that date of the 7th and 8th, 

        12        I didn't see them.

        13   Q.   How far away from Byangabo hill is Byangabo parish?

        14   A.   Could we have the question again please, Mr. Prosecutor?

        15   Q.   How far away is Byangabo hill from Byangabo parish -- 

        16        I'm sorry, Busogo hill from Busogo parish.

        17   A.   I told you that between Byangabo and the Busogo parish, 

        18        there was a distance of one kilometre.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  But I think counsel is asking about 

        20        Busogo hill and Busogo parish.

        21   THE WITNESS: There is a distance of 500 metres between Busogo 

        22        hill and Busogo parish.

        23   BY MR. FLEMING:

        24   Q.   So, on the day of the 7th of April 1994, is it your 

        25        evidence that you heard no gunshots, for example, coming 

        26        from Busogo parish?

        27   A.   I heard the gunshots.

        28   Q.   Did you hear hand grenades exploding?

        29   A.   I also heard grenades exploding.

        30   Q.   Did you see fire?

         1   A.   No.

         2   Q.   Can you see directly from Busogo hill to Busogo parish?

         3   A.   Are you saying if you are on top of Busogo hill or at 

         4        the foot of Busogo hill?  If you are standing at the top 

         5        of Busogo hill, you can see Busogo parish, but if you 

         6        are at the bottom of the hill, you wouldn't be able to 

         7        see Busogo parish.

         8   Q.   Witness, is it your evidence still that the Interahamwe 

         9        did not receive militia or military-type training?

        10   A.   I maintain that the Interahamwe did not receive any 

        11        military training.

        12   Q.   On the morning of the 7th of April 1994 at Byangabo 

        13        market, how many other Interahamwe were there when you 

        14        were there?

        15   A.   I have given you the names of the Interahamwe with whom 

        16        I was whilst we were killing Rukara.  Those are the ones 

        17        whom I was able to recognise.

        18   Q.   And so, there were members of Interahamwe with you, were 

        19        they?

        20   A.   Yes, but I recognised many of them during the Rwankeri 

        21        attack whilst we were still at Rwankeri.

        22   Q.   Let us get this straight.  So, it was members of 

        23        Interahamwe who killed Rukara and Lucien; is that right?

        24   A.   Yes, that's right.

        25   Q.   And then there were many members of the Interahamwe with 

        26        you at Rwankeri; is that your evidence?

        27   A.   Yes, but if you want I can give you the names of those 

        28        Interahamwe.

        29   Q.   I don't need their names.  You might like to give us the 

        30        number of Interahamwe who were present at Rwankeri or

         1        Busogo hill.

         2   A.   Actually the Interahamwe who were with me were not more 

         3        than ten.  The rest of the group was made up of the war 

         4        displaced persons and members of the population.

         5   Q.   Witness, this is the situation, isn't it, by half past 

         6        six or 7 o'clock the morning after the president was 

         7        killed, you and other Interahamwe were killing people at 

         8        Byangabo, weren't you?

         9   A.   That's correct.  But in the company of the Interahamwe 

        10        were the persons displaced by the war and members of the 

        11        population.

        12   Q.   Witness, and in company was Kajelijeli, isn't that the 

        13        case?

        14   A.   No, that is not true; he wasn't there.

        15   Q.   And shortly after that there was a request for weapons, 

        16        wasn't there, to be able to continue the killings?

        17   A.   No, weapons were not asked for.

        18   Q.   And Kajelijeli brought weapons, didn't he?

        19   A.   No, that's not true.  That's a lie.

        20   Q.   And women were raped at Rwankeri, weren't they?

        21   A.   I told you that I don't know anything about rapes.  I 

        22        heard about them during the Gacaca hearings.

        23   Q.   And Interahamwe were involved in the killing at Busogo 

        24        parish, weren't they?

        25   A.   I had told you that I don't know anything about that.  I 

        26        also told you that I can only testify to events that I 

        27        witnessed.

        28   Q.   You were very keen to tell us about things that other 

        29        people told you.  That was a break from things that you 

        30        are an eyewitness to, wasn't it -- I will withdraw that

         1        question, metaphor, argument.  Witness, nothing would 

         2        convince you to a contrary view in respect to the man 

         3        named Gato, would it?

         4   A.   Had I been in a position to know what Gato had done, I 

         5        would be in a position to disprove a lot that he may 

         6        have said.

         7   Q.   A lot of what he might have said where?

         8   A.   From what you have just told me, I am saying that had I 

         9        known what he had said, I would have denied a large part 

        10        of what he might have said.

        11   Q.   Things that he might have said where?

        12   A.   I am answering you in that way, because when you asked 

        13        me the question as to whether nothing could convince me 

        14        to change what I know about Gato, that made me 

        15        understand that he had said something.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        17   BY MR. FLEMING:

        18   Q.   And, Witness, Kajelijeli was present in Byangabo on the 

        19        day on which the attack upon the court of appeal 

        20        occurred, I suggest to you.

        21   A.   No, Kajelijeli was not present at Byangabo.

        22   Q.   Witness, you've told us you killed without conscience.  

        23        I suggest to you that you came here and lied without 

        24        conscience.

        25   A.   I will not accept your suggestion because I am speaking 

        26        about events of which I was an eyewitness.

        27   Q.   So, any reliable evidence -- no, I'm sorry.

        28   MR. FLEMING: Sorry, Your Honours.  That's the evidence of 

        29        this witness -- I am sorry, that's the 

        30        cross-examination.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Any re-examination, Professor Hinds?

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour.  

         4        

         5                          RE-EXAMINATION 

         6   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         7   Q.   Witness, why did you come here to Arusha to testify in 

         8        this place?  What were your reasons for coming here, can 

         9        you tell this Tribunal? 

        10   A.   I came to testify, as I explained to you, to tell the 

        11        truth on events that occurred in 1994, and I have told 

        12        you that I was ready to answer questions put to me by 

        13        anyone on events of 1994, and I will do it the way I did 

        14        it in my confession. 

        15   Q.   Witness, prior to your testimony before this Tribunal 

        16        concerning killings that you participated in on the 7th, 

        17        were you involved in any criminal activity in Rwanda 

        18        prior to that time?

        19   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Counsel, I did not understand your 

        20        question.

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        22   Q.   Witness, prior to your involvement in the killings that 

        23        you testified about on April 7th of 1994, were you 

        24        involved in any criminal activity in Rwanda? 

        25   A.   No, I did not commit any other offence. 

        26   Q.   So, prior to the events of April 7th, you were a good 

        27        citizen; is that correct? 

        28   A.   Yes, I was a good citizen.

        29   Q.   And when you confessed to the crimes that you committed 

        30        during that particular period, did you, in fact,

          KAJELIJELI                                      19 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        indicate your remorse and sorrow for the crimes you 

         2        committed?

         3   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, I object to my learned friend 

         4        leading as how -- as he possibly can. 

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Let me rephrase.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   During your confession in Rwanda, did you, in fact, 

         9        indicate your feeling about the killings that you 

        10        participated in? 

        11   A.   I have done some soul searching and I realised that I 

        12        have nothing to reproach myself of, since the government 

        13        of national unity had asked us to do everything to bring 

        14        Rwandans together, I decided to tell the truth. 

        15   Q.   Why have you refused over the length of time -- that you 

        16        have continued to refuse to put Kajelijeli into the 

        17        criminal activities? 

        18   A.   After making my confession and after my repentance, I 

        19        understood that if I accuse someone of having 

        20        participated in the killings when that was not true, 

        21        that would amount to another criminal act. 

        22   Q.   Now, concerning --

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Go on counsel. 

        24   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        25   Q.   Concerning the killings that took place in Ruhengeri, 

        26        can you tell the Tribunal, if you can, the number of 

        27        people who were involved during those killings and 

        28        lootings and burnings that took place on the morning of 

        29        April 7th? 

        30   A.   Those who participated in the killings at that place

         1        were many; the looters were also many.  However, there 

         2        are names that I can give you and which I have mentioned 

         3        in my confession statement. 

         4   Q.   I would like you to tell the Tribunal if you --

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, you are asking about those who 

         6        participated in the killings of which date?

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: On April 7th at Ruhengeri.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Please, go on.

         9   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        10   Q.   Witness, I would like you to tell the Tribunal if you 

        11        can, an estimate of the number of people who were 

        12        involved in this killing.  You have already indicated 

        13        that there were about ten Interahamwe in that location.

        14   A.   Please, repeat the question, Counsel. 

        15   Q.   Can you tell the Tribunal -- can you give an estimate of 

        16        the number of people who were involved in the killings 

        17        that took place at Ruhengeri on the 7th? 

        18   A.   Let me give you the following estimate: the number of 

        19        people who participated in the killings at that place is 

        20        between 650 and 700 people. 

        21   Q.   And, can you tell the Tribunal what was the composition 

        22        of this number of people, where did they come from?  Who 

        23        were they? 

        24   A.   This group was made up of war displaced people fleeing 

        25        from the RPF war in the Keru, Butaro, Kidaho and Kinigi 

        26        communes, and the rest of the group was made up of 

        27        women, young men who lived in the neighbourhood of that 

        28        locality. 

        29   Q.   And the number of individuals whom you identified as 

        30        Interahamwe were about; is that correct?

          KAJELIJELI                                      19 NOVEMBER 2002



         1   A.   That is correct. 

         2   Q.   Now, can you explain to the Tribunal what you meant when 

         3        you said there was no plan to conduct these killings, 

         4        what did you mean by that? 

         5   A.   I was saying that there was no plan to perpetrate these 

         6        killings because nobody invited me to participate in the 

         7        killings. Suddenly, we just saw a great number of people 

         8        assembling in Byangabo and the killings started, and I 

         9        being an Interahamwe, did not participate in the 

        10        killings as an Interahamwe, I participated as an 

        11        individual, and that because there were some Interahamwe 

        12        who are free and who are not being tried because of the 

        13        killings. 

        14   Q.   Sir, do you know names of Interahamwe who are free and 

        15        who were in the secteur during April 7th and 8th and 

        16        have not been arrested for any crimes? 

        17   A.   I am not sure if we are in closed session, so that I can 

        18        mention these names of the Interahamwe.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, can we go into closed session?

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. Can that be done registry?

        21   MR. KIYEYEU: We are going to do so, My Lord. 

        22        

        23        (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the 

        24        transcript [pages 68 to 69] was extracted and sealed 

        25        under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)

         1   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         2   Q.   Witness, you have told us that there was no recruitment 

         3        for membership of the Interahamwe in the Busogo secteur; 

         4        is that correct? 

         5   A.   That is correct.

         6   Q.   Could you tell the Chamber how the Interahamwe got its 

         7        members in Busogo secteur, how did you get your members? 

         8   A.   I stated earlier that to be a member of the Interahamwe, 

         9        there are certain conditions that have to be met, i.e. 

        10        to be 18 years and above, to be of good behaviour before 

        11        the people, good moral standing recognised by the 

        12        people. 

        13   Q.   Witness, did membership of the Busogo secteur 

        14        Interahamwe come from another organisation -- youth 

        15        organisation?

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: I think that one -- we already have that 

        17        evidence on record.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: The reason why I am raising this, is because 

        19        the Prosecutor went into questions about recruitment, 

        20        and went into questions concerning why no Tutsis were 

        21        recruited, but if the Court knows --

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: No, not in that aspect and not with regard to 

        23        that aspect, and that is one.  The other one might not 

        24        be an easy matter.  If you are addressing some specific 

        25        areas, would you like to -- we continue as we are? 

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I am not.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, if you follow us then, of course, you 

        28        can continue because you have been addressing a 

        29        particular aspect of a secteur, I don't know whether 

        30        there would be any linkage.  Go on, Counsel, we will see

         1        how far you go.

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: Now that you have brought it to my 

         3        attention, there may be some linkage, depending on what 

         4        the witness says.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: You see how you determine it. 

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Let me just say something actually. 

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Witness, in response to a question put to you by the 

         9        Prosecutor, you indicated that you knew that Tutsis were 

        10        members of the MRND; is that correct? 

        11   A.   That is correct. 

        12   Q.   Do you know individuals who were Tutsis who were members 

        13        of the MRND?  Do you know their names? 

        14   A.   Yes, I know some. 

        15   Q.   Could you tell the Tribunal who they are as far as you 

        16        know, Tutsis who were members of the MRND? 

        17   A.   I can mention Kasankaima, that is K-A-S-A-N-K-A-I-M-A.  

        18        I can also mention Yamweri, Y-A-M-W-E-R-I.  There is 

        19        also Sengoma, S-E-N-G-O-M-A.  There is also one Phillip 

        20        who was a messenger at the communal office as well as 

        21        his father Muhinda, Abel.  Muhinda is M-U-H-I-N-D-A.  

        22        These are the names of Tutsis that I remember, Tutsis 

        23        who were members of the MRND which I remember.  I must 

        24        say that there were also Tutsi women.  I saw Tutsi women 

        25        who were wearing the kitenge of the MRND, and in that 

        26        regard I remember one person called Kabare.  Kabare is, 

        27        K-A-B-A-R-E. 

        28   Q.   Witness, do you know someone by the name of Robert 

        29        Kajuga, K-A-J-U-G-A, who is a Tutsi? 

        30   A.   I do not know him.

         1   Q.   Witness, did you know that the national founder of the 

         2        Interahamwe was a Tutsi, did you know this? 

         3   A.   I did not know this; I am not aware of this information. 

         4   Q.   Witness, when in your statement you said -- and I am 

         5        quoting from the written statement that you have in 

         6        front of you, it is the third page, last paragraph: 

         7        "There was no need for additional weapons".  

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Is the translator there where we are?

         9   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: No, not yet. 

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: I am sorry, it is the fourth page at the 

        11        last paragraph. "There was no need for additional 

        12        weapons", is the translator there?

        13   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Yes, Counsel.

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        15   Q.   Witness, when you said in your statements, "there was no 

        16        need for additional weapons at Ruhengeri, because first 

        17        of all the Tutsis were not armed and we had the 

        18        assistance of the military who were armed", what did you 

        19        mean by that statement? 

        20   A.   What I meant by these words was that, I wanted to 

        21        explain that there were many assailants, so we did not 

        22        need additional weapons or additional arms because the 

        23        people who were being attacked were not stronger than we 

        24        were. 

        25   Q.   Witness, you have testified that the prosecutors in 

        26        Rwanda refused to accept your confession of guilt and 

        27        your guilty plea.  Can you tell the Tribunal why the 

        28        prosecutors told you that they refused to accept your 

        29        guilty plea? 

        30   A.   They refused my confession because there were names they

         1        wanted me to include in my confession, and I did not 

         2        accept to do that. 

         3   Q.   Now, you have told this Tribunal in response to the 

         4        Prosecutor's question that you believe that Juvénal 

         5        Kajelijeli is innocent.  Why do you believe that 

         6        Mr. Kajelijeli is innocent of the crimes charged against 

         7        him? 

         8   A.   I stated to the Tribunal that Kajelijeli is innocent in 

         9        respect of the charges against him because in prison -- 

        10        as we are, at the prison where I am, we are 47 people.  

        11        At a Gacaca session in prison, none of the people I 

        12        mentioned ever mentioned him, cited him.  It is a Gacaca 

        13        session that is recognises by the Rwandan prosecutor's 

        14        office. 

        15   Q.   You told us that there was a Gacaca session between 1999 

        16        and 2000.  Was any one set free as a result of the 

        17        proceedings that took place at the Gacaca session during 

        18        that time period? 

        19   A.   At the time of that Gacaca session in prison, it was the 

        20        prosecutor of the republic and his assistant who were 

        21        running it and in the course of that session, the 

        22        prisoners, detainees present there, agreed on the truth 

        23        of such and such an event at the time of the events of 

        24        1994.  Following that Gacaca session, people were 

        25        exculpated by what the prisoners had said and they were 

        26        released and rehabilitated.  Along the same lines, I 

        27        think Kajelijeli is innocent because none of the people 

        28        in the Gacaca session prosecuted at my side as I was, 

        29        said that Kajelijeli had participated in the criminal 

        30        acts perpetrated in the Busogo secteur.  Moreover, the

          KAJELIJELI                                      19 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        prosecutor's people, since they had the need to tell the 

         2        truth, to state who had ordered the crimes to be 

         3        perpetrated, who had perpetrated the crimes and who were 

         4        the victims.  So, at that session, we had to tell the 

         5        truth on all those aspects. 

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS:  No further questions. 

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: No further questions.  Thank you, Learned 

         8        Counsel. 

         9        

        10        Yes, Judge Ramaroson has a question for the witness.

        11   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you, My Lord.  

        12        

        13        Witness, you said before that the people who were 

        14        attacking the people on the Busogo hill were 600 to 700; 

        15        is that right?

        16   THE WITNESS: Yes. 

        17   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And amongst them were displaced people -- 

        18        the people displaced by the war, Interahamwe, and also 

        19        the military? 

        20   THE WITNESS: On that point, I had stated that the military 

        21        arrived later, they found us there. 

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: At what time did the soldiers come; was it 

        23        in the morning or afternoon?  

        24   THE WITNESS:The soldiers arrived in the forenoon. 

        25   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And all those people killed only tens of 

        26        Tutsis from 8th o'clock in the morning until 5 p.m.? 

        27   THE WITNESS: In the course of that day, as people were being 

        28        killed bit by bit, gradually, others were busy with 

        29        looting, purging which is why it took so long. 

        30   JUDGE RAMAROSON: From where the military camp -- from which 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                      19 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        camp?

         2   THE WITNESS: The soldiers came from Mukamira. I will spell 

         3        that for you, M-U-K-A-M-I-R-A.

         4   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And who -- the soldiers were taking orders 

         5        from whom? 

         6   THE WITNESS: The soldiers must have been under someone's 

         7        orders because we saw them come.  The Lieutenant 

         8        Mburuburengero himself said he had sent a few soldiers 

         9        to help us.

        10   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Did Kajelijeli have a house at Byangabo? 

        11   THE WITNESS:  Yes, he had one.

        12   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And did he have a little drinking place.

        13   THE WITNESS: Yes, there was a drinking place, but it wasn't 

        14        Kajelijeli who was running the business. The house 

        15        belonged to Kajelijeli but it wasn't Kajelijeli running 

        16        the business. 

        17   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And, did he live at Byangabo?

        18   THE WITNESS: No, he did not.

        19   THE WITNESS: Did his wife -- one of his wives live in that 

        20        house? 

        21   THE WITNESS: No, none.

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: How far was Kajelijeli's house from Byangabo 

        23        market? 

        24   THE WITNESS: That house was at the very centre of Byangabo.

        25   JUDGE RAMAROSON: So, what distance from the market, was it 

        26        next to the market? 

        27   THE WITNESS: The house was on the road going to Ruhengeri.  

        28        So, it was next to the market. 

        29   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And who ran the drinking place? 

        30   THE WITNESS: There was a woman who ran the drinking place who

          KAJELIJELI                                      19 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        worked there and her name was Nyiramafaranga.  I will 

         2        spell it for you, N-Y-I-R-A-M-A-F-A-R-A-N-G-A.

         3   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And who lived in the house?  Was the house 

         4        rented out? 

         5   THE WITNESS: I don't know anyone living at that house; I only 

         6        saw it being open and beer being sold.

         7   JUDGE RAMAROSON: But the woman who ran the business, was it 

         8        under Kajelijeli's orders, was he the owner? 

         9   THE WITNESS: That is something that I don't know.

        10   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Did Kajelijeli have brothers in Byangabo and 

        11        who were Interahamwe? 

        12   THE WITNESS: No, none.

        13   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Does he have no brother in prison, don't say 

        14        the name of your prison?

        15   THE WITNESS:  Yes, he has a brother who is in prison.

        16   JUDGE RAMAROSON: And that brother lives where?  Did he 

        17        participate in the events of the 7th of April? 

        18   THE WITNESS: With regard to that question, I don't know, I 

        19        never saw him.

        20   JUDGE RAMAROSON: But you say he is in prison at the same 

        21        place as you.  Don't say where it is.

        22   THE WITNESS:  Yes, yes, quite.  We are imprisoned at the same 

        23        place.

        24   JUDGE RAMAROSON: But you don't know at all what he 

        25        participated in? 

        26   THE WITNESS: I really don't know anything about what he would 

        27        have participated in.

        28   JUDGE RAMAROSON: I have finished.  Thank you very much. 

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Interpreter, could you tell 

        30        Witness RGM that this marks the end of his testimony and

         1        we thank him.  We shall have time at a later stage to 

         2        consider and review his evidence together with all the 

         3        evidence that is going to be adduced during the course 

         4        of this trial.  But,once again, we thank him. 

         5   THE WITNESS: I thank you also on my part. 

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: I don't know whether there will be any 

         7        tendering of documents with regard to this witness, and 

         8        if so, can, at the same time, this witness be excused. I 

         9        don't know what is the position.

        10   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, we will be doing something along 

        11        the normal lines with the statement.  There are 

        12        inconsistences, one would say. 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay, but you don't need the -- 

        14        

        15        Counsel, I think the witness would not be required at 

        16        that stage, he can leave then.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is correct, Your Honour.

        18   MR. FLEMING: I am content to tender the whole of the 

        19        statement, Your Honour, what it contains and what it 

        20        doesn't contain.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, that might be a different matter, but we 

        22        take it that the witness -- whatever happens, the 

        23        witness would not be required.

        24        

        25        All right.  Tell Witness RGM, we have already thanked 

        26        him, he may leave.  

        27        

        28        Professor Hinds, your next witness?  Maybe you can just 

        29        give the name and then we will take a break.  This is 

        30        about the time we take the break and when we come back,

         1        we will start with that witness. 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  That witness is 

         3        MEM.  Your Honour, I hope he is available.  We saw him 

         4        during the lunch break and I think he was having some 

         5        malaria problems and was having blood drawn.  I don't 

         6        know if it was done, I will have to just check with 

         7        co-counsel during the break and find out what is the 

         8        situation.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. You can let us know the position. So, we 

        10        will take the normal break for 15 minutes and resume our 

        11        work at a quarter past four.  

        12        

        13        All right.  So, until 4:15, these proceedings stand 

        14        adjourned.

        15        (Court recessed from 1600H to 1615H)

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are resumed.  Professor Hinds, 

        17        please?

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour, I have just been informed 

        19        by Witness and Victim Protection that our witness -- 

        20        this is unofficial, but he has indications of malaria 

        21        and he is -- Dr. Belai wanted to bring him there and 

        22        they are trying to work out the security measures.  But 

        23        at this point he is too sick to come to court.  I assume 

        24        that we would be advised -- when the Court is advised as 

        25        to what his condition is concerning tomorrow. 

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Well, we can't do much.  Any possible 

        27        alternatives, perhaps, I mean for tomorrow, not now?  

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, as the Court knows, I was up to the 

        29        prison up until 11 o'clock last night.  The problem that 

        30        we have is that we don't have -- it is not a normal

         1        situation where you have access to witnesses.  They were 

         2        delivered here.  I just came on Saturday and I have not, 

         3        in fact, even seen the other two witnesses.  I have seen 

         4        these, RGM and MEM, but I have not seen RHU25 and RHU27, 

         5        since I saw them in Rwanda in September of last year.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  In that case, of course, we will 

         7        adjourn these proceedings to tomorrow morning at nine 

         8        and see how things work out.  Maybe, Counsel, you may 

         9        try to see what could have happened if for any one 

        10        reason that perhaps the witness would not be able to 

        11        take the stand tomorrow, what can be done in the 

        12        alternative.  I know it is --

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: I would do everything possible, Your Honour, 

        14        to see how we can move forward.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        16   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, on our part we are more than happy 

        17        to have anybody interposed.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  So, we leave things as they are 

        19        with the possible arrangement that can be worked out by 

        20        counsel.  

        21        

        22        So until tomorrow at nine in the morning, these 

        23        proceedings stand adjourned.
