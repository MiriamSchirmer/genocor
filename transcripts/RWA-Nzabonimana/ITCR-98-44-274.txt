MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please. 
MS. NTILATWA:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Denis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, 7th June 2006, for continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor vs Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Please, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  Yes.  

Good morning, Mr. Hometowu.  Can you hear me?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Good morning.  I can hear you very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning to you all.    

Witness T, your re-examination will continue, and the Prosecutor will continue his re-examination.  
WITNESS T, 
RE-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Good morning, Witness T.  Can you hear me?
A.	Yes, good morning.  I can hear you very well, Counsel Morley.  
Q.	I'll be asking you questions throughout this morning and possibly through this afternoon, and it may be that the business of your giving evidence will come to an end.  So we're on our last lap.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I did understand you very well.  
Q.	On the 26th of May, Mr. Robinson asked you about how it was that the MRND executive bureau exercised control over the préfectural Interahamwe.  And you said that you had learnt that a decision had been taken at the congress in July 1993 that control over the Interahamwe outside Kigali would be exercised through the usual structure of the MRND and, therefore, would be outside any control of the national committee for the Interahamwe.  Now, do you understand what I have said? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I have understood you.  
Q.	Please help us with what the decision was that you understand took place in July 1993.
A.	My understanding of the decision was that it officialised or it consolidated the extension of the Interahamwe at the national level because that, indeed, was the desire or the recommendation of the MRND congress of April 1992. 
Q.	And can you assist us now, please, with how the MRND executive bureau would exercise control over the préfectural Interahamwe?  Describe the mechanisms of control, please.
A.	Counsel, I did not quite understand your question.  There was some interference.  
Q.	Thank you.  Please help us with a description of how the MRND executive bureau would exercise control over the préfectural Interahamwe.  Can you describe the mechanisms of control, please?
A.	As far as I'm concerned, the mechanisms of control could be vertical from the grass roots to the top, involving the various bodies and structures of the party, be it in the commune, in the préfecture.  And it is this vertical control mechanism that existed according to the various structures and wings of the political party, youth wing particularly.  
Q.	If a decision was taken by the MRND executive bureau that a particular préfectural Interahamwe group should attend a particular rally or do a particular thing, how would that be communicated, by what mechanism, please?
A.	Party announcements were made through the traditional media, be it by radio announcement or by posters.  I am not aware of any specific mechanism that applied to the MRND.  All parties used the same traditional approaches to making such announcements, either through the radio or any such mechanism, and also this could have been done by way of mail or letters.  
Q.	Were the préfectural Interahamwe groups answerable to the préfectural MRND committees?
A.	Frankly speaking, I was not aware of the internal workings, and even the functioning of the organisation at the level of Kigali is what I presume must have obtained in the hinterland, but I am not aware of it and I did experience it.  I am certain that whenever rallies were convened or conveyed, they would be expected to attend, and in very much the same manner as obtained in the single party era.  People were convened by the same mechanisms. 
Q.	Were the préfectural MRND committees answerable to the MRND executive bureau?
A.	Obviously, Counsel.  
Q.	Did the MRND préfectural committees control the préfectural Interahamwe?
A.	Counsel, the decision, that was taken after the July congress sought to clarify these issues, but I must confess that I have no mastery of the manner in which these things worked out practically.  
Q.	If an Interahamwe group was formed in the préfectures -- let us, for example, imagine in Gisenyi -- what organisation in Gisenyi would control that Interahamwe group?
A.	The Interahamwe as a youth wing were answerable to the MRND, so they were indeed a youth wing of that party, and that relationship existed.  That is my understanding.  
Q.	Thank you.  But what I'm driving at is when you say an Interahamwe za MRND youth group would be answerable to the MRND, I'm looking for the chain of command.  Now, for example, in Gisenyi, where we know from your evidence an Interahamwe group was formed and, indeed, you have told us you were present for when the invitation to form it took place in early 1992, that group -- would that group of Interahamwe have been controlled by the préfectural committee for the MRND?
A.	Yes, in principle, and pursuant to the July decision which officialised that state of affairs.  But, once again, let me repeat that the youth wing of the Interahamwe worked on behalf of the MRND and reported to the local authorities or local officials of the MRND.  That was the case with the committee in Kigali.  I, therefore, did not see -- I do not see why the same would not apply elsewhere.  
Q.	And to complete the chain of command, would those local officials of the MRND then report to the MRND executive bureau?
A.	Counsel, I say "yes" in principle, and I insist that it is in principle because I am not aware of any specific case of any report that was provided by any -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And we lost the last word spoken by the witness, Mr. President.  We didn't hear the last word in the witness's answer in French.  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't propose to go over it, unless Your Honour wants the last word.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Thank you.  You have described the MRND operating as a pyramid.  Can you explain what you mean by that, please?
A.	In a pyramid you have the base, the foot of the pyramid, and the summit or the tip of the pyramid.  So that is the structure that was in place, from down, upwards, and from up, downwards.  
Q.	After July 1993, were the people at the top of the MRND pyramid Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, Karemera, and a fourth person, now deceased?
A.	According to the various instruments, yes, but at the top-most position was President Habyarimana, although he had just handed over the presidency, but it was the national bureau or -- well, let me say that I don't have a clear mastery of the terminology, but these were the persons who were the highest decision-making body of the party, that is, the national congress.  
Q.	Thank you.  You have said on the 26th of May that in relation to the Interahamwe being subject to legal statutes, the following:  "At the request of Mr. Mathieu, the committee prepared a draft statute which was submitted, and we did not have any follow-up to that, given the situation that was prevailing in the country."  Now, do you understand what I've said?
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	In the country, you have described conflicts between youth wings from other political parties and the Interahamwe za MRND.  You remember telling us that?  What I'd like to ask you is:  What was the effect of the other youth wings being formerly tied to their respective political parties when it came to making complaints about the behaviour of the other youth wings?
A.	When there were any complaints to be made against such acts of violence, the MRND -- and I know that Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, did complain to the executive of the MDR party through his youth wing, the JDR, who were officially and legally affiliated to him, and, of course, vice versa.  The leadership of the other parties would complain about the behaviour, violence, or blunders of the Interahamwe za MRND, did so directly to the MRND.
Q.	It may be my question was clumsy.  I apologise.  Why do you think Mr. Ngirumpatse did not formalise an Interahamwe statute legally linking the Interahamwe to the MRND?
A.	With hindsight, and as one considers the draft project that was prepared, my conclusion -- or, I am led to thinking that Mr. Ngirumpatse initially wanted to ensure that the various organs or bodies were elected at the various levels, not because of prevailing circumstances which did not reflect any choice by election, but he proceeded in a manner to ensure that while -- once the statute was adopted at the national level, then elections would take place at all levels of the youth wings.  So my feeling, and this is only a presumption, that he wanted to clear these things up before the legal status would be established.  But, then, I must confess I do not know.  
Q.	If the Interahamwe was not legally defined as a part of the MRND, to what extent, in your assessment, was it possible for the MRND leadership to disassociate itself from acts of the Interahamwe which were complained about by other parties?
A.	They could have raised -- and may I say, as far as I know, they did not raise this position.  They could have said the youth wing did not legally belong to the party.  
Q.	Thank you.  We may come back to this subject a little later.  I move on to Mr. Gasana.  You told us that Anasthase Gasana left the MRND in early 1992.  Did you know this man?
A.	Yes, I knew him, Counsel.  
Q.	Had he been a reasonably senior figure within the MRND?
A.	Yes, he was a very senior leader of the MRND; he was a conseiller advisor, advisor to the secretary-general, I believe.  He was an advisor to the MRND.
Q.	In May of 1992, when he left the MRND -- and you've told us he was an advisor to the secretary-general.  When he left the MRND in May of 1992, is it right that the secretary-general whom he was advising was Mr. Ngirumpatse?
A.	Counsel, I did not say that Gasana left the MRND on the 28th of May 1992.  I said that as far as I'm concerned, Gasana left the MRND in 1991 as people moved from one party to other parties, for reasons they knew best.  I, therefore, do not believe that Gasana was the advisor at the time Mathieu was in office.  

As far as I can recall, Gasana, Anasthase, was an advisor both to the former secretary-general, Mr. Bonaventure Habimana, and remained in office some time thereafter.  But I think that once the MDR was officially registered, and that was before 1992, I believe he had already left the MRND to become a member of the MDR.
Q.	Thank you, that's helpful.  That's very clear.  Might you have expected Mr. Gasana, before he left the MRND, to have been aware of the policies being developed at the highest level of the MRND?
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I think that was a matter of course because in his capacity of advisor, he definitely made some suggestions.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Robinson put before you a document prepared by Dr. Gasana, which is Your Honours' Exhibit D. NZ117.  Now, I don't propose to put that document in front of you because it speaks for itself.  
MR. MORLEY:
And insofar as Your Honours need to see it, no doubt Your Honours can be provided with a copy -- 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	But it is a matter of record -- 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm listening to the sirens, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	It's a matter of record that the document was produced in May of 1992 and in it Dr. Gasana talks about the Interahamwe.  Now, do you understand what I've said?
A.	Yes, I've understood very clearly, Counsel.  
Q.	This is at a time you have told us that Dr. Gasana is now a senior member of the MDR; that's right, is it not?
A.	Counsel, Gasana was an MDR minister.  He was a senior leader of the MDR party.  
Q.	Thank you.  In the document he describes, Mr. Robinson told you, the Interahamwe, in his opinion, at K0241101, as being created in order to intimidate people, commit armed robbery and create a sense of insecurity in the country by maintaining a permanent state of fear and insecurity.  You remember that being read to you by Mr. Robinson?  Do you understand what I've said?  
A.	Counsel, I do not recall what he read or what he did not read because at that time we were trying to locate the document and I only became aware of its content subsequently.  However, I know that among other things Mr. Gasana condemned the Interahamwe or describes the Interahamwe in the terms you have just mentioned, but I do not recall whether this excerpt was read out to me or not, but that is part of the document.  Yes, I do. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
It is a matter of record, Your Honour.  It was read and I'm sure Your Honours recall it. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, I have a number of questions.  First of all, to your knowledge, did Mr. Gasana know number 9?
A.	Yes, Counsel, he knew number 9. 
Q.	Did Mr. Gasana know number 9 well?
A.	To know him well -- I think it would be up to Gasana to say.  All I know is that both persons knew themselves, even outside the party.  
Q.	Are you aware that Dr. Gasana described number 9 as being a hardliner within the MRND za -- I'm sorry, within the Interahamwe za MRND movement?
A.	Yes, I read that information and I was greatly surprised by it.  
Q.	Are you aware that within the same document Dr. Gasana describes, among the brains of the creation of the Interahamwe movement, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	Yes, I read that he referred to them as the "think tank".  
Q.	Are you aware that in relation to Joseph Nzirorera, in respect of Dr. Gasana's document dated May 1992, he described Joseph Nzirorera as a former minister through whom everything destined for the Akazu was channelled?
A.	I could have confirmed that information if I had the document before me, but if that is what is written, then that must be what is written.  
Q.	Would it be right that among others, Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse were indeed the brains behind the creation and extension of the Interahamwe movement?
A.	Yes, one could say so, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  On the 26th of May, in response to questions from Mr. Robinson, you described a phenomenon called mirror accusations.  Do you remember using that term?
A.	Yes, I do remember, Counsel.  
Q.	What does a mirror accusation mean, please?
A.	As far as my understanding of that expression goes, a "mirror accusation" refers to transferring or ascribing to another what one is oneself, that is, ascribing to another the strategies that one uses for oneself.  That is my understanding of that expression.  I might be mistaken, but that is what I intended to say.  
Q.	Have you had an opportunity to read the work of Alison Des Forges?
A.	I have read of Alison Des Forges', Leave None to Tell the Story.  I think that is the one I have read.  
Q.	Having read her work, are you aware that she talks extensively about mirror accusations?
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Are you aware that she suggests that mirror accusations is something that the MRND did?
A.	Counsel, the MRND, like everybody else, used a number of strategies.  My position so far is that there was a vicious circle of violence which wasn't broken as each party accused the other.  That vicious circle, therefore, was an impediment to positive dialogue.  Now, whether the MDR used any strategy or whether the other parties, the MDR and what have you, used this mirror accusation strategy, I think that is a matter that speaks by itself.  What I'm saying is that up to the time of the massacres, each party accused the other one of being responsible for the tragic events that occurred.  That is why, as far as I am concerned, everybody is responsible somewhat and answerable somewhat.  I myself am answerable somewhat.  
Q.	Does it come to this:  Everyone indulged in mirror accusations?  Would that be wrong or would that be right? 
A.	I do not see how Alison Des Forges' book would only deal with one side of the story, whereas, all parties were involved in that game, and that was the source of the obstructions to positive dialogue and a normal unfolding of events.  The specific answer to your question would be that all parties on the field were involved in that type of exercise which led to this unending vicious circle.  
Q.	Thank you.  On the 26th of May, when Mr. Robinson was asking you questions, you told the Court about an MRND rally during Pentecost weekend at the end of May of 1992 at which Mr. Ngirumpatse spoke.  Do you understand what I've said?
A.	Yes, I did understand, Counsel.  
Q.	You told the Court that whilst Mr. Ngirumpatse was speaking, he was interrupted by two colonels.  Do you remember telling us about that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Were the Interahamwe present at that rally at which Mr. Ngirumpatse was speaking?
A.	Let me state this again clearly:  The MRND rally did not only bring together the Interahamwe's MRND, it brought together MRND supporters or members who, over time, became referred to as the Interahamwe.  But to be very specific, the Interahamwe's MRND were part of the MRND along with other members of the MRND.
Q.	It may be the question was confusing.  Yes or no, were the Interahamwe present at that rally at which Mr. Ngirumpatse spoke?
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I can confirm it. 
Q.	What did Mr. Ngirumpatse tell the crowd after he had spoken to the two colonels?  
A.	Actually, Mr. Ngirumpatse informed the audience -- or, rather, relayed the message that he got from the colonel, that is, that the youth wings of other parties were attacking, assets were -- destroying the belongings of members of the MRND and that, as a result, this constituted self-defence -- legitimate self-defence to ensure that one was not attacked.  And, henceforth, people gathered in their neighbourhoods in order to confront the various members of other political parties.  That is the background or the situation that I attended and which I referred to.  
Q.	After Mr. Ngirumpatse told the crowd that opposition youths were destroying MRND property, you told us that the meeting petered out.  Does that mean that people left the rally to go and confront the opposition youths?
A.	That's correct, Counsel.  
Q.	Is it right or wrong that the opposition youths were elsewhere and not attacking the rally itself?
A.	They were attacking their assets and goods in their absence.  As a matter of fact, Counsel, this was legitimate self-defence.  
Q.	Is the picture the following, and please correct me if I am wrong:  The rally itself was not being attacked because MRND members were at the rally, away from the rally their property was being attacked, and as a result of what Mr. Ngirumpatse said, people left the rally to fight the opposition youths; is that right or is that wrong?
A.	I did not quite understand the question, Counsel.  
Q.	I'll ask it again.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Is it the case that the rally itself was not attacked, that the members of the MRND, who were at the rally, learnt that opposition youths were damaging their property in their absence, because they were at the rally, and that as a result of what Mr. Ngirumpatse said, people left the rally to fight the opposition youths?
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	Can you help with the answer to this question:  Why should people from the rally -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Hello.  Is the microphone working?  Yes.  Forgive me.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Why not simply dispatch the police?  Why does there have to be, after Mr. Ngirumpatse talks to the crowd, a confrontation between two youth militias?  Why not just send the police around?
A.	Counsel, I cannot answer your question, I'm sorry.  I have described a situation whereby these top police officials who came to warn the members in this context of violence which was a characteristic of the youth.  This is the context I have described.  But it would have been normal, I admit, for the police to be deployed; however, it appeared the police had abdicated from its duty, especially after the letter of complaint addressed to the prime minister by the Interahamwe youth which stated that if nothing was done, people would defend themselves by all means in the face of the apathy of the public services.  But this may go a long way to explain the context that prevailed in Kigali at the time, the situation, that is.  
Q.	You've told us that Mr. Ngirumpatse told the crowd, and I'm reading from your answer.  It was now said that each member had the right to defend himself by all means.  Was Mr. Ngirumpatse sending the crowd out to confront the opposition youths?
A.	Counsel, I would say yes, the message is clear.  People are attacked.  They have to protect themselves.  I wonder if it is clear.  
Q.	It is a matter of record that Mr. Ngirumpatse had been the ambassador for Rwanda to Germany, the minister for justice, no less, and, of course, at the time, Pentecost 1992, he was then the secretary-general of the MRND.  Did it surprise you that Mr. Ngirumpatse would send the crowd out to engage in a confrontation with opposition youths?
A.	I am not surprised, given the situation.  
Q.	He has been described as an organist, a musician of excellence, a man who was highly respected, a consensus leader, a man who was famous for running a choir, a pleasant personality.  All of these are descriptions you gave Mr. Weyl when Mr. Weyl was asking you questions after Mr. Robinson.  Does it surprise you that such a man, pleasant, cultured, musical, would send the crowd out to confront opposition youths?
A.	Counsel, once again, the situation -- I must say I do not believe in the Bible proverb that says that when one slaps you on the left cheek you should show the right cheek.  Under normal circumstances, I would have been critical of this attitude, but in the context or the situation that prevailed, I am not condemning it.  
Q.	And you went on to say that the confrontation which followed was "very bloody", to quote you.  What do you mean by that?  Were people hurt?  Were people killed?  Can you give us some idea of what you mean by "very bloody"?
A.	By "very bloody", I mean it was very violent.  There were lots of wounded persons in -- as in -- as is the case in this type of confrontation on both sides.  I would also tell you it was said that RPF infiltrators were stoking the flames at the same time as meetings taking place between the parties in question in Brussels.  So there was -- there were a lot of casualties.  And I do not know if there were or were not any deaths, that is why I say that it was very bloody since I am not certain that there were any dead.  However, I would not be surprised if there had been since, at any rate, there were lots of wounded people.  And Kigali -- there was a lot of conflict in Kigali towards the end of the evening.  
Q.	And the crowd which was sent out to confront the opposition youths, leading to woundings and very bloody skirmishes, were they armed with traditional weapons.  Is that what led to the blood and the woundings?
A.	Counsel, the people who left the gathering were heading towards their homes, to their neighbourhoods.  So they would take up arms, they would perhaps break off a tree branch along the road.  They armed themselves with whatever they could lay their hands on.  And especially since people were passing by their homes, that was an occasion for them to arm themselves for this type of fighting.  
Q.	When you told us that Mr. Ngirumpatse told the crowd they could defend themselves by all means, did you understand that to mean they could use weapons?
A.	Counsel, I only understood what was said defending oneself.  And when one defends oneself, one uses all means.  There is no one particular means of defence that is excluded.  One uses the right to self-defence by employing whatever means available.  At least that is how I understood it.  And this would have included traditional weapons. 
Q.	Thank you.  You told Mr. Robinson on the 26th of May that you had not been aware of a meeting of senior persons, officers and MRND officials at Butotori camp in Gisenyi in the second half -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, the name is protected information. 
MR. MORLEY:
The name, which one?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The name of the location.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.  I apologise.  It's actually in the transcript and it will need to be redacted in respect of the 26th of May. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The redaction is ordered.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Respectfully, that information, the two words, may be protected with respect to the testimony of one particular witness, but it's not generally protected and it makes no -- there's no way to confront -- to ask this witness about a (By order of the Court, these words were extracted and sealed under cover), so -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think you're right.  I withdraw my comment.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  And Mr. Webster was whispering the same.  We are ad idem with Mr. Robinson for a change.  Anyhow -- 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, you told Mr. Robinson that you had been unaware whether or not there had been a meeting in the second half of 1992 at Butotori camp -- B-U-T-O-T-O-R-I -- near Gisenyi in which it is suggested that senior army officers and MRND officials attended.  Is it right that you are unable to say whether there was any meeting at Butotori camp?
A.	That goes without saying, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  You told Mr. Robinson on the 26th of May that the speech by President Habyarimana on the 15th of November of 1992 was interpreted by opposition parties as being a call to arms with the Interahamwe.  Now, do you understand what I've said?
A.	I understand you, Counsel.  
Q.	And you will recall you having told us you were at that rally and you recall some of what the president said, and in earlier testimony recalled how the president talked of descending during the election campaigns which were to come soon thereafter, descending with his Interahamwe.  Do you understand what I've said?
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Why would the opposition parties have understood what President Habyarimana was saying as being a call to arms with his Interahamwe?  What is your perception of that?
A.	The way I see it, it fits in with what we were calling earlier on, the mirror accusation.  How do you expect -- at least this is my opinion -- how do you expect the opposition, that felt very weakened by the elections it was calling for, Habyarimana's MRND -- in order to end this never-ending transition period?  Therefore, it was a challenge and it would be normal for arrival to respond the way they did.  That is my perception, since I do not see the relation between the speech, which I listened to and attended, and the opposition's interpretation of the same.  
Q.	Leon Mugesera made an inflammatory and racist speech on the 22nd of November 1992 which you've told us you did not attend, but you knew what the general contents of the speech were -- 
MR. MORLEY:
May I just pause.  I have problems with the microphone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  It's approaching eleven o'clock and we wanted to take our mid-morning recess.
MR. MORLEY:
Can I deal with this point --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sure.
MR. MORLEY:
-- as I'm in flagrante.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, coming back to where I was:  Mugesera, bad speech, 22nd November 1992.  You have told us -- 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry.  Is there a problem -- is there a problem with my microphone?  Perhaps there's a problem with my -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley -- 
MR. MORLEY:
We'll stop.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think that is the best thing to do.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take our mid-morning recess now.

(Court resumed at 1147H)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President; I want to make a small intervention at this point.  First of all, I want to thank Mr. Morley for what I think was an excellent re-direct examination.  But I note his time has expired pursuant to the Trial Chamber's scheduling order of the 30th of March 19 -- 2006. 

As you may recall, that order provided that the Chamber is of the view that the parties may be able to better focus their examination of this witness so that the examination-in-chief could be done within two days, considering five hours in court per day; seven days being devoted to cross-examination; and a half day for the re-direct.  You would note that yesterday we had more than two hours of re-direct examination.  This morning, we have had at least an hour and a half, so we are well over the half-day provision.  

I have -- there has been no motion for reconsideration of your scheduling order.  You frequently find that there are not grounds for reconsidering your orders, and, indeed, in this particular situation, given that the Defence examination took only five days rather then seven, I would think that there is no ground for reconsidering your order.  And so I ask that you terminate the re-direct examination at this time.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
My first thought, Your Honours, in this instance is I admire Mr. Robinson, and I well understand why he wants me to stop.  

Your Honour may recall that the business of time limits, which was something advanced by the Prosecution, was designed to ensure that we get through what are big witnesses within a reasonable time.  And as Your Honours may recall, we have scheduled the end of T's testimony for Friday.  Now, it will come to an end today, so we are ahead of our own scheduling.  The whole point about the timetabling was to ensure that we would get through the witnesses within a reasonable time.  And we are still within a reasonable time with regard to T.  

Secondly, and it may be my misunderstanding, but I'm not sure that it is, in fact, an order in respect of time allocations, it is an indication which counsel works to with their best abilities.  And it may be that it is Your Honours' understanding that insofar as there is overlap or moments when further time is sought, the position is flexible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. Morley, it is no need to go on any longer.  How much more time do you think you need?  
MR. MORLEY:
I believe I will finish Witness T by between 3:30 and 4:00 today.  And I did say that I was going to take a day, possibly more, and I started yesterday at the conclusion of the fourth -- the third session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, let me tell you what we are thinking:  We did not regard the scheduling orders as an order which was inflexible.  And we made it clear that we expected counsel to use their best efforts to complete their examination within the time that we had stipulated.  But we also had indicated that we were going to be flexible, to some extent, on these issues.

Now, I must say that even though no application had been made before, we of our own considered that the re-examination of this witness would take longer than we had originally allowed, because of the nature of the cross-examination.  So we did expect that we would have had to grant you some extra time, extra time with regard to this re-examination; 3:30 is a bit long.  
MR. MORLEY:
3:30 makes it a day, and that is what I thought I would be dealing with. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, if I can just make a few remarks.  I'm very gratified to hear that -- how flexible the Trial Chamber's time standards are.  As you know, I was not in favour of time standards.  And I will be happy to take advantage of that flexibility in the future.  But I note that we can't -- if you are going to take -- the Defence saved you two days.  And if it is the result of that that the Prosecution gets to use the extra two days, or it gets to use extra time, then we will not have much incentive to go along with your programme. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, that is not what I said. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I know it is not what you said, but it is what Mr. Morley said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I was trying to correct Mr. Morley, because that is not what the point is. 
MR. ROBINSON:
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't think that the time should be filled up in re-examination.  From an objective point of view, the cross-examination, we thought, created a situation which required a longer re-examination than was originally participated.  So, there was an objective basis for it.  That is what we thought before any application was made to us. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I appreciate that, and in fact, I agree with you.  But I also note that the Prosecution is frequently ignoring the Trial Chamber's orders without making application to vary them.  

I will bring you back to the time of the Alison Des Forges expert report that was due on a certain date.  The Prosecutor had let the deadline go by and then, after the fact, applied to have an extension, which you granted, and which at that time you eluded to Rule 46, it wasn't quite a warning.  It was maybe a warning before a warning.  But in any event, you said that to establish a practice of simply ignoring the Trial Chamber's directives without applying to vary them or reconsider them was, you know, was such that Rule 46 might be applied.  And I think we have just had that situation reoccur.  

So I -- I just -- honestly, we think these rules are applied inequitably here in this Trial Chamber, the Prosecution is free to make their own rules and discard the Chamber's rules, and we are held to the rules.  But, in any event, I note that no application was made before the expiration of the time and I think that is against what the Trial Chamber has previously ordered.  Thank you. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I share entirely the position of my learned friend, Robinson.  And I'm somewhat surprised by Mr. Morley's proposal, to the effect that for the Defence cross-examination to be effective within those time frames -- that led him, rather, to use more time than was initially agreed to.  I have held my peace from this end, but I believe that the Trial Chamber could have understood that I could have put many more questions to the witness if I weren't attempting to comply with the Trial Chamber's orders, scheduling orders; because I could have gone beyond the time I spent in cross-examination.  And I believe that Mr. Morley wants to take advantage of that, to claim that he has extra time because of the time that we -- we gained for the Trial Chamber, because we worked diligently.  

So I would, rather, to say that Mr. Morley is not asking the Trial Chamber for re-direct, as such, but rather to conduct an examination-in-chief anew.  So, I believe that when the rules are laid down and the Defence complies, it is not proper for Prosecutor to take advantage of Defence's compliance, because in so doing the Defence may then wonder whether the rules have been applied with fairness across the board.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I will simply say that I agree entirely with the comments made by my two learned friends.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, and I mention you because you spoke first, but the comments are applied to everybody, I think, on the Defence side.  The Chamber is becoming concerned about the constant suggestions that we are applying rules unfairly in this case.  We don't think that is so at all.  And now there is a level at which we think that some of the expressions made have crossed the lines of the courtesy levels we expect from counsel appearing before our Chamber.

Now, there is a level at which your enquiry about the time of the cross -- the re-direct was legitimate; we understand that.  But we explained that we ourselves had an objective reason for allowing extension to it.  And the suggestion that there was some inequity in that exercise, we don't think is called for in these circumstances, and we take exception to it.  And, in fact, earlier this week we were thinking in terms of whether we should address counsel on the standards of civility that we expect in our Chamber.  I hope it is not necessary for us to address that.

Now, Mr. Morley, the same could be said to you, because Mr. Robinson does have a point in the sense that when the time was expiring, you could have said something.  We have expressed a view that in our view that you needed more time.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the matter could have been put on the record in a different way than it has emerged this morning.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I apologise if there has been insensitivity.  I did mention two days ago that I thought we would be about a day.  And, perhaps, I should have put it in a more formal way as an application to vary the order. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let's move on now.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I understand your remarks and ordinarily I would be in a position -- feeling like I should be apologising, but I honestly, and I don't want to belabour this discussion, but when the Prosecution is allowed to take the initiative to violate the scheduling orders or other orders of the Trial Chamber, even if the Trial Chamber would ultimately have agreed with them had they applied, it gives the impression to the parties, the Defence particularly, that the Prosecution is able to do whatever it pleases.  And when the Trial Chamber doesn't take any action against that, it -- it -- what I would say is it furthers the levels of what we call impunity.  

And I'm sorry that that, you know, may be offensive to the Trial Chamber and may be uncomfortable for you to hear, but I feel that part of my job as a Defence lawyer is to have some accountability, or to ensure that there is accountability.  And when I see what I consider to be an injustice or an inequity by the way the Prosecution is allowed to proceed in this case, I feel I'm obligated to call it to your attention and to make it a matter of public record.  And I'm sorry if that is offensive to you, but I am going to keep doing that because I think that is my job. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Robinson, if you think that, maybe those speeches may become boomerangs because we think that we have exercised similar flexibility with regard to your side of the table as well.  We don't expect -- as I have said many time in the trial, there are certain types of matters which we expect counsel to self regulate.  And we have not tried to impose ourselves on either side in the way in which you think we should, because we didn't think it is appropriate when dealing with counsel of the standards which we think we have before us.  And so if you want a more intrusive Bench, we can be, but we didn't think it was appropriate or the proper way to behave when dealing with standards of counsel of this nature.  

In a matter of this nature, it is true that something could have been said before, but in our view we thought it was obvious from the way in which the examination of this witness turned out that the re-direct would have been longer than anticipated.  It is just obvious.  It is not necessary for us to have belaboured the point; we could have belaboured the point.  We thought it; we discussed about it ourselves, and we made our own view on that issue, and we could have made a scheduling order.  But we don't expect to have obvious matters canvassed; we don't expect to have time wasting with obvious applications.  

And, in fact, we could address that because there are lots of things that have happened in the trial which we think are quite unnecessary, time consuming and to some extent abusive of the process of the Court.  We have not addressed all of those matters in that way, but we could.  And if Counsel would feel happier if we have a more intrusive approach, we could be that way.  We don't think it would        be -- work for good relations in the Trial Chamber.  And we think that the standard of civility could easily deteriorate if we adopted that type of approach.  And we don't think it necessary because we think counsel on both sides are fully familiar with the rules.  We think that we have a professional representation before us.  And so we have expected a certain degree of self regulation on these matters.  So that is how I see it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Well, I have noticed that but, I guess, maybe this is a cultural -- but I feel like I'm fastidious in applying (sic) with court orders, when you make an order I comply with them all of the time.  And if you were -- and I don't see that being applied --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Robinson, you don't have to argue with me any more because we have said this was a guideline which we expected counsel to comply with to the best of their ability.  Now, in fact, we were intending at one stage to make complimentary remarks to the Defence side in the way in which this examination was managed, because we understood the care that was taken in planning your cross-examinations; and we appreciated the way in which it worked out.  
In fact, we were actually considering to what extent we should have directed the Prosecutor to have given notice of calling an additional witness to make up for the time that was saved.  We have saved two days -- a day and a half, and we thought that it because -- because -- but we decided to just pause before taking that step.  

And we expect the trial to move forward in this manner.  We thought that this was an indication that future witnesses would also have -- be examined thoroughly within the allocated time frame, and that is what we expect to occur.  But we have -- we are of the view that we are professional judges, that each side will encounter or may encounter unexpected situation during the examination.  We notice when these things occur, and we expect that we would be making allowances when these things occur.  If, for example, in your cross-examination you ran into a problem and you had to take extra time to deal with it, we would notice this. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we would notice this.  I mean we know the difference when you have a genuine situation which requires extra time, and when there is a filibuster.  We expect to be able to adjudicate on the difference in those situations.  And when those situations occur, we will act as we think the justice of the case requires.  That is what we think our function as judges are.  

But when the counsel before us, when they don't agree with a decision that we take, or they don't agree with how we -- they raise the flag of inequality or impartiality, it is not a civil way for counsel to behave with the Bar.  And there are certain international jurisdictions where that type of language from counsel would be dealt with in a much harsher way.  So, I thought it was a fairly gentle way of just saying, that we don't appreciate it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  I understand you, thank you very much for taking the time to explain that. 
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honours' leave, can we continue with T?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness T, can you hear me?  We will talk now about Mugesera.  
A.	Yes, I can hear you. 
Q.	You have told us that Mugesera had assistance from the army in leaving Rwanda when he was subject to an arrest warrant.  Do you remember telling us that?
A.	Yes, I remember, Counsel. 
Q.	Did you speak to any member of his family about his predicament? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Who did you speak to please? 
A.	I spoke to his wife, Counsel. 
Q.	And what did you speak to her about, please? 
A.	I told her that her husband was short (phonetic), and that he should be careful. 
Q.	In November 1992 President Habyarimana was officially the president of the MRND.  Do you know whether or not he was present at the Mugesera speech on the 22nd of November 1992? 
A.	I do not think he was present when the speech was made. 
Q.	You have told us that what Mugesera said was not in keeping with MRND policy; you remember telling us that when Mr. Robinson was asking you questions? 
A.	Yes, I remember that well, Counsel.  It was not in keeping with the policy. 
Q.	Were you aware of a meeting of the MRND executive bureau on the 7th of December of 1992 in which handwritten notes of the meeting were passed on to President Habyarimana in which there is reference to how the MRND must defend Mugesera, and in the future screen speeches? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to object to that question because it assumes -- it misstates some facts.  First of all, the meeting was not of the MRND executive bureau, but of the political bureau which included the presidents of the préfecture, all of the préfectures.  And in fact, none of the three Accused attended that meeting.  But in any event, I also believe that Mr. Morley has -- should present -- or, at least read from the document exactly rather than presenting his selective portion of the discussion that is in those minutes about the Mugesera speech.  

So, I have two objections:  He mischaracterised the nature of the meeting and the content of it.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
I thank Mr. Robinson.  If I have mischaracterised who was at the meeting, I apologise.  It is certainly a note from the political bureau to the president describing action in respect of Mugesera.  I'm not going to press the point any longer, Your Honour, because the point that is being made is one which is plain on the face of the document.  And for Your Honours` assistance, it is in evidence.  I can't remember the evidence number, but it is tab 67.  

But I will simply ask the witness this: 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, were you aware of any discussion about Mugesera by the political bureau of the MRND on the 7th of December 1992? 
A.	No, Counsel, I was not aware.  I had no knowledge whatsoever about this matter. 
Q.	Thank you.  You were also asked by Mr. Robinson about killings which had taken place -- of Tutsi, in Kibilira, Mukingo, Kinigi, Gaseke, Giciye, I will spell that one, G-I-C-I-Y-E, Karago and Kibuye, between late 1992 and January 1993.  My question of you is this, were you present in those areas on the occasions that Tutsis were killed?  

Did you hear the question?
A.	I heard the question clearly, Counsel.  And my answer is that I was in none of those places. 
Q.	Do you know who killed a Tutsi in those areas at those times?  I'm not asking for your opinion, I'm asking for your knowledge. 
A.	I do not know who did it, Counsel. 
Q.	You were asked by Mr. Robinson about whether the RPF infiltrated the local population.  And you responded, "How can you win a guerrilla war if you did not infiltrate".  How is it the population, believing infiltrators were around them, were supposed to clearly and accurately identify who was an infiltrator? 
A.	Counsel, by way of an example and in answer to this question, generally, the populations in a given locality all know each other.  And when they identify or observe a new face under circumstances of war, they might consider that person to be an infiltrator, a stranger. 
Q.	Do you think there was a difference between being a stranger and being an infiltrator? 
A.	Counsel, I am aware of all of this, but my approach was to explain the context.  However, I was never that observant, yet a normal stranger, or an unknown person, in a locality given the situation we are discussing, well that is it, that is all. 
Q.	You have told us that in February 1993 as a result of renewed RPF aggression, there were 900,000 displaced people.  Would that have meant there were a lot of strangers around? 
A.	That is not how I understand the term "stranger". 
Q.	It may be a translation issue.  I'm thinking of the word stranger in French, it also means foreigners.  What I am driving at, with the number of displaced people in Rwanda in 1993 within various communities, were there lots of new faces? 
A.	Certainly, Counsel, given the difference, that of the situation, it was obvious it was special.  Or perhaps I do not understand your question properly. 
Q.	And as a result of the numbers of displaced people, did relations between the Hutu and the Tutsi improve or worsen? 
A.	Relations between Hutus and Tutsi deteriorated as the war progressed, Counsel. 
Q.	Given that there were new people coming in and out, given also that you told us that in 1992 the prime minister withdraw the need to have a laissez-passer in Kigali so that there was no longer official monitoring of who was entering and leaving Kigali, were there ever any lists compiled of new faces by the Interahamwe? 
A.	Counsel, I know of no list.  I did not see such list. 
Q.	When the massacres began from the 6th of April of 1994 how were infiltrators identified? 
A.	I might just repeat what I stated earlier; on a neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood basis, locality by locality, people knew each other and considered that unknown persons could be -- or could be considered infiltrators.  There was no issue of listing.  People knew each other.  It might differ from the situation in your large cities or cultures where people speak to each other rarely; but in Kigali, I'm not exaggerating when I say everyone -- everybody knew each other as long as they resided in the same neighbourhood.  That is what I can say in answer to you, Counsel. 
Q.	Was there any monitoring of those who were visiting the RPF barracks or those who were expressing pro-RPF thoughts prior to the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Counsel, regarding those who would visit, in broad daylight that is, RPF quarters, I would be wrong if I said otherwise, but even though it seemed that the state had given up you would understand that certain services, departments were functioning.  There was some monitoring by Interahamwe.  Interahamwes who were there who would keep an eye on the comings and goings into such places; that is one form of monitoring.  

This was not a culture where the written words dominated; this was an oral culture.  And I do not think that Rwanda is any different from the rest of Africa in this regard.  You see, I was trying to explain this earlier when I referred to the way things worked.  These people would monitor those entering the RPF buildings, occupied buildings; these people were monitored by the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Were the people entering the barracks, the people who were being monitored, were their names ever written down? 
A.	Probably.  Probably, although I was not a witness to this, I expect that that was done. 
Q.	And what do you think happened to those people whose names were probably written down after the death of the president in April 1994?  
A.	Counsel, I do not know them by name, but those people who were eyed, I'm certain that if they did not escape, they must have been eliminated.  And, in fact, that is the tragedy, this confusion, this excess, this confusion, that is.  And those same people, I am certain that they were not saints.  They also had tasks or missions, they had a mission.  So that is why people thought that those they did not know must have been their enemies, although that was not necessarily always the case.  However, I am not saying that those people were necessarily collaborating with the enemy.  That's all I am saying. 
Q.	What was the role of the RTLM in the massacres which took place after the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	Counsel, RTLM was pouring fuel on the flames.  It was an integral part -- party to the massacres.  In brief, that is what I can tell you about RTLM broadcast in relation to the RPF conflict after the 6th of April. 
Q.	Did the RTLM broadcast encourage the massacres? 
A.	That is quite true, Counsel.  It is good to tell the truth. 
Q.	Is it right that the RTLM was set up in July or August of 1993 and number 9 was a member of the radio station's steering committee? 
A.	It is quite true, but one might clarify that what you refer to was the installation committee, it is the same thing, however.  I just wanted to make that rectification. 
Q.	Did number 9 go to the RTLM station on the 8th of April and see their lists of people who were to be eliminated on a blackboard? 
A.	People eliminated and the names of persons whose elimination was not certain, these names had question marks on the lists. 
Q.	In August of 1993, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse authorise a Ville morte in Kigali, and that at the last minute, with the assistance of Turatsinze, cancel of Ville morte? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to object to this question as being outside of the scope of cross-examination.  This was led by Mr. Morley in his direct examination, was not discussed during the cross-examination at all. 
MR. MORLEY:
Technically, my learned friend is correct.  But there are two examples of Ngirumpatse exercising control over the release of the Interahamwe.  One of them is August, and then the second is the 31st of October.  And I'm simply lining those two exercises of control up alongside each other.  I respectfully submit it is appropriate within the context of re-examination on control exercised by Ngirumpatse. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, when such things are gone into for the first time on re-direct examination, we should have the opportunity to conduct a re-cross-examination on those issues.  That is why it is better to not allow the re-direct to stray so far from the cross. 
MR. MORLEY:
No, the material was led, certainly, during the course of direct examination.  Although it was not touched on in cross-examination, it is part of the re-examination to remind, through the witness, the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, that formulation was not appropriate for re-examination. 
MR. MORLEY:
I was conscious of that as it came out of my mouth, actually.  It is a small point, Your Honours.  If    Your Honours feel that we don't need to have August -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the only point is to remind us of what was said in the direct examination, then the question cannot be allowed. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well. 

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	October 1993 then, Witness T, under cross-examination answering questions from Mr. Robinson, you described how an Interahamwe march was authorised by the MRND, and then canceled at the last minute as a result of a communiqué from number 1 and Ngirumpatse in respect of the death of President Ndadaye in Burundi.  Do you --  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  Yes, I remember, Counsel. 
Q.	How did Ngirumpatse authorise the march and whose decision was it to cancel it? 
A.	Counsel, there was some (unintelligible) between the actions of the Interahamwe za MRND to be conducted in Kigali for political demonstrations.  So, it was between the party leadership and the national provisional leadership of the Interahamwe, which was the channel through which announcements for action by the party could be made.  In that framework, certain communiqués or announcements in order to lend them an air of authenticity were to be signed by a member of the national committee, in this case, Mathieu or any other official, or even one of the members of the Interahamwe national provisional committee.  This was in order to lend authenticity and impart more importance to the communiqué issued.  

This was the case when the march was authorised, which would have been in line with the speech by the president during the seven days of mourning.  And, therefore, during that period, it is to be noted, or it is right, that certain activities or certain party activities would be subject to cancellation. 
Q.	Thank you.  Going back to the RTLM, there is a question I failed to ask: You told us that the RTLM broadcast encouraged the massacres.  Could the government have stopped that radio broadcasting, and if so, should it have done? 
A.	It should have used the police authority in its power to forbid, prohibit or punish any given act.  They should have -- they should have prohibited it.  But I do not know, specifically, what the appropriate government action was under these circumstances or another. 
Q.	What impression did it create in your mind that the government did not close down RTLM which was encouraging the massacres? 
A.	It was fair and good under those circumstances of war.  Again, the RPF radio, Muhabura, was doing the same thing.  So, the argument was that the other radio was doing the same thing, so what is not prohibited is allowed.  Under those circumstances, I would say that RTLM was a party to the conflict.  And it conducted its own war in that way.  And the argument was that it was doing exactly the same thing that Radio Muhabura was doing.  So once, again, it is tit for tat. 
Q.	Was it your impression that the government approved of what RTLM was broadcasting, encouraging the massacres? 
A.	Counsel, that is what I have just said; that which is not prohibited is necessarily allowed, particularly under those circumstances.  And, again, I go back to the circumstance that obtained at the time; that is what happened at the time.  That was the context at the time; I am not endorsing it and even less so today. 
Q.	Was there tension between the Belgium peacekeepers and members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  That even led to the issuance of correspondence or some kind of complaint in a pamphlet that narrated that situation, I believe, in the letter of the 19th of January from the provisional Interahamwe national committee to the highest authority of UNAMIR, that is the secretary general, or, rather, to the special representative of the secretary general. 
Q.	Thank you.  But was there fighting between members of the Interahamwe and Belgium peacekeeper at a bar called Chez Chic in early 1994? 
A.	Counsel, I didn't quite understand the name of the location you mentioned. 
Q.	Chez Chic or Chez Chic, "house of girls" in English? 
A.	Yes, I have understood.  Those skirmishes between various undisciplined members of the army and some Interahamwe did occur, but that was well before the 6th of April.  I would not refer to that as fighting, in the sense of fighting as I understand it, but those were skirmishes.  Fistfights, I would say, did occur between the Interahamwe and some UNAMIR troops, particularly Belgium troops in various cafes, particularly like Chez Chic which you referred to, and also in Kigali nightclubs, so some skirmishes did occur.  But, again, I say that was before the 6th of April. 
Q.	Are you aware that ten Belgium peacekeepers died immediately after the death of the president who had been protecting the prime minister? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	I'm asking for your knowledge, not your opinion.  Do you know who assassinated Gatabizi? 
A.	You said "Gatabizi".  Maybe you mean Gatabazi.  Could you be more specific?  Anyway, my answer would be that I don't know the person who murdered him.  And I do not believe that the investigations led to any findings on who had assassinated or murdered Gatabazi. 
Q.	Thank you, and I'm sorry for my mispronunciation.  Again, yes or no, do you know who assassinated Bucyana, B-U-C-Y-A-N-A? 
A.	No, I do not know the name of the person who assassinated Bucyana. 
Q.	Yes or no, do you know the date on which the fax from General Dallaire sent to UNHQ, said to be the 11th of January 1994, do you actually know when that document was sent to UNHQ? 
A.	I have no idea, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  If you will bear with me for a moment.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours, I'm making efforts to get through my list of questions in good time.  So forgive the hiatus; I'm being selective. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You have told us that roadblocks sprang up all around Kigali in the aftermath of the death of the president.  Do you actually know who ordered them? 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There is no sound from the witness, Mr. President.  Apparently, the witness is speaking, but we don't have sound in the booth. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, unhappily the sound failed, so I will ask the question again.  Yes or no; do you actually know who ordered the roadblocks to spring up in Kigali? 
A.	No.  But I was saying that some of the roadblocks were manned by soldiers.  And it would obviously follow that these were ordered by the army.  And, again, these roadblocks are operational according to a certain time frame that coincided with the curfew. 
Q.	Was there, to your observation, cooperation between the Interahamwe and the army in controlling roadblocks in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, that was a matter of fact, it did happen. 
Q.	You told Mr. Robinson that you were aware that excesses were being committed by the Interahamwe, in that the Interahamwe were killing women and children.  And you told Mr. Robinson about the four-year old girl.  And he asked you the question on Tuesday the 30th of May:  "Did you favour the Interahamwe or other members of the population committing those excesses or did you wish that they would be stopped?"  And you replied, "Counsel, I did not try; on the contrary, the thing to do then was to congratulate, to encourage those who were facing up to the enemy."

Do you understand what I have said?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Why congratulate those who are committing excesses? 
A.	Counsel, it is because discouraging them, or casting doubt in their minds that they were not attacking the enemy could lead to the loss of one's own life.  There are -- there are such known cases. 
Q.	Again, on the 30th of May, in answer to a question from Mr. Robinson, you were being asked about the extermination of the Tutsi.  And you replied:  "I did not perceive an extermination as an ethnic group, but in the event that group was eliminated."

Now, do you remember saying that?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Was it your observation that the Tutsi had been eliminated as an ethnic group? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
If Your Honour will allow me a moment, I'm going to do a little skipping. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You will recall, Witness T, that Mr. Robinson read to you a broadcast by the minister of defence, Mr. Bizimana; I think -- I think dated the 15th of April.  And Mr. Robinson --  
A.	Yes, I do remember. 
Q.	And Mr. Robinson was suggesting that the minister was calling on the population to calm down.  Now, I'm going to remind you of one of the sentences that the minister uttered.  Listen to what I read.  He said to the population:  "Amongst other things, you the people should collaborate much more to vanquish the enemy once and for all."  How was the population to calm down if it was also being urged to collaborate to vanquish the enemy once and for all?  Is there any contradiction in what the minister was saying?  How do you approach his words? 
A.	Counsel, the speeches that were made at that time in Rwanda, many of those speeches conveyed ambivalent messages with double talk, with second meanings.  And anyone could interpret those messages according to their own state of mind.  
Q.	Thank you very much for that -- 
A.	You have just quoted. 
Q.	Thank you very much for that.  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, that extract was from D. NZ126; and as Your Honours know it was read into the record.  

We are making progress, and I have some editing that I would like to think about over lunch.  Is this a convenient moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is a convenient moment, Mr. Morley.  

We will take the luncheon break now. 
(Court recessed from 1300H to 1437H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley, you may continue. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness T, are you there? 
A.	I am on line, Counsel Morley. 
Q.	Thank you.
MR. MORLEY:
Brief word to Your Honours.  Your Honours, the exhibit referred to before the adjournment should have been D. NZ125 because I am now turning to D. NZ126.  

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You may remember, Witness T, that when Mr. Robinson was asking you questions, he read to you a section of a speech on the radio by minister of defence, Bizimana, in which Mr. Robinson was suggesting that minister of defence, Bizimana, was saying that the army could not cope; do you remember that document? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I think I remember that document, yes. 
Q.	One of the things that was said by the minister of defence was as follows.  Listen to what I read: "We call on the RPF to stop, and this will allow us also on our part to pacify and restore calm in the country.  But if the RPF persist in combat, it will be very difficult for the government to restore calm."  Do you understand what I have read? 
A.	No, Counsel, I don't think I remember. 
Q.	Did you understand what I read? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, my question is this:  Where minister of defence, Bizimana, is saying if the RPF does not stop, the government may not restore calm, is that, to your mind, the minister saying that the army cannot cope or is that the minister saying the state of events in Rwanda will continue unless the RPF stops?  Which is it, do you think? 
A.	In all honesty, given that I was there, both meanings can be understood from that speech. 
Q.	Were you in the army? 
A.	No, Counsel, I'm a civilian.  I have never done any military service. 
Q.	Were you party to any discussions by the army on the strengths and movements of the Rwandan armed forces? 
A.	Sorry, Counsel, I didn't catch the beginning of your question.  Could you repeat, please?  
Q.	Were you ever a part of discussions by the army of the strengths and movements of the Rwandan armed forces? 
A.	No, Counsel, I don't know in what capacity I could have taken part in discussions on that score. 
Q.	Were you part of the gendarmerie? 
A.	Nor was I involved, implicated, associated with them in any way. 
Q.	Were you part of any discussions by the gendarmerie on their strengths and capabilities? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	During the events after the death of the president in 1994, were you ever party to discussions with the army or the police about how the army or the police would deal with the massacres?
A.	No, Counsel, except that at one meeting which was disturbed at the time of civil self-defence, we    were -- they explained to us that in view of these armies' difficulties in facing up to -- difficulties in meeting the situation, that the government had been obliged to establish this system of civil self-defence.  Otherwise, no, I was not associated to any discussions on that score. 
Q.	Thank you.  That is helpful.  That discussion, you have told us before, was on the 15th or 16th of May of 1994 with Colonel Gasake; is that right? 
A.	Colonel Gasake was charged by the government to -- was put in charge by the government of the self-defence in Kigali urban and rural, I think. 
Q.	That meeting was, you have told us, between the 15th and 16th of May of 1994; is that right?
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  As I recall it was about the 16th of May. 
Q.	Between the 6th of April of 1994, and the 16th of May of 1994, had you observed soldiers at the roadblocks in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, that is quite certain, Counsel. 
Q.	Had they been killing people who were Tutsi? 
A.	Counsel, I don't know. 
Q.	Had they been working with the Interahamwe at the roadblocks in Kigali? 
A.	Some roadblocks; I would specify that some roadblocks were held -- manned exclusively by soldiers whereby other roadblocks were manned either exclusively by what we have agreed to call Interahamwe, or both soldiers and Interahamwe.  What I could say is that some roadblocks were mixed, if I could put it like that.  You would find soldiers or gendarmes and Interahamwe where others were held exclusively by Interahamwe, others manned exclusively by soldiers.  But there were some which were manned by soldiers or gendarmes and civilians. 
Q.	A document was shown to you dated the 30th of March 1994, said to come from General Dallaire about the abilities of the gendarmerie.  Do you remember the conclusion of the document that was read to you? 
A.	Yes, in general, I think I remember the tenor of what was read. 
Q.	Are you aware that the document at paragraph 11C says:  "The gendarmerie, especially at the high levels, is thoroughly politicised"? 
A.	No, Counsel, I don't think I had that paragraph. 
Q.	Are you aware that the document at paragraph 11K reads:  "When that gendarmerie does react to a situation in force, it is respected.  They appear rugged and are armed with assault rifles.  When they appear, the situation usually pacifies."  Are you aware --  
A.	Is there any more, Counsel?  
Q.	No.  The question was, are you aware that that document said what I have read to you? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I am going to ask to strike the last two questions.  I thought that this was actually leading somewhere, but I can see that it wasn't.  Obviously, the witness wasn't aware because he was never shown the document.  It was -- the portion that was read to him was read from here in Arusha, the one paragraph.  And it is obvious that this exercise that Mr. Morley just engaged in was completely wasting our time because he just wanted to highlight some other paragraphs that were in that document.  And, obviously, the witness was not aware of it, so it wasn't questions asked in good faith.  

And that is something that should be done in closing submission, but simply to ask a witness whether he was aware of something for the rhetorical purpose of letting Mr. Morley to announce things that he wants the Trial Chamber to think about in the end when it gives its judgment, is not proper re-direct examination. 
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honours' assistance, the document is D. NZ127.  My learned friend, Mr. Robinson, drew the witness's attention to the concluding paragraph of the document in order to lay foundation for the suggestion, leading the witness through cross-examination that the gendarmerie was incapable of dealing with what was taking place in Kigali.  On the face of it, therefore, having articulated the conclusion and not the contents of the document it would be, Your Honours may feel, inappropriate for the evidence to rest on simply that section of the document, bearing in mind that that section of the document is what was the foundation for the witness being invited to say the gendarmerie could not cope. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, that is a perfectly good argument to make at the end of the case, but inappropriate to put to the witness unless there is substance behind the questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But Mr. Robinson, the witness's answer has put an end to that line of questioning. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is correct.  I'm asking that it be stricken because I was going to -- if I had known that that was the only question to be put to that witness about this -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
I would have objected at --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but --
MR. ROBINSON:
-- at the time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the answer might have been yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
But -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
In which case the other question that you anticipated would have been asked.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, we know that the witness hasn't seen the document before because he -
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but this discussion is taking time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is unnecessary to strike it, because I don't think the answer is no. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, exactly.   Thank you.

Now where was I?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	On Tuesday, the 30th of May, you said to Mr. Robinson in respect of Nzirorera, Karemera, Ngirumpatse and the invitation to conduct a pacification tour, I quote you:  "We have been betrayed by those in whom we had placed our trust."  Why did you feel that? 
A.	Well, in fact, we felt betrayed by those who had given us that mission, and those whom we trusted because on our return we noticed that no one except Mr. Nzirorera, whom we found there -- we learnt that they had left without alerting us, informing us.  And, in fact, that the message that we had borne might be interpreted as a personal initiative and exposed us to the risk of being killed.  And that is the sense in which we felt betrayed. 
Q.	Did you feel that Ngirumpatse, Karemera, and Nzirorera had confidence in the pacification tour, or did you feel they felt differently about it; and if so, what?
A.	Well, the same feeling is part of what I just explained.  Someone entrusts you with a highly important and very dangerous mission.  You line up with them because you feel that their reasoning is well-founded, and you contribute to the success of the mission.  And then on your return, you find the person is not there, and you begin to doubt what you were asked to do.  So, once again, that was the sort of feeling we experienced which led us to observe, noting the contradictions at that time in that context, that was our feeling.  The people had confided and trusted a mission to us which they apparently did not believe in themselves.  And that is how I would describe our feelings when we observed their absence, noted that they had gone in face of the dangers awaiting us. 
(Pages 12 to 29 by Donna M. Lewis)




1500H 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You've described Ngirumpatse as a man of consensus, that he was a man who would lead from the centre rather than the front.  If the consensus was to massacre the Tutsi, from your knowledge of Ngirumpatse, would he have stood up and said no, that's not allowed, and tried to stop it, or would he have gone with the consensus?  
A.	I would reply, Counsel, inasmuch as I'm not in other people's minds or hearts, but in -- Mr. Ngirumpatse sent us on this mission to get the killing stopped.  So did I err in describing the man whom I know?  That's not up to me to say.  I judge or assess, appreciate, in light of what I saw, what I know.  And so as we were called upon to get the killing to stop, I can but describe the man's morality as I have done.  
Q.	Was it a genuine attempt to get the killings to stop or could and should more have been done? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I've heard Your Honour speaking to your brother Judge.  I have actually asked that before.  If Your Honour wants me to move on, I will.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, there's no need to answer that.  You have actually answered that earlier yesterday afternoon, and we remember your answer.  Thank you.  

When you were questioned by Mr. Weyl about why there were no statutes for the Interahamwe za MRND, you said this:  "Since Mathieu Ngirumpatse was reproaching other opposition party leaders just as he rebuked youth wing members, legally speaking, we felt he wanted to avoid similar rebukes because of excesses by certain Interahamwe."  Do you understand what I have read?  
A.	Yes, I understand, Counsel.  
Q.	Was it, to your mind, to avoid similar rebukes that led to there being no statutes for the Interahamwe, or is that not the case? 
A.	I think I remember that before the end of the morning session, the question -- this same question was put to me.  So ourselves were wondering, in an attempt to explain this line, just as I said this morning, a possible answer could be the expectation of the proper advent of elections that were expected, so that once and for all this legal status could be addressed.  This is all I can say, Counsel.  
Q.	You told us there was a time when there were Tutsi in the Interahamwe.  By July of 1994, what had happened to the Tutsi in the Interahamwe? 
A.	In July 1994 -- did you say 1994 or 1993?  I beg your pardon, Counsel.  
Q.	By July -- not in July, by July 1994, what had happened to the Tutsi who had been members of the Interahamwe before April of 1994? 
A.	I don't know anything in particular about that. 
Q.	That will do.  Thank you.  You have told us that others would join the Interahamwe za MRND at the roadblocks and that everyone at the roadblocks became known as Interahamwe.  My question is:  At the roadblocks where there were Interahamwe za MRND, were they the people primarily in control of those roadblocks or not?  
A.	Predominantly, yes.  I am making reference to Kigali city. 
Q.	Let us turn to events outside Kigali.  When you left Kigali on around the 17th of April of 1994 and you passed through Gitarama, were there roadblocks in Gitarama?  Were there bodies on the streets there?  Had the massacres spread beyond Kigali yet?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going to object to these questions as beyond the scope of cross-examination.  
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully submit not, because we have the witness describing the three defendants being in Gitarama on -- between the 18th and the 20th of April, and the spread of the killings seems to have followed the government and these three defendants.  It's a matter for Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I don't remember whether this matter was raised in cross-examination. 
MR. MORLEY:
Oh, no, it wasn't. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, then how do you come to it?  
MR. MORLEY:
No, the specific fact of the spreading of the genocide was not, and I well understand why the Defence avoided it, but the Defence did raise the presence of Ngirumpatse, Karemera and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the rule basically is that you can't conduct a new examination-in-chief at this time. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm not conducting a new examination-in-chief.  I'm establishing that when the defendants were found by this witness, as has been raised under cross-examination, in Gitarama on -- between the dates of the 18th and the 20th, and perhaps a few days later than that, of April in 1994, that the killings began to spread.  It's a one-question, one-sentence answer.  I understand why the Defence are wary of it, but they raised the presence of those three with the government in Gitarama at that time, and we all know what happened on the 19th of April in Butare, the speech of President Sindukuwabo and the spread of the killings to Butare.  And Your Honours will hear evidence later of the spread of the killings to Gitarama.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but if this is not what this witness was called to say, why get it from him in re-examination for the first time?  
MR. MORLEY:
Because it sets the context of what was raised in cross-examination of the presence of the defendants with the government in Gitarama at that time.  If Your Honours think there's no weight in it, I'll move on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, Mr. Morley, it's not a question of weight at this stage, it's a question -- a response to the fact that you were unable to reassure us that this matter really was raised in cross-examination -- 
MR. MORLEY:
No -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and that's the basis for our ruling; you should move on. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm very happy to move on, but I just want to make it clear that I was not saying that this is not a matter which properly arises out of cross-examination.  The specific fact of killings following the government was not raised in cross-examination.  What was raised is the presence of these three defendants in Murambi, Gitarama, at the relevant time when Your Honours know there's other evidence to show that the killings spread at that time.  So I respectfully submit it's a legitimate line of questioning, but if Your Honours prefer me not to deal with it, I'll move on.  I'm very happy to do so. 

I see Mr. Weyl on his feet.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  You very frankly pointed out that we are now in the area of new examination-in-chief and if the question had been put in examination-in-chief, we would have objected by asking our friend in the Prosecution to tell us how his question was relevant and to refer us to excerpts or portions of the indictment and preliminary brief, since we know -- so that we would know for which part of the charges our clients are being accused in this respect.  
MR. MORLEY:
If it assists Mr. Weyl, Your Honours have already ruled, and I'm moving on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When you were asking -- I'm sorry, answering questions from Mr. Weyl, there was a section concerning the distribution of guns to the Interahamwe in late 1993.  And you told Mr. Weyl that you had never seen Mr. Ngirumpatse with any of those guns and that you had not been part of the obtaining of those guns.  Why is it that you had said previously you believed Mr. Ngirumpatse to be involved in the obtaining of those guns in 1993?  
A.	I do not understand the question, Counsel. 
Q.	To your mind, was Mathieu Ngirumpatse involved in obtaining the guns which Turatsinze distributed in late 1993 and, if so, why do you say that?  
A.	I have said this, and I repeat what I said.  Perhaps it will be understood why I said it.  When I talked about the distribution of weapons by Turatsinze, my contacts with Turatsinze on the subject of concerns and problems that ensued following the non-distribution of a part of the weapons for which he was suspected, at a meeting where there was mention of potential searches, Mr. Ngirumpatse had warned that careless persons who were caught, given that the searches could be extended to residential areas, well, there he said that such careless people should no longer count on any assistance or support by or from the MRND party.  And that is how I arrived at my statement.  
Q.	You told us previously that you believe the number of weapons to be either 596 or 696 firearms, with ammunition, and that you understood those weapons to come from the ministry of defence.  Was Mr. Turatsinze able to, on his own authority, obtain such a quantity of weapons, or would he need somebody more senior to communicate with the ministry of defence?  And if so, who would that be?  
A.	Speaking of responsibility or management and the role that fell to Turatsinze within the Interahamwe, as well as his relationship, working relationship, with the leadership of the party, clearly for me this is the deduction.  I do not see how Turatsinze, on his own, could have had contacts with the highest levels of the army, not to mention the ministry of defence.  There you have it, Counsel. 
Q.	That's helpful.  Thank you.  You were asked a question by Mr. Weyl, and I want you to listen to what was asked and what was answered on Thursday, the 1st of June:  "Do you sincerely believe that the Abatazi government had any state authority, any real state authority at all?"  And your response was:  "Counsel, I can only go on the basis of my observations.  The government had been officially put in place.  The population was invited to respect that government.  And from that point of view, it did enjoy - or, was vested with authority."  

Did the government have authority during the course of the events after the death of the president?  
A.	I repeat that the government was properly vested.  If this had been under normal circumstances, today we would not be talking about the war situation, so in support of the answer I gave, I meant to say that the context of exercising that power for it to be difficult and complex is one thing, but it is another to say that the government was not properly vested with power.  I did respond to the spirit of the question and that is what you should read in the answer I gave.  
Q.	Just so there's no misunderstanding, were you a member of the government?  
A.	No, Counsel, I never was. 
Q.	Were you a part of discussions by ministers about what to do in Rwanda after the death of the president?  
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you know whether the government could have exercised any authority or not?  
A.	The government must exercise its prerogatives.  At least, that is my opinion.  It is not a matter of whether I know this or not, but a government that has been sworn in, has been sworn in and is vested with a power. 
Q.	Mr. Weyl kept pressing you on this point, and at one point on the 1st of June he suggested that the situation in Rwanda meant that the corporal did not listen to the general, and you replied -- and listen to what I read -- "I think that is somewhat exaggerated.  Perhaps they're trying to intimate that there was more disobedience than before.  Counsel, from what I understood of it, authority nonetheless did exist, but perhaps the authorities should have chosen a line of action more courageous than just resigning themselves."  What did you mean by what you were saying there, please?  
A.	I still do not see any ambiguity.  I wanted to point out the responsibilities of the government, that's all. 
MR. MORLEY:
Will Your Honours allow me just a moment to confer with my learned friend?  

The last question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness T, you told us that you had met General Dallaire.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And you have, of course, told us a lot about the Interahamwe.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I hope I have spoken about them sufficiently.  At any rate, to the best of my knowledge, I have spoken about the Interahamwe.  
Q.	And you also told us, when being asked questions by Mr. Robinson, that you had read General Dallaire's book which is entitled Shake Hands With the Devil.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I did not quite understand.  The sound, I should say was not too good, but I think you made reference to his work Shake Hands with the Devil.  If that is the case, yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	And was it your understanding, which you articulated to Mr. Robinson, that when General Dallaire referred to shaking hands with the devil, from your reading of his book, he was referring to shaking hands with number 9?  
A.	I must speak at -- in some detail about this.  
Q.	No, thank you.  
A.	Because for those who have read -- but I have not given my answer, Counsel. 
Q.	No, you haven't.  I just want you to answer the question directly.  Did you understand, yes or no, that from reading General Dallaire's book, whatever you think about it, that when he referred to shaking hands with the devil, he was referring to shaking hands with number 9; yes or no? 
A.	Counsel, with all due respect to you, however, when referring to the understanding of the title of a book, I cannot give a yes or no answer to give sense or meaning to the answer.  So very briefly, number 9, number 1 -- excluding number 1, the title expressly, and with cold calculation, maintains ambiguity on number 9 and number 6.  I have given my answer.  
Q.	That will do.  Thank you.  

MR. MORLEY:
I have no further questions.  Do Your Honours have any questions of this witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't have any questions of the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I thank Your Honours for Your Honours' patience in allowing me a little extra time.  Your Honours see that I was true to my word, it is half past 3:00.  And I should like to thank the witness for his many hours of testimony.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we thank you for testifying at the Tribunal.  Your evidence has now come to an end.  We now excuse you from attendance.  Before the video link is closed, I would like to thank the authorities in the location where you are for their assistance in providing and managing the video link which has facilitated our trial considerably, and I'd also like to thank the representatives of our Court who have been at the location and assisted in the facilitation of the testimony, and I include in that the counsel who have participated in this exercise.  


Well, I must say I should also thank counsel here for the way in which the testimony has been conducted and we appreciate the care that was taken in the questioning and the timeliness with which the exercise was completed.  Witness T, you are now excused and we thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Since you spoke about timeliness, I don't want to take up much time but before the video link is terminated, I would like to take advantage of the presence of the state officials to try to resolve something that has been left unresolved by your ruling of yesterday.  

First of all, on behalf of Mr. Nzirorera, I would like to thank also the state officials who have sat for many days, when obviously they have many other important things to do.  I think they have provided a great service to this Tribunal, and we're grateful for that.  

Yesterday, when you issued your oral decision, you reserved decision on whether or not there could be disclosure of the Witness HH material that was contained within the files of the state, and you indicated that you would want to receive the views of the state.  Yesterday -- when Mr. Morley and the judge who is in the room were discussing this yesterday, we were listening on the video link and I heard the judge say that, as far as the state was concerned, once the material was delivered to the Trial Chamber, it was up to the Trial Chamber to decide what could be released and what could not be released.  So I would invite you to ask the judge whether, in fact, I've accurately stated his position, and, if so, I would then ask you to grant us the release of that part of the document for which you reserved your ruling.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  That reminds me that I probably should have specifically included the juge d'instruction in my words of thanks.  It was probably improper to allow him to be included in the general expression of appreciation to the authorities.  But we do thank the juge d'instruction for participating in this programme.  As you know, without his participation, this could not have been done, and we express our great appreciation.  

Mr. Robinson, in response to your particular request, arrangements have already been made for the transfer of the request to the competent authority, and we anticipate that we will get an answer shortly.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And if I could just make one more remark, good news and bad news:  Good news being, at least as far as Mr. Nzirorera is concerned, we're not going to ask for certification to appeal your decision of yesterday.  The bad news is that we fully intend to call Witness T in our defence case, hopefully after his trial has been concluded, so that we can have a full examination of the issues which we feel have been withheld from us.  Thank you.  

I wish Witness T the best of luck in the meantime.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you all very much.  And we can now formally close the video link.  I think we will take our recess now, mid-afternoon recess.  I hope the Witness ZF will be available.  We should resume at about four o'clock.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness ZF.  

Mr. Registrar -- Madam Registrar, the witness needs assistance with his headphones.  The witness needs assistance with his headphones.  

Good afternoon, Witness ZF.  Can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Once again, I have to apologise for the long gap in your testimony, but I can assure you that you now have our undivided attention for the remainder of your evidence.  I think that the stage that we had reached was that counsel for Mr. Karemera was in the final stages of his cross-examination, and he will continue his questioning this afternoon.  I must remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  

Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
WITNESS ZF
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	You will recall we were approaching the end of my cross-examination.  I'd begun putting questions to you on the Interahamwe, and I should like to ask you; as regards the Interahamwe, is it not true that the RPF had considered anyone opposed to it as Interahamwe?  
A.	Counsel, as to the RPF's consideration of the Interahamwe, I know naught of it because I did not know, and still do not well know, of RPF.  
Q.	Witness, is it not true that with the war of October 1990 there was a division, even hatred, between the ethnic groups and, in particular, between the Hutu and the Tutsi? 
A.	If you're speaking of the war, I think the war placed particular emphasis on that hatred that had already existed, but not way back in history, not historically, but for a -- in recent times and even if people are born of the same father and same mother, there can be hatred and misunderstanding.  But the war came and fueled the flames of that hatred that already existed to some extent. 
Q.	Witness, would you agree with me that with the war, there were two opposed camps, antagonists, two antagonists?  
A.	In a way I could say no.  In a way, I could say yes.  No, as regards two camps.  But if you are using the word "armies", then I could say yes because there were two armies, a rebellion and a regular army, but still two armies who were in conflict at that time. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell me as of when the interim government was set up? 
A.	Counsel, I don't remember the date very well of the institution of the government.  I don't know if you're speaking of the -- the coalition government or the government of national salvation, because there were -- because there were many names.  Maybe you should distinguish between those two governments. 
Q.	The government of national salvation.  
A.	The government of national salvation, I don't remember the date very well, but I know that it was after the 6th of April that the government was set up -- the Abatazi government, as we call it, Abatazi.  But it's around that time. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, the interim government or, as you say, the government of national salvation, was it led by the MRND? 
A.	I wouldn't know, really, but I do know that there was a group of people called the Abatazi, the saviours, and that group of people came together to constitute a government of national salvation, but I don't know whether it was led, or not, by any political party or by the whole body of political parties, all the political parties that were already numerous. 
Q.	Do you not remember the prime minister at that time? 
A.	I remember his name. 
Q.	What was his name? 
A.	His name was Jean Kambanda. 
Q.	He was from what party? 
A.	Counsel, I did not seek to know what political party he belonged to. 
Q.	Witness, okay, I note that you were not interested.  Now, could you tell me whether the interim government could avoid war at the time -- could -- that is to say, could the government of national salvation avoid war at that time? 
A.	Avoid -- no, Counsel, because the war was already there and was being fought.  But attempt to stop it -- nor could they stop it because at that time whomsoever could ask the soldiers to stop the war would be considered an accomplice of the enemy, and -- what I know of the situation that prevailed at that time. 
Q.	Witness, thank you for having answered my questions.  I have finished.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, thank you very much.  I have finished my cross.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Witness, you still have to answer questions from the Prosecutor, who is entitled to re-examine you now. 

Mr. Webster.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Prosecutor. 
Q.	There are around three or four major themes that I'd like to address with you during the course of this afternoon.  The first concerns events that happened before 1994.  Do you recall that portion of your direct examine and your cross-examination when you were asked about events in Byahi commune? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	My recollection is that on your direct exam you told us about attacks launched by the local authorities against the family of Valens Kajeguhuaka.  Do you recall that portion of your testimony?  I think you were talking about events in 1992? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	You had even referred to those events in your witness statement of June 1998.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I'll direct the Court to page 15 of the English text of the statement of June 1998, at the very top of the page.  It's K-number K0149494.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When I read that witness statement which is already in evidence and when I think back to your testimony, it seems to me that you were talking about the family of Valens Kajeguhuaka and not about Mr. Kajeguhuaka himself.  Is that accurate, or could you clarify that point for me?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I object.  Leading. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm asking the witness to clarify what he said in his cross-examination.  I'm not leading him at this point.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Witness, could you please wait for a ruling on my objection?  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem I have is that I don't think it was correct for you to have read the portion of his witness statement to get him to explain what he said in cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I didn't read the witness statement, Your Honour.  I referred the Court to a reference to the witness statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you made a statement as to what was contained in the witness statement and asked the witness if that was accurate.  So that was the -- I think, what was the objection that was raised.  So if you can find another question to ask or to -- rephrase the question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, in your recollection of events from 1992 when you were telling us about the attacks in Byahi secteur and you mentioned the name of Valens Kajeguhuaka, were you referring to an attack on this person in particular or to his family?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, in speaking of Byahi secteur, in Rubavu, Gisenyi préfecture, I did speak of a family who were considered to be members of Valens Kajeguhuaka's family, but I, myself, have no certainty as to whether they were really his brothers or whether it was people's presumptions concerning them.  And those people who were considered to be members of Kajeguhuaka's family were attacked and not Valens Kajeguhuaka.  
Q.	Thank you.  That's the clarification I was seeking, Mr. Witness.  Because when you were challenged about that information by Mr. Robinson, he read one paragraph in isolation from a book that was written by Valens Kajeguhuaka.  Do you recall that portion of your cross-examination?  
A.	Yes, I recall. 
Q.	And that paragraph, when read in the context of the entire chapter or, in fact, the two chapters of that book, makes it quite clear that the paragraph itself was referring to an incident in June of 1990, and not an incident in 1992 that you were describing.  Now -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President.  Oh, go ahead.  Never mind.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Bearing that in mind -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did the witness read the book?  
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness didn't read the book, Your Honour, and neither did the Court, and apparently neither did -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but then what are you doing now?  Are you putting the book in evidence?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I am. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Through this witness?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Through this witness?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm putting the -- the paragraph was read into the record, Your Honour, and what I would like put in evidence is the entire chapter.  In fact, why don't I make that available to the witness and he can look at it himself?  Copies were served on the Defence earlier today.  In fact, this book comes from the Defence.  I requested Mr. Robinson to allow me to look at the book, and I made a copy of it.  I have a copy of the entire book, but I don't think it's necessary to put the entire book in evidence.  I have made copies of two chapters, which I'd like the registrar to hand up to the witness.  Copies were served on the Defence a little earlier, just around 15 minutes ago, and I have copies for the Bench.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	What I propose, Mr. Witness, is to bring your attention to three or four sentences in the materials that were placed before you.  Before I do that, can you tell me if you knew Valens Kajeguhuaka personally?  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you know when he actually left Rwanda?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I don't remember very well the date, but I know that when he left, he left along with Bizimungu, and I remember the events in Gisenyi because they passed through Gisenyi, but I no longer recall at which moment, at which time. 
Q.	When you say "Bizimungu", can you tell us who you mean by that, please?  
A.	The ex-president of the present regime. 
Q.	So, in other words, you're referring to Pasteur Bizimungu? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	When they left the country, do you recall if that was before or after the attack of October 1990?  
A.	Yes, I do think so, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, perhaps I did not frame the question well enough.  Are you saying that they left before 1990 or after 1990 - or, after October of 1990? 
A.	They left after October 1990. 
Q.	Okay.  If we look at the chapter in Mr. Kajeguhuaka's book, what he tells us is that he left the country in August of 1990, which would be before October.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object.  I didn't even hear a question, but I think it's leading and improper, if there is a question associated with that statement. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm asking the witness to respond to that statement.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, that's not the way to conduct a direct examination, to make a statement, ask a witness to respond.  It's leading.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I can put this chapter in evidence and then read it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, Mr. Robinson is correct.  If you're putting the book in evidence, the book will speak for its contents.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  May I have this marked for identification?  Excuse me, may I have this entered into evidence, please?  This is the book by Valens Kajeguhuaka.  It's chapter 9 and chapter 10.  It's identified by K-numbers K0368193 through K0368206.  Within this series of K-numbers are the two pages that Mr. Robinson had marked for identification during his cross-examination.  What I am suggesting to the Court was that that one -- those two paragraphs that were read into the record, which is part of the evidence, were completely taken out of context, and I would like the Court to have the context in which to situate that paragraph.  And then I will continue to ask the witness questions about it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, we object to the admission of these materials.  We note that they were not admitted during the Defence use of the materials.  They were marked as Exhibit IDN. Z14, and we have no objection if Mr. Webster wants to mark this as IP. 1 or IP. 2, but -- and he can put questions to the witness about the book, what's in the book, and try to elicit some evidence from that.  But since the witness is unfamiliar with the book, there's no foundation for its contents being admitted, either for the Defence or for the Prosecution.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we have to admit it for identification only at this stage.  What's your identification number?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't know where we are.  If the registry could help me out with that, please.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the video of Petit Kigali was IP. 1 and then it was turned into P. 28 when it was admitted with Witness T.  So that's the only IP-number that's been used so far.  So this would be IP. 2, if my records are correct, which I think they are. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you just confirm that and we can mark it IP. 2?  
MS. NTILATWA:
It is true, Your Honour, it is IP. 2. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
(Exhibit No. IP. 2, marked for identification) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if we could direct our attention to page 256 in the pages that you were given.  If you could read the bottom of that page to yourself and the beginning of the next page.  

Have you found the place, Mr. Witness?  
A.	The number is not visible for me.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could have the registry assist us, please.  Can you show the witness this page?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	If you could just take a moment, Mr. Witness, to read the bottom left-hand corner of the page and the top right-hand corner, and let us know when you've read it.  
A.	All right, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Based on what you've read, which is essentially a portion of the text that Mr. Robinson referred to during his cross-examination, would it appear to you that Mr. Kajeguhuaka is actually seriously talking about training infiltrators and harbouring infiltrators in his home?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  How could this witness know whether the man is serious or joking, or whatever?  I think that question is vague and improper. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I can direct the witness to a sentence on page 257, which I'll read.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is your witness.  He doesn't know the book.  If the book goes into evidence, the contents will speak for themselves.  I presume that at some stage either you or the Defence will find a way of getting it admitted.  But his testimony about it doesn't carry much weight. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  I'll ask one or two questions and move on, Your Honour.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The last sentence on page 256 reads, and I'm reading in French:  "The final phase was the demonstration of our arsenal which led to the greatest panic -- or, sparked the greatest panic ever seen in the history of the national guard.  Captain Bizimana and Major Bahufite came to observe from a place that overlooked the two adjoining houses at the back of my house." 

Then we go down a paragraph.  Mr. Kajeguhuaka goes on to describe a weapon made of wood which was made to look like a missile.  In the preceding paragraph, he describes groups of people marching and making efforts to make a lot of noise to attract attention.  

Mr. Witness, based on your understanding of events in Gisenyi in 1990, is this the type of activity that one would engage in, in order to secrete infiltrators in one's home?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, in -- with regard to the paragraph you have just read, which recounts a situation at a given point in time when I was in Gisenyi, the author of which mentions an event or describes an event that was very obvious to all, I think that it is not true and that if he could do it, personally, my view is he may have been doing this secretly, but for an event of such magnitude, I do not think it could have been possible at that point in time.  And, personally, I never heard of this event, nor of these operations or manoeuvers in Rubavu commune where Kajeguhuaka lived, nor anywhere else in Gisenyi préfecture. 
Q.	Well, with regard to this whole notion of infiltration, Mr. Witness, based on your experience and the breadth of your observations in the early '90s, do you have a basis -- would you agree or -- what comment would you have to offer about the use of the term "infiltration" in regard to the local Tutsi population?  When you heard the soldiers make reference to infiltrators, did you think that they were responding to a reality where there were actually RPF soldiers being brought into the country, based on your observation?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, the word "infiltration" was mostly used by soldiers to refer to the war zone, the front, where even our soldiers did it, they infiltrated, that is, they infiltrated the area held by the enemy.  They entered the enemy's zone to carry out military espionage, and the RPF did it as well.  This is in the context of military strategy.  But the other uses of the word "infiltration" include communication, radio communication between military operators to monitor the enemy's transmissions, and there it is similar to the first definition I have given; that is, that they would want to gain access to the opponent's positions.  But in Gisenyi préfecture, to be specific, Rubavu commune, there was always, especially from 1991 or 1992, an assumption that there was infiltration because Gisenyi is a border town at the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, the city of Goma, where there was a concentration of Rwandans, Hutu or Tutsi, who had remained on the other side of the border when the colonisers demarcated the border.  And each of these ethnic groups could be rooting for their particular -- for their counterparts on the other side of the border.  And so there was this concern right up until the end of the war in 1994.  

As a matter of fact, there never was infiltration from the town of Goma because we were very well organised in Gisenyi so that there was no way for would-be infiltrators to gain access to Gisenyi.  On the contrary, our elements, soldiers, could pass from our side of the border to get to Goma.  They were not stronger than us in that respect.  

It is only in 1992, or thereabouts, that there was a suspicion that a group of Tutsis in one of the secteurs of Rubavu commune, Byahi secteur, it was said that those people -- because those from the border area carry out trade with their neighbours in the neighbouring country.  So, when they went to sell their goods and would return, it was said that they were conspiring with the enemy and that they could be using this opportunity to smuggle them in.  And that is why in the Byahi area there was always a lot of violence.  There was always -- there were always atrocities being committed against Tutsis in Byahi area.  

But with respect to the infiltrators from either side who were trained in Rubavu commune, I do not think that is possible, because, had it been possible, then the town would have been taken in a very short time and then our forces would have lost a very important pool of forces for the country.  So, I am certain that it is not true and that we never had infiltration or infiltrators who were trained or recruited in Gisenyi right up to the end of 1994.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, you were confronted by Mr. Robinson during his cross-examination with portions of a report, a final report by an international commission of investigation of human rights violations in Rwanda.  He referred you to one or two paragraphs which were isolated elements from that report and suggested to you that because the killings that you described did not appear in that report, or in the paragraphs that he read, that somehow your account was inaccurate or was not to be believed.  I have taken the time to look at the entire report, and I'd like to read portions of it to you and then have you respond to it.  

If we direct our attention to page 3 of the report, at the third paragraph, it tells us that the commission investigated three major massacres:  One in Kibilira in October of 1990, the killings of the Bagogwe, and the events in Bugesera in March of 1992.  Now, those weren't the incidents that you were talking about, were they?  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	The report does, however, address several of the incidents that you mentioned.  One, in particular, concerns Léon Mugesera, and I'm going to read that paragraph.  If you give me one second, please.  

If we direct our attention to page 15 in the English text, it reads:  "The third attack at Kibilira differed significantly from the first two, in that the assailants also attacked Hutu who were members of the opposition parties, accusing them of betraying the president and the country.  This accusation had been heard before, but was expressed with unprecedented force and crudeness the month before the third attack in a speech by Léon Mugesera, a young local man and a graduate of Laval university, known to have had close ties to President Habyarimana, Mugesera is vice-president of the MRND for the préfecture of Gisenyi, and until February 8th 1993, served as a ministerial councillor in the capital.  

"Identified by witnesses as having played an important role in inciting the attacks against Tutsi in 1990, Mugesera was again in 1992 given the task of fomenting hatred in Kibilira and the neighbouring commune of Gaseke."  

Mr. Witness, having heard that paragraph from the report, would you care to comment and let us know if that's consistent with your observations, or does it differ in any respect from what you heard in Gisenyi?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  First of all, I don't think this is proper direct examination.  I could go on to say how this also does not relate to the cross-examination point that was made with respect to this document, which concerns the timing of the attacks.  But I think it's enough to state that it's not a proper question on direct exam. 
(Pages 30 to 45 by Karen Holm)

1700H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This type of question is really associated with cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, Mr. Robinson placed the report in evidence by reading it to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I agree that you can examine on different aspects of a report that was used in cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But what you have just done, you have put something to the witness and asked him to agree with it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I have asked him to comment on it, Your Honour, which is exactly what Mr. Robinson did. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He was examining -- you can demonstrate that what was put to the witness in cross-examination requires to be shown in its proper context, I think that is a proper line for -- but what you are -- it seems to me you are trying to get the witness to confirm what is in the book.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I will offer the report in evidence, Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, again, Mr. President, there being no foundation for it I would ask that it be marked IP. 3.  I think its author will probably be a witness so it could probably be admitted at the time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That is not a problem, Your Honour, the book -- the report is -- is going to come into evidence at some point.  I see no reason it can't come in now, but if Mr. Robinson has an objection we can mark it for identification and it can come in through another witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's interesting that both of you are having this problem now, because just a bit of different approach.  You see, all of this material would have been in evidence. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, that is what I am proposing.  Mr. Robinson has read a portion of the report; the whole report should be in evidence.  If it doesn't go into evidence now, it will go into evidence several months from now.  It doesn't really make any difference.  So it's the type of document that we should have agreed to put in evidence from the beginning, which is what I've suggested all along.  I'm not opposed to that.  Even the exhibits Mr. Robinson introduces during his cross-examination, I've indicated to the Court several times that if he -- if he was to consult with us we would have no objection to some of them.  I do not think there has ever been any equivocation on that point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson --  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- you've expressed a position already about consenting to documentary testimony.  But on the other hand, right, there is a basis for objection, and then there are situations where you are just objecting because you don't want to consent.  

Now, I think that both the whole case loses something, when we have technical objections which are not really based on serious grounds.  Now, this particular book that Mr. Webster is going to put in, I don't believe that you have a serious objection to it going in in due course.  Is there any reason why it can't go in now?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I'm not actually making a technical objection if, in fact, Alison Des Forges doesn't testify in this case.  This is inadmissible and it (inaudible) it is a very partisan report and it's highly disputed as to its veracity and accuracy.  So, simply because I anticipate the eventuality, I don't think it should be admitted at this point.  So it's not really a technical objection, it's a document we don't agree with its contents, and it shouldn't be admitted unless they have a sufficient foundation and we can test the author of the document.  And have a -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
So we will mark it for identification, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification, that's IP. 3.
(Exhibit No. IP. 3 marked for identification)
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	Mr. Witness, during your cross-examination, you were challenged on your account of receiving information from Bizimuremyi, based on the Defence allegations that Bizimuremyi was not present in Gisenyi in 1992 and 1993.  

I'd like to go back to that portion of your evidence and ask you to explain a bit more your observations in relation to Bizimuremyi in Gisenyi prior to 1994.  Now, you told us at one point that he lived in***** ******.  And I'd like you to be a bit more expansive and tell us was he resident in Gisenyi full-time during the entire period of 1994 or did you see him move round the county; how did it come to pass that you interacted with him in Gisenyi prior to 1994? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, Lieutenant Bizimuremyi was posted full-time in Gisenyi as of 1992, and he stayed there until the 7th of July 1994.  And not only our relations, my contact with him ceased at that time, since we went together into exile.  We went into the Democratic Republic of Congo, but he settled in Ngoma, and the others, and that includes me, went to the refugee camp.  And Bizimuremyi was not someone who went on mission -- at that time, he did not come to Gisenyi, that's between 1992 and July 1994, didn't come there on mission, he was there full-time, and he played an extremely important role along with the OPS commander who was in the beginning Lieutenant Colonel Juvenal Bahufite in the first phase, and in the second phase, subsequently, it was Colonel Nsengiyumva, Anatole and right at the end, before Gisenyi fell and they crossed over to Ngoma it was Bahufite, again, who'd come back to Gisenyi and he found Bizimuremyi there because at that time Lieutenant Colonel Nsengiyumva had joined or gone to Operation Turquoise and at the time when Gisenyi préfecture and in particular Rubavu commune fell, we all packed our bags together under the leadership, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Bahufite, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Bahufite and we left together into exile.  I think I have answered your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Thank you.  Well, regardless of whether Bizimuremyi was based in Gisenyi or not during that period, would you know if he ever left Gisenyi to go on mission to other parts of the county during the period 1992 to 1994? 
A.	I don't think so.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, Mr. Robinson has indicated that he has spoken or he has information from Côme Bizimungu and from Raphaël Bicumbi, two of the civilian authorities that you have mentioned in your own testimony, and that these persons claim not to know a Bizimuremyi.  Based on your experience, do you think those statements are accurate, and if they are not, would you have an explanation for why Côme Bizimungu or Raphaël Bicumbi would deny knowing Bizimuremyi? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President; really this question is not a proper question for direct examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I don't -- I don't see this one. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm not -- I'm actually -- he's asking the witness to speculate, as to number one, whether he knows someone or not; and which he may or may not have some way of knowing, and number two, if they really know them but they are denying it, why would they be doing that?  That is calling for speculation.  It is not within this witness's knowledge or purview why somebody might ever give an accurate testimony or inaccurate testimony or whatever.  If you look at the question on your screen, I think you'll see that it's -- or maybe you do not have that advantage. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.
MR. ROBINSON:
 Okay.  Anyway -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
But I must say it did not jar when I heard it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, the question is in two parts, Your Honour.  Mister -- I can rephrase the question if the Court -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you can take the objection that way. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, based on your experience in Gisenyi -- based on your experience in Gisenyi, and your interaction with Côme Bizimungu who you have identified as the préfet and Raphaël Bicumbi who you have identified as the sous-préfet.  Would you comment on whether those two individuals would have had an opportunity to interact with Bizimuremyi in 1992, when you were in Gisenyi? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, regarding Bizimuremyi, it wouldn't be -- it isn't a fictional character, he was someone who was well known in Gisenyi and the other people can tell you so, those who want to, because the truth will out.  But as regards the préfet, Côme Bizimungu, who left moreover in '92, already he no longer was préfet already then, and to say that he did not know Bizimuremyi, he might have his own reasons, even if in the beginning, in '92 he wasn't yet settled as such.  But, as of June and July '92, I think when he left the position I think he could have known him, and that Bizimuremyi's activities were intermediate activities really for many people, because from what I remember at that time at the camp, even the préfet would come to the camp for consultations, discussions with the OPS commander.  And very often, when something had to be told to the préfet and he couldn't go himself, he would send Bizimuremyi.  

Bizimuremyi was someone who, I don't know why, but he was very much liked by both of those commanders.  He was more flexible than the other officers, and whether it was Côme Bizimungu because the one who replaced, whose name was Shumuhiga, was not very much liked by the soldiers or even by the OPS commander.  They had a wary relationship, but as far as Côme Bizimungu was concerned the relations were more open and, indeed, contacts with Bizimuremyi also were open and I can assert that he knew him.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Now, I'd like to mention two other persons that were used to confront you during your cross-examination with respect to Bizimuremyi:  The first is another soldier by the name of Faustin Murego.  Do you know this person? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was his status in Gisenyi? 
A.	Faustin Murego was a lieutenant in the Rwandan army posted to camp -- to the OPS camp in Gisenyi.  
Q.	Was he present in the OPS camp during the period 1992 and 1993? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you recall what period of time he was present in the OPS camp? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Continue, please? 
A.	He arrived, Counsel, about at the end -- approximately; it was at the end of 1993. 
Q.	And did he remain through the beginning of 1994? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	When did he leave the area? 
A.	I don't know the date very well, Counsel, but he went for a course in Europe before the presidential plane came down. 
Q.	Right.  Well, with respect to Faustin Murego, over what period of time was he in Gisenyi as far as you can remember?  You don't have to tell us when he actually left, but for how long did he remain as far as you're aware? 
A.	It was a short stay, Mr. Prosecutor.  I can't remember exactly how long, but it was not long. 
Q.	Well, during the period that you observed him in Gisenyi, did you ever see him in Bizimuremyi's company?  Have you ever seen them together? 
A.	While he was in Gisenyi, and before he left on his course as an officer, he was with the others at the officers' mess and at that time he had relations with him and with others who were at the officers' mess but also outside -- outside the officers' mess.  I think they had relations because they were all in the same battalion and pursued the same activities. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, Mr. Robinson has indicated that Mr.  Murego is among the witnesses he may call to establish that there was no officer named Bizimuremyi in Gisenyi OPS command, would you comment on that?  Apparently, Mr. Murego, himself, claims that there was no officer named Bizimuremyi in the Gisenyi OPS command. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness can answer the question.
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you have a comment to that? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, as regards Lieutenant Murego who was an officer who lived in the officers' quarters, with his family, in fact, on the spot, and before he left, he left his family in Gisenyi there, and I don't know whether he, personally, and his family also could say that there is no one by the name of Bizimuremyi and no Bizimuremyi family, because he had a family, he had his wife and children.  Murego, also, had the same status and lived in the same quarters and they were families who knew each other very well.  

The reason that might lead him to say that he doesn't know him is unknown to me.  But, you know, Mr. Prosecutor, each one can say what he will, what he wants according to his ends and purposes.  Maybe I could tell you a Rwandan proverb that says imrabusha (phonetic) -- you can go through a forest you don't know, and cut a tree that it is traditionally forbidden to cut down, and you don't know it.  That is the Rwandan mentality.  It's hard to say everything.  That's why even in other investigations you might undertake, words and actions that are the opposite of the truth but in truth mean the same thing, that's why when they speak of Abakombozi and work and all of that, what I personally -- is considered by many to be treason and for him to say that he knew Bizimuremyi, but doesn't know where he is; whether he is in prison or maybe one day he'll be caught, it's difficult.  I think that it's a question of courage, perhaps of seeing to prioritise truth over fraternity or other considerations.  I think I have answered your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	I'm going to mention one more name to you and ask you if this person had a basis to know Bizimuremyi, based on your observations in Gisenyi in 1992 and 1993.  And his last name is also of a soldier and he is Christophe Kabera.  Based on your activities in Gisenyi, would Christophe Kabera have a basis to know that Bizimuremyi was present in the OPS camp in Gisenyi during the period 1992 and 1993? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I would like to know whether Major Kabera said that Bizimuremyi didn't exist or whether he wasn't or he hadn't gone to Gisenyi.  I would like to know what exactly is the question.  
Q.	From what I understand, Kabera states that Bizimuremyi did not exist "in our secteur" and you would have no contact with someone like Bizimuremyi because Kabera, himself, was the only person who would have contact with you.  So not only is he saying that Bizimuremyi was not in the secteur, he is saying that you would have contact with no other officer because he, Kabera, was the only officer that you were authorised to have contact with? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may continue.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. Prosecutor, as regards the first part of the question, Major Kabera knew Bizimuremyi very well, because both Lieutenant Bizimuremyi and Major Kabera, although Kabera in the meantime left, went to Byumba and then returned towards the end -- towards the end of June '94.  We all left together with Kabera and Bizimuremyi.  Myself and Lieutenant Colonel Bahufite would come back for the last phase.  He knew him very well, and as regards the second part -- the second question, you are saying that there was no other officer who could contact me apart from him.  Well, that's not true, because there was no limitation on senior officers.  You can seek your information; seek that information from the military.  It wasn't Major Kabera who could determine when I should be contacted.  And if you want, I can show you photographs where I was with the other officers and he and the other officers.  

And I think that Lieutenant Bizimuremyi although he was a lieutenant and that he, Kabera, was a major, from the point of view of their functions, it was Bizimuremyi who had more activities, because that could exist in the army; there is the rank, and then there are the duties.  Kabera was an officer and he had access, as did all the other officers, he had access to me, and to read the messages and put questions to me of a general nature.  But to say that only he could meet me is not true.  And as for having duties over me, that, also, is not true because the OPS commander was there.  And it was only he who was authorised among the people to whom I might hand over messages.  And then he would hand it over to the addressee who was the OPS commander, and who could transmit nationwide.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, how much more time do you have?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to finish this evening.  It should only take another 10 minutes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We'd better finish then. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we go into closed session for the last two lines of questioning?  It should only be around three or four questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you ready for that now?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we go into closed session, now?
