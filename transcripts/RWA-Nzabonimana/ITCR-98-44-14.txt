in respect of Juvénal Kajelijeli, the

10

Your Honours, in the ICTY in the Prosecutor

11

vs. Furundzija, before the Court at first

12

instance, and at page 183, the learned Trial

13

Chamber said this:

14
15

"The essence of the whole corpus of

16

international humanitarian law, as well as

17

human rights law, lies in the protection of

18

the human dignity of every person, whatever

19

his or her gender."

20
21

May I interpose there, or race or ethnic

22

origin.

23
24

"The general principle of human respect for

25

human dignity is the basic underpinning and,

indeed, the very raison d'être of

become of such paramount importance as to

law.

human beings from outrages upon their

8

personal dignity, whether such outrages are

carried out by unlawfully attacking the body

This principle is intended to shield

10

or by humiliating or debasing the honour,

11

the self-respect or the mental well-being of

12

a person."

13
14

That statement appeared within a reasonably

15

narrow context of that case, and I will

16

return to it within that narrow context.

17
18

However, it is a statement applicable to

19

human rights law as is developing in

20

tribunals such as this.

21

underpinning of human rights law is the

22

dignity of every person, whether that

23

dignity be a physical dignity or a mental

dignity.

is established.

It is, of course, this Trial Chamber's

responsibility to make a person accountable.

It is not the Prosecutor's responsibility.

This Trial Chamber supervises, from the

Turning then, specifically to the

indictment, the Accused is charged with

11 separate charges.

15

Count 1 -- he is charged with a conspiracy

to commit genocide.

18
19

Count 2 -- he is charged with the committing

public incitement to genocide.

Count 5 -- he is charged with crimes against

5

humanity, specifically murder.

6
7

Count 6 -- he is charged with crimes against

8

humanity, specifically extermination.

9
10

Count 7 -- he is charged with crimes against

humanity, specifically rape.

12
13

Count 8 -- he is charged with crimes against

14

humanity, specifically persecution on

15

racial, political or religious grounds.

16
17

Count 9 -- he is charged with crimes against

18

humanity, which are other inhumane acts.

19
20

Count 10 -- he is charged with serious

21

violations of Article 3 common to the Geneva

22

Conventions and Additional Protocol, and

23

specifically with murder as well as cruel

24

treatment, such as torture, humiliation,

corporeal punishment and the like.

And, Count 11 -- again, serious violations

2

of Article 3 common to the Geneva

3

Conventions and Additional Protocol II; he

4

is charged specifically that he is

5

responsible for causing outrages against

6

personal dignity, in particular humiliating

7

and degrading treatment, rape and other

8

matters.

9
10

Your Honours, the events about which we will

11

speak occurred the morning after the

12

shooting down of President Habyarimana's

13

plane.

14

blame to the shooting down of that plane.

15

It is of no consequence in this case, except

16

to say that it was the starter's flag for

17

one of the most barbaric episodes in the

18

history of modern man.

19

of the barbarism isn't known because nobody

20

could count the bodies, and nobody can give

21

an exact census of how many there were

22

before the atrocity and how many there are

23

after the atrocity.

barbarism beyond what has been known in the

25

modern world in a long time.

We, of course, not only have to prove that

2

there was genocide; specifically, we have to

3

prove that the Accused had a role in that

4

genocide and specifically those matters

5

which we have just enumerated.

6
7

To encapsulate the case -- and this is all I

8

wish to do because so much of the evidence

9

is available, and there has been a

10

revelation of most of the evidence, if not

11

all of the evidence within documents that

12

are before this Court -- so I wish only to

13

encapsulate the case.

This case is about three horrifying days in

Ruhengeri, an area in the north of the

17

country which was the stronghold of

18

President Habyarimana.

plane was shot down on the evening of the

20

6th of April 1994.

there began a series of massacres early in

later, at the Ruhengeri Court of Appeal.

Your Honours will find it ironic that two

places where modern man attempts to find

3

some reconciliation in life became the

4

venues of such a massacre.

5

where people went to pray, at Ruhengeri

6

Court of Appeal, where people went for

7

justice, both became places of massive

8

injustice and massive violation of human

rights.

following.

to kill.

On the 7th of April, the comment I have

8

already mentioned -- "Go and kill;

Second, there was

10

an explosion of violence over three days

11

which commenced within ten or so hours of

12

the shooting down of Habyarimana's plane.

13

In that time, the evidence will be that the

14

Accused was able to mobilise some

15

600 uniformed, trained, and armed men to go

16

about this killing spree over the next three

17

or four days.

18
19

In 1991 an organisation was formed by the

20

Accused, the Amahindure -- which was

member of government.

2
3

We can say further that if there is need to

4

establish the specific intent any further,

5

the fact that they went off singing,

6

"Tubatsembetsembe", "Let's exterminate

7

them", there was, in fact, a specific intent

8

to exterminate the Tutsi.

9
10

Dealing with conspiracy -- the allegation is

11

that there was a conspiracy at least between

12

Nzirorera, whom I have mentioned, and

13

Kajelijeli and others.

14

conspiracy will go along these lines:

15

First, Kajelijeli was Nzirorera's right-hand

man.

18

I've already mentioned the fact that the

armed, and they were with the Accused.

And he said in respect of that:

"Wear your

3

exterminate for me all the Tutsi remaining

4

in the commune".

5
6

We go back a little further, in 1993.

7

There'll be evidence of somebody who went to

8

a meeting and heard at the same meeting,

9

speaking, Nzirorera and the Accused.

The

10

meeting was essentially a recruiting meeting

11

for the Interahamwe.

12
13

Shortly after that meeting a number of young

14

men from the Interahamwe planted a tree in

15

front of Nzirorera's house, and after that

16

that's where the meeting was held --

17

meetings were held for the Interahamwe,

18

that's where the Interahamwe flag was flown;

19

in fact, on the tree that they had planted.

20
21

There can be no doubt that collectively both

22

Nzirorera and the Accused conspired to give

23

effect to this heinous plan to -- what was

24

it -- go to work, exterminate for me all the

25

Tutsi remaining in the commune.

made by Nzirorera and the recruitment into

Q.

All right.

So at the top of the page, on

the page numbered 73, you've recorded

sources of information and then below that

you have sources for each number on the

8

the locations the source of your

information?

Have you recorded,

A.

Yes.

Q.

And do the numbers 1 to 22 go back to the

12

numbers on the sketch page?

13

A.

Yes, that's true.

Q.

All right.

So, in summary:

You drew a

sketch; on the next page you identified

those locations on the sketch by numbers and

a description; and then on the final page

you identified specifically your sources of

Q.

Page 1 is the cover sheet, signed by you; is

It is correct.

this a sketch that you did?

That's a sketch that I did.

4

The procedure is the same.

5

The difference

maybe is that the scale here is different.

6

Q.

Okay.

7

A.

Yah, somewhat larger and less exact.

8

Q.

9

It's a somewhat larger scale?

That's correct.

Q.

All right.

But then

Can you confirm

Now, under each particular

11

item -- let us take 0001, is that a

12

description of a photograph that you have

recorded there?

A.

That's a description of Photograph No. 1.

Can I remark that I want to make three minor

16

corrections and add one word in this

document, if you can give me the opportunity

18

to do that later?

for example, on 0001 "own observation" --

source of information that you have on the

5

previous page?

Does this relate back to the

A.

Yes, it does.

7

Q.

All right.

So if we find, for example, a

name mentioned -- and let's take at the

bottom of the next page 0030, you see a

name.

Please don't repeat the name, but you

11

see a name there?

A.

Yah, I see it.

13

Q.

All right.

And is that name then appearing

14

on the second page of that document as being

15

one of your sources of information?

16

A.

Exactly.

All right.

Now, would you go to the bundle

of photographs, please.

photographs, copies of the photographs that

you took?

A.

Yes, they are.
